CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 1 Page 1 BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY SUBJECT Student Health Insurance Contract between Boise State University and Relation Insurance Services Services -Education Inc. REFERENCE April 2010 The Idaho State Board of Education ( Board) a pproved a contract with Relation Insurance Services -Education Inc. (formerly known as Ascension) for student health insurance. June 2020 The Board approved an extension of a contract with Relation Insurance Services to provide student health insurance services . APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE , OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section V.I.3.a . and III.P.14 BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION In July 2009, the Idaho State Division of Purchasing issued a R equest for Proposals (RFP) for a contract for student health insurance available to all of the higher education institutions. After the Board approved the contract in April 2010, the company that is now Relation Insurance Services -Education Inc. was awarded the contract for three years plus seven one-year renewal options. After the Board's policy change in response to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Boise State University (BSU) re-evaluated its student medical insurance needs and elected to continue to provide a voluntary stud ent health insurance plan, graduate assistant insurance, international student insurance (for students studying in the U.S.) and secondary insurance for intercollegiate athletes. BSU requires that coverage per Board Policy III.P.14.b. The Board approved a contract extension for one year with an option for an additional year, which extended the agreement through July 2022. BSU is preparing a formal RFP for these services scheduled to post Summer 2022. Following the RFP process , the prevailing vendor's cont ract will be submitted to the Board in late 2022. The anticipated new contract's term would then commence July 31, 2023. BSU has been in consultation with the University of Idaho, Lewis -Clark State College, and Idaho State University regarding a future jo int purchasing effort for student health insurance . CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 1 Page 2 IMPACT The program in place has been working well since 2009. Extending the existing program through July 31, 2023 provides continuity and care to students , while BSU pursues a formal bidding process for services that will continue to meet student needs. The estimated annual expenses are provided below. BSU does not anticipate the total to exceed $2.5 million. Graduate assistant insurance $1,835,050 International student insurance $378,000 Self-funded insurance for athletics $50,000 Estimated total $2,263,050 ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Contract Extension Attachment 2 - Letter of Acceptance for International Student Insurance Attachment 3 - Letter of Acceptance for Graduate Assistan t Insurance STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS This action allows Boise State University to continue with its current student health insur ance contract while examining other potential options through the Request for Proposals process. The other four -year institutions are not at a point of change in their student health insurance contracts, but the institutions will work together to determine if it is in their best interest to work on future student health insurance contract procurement processes together. Staff recommends approval.

The hallmarks of our company are providing excelle nt management responsiveness and professionalism, great event security , guest services and parking personnel , flexibility and standard customization, a performance -based business model and being an international company with a boutique business philosophy. We believe the BEST approach is different from most of the traditional crowd management and event security companies that will be presenting proposals to your organization. The backbone of our company is providing a quality staffing solution for our clients. Focusing our efforts on recruiting, hiring, and training employees that are good fits for the positions contracted with BEST is top priority. Taking that employee base i n operating your venue is the mission of our industry leading operations team led by Jason Huntsman, our Regional Director. Mr. Huntsman has over 10 years of experience in the crowd management and event security management. He would be leading our transiti on of your account if we are fortunate enough to be awarded your work. BEST is focused on providing an industry leading local management team for Boise State. Upon award of your contract, we would open a local office that would be dedicated specifically to our operations at the university. Our team of full -time staff assigned to your account will include an Account Manager and an Assistant Account Manager who would report directly to Mr. Huntsman to ensure we have the resources necessary to meet the requi rements in your RFP.

ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 9Section 1: Company History Background of BEST Whelan Security was founded in 1949 by Jim Whelan in St. Louis, Missouri under humble circumstances. Jim had returned from serving overseas during World War II in the mid -1940s. After several years driving taxis, he and his brother Dave got the entre preneurial idea to leverage the vehicles for a different purpose. They applied for a private patrolman license to inspect and secure businesses along the St. Louis riverfront in the evening and overnight hours. The brothers each patrolled their areas of th e city by night, after which Jim would arrive back home around 7 a.m., sleep for three or four hours and then head back downtown in his business suit to visit with his customers and seek new clientele. In 1956, the Whelan brothers won their first \"on -site\" guarding contract with the St. Louis Public Housing Authority and formed Whelan Security and Plant Protection Incorporated. The business was managed out of Jim's house, with his sister -in-law Margaret Twardowski assisting with payroll and billing. Short ly afterwards, Dave exited the business leaving Jim to run the company. Jim died suddenly of a heart attack in 1969, having grown the business to 75 security officers and $500,000 in annual sales. Margaret's son Patrick, who worked in human resources for McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing), was approached by Jim's widow Geraldine to see if he would be interested in running the company. Patrick took a leap of faith and accepted her offer, and the company hasn't looked back since. Over the next three decades, Patrick built a highly respected security firm in the St. Louis area. Eventually, Patrick's sons Greg and Dan joined the organization, and helped transform the company into a nationally recognized brand and one of the largest privately held security firms in the United States. In 2009 the organization made a significant investment to expand into the crown management and event security space. At the time they hired Jeff Spoerndle who brought decades of experience in the industry to the company. The objective of the expansion was to bring a quality provider to the space and to grow our market share in a slow and steady fashion. In the early years of our event business, we focused on developing service programs that would address the weakness of our competitors in the market space. As we grew our company turned into the preferred choice for many of the nation's most high -profile clients, venues and national events ending last year with $40M in annual sales. In April of 2019, Whelan proudly joined Canadian -based GardaWorld, the largest privately -owned security services company in the world. GardaWorld also began from humble beginnings when CEO Stephan Cretier started a security company off an investment of $25 ,000 from a second mortgage, and today has grown to become one of the five largest security companies globally. This is a perfect fit for both organizations, as GardaWorld already possessed a major presence in the United States in the cash services busines s, but was seeking a high -touch, values -driven provider to lead their US expansion in both the traditional security services and event staffing spaces. Whelan fills that void, and with the integration of another strong US security services provider, United America Security, we now offer a domestic platform of 45,000 security professionals operating out of 60 branch offices across all 48 continental states. The entire leadership of team of Whelan remains in place with the autonomy to manage the business the Whelan way - one employee and one client at a time - but with the backing of a $2 .75B North American platform of 63,000 security professionals and a $2.75B global platform operating on five continents. ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 10Hallmarks of BEST Over the years, event staffing and security companies have been challenged to do two things - differentiate themselves from one another and establish world -class service levels. At BEST , we believe there are five hallmarks of our company that differentiate us from our competitors and create an opportunity for us to provide unique, world -class service. These hallmarks are derived from third party surveys of our clients and represent the c haracteristics that our client promoters indicated they most appreciate about BEST . The relevance and importance of these five hallmarks have also been validated by the IOMA Security Guard Firm Ratings and Benchmarks Report and BEST Core Values. Hallmark #1 - Management Responsiveness and Professionalism The IOMA Benchmark Report rates responsiveness as the single most important issue in its Client Criticality Rating. Responsiveness and professionalism of our staff are also rated as the top two attribute s our clients most appreciate about BEST according to our client surveys. We believe responsive service with a real sense of urgency can only be delivered through great leaders, which is why \"leadership\" is one of our 10 core values on the Mission and Valu es Card carried by all our employees. Averaging approximately 20 years of industry experience, our team of security management professionals creates great relationships with our clients and employees and responds proactively to their individual needs. Hallmark #2 - Event Security, Guest Services and Parking Personnel In an industry that often ignores front -line employees, BEST views our employees as our most important asset and sustainable competitive advantage. \"Respect,\" \"loyalty,\" and \"empowerment\" a re 3 of our 10 core values because we proudly acknowledge that our product is people. We support and equip our people through a management culture of servant leadership and faith in the inverted organizational chart, through which front -line employees are at the top of the chart, and all supervisors, managers and executives support UP to the most important person - the event staff and security officer. We believe that true success and world -class customer service is achieved and delivered through highly eng aged employees who represent BEST and our clients more professionally than event staff and security personnel in other companies. Research shows that engaged employees are 27% less likely to miss work, 51% less likely to turnover, 62% less likely to have a workplace accident and significantly more likely to deliver great customer service. At BEST , our employee -centric culture makes the big difference, but we also recognize that our core service delivery programs of employee selection and development are k ey components to creating engaged employees. Our Screening Process is among the most rigorous and stringent in the industry. It is not easy to get a job with BEST for a reason. Our Training Program is among the most robust in the industry. From employee re cognition programs to employee opinion surveys to internal advancement opportunities to our Learning Management System, all our programs are designed to create engaged employees. In support of this hallmark, industry -wide buyers in the IOMA Benchmark Repor t rated employee background checks and stability of personnel as the 2nd and 3rd most critical issues, while the surveys of our clients indicated that professionalism and quality of personnel is the 2nd most critical area to them. Hallmark #3 - Flexibili ty and \"Standardized Customization\" At BEST , we will always advise of the benefits of standardization in order to drive efficiency and consistency, but as a privately held company who answers only to our clients and our employees as ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 11opposed to stockholder s, money managers or parent companies, we have the ability to provide highly customized services that are unique among larger security firms. This has allowed us to coin the seemingly paradoxical phrase of \"standardized customization,\" which simply means t hat we will suggest standardized service programs in areas that we believe are beneficial and cost -effective to our clients while at the same time offering specific solutions to meet unique needs on a client -by-client basis. The IOMA Benchmark Report rates the attributes of flexibility and customization as the 5th and 7th most important issues to buyers of contract event staffing and security services. BEST clients ranked our agility, flexibility, and willingness to customize our program to fit their consta ntly changing needs as the 3rd characteristic they most appreciate about BEST in the surveys. The largest national and global firms simply can't do this because of their bureaucracy. BEST clients never have to settle for a cookie -cutter, one -size- fits-all program. In fact, our core service deliverables often become differentiators because of the way we can customize recruiting, training, and technology programs. This is the reason \"flexibility\" is one of our 10 core values. Hallmark #4 - Performance -Based Business Model Two of the company values on our Mission and Values Card are \"quality assurance\" and \"results.\" According to the IOMA Benchmarks Report, the attributes of performance, quality assurance and continuous improvement all rank within the 10 mos t critical issues to buyers of our services (4th and 9th). Security firms were rated lowest in the same report in their ability to \"develop meaningful and concrete ways to measure contract performance,\" so this is an area that is not only important to clie nts but also needs improvement from an industry -wide perspective. We believe customers are seeking complete transparency in their partnership with their contract event staffing and security firm, and we are proud to say that BEST has always been an industr y innovator and leader in this critical area. Hallmark #5 - International Company with a Boutique Business Philosophy Strong relationship with management and on -site staff rounds out the list of top BEST attributes from our clients. Operating in all 48 continental states and with a global reach across five continents, BEST Crowd Management is one of the largest security organizations in the United States and the world, but the only one that has maintained the personal touch and feel of a privately -owned boutique firm. Each client should feel like they are unique, made possible by our Customer First Service Program . Each employee should feel like they are a part of an extended BEST family. Based on our goal to be the BEST security company to work for and the BEST people to work with, we have always grown our business one client and one employee at a time. Core Values The BEST core values express the strength of our commitment to our clients and the bravery and decisiveness of our people. Each of our employees takes great pride in being part of the BEST community and playing an active role in our company's unique, inspira tional success story. Our integrity is the moral force that drives everything we do, every day, and with everyone with whom we interact. We secure and strengthen the trust that our clients place in us to safeguard their people, assets, and business. We are vigilant in mitigating risk and enabling our clients to do business safely and securely throughout the country. We win our clients' respect with the quality of our services and the absolute commitment of our people.

BEST Locations - United States ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 26Section 4: Organizational Approach A. Hiring Detail BEST has developed a culture built around successful human capital management through the concept of \"creating engaged employees.\" In the book called 12: The Elements of Great Managing , the author teaches that pay and benefits are certainly important factors, but there are 12 other management principles that a company and leader should adopt to create engaged employees. Research has shown that engaged employees are much less likely to turnover, much less likely to be late for work or call off from work, and m uch less likely to experience a workplace accident. A Harvard Business Review Survey has uncovered that only 29% of American employees are \"engaged,\" meaning that 71% of all employees hurt their companies as opposed to helping their companies. At BEST , we teach our managers the principles of this book, which include concepts such as praise and recognition, listening and responding to employees' opinions, placing employees in a position where they can succeed and creating career growth and progression. Through this management approach, we have been very successful in recruiting, attracting, and retaining high quality personnel as evidenced by our high employee retention rates. Beginning with our recruiting efforts to attract quality employees all the way t o the final background check, our selection process goes well beyond technical requirements. Every step of the way, our human resources processes are designed to ensure we employ only the BEST qualified individuals for your security program. Recognizing that successful personnel placement goes beyond maintaining a pool of talent, BEST accurately matches the skills, attributes, and traits of the officer with the skill requirements of the post to which they are being assigned. The goal of our personnel sel ection process is \" matching the right people to the right environment .\" Below you will find the recruiting methods to complete our extensive recruiting plan: Social Media Advertising Employee and Client Referrals Military and Veterans Groups Online Postings Colleges and Technical Schools Non -Profit Organizations Churches Job Fairs Government Agencies Direct Recruitment from Service Industries such as Restaurants, Retail and Hospitality ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 27 Sample Recruitment Ads: ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 28 Once an applicant clicks on one of our job ads or job positing through websites or social media such as Indeed, Facebook, and Instagram, they are instantly engaged through the following steps: 1. Applicant is engaged in real -time with our AI assistant Ava - Our AI assistant Ava was des igned from the ground up to help companies of all sizes and complexities get hiring work done faster.

Additionally, we send applicants a \"what to bring\" document to ensure their hiring experience is seamless. After the hiring event, Ava re-engages with no -show applicants and provides them another invitation to an upcoming hiring event. Additionally, our Hiring & Recruiting Manager sends another individualized text message through Text -Em-All (web -based mass messaging system) reminding the no-show applicants to re -schedule. We utilize both Ava and Text -Em-All to ensure proper and constant communication is occurring. 3.

We track these in shared spreadsheets and have a minimum number ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 29of contact points that our team is responsible for throughout the year to ensure our relationship stays as active as possible. Employee Screening Process At BEST , we have benchmarked our employee selection process against the BEST in the security industry and identified the screening criteria that we believe BEST allows us to provide superior security personnel to our clients. Through the implem entation of BEST practices and innovative solutions, BEST has built an unrivaled employee selection and background -screening platform that has the depth and breadth to satisfy the demanding needs of our customers. BEST offers the comprehensive Employee Screening Process , which includes the following: Prior Employment One of the most falsified pieces of information is an applicant's employment history. An investigation of previous employment is conducted on all candidates considered for employ ment. Subjects investigated include absenteeism, tardiness, conduct, job performance, and reason for separation from previous employers. If an applicant has prior military experience, they are required to provide a copy of the DD214 indicating an honorab le discharge. Application, Hiring Assessment and Job Matching Assessment All candidates for employment must complete a detailed application and participate in a formal hiring assessment. The hiring assessment provides an opportunity to verify that they fit basic requirements as specified online (age, education, government eligibility, local licensing requirements, proper I -9 credentials, DD214 with honorable discharge if in U.S. military, proximity to accounts and scheduling flexibility) and include eval uations of appearance, attitude, demeanor, mental alertness, general intelligence, integrity, interpersonal communication skills, specific job -related qualifications, and job knowledge. We host hiring events each month at our BEST Training Offices in Boise , select hotels in strategic geographic al locations , as well as future potential at Boise State University (if possible) . Applicants are interviewed by our Hiring & Training Manger. The interview takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes with a combination of situational, behavioral, and open -ended questions. Examples include: Why do you want to work as a member of the Boise State Event Day Staff? Able to stand long periods of time (up to 7 hours)? Able to work in inclemen t weather (Hot, Cold, Rain etc)? Have access to reliable transportation? How would you describe Exceptional Guest Service or Give an example of a time where you received Exceptional Customer Service? Tell me the last time you dealt with an unhappy customer ? What did you say and do? Did you improve their experience and if so, how? ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 30 If hired, are you available to attend our training session this month? Yes or No We also evaluat e the applicant's appearance, body language, eye contact and communication. Lastly, we want to ensure the hiring event is exciting for potential event staff. Photos of the applicant with a Broncos #22 \"Rookie\" Jersey and a backdrop with the BEST logo are taken. New hires are encouraged to post these photos on social media accounts a nd tag BEST. Posting and tagging enrolls new hires into a raffle for the opportunity to win gifts, swag, and prizes. Criminal Background Investigation One of BEST's key differentiators in the staffing industry is our adherence to our background check program. Every employee will not only be required to pass the background check for the State of Idaho Security license, but they must also pass our in -house background check as well as monthly monitoring. Detailed below is a description of this program. Candidates with records of felony convictions or misdemeanors (or nolo contendere plea) of a job -related or moral turpitude nature for a minimum seven -year period immediately preceding application are not suitable for employment with BEST. Criminal background checks to the county level are completed on all candidates considered for employment with BEST. An industry -leading, employment screening company conducts all our criminal background investigations, and all county criminal backg round checks are investigated in person at the county courthouse by a representative of our 3rd party background check firm. After the applicant becomes an employee with BEST their criminal background is run monthly to ensure that a crime was not committed during the individual's employment with the company. If a felony conviction or misdemeanor (or nolo contendere plea) of a job -related or moral turpitude nature is found on the monthly check, the employee is terminated. OFAC Prohibited Parties Search BEST's criminal background investigation also includes an OFAC federal database search to identify \"prohibited parties.\" A prohibited party is defined as \"specially designated nationals, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, blocked persons, vessels, and partie s subject to various economic sanctioned programs who are forbidden from conducting business in the United States, as well as entities subject to license requirements because of their proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\" Government regulations may require that organizations not deal with prohibited parties, thereby making this search a necessity. One of the common uses of this check is for Patriot Act compliance. B. Employee Benefits and Recognition Program Employee Benefits It is evident that recruiting and retention of employees is key to the success of BEST profitability and continued delivery of world -class services to our clients. In order to reward our employee's commitment to provide world class service to your facility we have developed the employee benefit program listed below. ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 31 Recognition Awards The Awards are handed out by the Account Management Team for large events and seasonally to employees who showcase exceptional customer service, understanding of their po st and overall facility knowledge.

It is critical to establish as many outlets as possible for employees to provide feedback and concerns to the Account Management Team. The employee suggestion and feedback box can only be accessed by the Management Team. Anonymous Emp loyee Hotline (ReportLine) BEST has established an Employee Ethics and Compliance ReportLine. The ReportLine is available to accept reports or complaints 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The employee may choose to make a call or web - based report anonymously; however, providing their name will allow a more direct and personal investigation and response. The sole purpose of the ReportLine is to provide a direct link for the employee to report any ethics, compliance, or policy concerns to the appropriate person so that the issue can be promptly escalated and resolved. ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 2 Page 33All reports through BEST 's ReportLine are automatically logged in BEST 's web -based Case Management system which allows us to document all activities in a single, centralized database. The Case Man agement System allows BEST officials to oversee investigations, manage workflow and track trends across the organization. It also provides us with a historical of all investigations - from initial notification through final resolution. Employee Assistanc e Program (EAP) To help employees balance work, life and family, BEST offers a no -cost, confidential employee assistance program for employees and their family members. The program provides support, guidance, and resources for issues related to childcare, relationships, legal problems, finances, life transitions, addictions, depression, anxiety and other personal concerns.

It was anticipated that the project would be completed with 100% donor/sponsor funding. Due to the rapidly inflating construction market, the lowest project cost s came in higher than anticipated, exceeding the project contingency of $400,000, bringing the total project cost to $6 million which is $1.5 million more than approved by the Board in April 2022. Boise State University seeks approval from the Board to increase the maximum total cost for Albertsons Stadium South End Video Board (Melaleuca) to $6 million. IMPACT Additional funding for this project will be entirely philanthropic funds. Proceeding with this project is essential to leverage the significant d onor/sponsor funding, but to also ensure that the relationship with the donor/sponsor is maintained. Previous Project Cost $4,500,000 Projected Escalation $1,500,000 Total Project Cost $6,000,000 ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Video Board Re ndering STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The Board approved the agreement to partner with the Boise State Foundation to purchase and install the video board at the April meeting. This action allows th e CONSENT JUNE 1 4, 2022 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 3 Page 2 project to proceed . Additional inflation and market project costs will be covered by philanthropic funding . Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION I move to approve the request by Boise State University to increase the Project Cost from $4,500,000 and to proceed with the construction of the Albertsons Stadium South End Video Board for a total cost not to exceed $6,000,000.

BACKGROUND /DISCUSSION The 2002 Operating Agreement (as amended in 2006) between the Regents and IDWR defined the terms for IDWR to occupy 54,355 s quare feet of the Idaho Water Center . The agreement provided a payment schedule with IDWR covering all costs of financing, construction , and operations of the space IDWR occup ied. In 2012 and 2019 the Idaho State Building Authority (ISBA) refinanced the debt on the building which significantly reduced the financing costs of construction and resulted in lower total payments from the University of Idaho (UI)/IDWR to ISBA . Consequently, UI and IDWR financial staff recalculated the payment for IDWR to reflect those savings in the payment schedule of the Operating Agreement . UI administration additionally proposes to clarify the existing agreement by the attached a mendment to ensure any future financing savings attributable to the space occupied by IDWR can be apportioned to IDWR without further amendment to the Operating Agreement. IMPACT The savings from ISBA bond refinancing will result in lower overall payme nts from UI to ISBA under the terms of the State's Facilities lease with ISBA. The proposed amendment simply allocates the share of those savings attributable to the space occupied by IDWR to IDWR by shortening the duration of payments due by about three and a half years . This amendment does not result in any net impact to UI's finances beyond the previously established savings UI realized from ISBA's refinancing of bond debt . The result of this amendment will be that UI simply collect s less from IDWR bec ause UI will need to pay less to ISBA.

A. The Idaho State Building Authority (\"Authority\") issued bonds in 2003 for the construction of the Idaho Water Center. B. The parties e xecuted an Operating Agreement on December 17, 2002, which outlines the relationship of the parties regarding the Idaho Water Center. The Operating Agreement includes a Schedule identifying IDWR 's payment obligation to the University to cover its share of the bond payments , parking access fees, and operations and maintenance costs . C. The pa rties amended the Operating Agreement on August 1, 2006 (the \"First Amendment\"). The First Amendment established the Net Rentable Square Feet at 54,355. D.

Operations and maintenance cost payments are determined every five years as set forth in the Operating Agreement. The current period covered is 2020 -2024. E. The Authority refunded a portion of the bonds in 2 012 and again in 2019. The two bond refundings result in a savings of approximately $18.2 million. F. The bond payment structure in the Operating Agreement does not document a mechanism for IDWR and the Board to benefit from the savings achieved through the two refundings. Therefore, the parties want to amend the Operating A greement. The foregoing Recitals are incorporated into this Second Amendment as if set forth in full. The parties agree to amend the Operating Agreement as follows: 1. Exhibit B as previously amended and as it has been previously revised in accordance with Section 4.2 of the Operating Agreement is deleted and a new Exhibit B is added . The new Exhibit B is attached and incorporated to this Amendment. 2.

If IDWR elects to lease additional space pursuant to section 3.3, IDWR and the University shall adjust the Schedule or make other provision for paymen t of the costs of such additional space. If the Authority refunds the bonds pursuant to the Facilities Lease, the parties will adjust the Schedule to equitably apportion any change in the Basic Rent payable to the Authority. 3. All other provisions of the Op erating Agreement shall remain in full force and in effect. 4. The Operating Agreement, as amended by the First and Second Amendment, constitutes the final and complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings between the parties, whether written or oral. 5.

In 2002 a comprehensive review and substantial revisions occurred to bring them in line with SBOE/Regents policy. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section II.E., F. BACKGROUND /DISCUSSION The University of Idaho has been reviewing policies and making appropriate updates to align with updated procedures, Idaho State Board of Education governing procedures , and Department of Labor guidance. Revisions of F aculty - Staff Handbook (FSH), Section 3080 remove s the need to create an offer letter and salary agreement for staff at the time of appointment. IMPACT The changes to this policy remove process redundanc ies and streamline new employee paperwork. Under the new policy, staff will receive an offer letter with salary information included. Previously, the process required an offer letter and a separate salary agreement. Regular annual salary agreements will remain as part of the process. This revised process mirrors what already happens for faculty appointments.

[RGP II.D.2.d(1)] These employees have no expectation of continuing employment beyond an existing contract period, and their service in no way qualifies them for consideration for tenure in that position. In no case are such employees legally entitled to advance notice of or reasons for a decision not to enter into another contract of employment for another period and such decision is not grievable or appealable in any way. [rev. 7-02, 1-08] b. The UI president serves as such at the pleasure of the Board of Regents and may be dismissed from that position at any time with or without cause or written notice.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section V.K.1 BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Lewis -Clark State College (LCSC) seeks to begin the renovation and build- out of the first floor of Clearwater Hall , which is a site located on Main S treet in Lewiston and a short distance f rom the campus. This build- out has been on LC SC's state Division of Public Works alteration and repair s project list since at least 2019. LCSC seeks to build out th e first floor for the Workforce Training Center's (WFT) use and relocate the operation from a leased site. The relocation will create synergies wit h two other centers located at Clearwater Hall : the Adult Learning Center (ALC) and the Idaho Small Business Development Center (ISBDC) as well as an additional center adjacent to this location, the Center for Arts and History (CAH) . As students achieve their educational goals such as a G eneral Education Diploma (GED) through the Adult Learning Center, the co- location of Workforce Training creates an easy transition into certificate programs offered by WFT. Additionally, ISBDC assists existing and new businesses to be successful, including providing workforce training. As ISBDC identifies training needs for new businesses, the path to connect with these needs will be more seamless for the customer. Having each of these centers co- located will create ease of access for customers and businesses. Additionally, being located downtown puts WFT closer to businesses that have training requests. The build out of the WFT/Clearwater Hall area will also allow the other centers and businesses to host events within this space. WFT will also be doing personal development classes, formerly offered by CAH and will partner with CAH to develop these classes. Each of these synergies will help to create a one -stop shop for adult learners and small businesses (GED to certificate; business development to business success; and personal development for the needs in between). The cost to build out this facility , including HVAC, restrooms, nine offices, and four classrooms totaling 6,400 square feet along with associated furniture and equipment , is estimated at $1.5 million . CONSENT JUNE 14 , 2022 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 6 Page 2 The proj ect will be funded by institutional and WFT reserves and an internal loan. LCSC plans to provide a $1 million internal loan to WFT to partially fund the construction and build out. WFT will repay this internal loan through savings achieved by terminating an existing lease, programmatic revenue, fundraising, and anticipated growth with additional facility space. IMP ACT The build out of Clearwater Hall will increase available programmatic space for Lewis -Clark State College and allow synergies between three existing downtown programs and Workforce Training. The fiscal impact to the college is an estimated $1.5 million of which an internal $1 million will be repaid by the Workforce Training operation. The net impact is lowered by the termination of an existing lease estimated at $35,000 per year. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Conceptual Map Attachment 2 - Six-year Capital Plan STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS LCSC has reviewed the space for feasibility and has a rough cost estimate as well as a preliminary sketch as shown in Attachment 1. This approval will allow LCSC to move forward with design and planning, which is the first step in what will be a design- bid-build process . This project has been on the Division of Public Works list for at least three years and has not risen to a high priority level . LCSC now has the ability to move forward with the project using other funding sources . Since this is now a capital project, Board action is required to add it to LCSC's six - year capital constructi on plan. Policy V.K. requires projects estimated to exceed $1 million to be on the approved six -year capital construction plan prior to an institution soliciting or committing funds. Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION I move to approve the revision to LCSC's six -year plan as submitted in Attachment 2 and to authorize the construction of the first floor of Clearwater Hall by Lewis - Clark State College for a cost not to exceed $1.5 million , and to further authorize the President or designee to execute such documents and agreements relating thereto.

ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Duties and Responsibilities Attachment 2 - Revised Organization Chart Attachment 3 - Dr. Grace Anderson Curriculum Vitae STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Pursuant to Board Policy II.B. 3., the creation of any position at a level of vice - president (or equivalent) and a bove, regardless of funding source, require s Board approval. This includes the creation of a position through the promotion or elevation of an existing positio n. The new VP IRPE position was implemented in January 2022, and Grace Anderson moved from the Director of Institutional Research and Effectiveness to the VP IRPE, so this action is retroactive to that date. President Pemberton did notify the Board President and Executive Director in advance of implementation. It was just an inadvertent oversight that the position wasn't brought to Board for approval until now. Staff recommends approval.

ATTACHMENT 3 CONSENT - BAHR TAB 7 Page 3CONSENT JUNE 1 4, 2022 CONSENT - IRSA TAB 8 Page 1 UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO SUBJECT Online Bachelor of Business Administration APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section III.G . BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION University of Idaho's proposed online Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) is developed by the College of Business and Economics and is intended to meet state workforce and economic need. The online degree is designed to enhance access through affordable tuition and fees , which are set at $365 per credit hour. The program is priced lower than the current Bachelor of Science in Business. All courses will be offered 100% online and asynchronous, allowing students to complete the degree reducing conflicts , and relieving time restraints that are typical of working adults . Program demand is supported by analysis of demand trends, job postings, and the educational offerings of comparator colleges and universities provided by EMSI Burning Glass . Among the more cited skills advertised by employers were expense reporting, procurement, onboarding, Microsoft Productivity Suite, event planning, purchasing, budgeting, accounting, business support systems and Microsoft OneNote. The top common skills and dispositions included management, communication, detail orientation , coordination, prioritiz ation, leadership, and problem solving. The median earnings for Management and Business Management jobs in 2018 was $88,300 and the salary is expected to incre ase by 23.8% by 2029, further propping demand. The program is purposely designed with stackable certificates, each providing focus on key clusters of in -demand skills included in the analysis. The program is intended to provide Idahoans with the skillset needed for employment in desirable business and management positions , supporting the economy of Idaho and creating conditions attractive to companies to relocate and found their enterprises in the state. Only 27.5% of Idaho residents age 25+ have completed a bachelor's degree. By eliminating the need for a student to have to move to Moscow or a regional center to pursue a traditional degree, working adults and nontraditional students will be able to complete a bachelor's degree and increase their business and management skills. The BBA program is built around four, stackable certificates that require few prerequisites. By removing the prerequisite obstacle , students will realize an immediate impact on their professional qualifications, employability, competency, and productivity. The equivalent of one certificate per semester is achievable to the motivated full-time student , and they can continue completing additional certificates to earn the full BA degree. This pathway model differentiates this program from other offerings in the state. CONSENT JUNE 1 4, 2022 CONSENT - IRSA TAB 8 Page 2 IMPACT Students completing a Business Administration education will have higher earning power and improved quality of life. The individuals moving to positions providing health care benefits will reduce state- funded benefit expenditures. Companies in Idaho will b e able to develop their own managers. Non-traditional students with children will be able to model the importance of post -secondary education and improve the Idaho high school go- on rate. Students will complete the state board core, leading to citizens with a better understanding of the arts, culture, history and science. The College of Business and Economics anticipates hiring three full -time faculty to cover 18 sections of new and existing courses for the proposed online program. This includes costs associate d with existing administrator, full -time instructors, adjuncts, and overload instruction. The p rogram will require new computers and monitors for newly hired faculty. Fiscal impact is between $427,551 - $761,723 of ongoing funding and $5,000 - $ 43,210 in one- time funding. The cost per credit hour is $365. This includes an online course fee of $35 per credi t. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Bachelor of Business Administration Program Proposal BOARD STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As provided in the program proposal, this pathway model will provide students with opportunities to complete the Bachelor of Business Administration degree through stackable certificates while also enabling students to develop specific skills that will benefit them in their current employment or business. Those certificates include Applied Finance, Business Leadership, Enterprise Systems Integration, Sales Management, and Technical Program Management. The program anticipates enrolling 53 students initially reaching 218 once the program is up and running. As provided in their proposal, projected costs total $503,251 and $792,923 respectively during the second and fourth years of operation. With a price per student credit hour of $36 5 delivery of 1,398 Student Credit Hours ( SCH) in FY24 and 2,203 SCH in FY26, the program will produce revenue sufficient to cover projected costs. With students enrolling in an average of 19.5 SCH, headcount enrollment of 72 students will result in revenue sufficient to cover projected costs. In FY26 , headcount enrollment of 113 students will produce revenue sufficient to cover projected costs, assuming hiring and other expenses are incurred as planned. Any tuition discounts offered to students impacting the revenue per SCH will impact the number of S CHs and students necessary for the program to break even. The university provides if the program does not enroll students sufficient to produce revenue equal to or greater than the realized costs of maintaining and delivering the program, there would be justification to discontinue the program. University of Idaho's proposed online Bachelor of Business Administration is consistent with their Service Region Program Responsibilities and their current CONSENT JUNE 1 4, 2022 CONSENT - IRSA TAB 8 Page 3 institution plan for Delivery of Academic Programs in Region II. As provided in Board Policy III.Z, no institution has the statewide program responsibility business programs at the baccalaureate level. Additionally, Board Policy III.Z does not apply to programs for which 90% or more of all activity is required or completed online. Currently, Boise State University offers an online BBA, Idaho State University offers an online B achelor of Science in General Business, and Lewis -Clark State College offers a Bachelor of Applied Science in Business.

This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program. All questions must be answered. Rationale for Creation or Modification of the Program 1.Describe the request and give an overview of the changes that will result. What type of substantive change are you requesting? Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Identify any existing program that this program will replace. If this is an Associate degree, please describe transferability. The College of Business and Economics is requesting approval of an online degree, a Bachelor of Business Administration. While including some of the same courses as our existing programs, it will not replace any programs. We do not anticipate that the new online degree program will use any teaching staff resources of our existing programs. 2.Need for the Program. Describe evidence of the student, regional, and statewide needs that will be addressed by this proposal to include student clientele to be served and address the ways in which the proposed program will meet those needs. a.Workforce and economic need: Provide verification of state workforce needs that will be met by this program. Include job titles and cite the data source. Describe how the proposed program will stimulate the state economy by advancing the field, providing research results, etc. Employers are increasingly hiring those with online degrees, with the preference for traditional seated degrees fading rapidly. Job posting analytics provided by EMSI indicate that within Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming there were 1,051 unique job postings between September 2016 and May 2020 in Management and Business Management. The average advertised salary was $58,800 dollars. The top hard skills advertised were Expense Reporting, Procurement, Onboarding, Microsoft SharePoint, Event Planning, Purchasing, Budgeting, Accounting, Business Support Systems, and Microsoft OneNote. The top common skills were Management, Communications, Detail Oriented, Microsoft Outlook, Coordinating, Microsoft Excel, Prioritizing, Leadership, Operations, and problem solving. Analysis of this data had guided the creation of our proposal. Nationally within Management and Business Management there were 135,301 jobs in 2018 with a median earnings of $88,300. This rate is expected to increase by 23.8% by 2029. By providing the skills to allow more Idahoans to succeed in these high paying jobs we will help to support the Idaho economy and tax base while providing assurance for companies considering locating within the Gem state that the human resources they require are locally available. Further, we will seek to coordinate with industry in Idaho, encouraging them to provide feedback on curriculum, provide adjunct and guest speakers, virtual executives in residence, and direct and indirect financial support for the program. As many Idaho companies have a footprint that exceeds the state this would allow tapping a larger target market of potential students. b.Student demand. What is the most likely source of students who will be expected to enroll (full-time, part-time, outreach, etc.). Provide evidence of student demand/ interest from inside and outside of the institution.

Indeed, non-traditional learners report few lessons are more powerful to their children than seeing them doing homework. Finally, to complete the degree students will complete the state board core, leading to citizens with a better understanding of the arts, culture, history, and science. 3.Program Prioritization Is the proposed new program a result of program prioritization? Yes __ No_X_ If yes, how does the proposed program fit within the recommended actions of the most recent program prioritization findings. 4.Credit for Prior Learning Indicate from the various cross walks where credit for prior learning will be available. If no PLA has been identified for this program, enter 'Not Applicable'. Not Applicable 5.Affordability Opportunities Describe any program-specific steps taken to maximize affordability, such as: textbook options (e.g., Open Educational Resources), online delivery methods, reduced fees, compressed course scheduling, etc. This question applies to certificates, undergraduate, graduate programs alike. The online Bachelor of Business Administration is designed with affordability in mind. Credit hours will be priced lower than the current Bachelor of Science in Business, at $360.00 per credit hour initially, assuring its competitiveness with other online programs. All courses will be offered in a 100% online, asynchronous, format to maximize flexibility in their completion and minimize conflicts with work and other time constraints. Instructors will be encouraged to use Open Educational Resources whenever possible and appropriate.

The amendment created a student transportation funding cap, affectin g school districts that exceed by 103% the statewide average cost per mile and cost per rider . The 2007 and 2009 Legislatures further amended this language to provide clear, objective criteria that defines when a district may qualify to be reimbursed for expenses above the cap, and by how much. These new criteria designate certain bus runs as \"hardship\" runs, and allow the district to receive a higher cap based on the percentage of the district's bus runs that are so categorized. As of April 1 2, 2022 , 30 school districts and/or charter schools were negatively affected by the pupil transportation funding cap: 1 BOISE INDEPENDENT DISTRICT $ 621,523 11 MEADOWS VALLEY DISTRICT $ 22,479 61 BLAINE COUNTY DISTRICT $ 244,947 71 GARDEN VALLEY DISTRICT $ 39,839 131 NAMPA SCHOOL DISTRICT $ 149,216 134 MIDDLETON DISTRICT $ 173,903 137 PARMA DISTRICT $ 34,525 171 OROFINO JOINT DISTRICT $ 15,286 192 GLENNS FERRY JOINT DISTRICT $ 6,022 244 MOUNTAIN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT $ 11,438 281 MOSCOW DISTRICT $ 138,607 CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - SDE TAB 1 2 Page 2 305 HIGHLAND JOINT DISTRICT $ 36,945 341 LAPWAI DISTRICT $ 33,828 393 WALLACE DISTRICT $ 1,452 401 TETON COUNTY DISTRICT $ 31,006 411 TWIN FALLS DISTRICT $ 66,987 414 KIMBERLY DISTRICT $ 8,011 421 MCCALL -DONNELLY JOINT SCHOOL DISTRICT $ 84,333 454 ROLLING HILLS PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 18,753 456 FALCON RIDGE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 21,779 474 MONTICELLO MONTESSORI CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 2,803 475 THE SAGE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF BOISE, A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 6,459 478 LEGACY PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 6,270 482 AMERICAN HERITAGE CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 4,635 498 GEM PREP: MERIDIAN, LLC $ 21,583 499 FUTURE PUBLIC SCHOOL, INC. $ 17,298 511 PEACE VALLEY CHARTER SCHOOL, INC. $ 9,266 513 PROJECT IMPACT STEM ACADEMY, INC. $ 16,164 544 MOSAICS PUBLIC SCHOOL, INC. $ 30,793 796 GEM PREP: NAMPA, LLC $ 2,545 The State Department of Education received requests from various school districts and charter schools for a waiver of the 103% funding cap as provided in Section 33-1006, Idaho Code. Student Transportation staff reviewed these requests to ensure they meet the eligibility criteria. Of the 30 districts and charter schools negatively affected by the pupil transportation funding cap, only six (6) districts have routes meeting the statutory requirements of a hardship bus run, which would allow the Board to grant a waiver. All six of these districts , listed below, have applied for a waiver from the student transportation funding cap. #171 Orofino Joint District submitted school bus routes that met the required criteria. This represents 6.25% of the bus runs operated by the district. When added to the 103% funding cap, as provided by law, this would allow the Board to increase their funding cap to a maximum of 109.25 %. #244 Mountain View School District submitted school bus routes that met the required criteria. This represents 60% of the bus runs operated by the district. CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - SDE TAB 1 2 Page 3 When added to the 103% funding cap, as provided by law, this would allow the Board to increase their funding cap to a maximum of 163%. #281 Moscow District submitted school bus routes that met the required criteria. This represents 15% of the bus runs operated by the district. When added to the 103% funding cap, as provided by law, this would allow the Board to increase their funding cap to a maximum of 1 18%. #305 Highland Joint District submitted school bus routes that met the required criteria. This represents 80% of the bus runs operated by the district. When added to the 103% funding cap, as provided by law, this would allow the Board to increase their fu nding cap to a maximum of 183 %. #341 Lapwai District submitted school bus routes that met the required criteria. This represents 52.94% of the bus runs operated by the district. When added to the 103% funding cap, as provided by law, this would allow the Board to increase their funding cap to a maximum of 155.94 %. #414 Kimberly submitted school bus routes that met the required criteria. This represents 3.45% of the bus runs operated by the district. When added to the 103% funding cap, as provided by law, this would allow the Board to increase their funding cap to a maximum of 106.45%. IMPACT The approval of the cap waivers listed below allows districts to be reimbursed for routes that meet the hardship criteria. Board inaction or denial of the funding cap waivers would result in a loss of funding for the school districts in question. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Funding Cap Waiver Spreadsheet Page 7 BOARD STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS At the June 2021 Regular Board meeting the Board approved waivers for 14 school districts: Plummer -Worley, Garden Valley, Orofino County, Kootenai, Moscow, Lapwai, Buhl Joint, Genesee Joint, Lake Pend Oreille, Blaine County, Mountain View, Lewiston Independent, and Teton County School Districts . All six of the school districts the Board is considering had waivers of the funding cap approved in 20 21. Pursuant to Section 33 -1006, Idaho Code: \"A school district may appeal the application of the one hundred three percent (103%) limit on reimbursable costs to the state board of education, which may establish for that district a new percentile limit for reimbursable costs compared to the statewide average, which is higher than one hundred three percent (103%). In doing so, the state board of education may set a new limit that is greater than one hundred three percent (103%), but is less CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - SDE TAB 1 2 Page 4 than the percentile limit requested by the school district. However, the percentage increase in the one hundred three percent (103%) cap shall not exceed the percentag e of the district's bus runs that qualify as a hardship bus run, pursuant to this subsection. Any costs above the new level established by the state board of education shall not be reimbursed. Such a change shall only be granted by the state board of education for hardship bus runs. To qualify as a hardship bus run, such bus run shall meet at least two (2) of the following criteria: (a) The number of student riders per mile is less than fifty percent (50%) of the statewide average number of student riders per mile; (b) Less than a majority of the miles on the bus run are by paved surface, concrete or asphalt road; (c) Over ten percent (10%) of the miles driven on the bus run are a five percent (5%) slope or greater. The Department of Education transportation staff review each of the applications prior to submittal for Board consideration. Only those school districts that have met the statutory requirements may be considered for approval .

In some cases, school districts use a long -term substitute prior to requesting emergency provisional certification for the individual. The individual that the school district is requesting emergency certification for may have been in the classroom as a long -term substitute for the entire school term. Salary based apportionment is calculated based on school district employee certification. A school district or charter school receives a lesser apportionment for noncertificated/classified sta ff than it receives for certificated staff. Substitute teachers are calculated at the lesser -classified staff rate. A process for approving provisional certificates was approved by the Board at the April 2019 Regular Board meeting to limit the timeline for emergency provisional certificates to come to the Board to incentivize school districts and charter schools to request emergency provisional certification earlier in the school year rather than waiting until the end of the school year . The approved process required requests for the current school year to come to the Board at no later than the April Regular Board meeting. The process was amended at the August 2019 Regular Board meeting to provide an extension of this timeframe \"subject to extenuating circumstances\" such as when a local education agency loses a staff member after the January Professional Standards Commission (Commission) meeting deadline. CONSENT June 14, 2022 CONSENT - SDE TAB 1 3 Page 4 In order to meet the April Board meeting agenda material deadline in March of each year, the certification request is required to be submitted no later than January of each year to make it through the Commission/Department process. Due to the length of time it was taking to process the requests when Commission recommendations were included in the process, the Board amended the process again at the August 2021 Regular Board meeting limiting the recommendation process to recommendations from Department certification staff or Division of Career Technical Education staff as applicable to the type of certification. The Department staff have forwarded those applications they recommend for approval for Board consideration. Emergency Provisional Certificates and Endorsements may be issued to an uncertified person with the minimum amount of training or may be issued to individuals with an existing certificate and endorsement outside of the area they have been hired to teach in. In the case of someone hired outside of the subject area they are endorsed to teach in, the Emergency Provision Certificate/Endorsement is for the endorsement area. These requests were not received by the April Regular Board meeting as required through Board action at the April 2019 Regular Board meeting. BOARD ACTIONS I move to approve the request by State Department of Education for approval one- year emergency provisional certificates in the endorsement area(s) at the specified school districts as provided herein for the 2021-2 022 school year for the following individuals: Cynthia Peterson, Wesley Naylor, Sandra Valdez, Lucinda Padill Nakaeta __________ Seconded by __________ Carried Yes _____ No _____ CONSENT JUNE 14, 202 2 CONSENT - SDE TAB 14 Page 1 PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS COMMISSON SUBJECT Professional Standards Commission Appointments REFERENCE April 2022 Board approved 20 appointments to the Professional Standards Commission. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Section 33- 1252, Idaho Code BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Section 33 -1252, Idaho Code, sets forth criteria for membership on the Professional Standards Commission (PSC). The Commission consists of eighteen (18) members including one (1) from the State Department of Education and one (1) from the Division of Career Technical Education. The remaining members shall be representative of the teaching profession of the state of Idaho, and not less than seven (7) members shall be certificated classroom teachers in the public school system and shall include at least one (1) teacher of exceptional children and at least one (1) in pupil personnel services. The Idaho School Superintendents' Association, the Idaho Association of Secondary School Principals, the Idaho Association of Special Education Administrators, the educati on departments of private colleges, and the colleges of letters and sciences of the institutions of higher education may submit nominees for (1) position each. The community colleges and the education departments of the public institutions of higher educat ion may submit nominees for two (2) positions. Two (2) positions on the PSC are open for three (3) -year appointment s, effective July 1, 2022 : one (1) position representing pupil personnel services, and one (1) position representing certificated classroom teachers . Nominations were sought from the Idaho Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, Idaho Association of Secondary School Principals, Idaho Education Association (IEA) , Idaho Indian Education Committee, and Northwest Professional Educators (NWP E) in early 2022. No nominees for the pupil personnel services position were submitted in early 2022, and additional nominations were sought from the Idaho School Counselor Association, School Social Work Association of Idaho, Idaho School Psychologist Association , and School Nurse Organization of Idaho (SNOI) in March 2022. One (1) nomination was received from a member of SNOI. A second SNOI member expressed interest in the position but did not feel comfortable with the time away from their district due to a staffing shortage. While Section 33- 1252, Idaho Code, asks for the submission of three (3) nominations for each position, the PSC respectfully requests appointment of the interested nominee to the pupil personnel CONSENT JUNE 14, 202 2 CONSENT - SDE TAB 14 Page 2 services position. Appointment of the interested nominee ensures all regions of the state are represented on the PSC. Donald Eberlin, Jr., an appointee to the PSC effective July 1, 2022, representing certificated classroom teachers, has been promoted to a vice- principal position for the 22-2 3 school year . Mr. Eberlin has declined the appointment, as he is no longer representative of certificated classroom teachers. Nominations from the IEA and NWPE for 2022- 2025 open positions were reconsidered for the appointment. IMPACT Board action allows for appointment / of members to the PSC, ensuring all seats are filled for the 202 2-2023 meeting year, and all regions of the state are represented.

Any state organization of teachers whose membership is open to all cert ificated teachers in the state may submit nominees for positions to be held by classroom teachers; the Idaho Association of School Superintendents may submit nominees for one (1) position, the Idaho Association of Secondary School Principals may submit nom inees for one (1) position; the Idaho association of elementary school principals may submit nominees for one (1) position; the Idaho School Boards Association may submit nominees for one (1) position; the Idaho Association of Special Education Administrat ors may submit nominees for one (1) position; the education departments of the private colleges of the state may submit nominees for one (1) position, the community colleges and the education departments of the public institutions of higher education may submit nominees for two (2) positions, and the colleges of letters and sciences of the institutions of higher education may submit nominees for one (1) position.\" CONSENT JUNE 14, 202 2 CONSENT - SDE TAB 14 Page 3 Additionally, Section 33- 1252, Idaho Code, requires not less than seven (7) members be certificated classroom teachers in the public schools system and shall include at least one (1) teacher of exceptional children and at least one (1) teacher in pupil personnel services. While not required, historical practice has been to identify whether a teacher serving on the commission is an elementary or secondary school teacher to assure a balance in the representation on the Commission. At the June 2016 Regular Board meeting, the Board requested the SDE amend its practices when requesting nominations to the PSC. The new practice would be for SDE to reach out not only to the statutorily identified stakeholder groups, but to also reach out to other education community groups to allow individuals who are not connected to the standard communications process an opportunity to apply or submit nominations for open positions. Specifically, it was discussed that there was a need for educators who work with underserved populations to have an opportunity to serve on the PSC. The Board's Indian Education Committee expressed an interest in nominating individual educators to the Commission if notified in advance of openings. Original appointments are made for a term of three years. Appointments to fill vacant positions are made for the remainder of the term they are f illing. This process helps to limit the number of new appointments that have to be made in a single year and helps to assure some continuity of membership on the PSC.

ATTACHMENT 7 CONSENT- SDE TAB 14 Page 1Greetings, My name is Eric McDowell and I am the current science teacher at Kendrick Jr./Sr. High School. For the past 8 years, I have been heavily involved in my school and community in a variety of roles beyond my duties as a teacher, such as a city councilor, treasurer of the Juliaetta Community Improvement Association, President of the Kendrick Education Association, and the secretary of the Kendrick Lions Club. I am also a prolific and successful grant writer who has brought over $100K into th e Kendrick -Juliaetta community. In my roles as a teacher and officer in my local teaching union, I have contributed to our local finally achieving an actual master agreement rather than the unofficial agreements that had existed since the late 1970s. This successful effort has played huge roles in minimizing teacher/staff turnover in my district as well as to make our small district competitive in Region 2. As a part of gaining an official master agreement in my district, I have been unfortunately a witn ess to several incidences of unethical behavior by administrators and school board members . This behavior has played a pivotal role in my efforts with regard to my local as well as induced my current pursuit of credentials as an administrator. I hope to fu rther my profession by seeking a spot on Idaho's Professional Standards Committee.

December 2017 Board accepted the Lewis -Clark State College Focused Visit State Team Report . APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Sections 33 -1254 and 33- 1258, Idaho Code BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The Professional Standards Commission (PSC) is tasked by the State Board of Education (Board) with conducting a full unit review of all Board -approved teacher preparation programs in Idaho on a seven (7) year cycle. The PSC convened a State Review Team (Team) of content expert s from the fields of higher education and K -12 education and conducted a virtual, full unit review of Lewis -Clark State College's (LCSC) approved educator preparation programs on December 12 - 14, 2021. The Team reviewed evidence to confirm whether each program leading to initial certification met the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification of Professional School Personnel, approved by the Board June 20, 2018. The review was held concurrently with the review of LCSC 's educator preparation programs by the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) . The LCSC review included a pilot process and form for program design review , for those programs leading to endorsement with fewer than five (5) completers in a seven (7) -year period. The concept of program design review was developed during Phase III work of the Educator Standards Working Group to provide EPPs the opportunity to identify those programs with few or no completers and to provide design evidence for continued, conditional approval of the program. The Chemistry and Psychology programs were identified by LCSC for design review . Upon completion of Team review, all LCSC programs and state specific requirements are recommended for continued approval with the exception of the following: P re-Service Technology Standards - conditionally approved, lack of evidence Chemistry - conditionally approved, design review . CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - SDE TAB 1 5 Page 2 No rejoinder to the State Team report was submitted by LCSC for PSC consideration. On April 7, 2022, the PSC Standards Committ ee reviewed the final report submitted by the Team. While the Psychology program had been identified by LCSC for design review based on a low number of completers, the Psychology program has no program -level (enhancement) standards against which to review. In result, the Psychology program design review form completed by LCSC showed program alignment to the Core Teaching Standards. Because LCSC is able to issue institutional recommendations for the Psychology program and other programs without program -level standards based on approval of Core Teaching Standards , the Standards Committee determined that it was not logical to recommend conditional approval of the Psychology program when the Core Teaching Standards were met. Psychology program design review was removed from the report. The Standards Committee brought the report to the full PSC on April 8, 2022, and the full PSC voted to recommend the Board approve the LCSC State Team Report as provided in Attachment 1. IMPACT The recommendations in this report will enable LCSC to continue to prepare teachers while ensuring state teacher preparation standards are appropriately embedded in the programs . ATTACHMENTS Attachmen t 1 - LCSC Final State Review Team Report STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Pursuant to Section 33- 114, Idaho Code, the review and approval of all teacher preparation programs in the state is vested in the State Board of Education. The program reviews are conducted for the Board through the Professional Standards Commission (Commission). Recommendations are then brought forward to the Board for consideration. The review process is designed to ensure the programs are meeting the Board approved standards for Initial Certification of Professional School Personnel (Certification Standards) for the applicable program areas. Certification Standards are designed to ensure that educators are prepared to teach the state content standards for their applicable subject areas and are up- to-date on best practices in various teaching methodologies. Current practice is for the Commission to review new programs and make recommendations to the Board regarding program approval. New program reviews are conducted through a \"Desk Review\" and do not include an on- site review. The Commission review process evaluates whether the programs meet or will meet the approved Certification Standards for the applicable certificate and CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 CONSENT - SDE TAB 1 5 Page 3 endorsement area. The Commission may recommend to the Board that a program be \"Approved,\" \"Not Approved,\" or \"Conditionally Approved.\" Programs conditionally approved are required to have a subsequent focus visit. The focus visit is scheduled three years following the conditional approval, at which time the Commission forwards a new recommendation to the Board regarding approval status of the program. Once approved by the Board, candidates completing these programs will be able to apply for a Standard Instructional Certificate with an endorsement in the area of study completed.

Lewiston State Normal School was e stablished by an act of the Idaho State Legislature in 1893 to address the need for quality teachers in the region's many one -room schools. In 1943, the legislature granted the college its current status as a four- year undergraduate institution. T he college's days as a normal school came to end on March 2, 1971, when Gov ernor Cecil Andrus signed a bill to change the name to the current Lewis -Clark State College. The purpose of the educator preparation program review was to determine if sufficient evidence was presented indicating that candidates at Lewis -Clark State College meet state standards for initial certification. The review was conducted by an 11 -member state program approval team, accompanied by two (2) state facilitators who assisted in the review of state specific requirements .

As such, the standards set the criteria by which teacher preparation programs are reviewed for state program approval. The following rubrics are used to evaluate the extent to which educator preparation programs prepare educators who meet the standards. The rubrics are designed to be used with each individual preparation program (i.e., Elementary, Special Education, Secondary English, Secondary Science -Biology, etc.). The rubrics describe three levels of performance, unacceptable, acceptable, and exemplary for each of the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification. The rubrics shal l be used to make holistic judgments. Elements identified in the rubrics provide the basis upon which the State Program Approval Team evaluates the institution's evidence that candidates meet the Idaho standards. Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary The pro gram provides evidence that candidates meet fewer than 75% of the indicators. The program provides evidence that candidates meet 75% -100% of the indicators The program provides evidence candidates use assessment results in guiding student instruction (when applicable) . The program provides evidence that candidates meet 100% of the indicators. The program provides evidence of the use of data in program improvement decisions.

Provided syllabi and corresponding key assignment descriptions from Fall 2017 to Summer 2021 indicate a lack of evidence for how candidates learn, understand and implement the Pre -Service Technology Standards. Evidence did not demonstrate candidates' knowledge of subject matter, teaching and learning, and technology to facilitate experiences that advance student learning, creativity, and innovation in face to face and virtual environments. Throughout the review, there was some evidence of candidates receiving instruction that advances their learning of digital tools ; however, there was no evidence to support any of the indicators. An additional area to note was the lack of types of evidence provided and the inability to review the majority of the provided student examples due to access issues.

Additionally, all teacher candidates are expected to meet the requirements defined in State Board Rule (IDAPA 08.02.02: Rules Governing Uniformity). Idaho educator preparation programs complete an Institutional Recommendation to the State Department of Education verifying that the candidate has met all the requirements as defined in State Board Rule (IDAPA 08.02.02: Rules Governing Uniformity). Standard 1: State Board Approved Program - Educator preparation program had a State Board approved program for initial certification for each area of endorsement indicated on candidate 's institutional recommendation . Standard 1 Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary State Board A pproved Program X Standard 1 Analysis - Institutional recommendations (IRs) provided by the EPP demonstrate that candidates for initial certification (audited candidates) received one (1) or more endorsements for State Board- approved programs. Of 18 audited candidates \u2014roughly 10% of completers recommended for IRs in 2018, 2019, and 2020\u2014 all 18 received one (1) or more endorsements for State Board- approved program(s). IRs were compared against the SDE document \"Approved Idaho Educator preparation Programs by Institution\" ( https://www.sde.idaho.gov/cert - psc/psc/standards.html ), which documents all teacher preparation programs for initial certification approved by the Idaho S tate Board of Education. Standard 2: Content Knowledge Assessment - Recommended ca ndidate received passing scores on State Board approved content area assessment for each recommended area of endorsement. Standard 2 Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary Content Knowledge Assessment X Standard 2 Analysis - Praxis II score reports from audited candidates provide evidence the EPP takes a systematic approach to assure each candidate receives a passing score on a State Board approved content area assessment for each recommended area of endorsement. Content area assessments applied to 34 endorsements across 18 audited candidates. Of 34 endorsements, one (1) content area assessment was not the correct assessment for the endorsement granted. Upon request of a passing content area assessment for the correct endorsement, the EPP acknowledged the err or, identified the reason for the error, contacted the completer to disclose the error, and provided a means for the completer to take the correct assessment at no cost to the completer. In addition, the EPP identified the most expeditious route by which the completer may gain endorsement in the area in which they have passed a content area assessment. The error appears CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT- SDE TAB 15 Page 52to be a single instance and not indicative of a systematic shortfall. The EPP's response to discovery of the error was immediate and appropriate. Standard 3: Pedagogy - Recommended candidate demonstrated competency in pedagogy for each recommended area of endorsement. Standard 3 Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary Pedagogy X Standard 3 Analysis - Official transcripts, unofficial transcripts, degree audit spreadsheets, and LCSC catalogs provide evidence that recommended candidates demonstrate competency in pedagogy for each recommended area of endorsement. Of 18 audited candidates, all received passing grades in pedagogy coursework as identified for each endorsement granted. Standard 4: Performance Assessment - Recommended candidate received a basic or higher rating in all components of the approved Idaho framework for teaching evaluation. Standard 4 Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary Performance Assessment X Standard 4 Analysis - Common summative assessments from audited candidates provide evidence that candidates who receive an institutional recommendation receive a basic or higher rating in all components of the Idaho framework for teaching evaluation. Of 18 audited candidates who received an institutional recommendation, all received a basic or higher in all components of the approved Idaho framework. Standard 5: Clinical Experience - Recommended candidate completed clinical experie nce for each recommended area of endorsement and grade range. Standard 5 Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary Clinical Experience X Standard 5 Analysis - A placement table provided by the EPP provides evidence that audited candidates complete clinical experience in each recommended grade range and area of endorsement. Of 18 audited candidates, all completed a clinical experience in the appropriate grade range and area of endorsement. The EPP does not have a placement office or standardized protocol for cli nical experience placement, relying on faculty \"mentors\" with deep connections to the local K -12 community to place students in clinical experiences that best meet the needs of each student. Based on this evidence, the current, individualized placement process appears to work, though lack of standardized protocol may prove problematic over time with personnel change both within and outside of LCSC and the resulting loss of institutional knowledge. CONSENT JUNE 14, 2022 ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT- SDE TAB 15 Page 53Standard 6: Student Achievement - Recommended candidate dem onstrated the ability to produce measurable student achievement or student success and create student learning objectives. Standard 6 Unacceptable Acceptable Exemplary Student Achievement X Standard 6 Analysis - A table of Performance -Based Assessment (PBA) Summary Scores provides evidence of some audited candidates' demonstrated ability to create student learning objectives. Of 18 audited candidates, 12 had a PBA score. The PBA, a key assessment, appears to have been a recent addition (2019 program com pleters) to the EPP's educator preparation programs, so not all audited candidates have evidence of a PBA. Because a pre -assessment element is missing from the PBA, the PBA does not provide evidence of a candidate's ability to produce measurable student achievement.

FOUNDATION STANDARD DESIGN NARRATI VE: How is the standard being met? What courses from Section I address the standard? EVIDENCE EXPLANATION: How does the provided evidence support the standard? Standard 1 Learner Development ...understands how learners grow & develop... Understanding of devel opmental stages and discernment between aspects of development (cognitive, identity, moral, minority -identity) and general growth is taught in ED-321, Educational Psychology and knowledge of it is applied by each candidate in a simulated case -study paper. Further understanding of minority identity development is taught in ED-345, Culturally Relevant Teaching . Further understanding of development for students with specific learning challenges is taught in SE-322, Inclusion Strategies, K -12. ... designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences. As well as simulation assignments, such as the case st udy paper in ED -321, candidates are assessed on the appropriateness of their lesson for engaging and teaching the students, including consideration of level, differentiation, cultural relevance, and specific learning challenges using our Performance -Based Assessment , which is employed as a value -added measure by having each candidate carry it out once for their co -requisite methods courses (general methods, ED-445, Instructional Strategies & Classroom Management & subject - specific methods, ED-447, Teaching Methods in the Content Area ), and again in their Clinical Internship (see Clinical Internship Handbook {available upon request) & syllabus for ED-460) in their final semester. Standard 2 Learning Differences ...uses understanding of individual differences and diverse cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning environments that enable each learner to meet high standards. Individual differences are emphasized in the differentiation unit in ED-321, Educational Psychology , which is assessed via a simulation lesson plan assignment in which extensive differentiation for levels of thinking, receptive/perceptive differences, learning style differences, and separate intelligences have to be present and noted by the candidates. ED-345, Culturally Relevant Teaching , is a course dedicated to understan ding and working with cultural differences and making fully inclusive environments. SE-322, Inclusion Strategies, K -12, is a course dedicated to teaching the candidates to create fully inclusive environments for students with specific learning challenges, and also spends course time on inclusion for ENL students. Attention to learning differences for all students is assessed in our Performance -Based Assessment (PBA), includi ng differentiation for learning differences and modifications (adaptations/accommodations) for students with specific learning challenges, which requires the candidates to seek out resources and ideas for making student and lesson -specific modifications. T he PBA is employed as a value- added measure by having each candidate carry it out once for their co- requisite methods courses (general methods, ED-445, Instructional Strateg ies & Classroom Management & subject -specific methods, ED-447, Teaching Methods in the Content Area ), and again in their Clinical Internship (see Clinical Internship Handbook {available upon request} & syllabus f or ED-460) in their final semester. Standard 3 Learning Environments ... works with others to create environments that support individual and collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self -motivation. Our entire program and all of our faculty emphasize that building a community of learners as a positive, supportive, trust -enhancing environment is central to educating. A focus on such environment clears the way for classroom management to be based upon reciprocity, kindness, and trust rather than upon arbitrary control, regimentation, or fear. This is built as a premise into the instruction theory and methods of every course from ED-214, Principles of Education , through ED-321, Educational Psychology , ED-345, Culturally Relevant Teaching, RE-309, Disciplinary Literacy , SE-322, Inclusion Strategies , to the co -requisite methods courses, general methods, ED- 445, Instructional Strategies & Classroom Management and subject -specific methods, ED-447, Teaching Methods in the Content Area. The candidates' Professional Portfolios , one of our key assessments evaluated at the end of Clin ical Internship, reflect the emphasis upon the caring environment created by our candidates in their work in classes, clinical experiences, and clinical internship.

In the Performance- Based Assessment , the candidates' strategies are evaluated for their facilitation of content, coherence for effective instruction, differentiation, modification, use of literacy strategy (all in assessment of planning), plus communication, engagement, and management (in the performing section). Standard 9 Professional Learning and Ethical Practice ... engages in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others The engagement of the candidates throughout the program is the first evidence of their learning and self - evaluative stance. They must obtain a B - or better in every program course to successfully complete the program, and each course expects positive engagement in learning all of the aspects of professional practice. The Professional Portfolio contains candidates' self -selected artifacts representing their professional lear ning, reflection, and self -evaluation. The Performance -Based Assessment's Section 4 is comprised of reflection upon the teaching process that requires candidates to generate meaningful reflections on both strengths and challenges, both positive accomplishments and matters on which they require improvement. It also explicitly assesses growing in the profession and professional character. All candidates must provide a substantive IPLP as required by the State to succe ssfully complete the program. The IPLP is a definitive statement of candidates' intention to pursue further professional learning. Standard 10 Leadership and Collaboration ...seeks appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for s tudent learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession.

With 0 -5 candidates having moved through the program over the past cycle, we have no performance samples from candidates in the program to offer for evidence of performance enhancement indicators. Even with such samples, the particularity of the indicators' demands make it unlikely that any EPP would be able to assure that all of them have been performed by every candidate in the formally evaluated 4 -6 hours, the informally observed 16- 20 hours, or even the total clinical experience/internship teaching hours (appro ximately 250 hours, with repetition of lessons for sections of the same course considered). This is one of the reasons that the State is voting in Jan, '22 on revised evaluation that does not depend upon covering indicators in a checklist approach. Wha t we can assure is that the spirit of the standard is being met, in which our candidates are effectively engaging students in the content of the discipline, inevitably teaching what is in a sub -set of these indicators. To assure this, ED-447 is specifically to instruct candidates on the application of their content and its aspects, and give them a chance to teach at least once to a full class in their clinical experience. Then, in clinical internship ( ED-460), they teach full classes for around eight of their sixteen -week placements. In both ED -447 and Clinical Internship, the candidates' teaching is evaluated formally twice, one time using the Danielson rubrics and one time according to our own Performance- Based Assessment . Rubric items in planning and performance involve facilitation of and student engagement with content in the discipline.

ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - ETS Praxis II Assessments & Cut Scores BOARD STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Pursuant to IDAPA 08.02.02.017, the PSC shall recommend assessments and qualify scores to the State Board of Education for approval. IDAPA 08.02.02. requires candidates to receive a qualifying score on a state approved content area, pedagogy, or performance assessment as applicable to the route or type of certification. The Praxis II is one of the Board approved content area assessments. Receiving a qualified score on a content area assessment is required for earning a standard instructional certificate, career technical degree- based certification, alternate routes for content area endorsements, and interim certification through an alternative authorization for content specialist. The PRAXIS II was approved by the Board in early 2000. Qualifying scores were set by the Board based on recommendations from the PSC at the December 2003 Board meeting, effective September 1, 2004. A few updates to the qualifying scores in individual subject areas were made at the June 2005, April 2006, June 2006, October 2006 and February 2018 Board meetings. Starting in 2019, updates have come to the Board more regularly. Consideration of the attached qualifying scores is part of the ongoing process to maintain updated qualifying scores on Board- approved content, pedagogy or performance assessments. In February 2020 the Board requested the PSC to include in their consideration and make recommendations on additional assessments that could serve as content, pedagogy, or performance assessment for certification purposes.
