WHAT IS \"BALANCE BILLING\" (SOMETIMES CALLED \"SURPRISE BILLING\")? When You see a doctor or other health care Provider, You may owe certain out-of-pocket costs, such as a Copayment, Coinsurance, and/or a Deductible. You may have other costs or have to pay the entire bill if You see a Provider or visit a health care fac ility that isn't in Your health plan's network. \"Out-of-network\" as used in this Notice, describes Providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with Your health plan. Out-of- network Providers may be permitted to bill You for the difference between what Your plan agreed to pay and the full amount charged for a service. This is called \" balance billing .\" This amount is likely more than in-network costs for the same service and might not count toward Your annual out-of-pocket limit. \"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected ba lance bill. This can happen when You can't control who is involved in Your care - like when You have an emergency or w hen You schedule a visit at an in-network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out-of-network Provider. YOU ARE PROTECTED FROM BALANCE BILLING FOR: Emergency services If You have an Emergency Medical Condition and get emergency services from an out-of-network Provider or facility, the most the Provider or facility may bill You is Your plan's in-net work cost-sharing amount (such as Copayments and Coinsurance). You can't be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services You may get after Yo u're in stable condition, unless You give written consent and give up Your protections not to be balanc ed billed for these post-stabilization services. Certain services at an in-network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center When You get services from an in-network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center, certain Providers there may be out-of-network. In thes e cases, the most thos e Providers may bill Y ou is Your plan's in- network cost-sharing amount. This applies to emer gency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensiv ist services. These Providers can't balance bill You and may not ask You to give up Your protecti ons not to be balance billed. If You get other services at these in-net work facilities, out-o f-network Providers can't balance bill You, unless You give written consent and give up Your protections. You're never required to give up Your protections from balance billing. You also aren't required to get care out-of-network. You can choose a Provider or facility in Your plan's network. WHEN BALANCE BILLING ISN'T ALLOWED, YOU ALSO HAVE THE FOLLOWING PROTECTIONS: You are only responsible for paying Your share of the cost (like the Copayments, Coinsurance, and Deductibles that You would pay if the Provider or facility was in-network). Your health plan will pay out-of-network Providers a nd facilities directly. Your health plan generally must: Cover emergency services without requiring Y ou to get approval for services in advance (preauthorization). Cover emergency services by out-of-network Providers. Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Utah Base what You owe the Provider or facility (cos t-sharing) on what it would pay an in-network Provider or facility and show that am ount in Your explanation of benefits. Count any amount You pay for emergency services or out-of-network services toward Your Deductible and out-of-pocket limit. If You believe You've been wrongly billed , You may contact www.cms.gov/nosurprises or call the No Surprises Help Desk at 1 (800) 985-3059.

This Summary Plan Description (SPD) describes the terms and benefits of coverage available through Utah State University. This SPD replaces any plan description or SPD previously issued by the Plan Sponsor and makes it void. This SPD is not meant to interpret, extend, or change the provisi ons of the Plan in any way. Benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Plan Sponsor decides, in their sole discretion, that You are entitled to them. The provisions of the Plan may only be determined fully and completely from the actual Plan docum ent, which is available from the Plan Sponsor. Prior to amendments, the Plan Document is this SPD. If the Plan Document and this SPD differ, the Plan Document will prevail. No oral interpretations can change this Plan. This SPD includes separate sections for Medical Benefits and Dental Benefits. While the first portion of each section contains only a summary (the complete benefits, conditions, limitations, and exclusions are described later), it includes some important information that can only be found within that particular portion of the section, such as the percentages paid, Deductibles, Copayments, and Out-of-Pocket Maximum amounts under the Plan. The Plan Sponsor intends the Plan to be permanent, but since future conditions affecting the Plan Sponsor cannot be anticipated or foreseen, the Plan Sponsor reserves the right to amend, modify or terminate the Plan, or any portion thereof, in any manner, at any time, regardless of Your or Your Dependents ' health or treatment status, which may result in the termination of modification of Your coverage and/or the coverage for Your Dependents.

THE NEWBORNS ' AND MOTHERS ' HEALTH PROTECTION ACT Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage may not restrict benefits for any Hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to less than 48 hours follow ing a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section. However, the Plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending Provider, after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. Also, u nder federal law, the Plan or issuer may not set the level of benefits or out -of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48- hour (or 96- hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. In addition, the Plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a Physician or other health care provider obtain preauthorization for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours). However, to use certain Providers or facilities, or to reduce Your out -of-pocket costs, You may be required to obtain preauthorization. Contact the Claims Administrator's Customer Service for additional information on preauthorization.

As of February 17, 2009, the Plan and Employer comply, to the basic extent required by law, with the HIPAA Privacy and Security provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, including but not limited to compliance with individuals ' requests for certain restrictions on disclosure of their PHI or ePHI, increased obligation to account for disclosures of ePHI if maintained in electronic health records, increased access to PHI maintained in electronic format, and required notification of breaches of \"unsecured \" PHI where the unauthorized person who received the PHI might reasonably be able to retain the information. Section A. Notice of PHI Uses and Disclosures Required PHI Uses and Disclosures Upon Your request, the Plan is required to give You access to certain PHI in order to inspect and copy it. Use and disclosure of Your PHI may be required by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate or determine the Plan 's compliance with the privacy regulations. Uses and Disclosures to Carry Out Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations The Plan and its business associates will use PHI without Your consent, authorization or opportunity to agree or object to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations. The Plan also will disclose PHI to the Plan Sponsor for purposes related to treatment, payment and health care operations. The Plan Sponsor has amended its plan documents to protect Your PHI as required by federal law. Treatment is the provision, coordination or management of health care and related services. It also includes but is not limited to consultations and referrals between one or more of Your Providers.

Payment includes but is not limited to actions to make coverage determinations and payment (including billing, claims management, subrogation, plan reimbursement, reviews for medical necessity and appropriateness of care and utilization review and preauthorization). For example, the Plan may tell a doctor whether You are eligible for coverage or what percentage of the bill will be paid by the Plan. Health care operations include but are not limited to quality assessment and improvement, reviewing competence or qualifications of health care professionals, underwriting, premium rating and other insurance activities relating to creating or renewing insurance or health maintenance organization contracts. It also includes disease management, case management, conducting or arranging for medical review, legal services and auditing functions including fraud and abuse compliance programs, business planning and development, business management and general administrative activities.

Psychotherapy notes are separately filed notes about Your conversations with Your mental health professional during a counseling session. They do not include summary i nformation about Your mental health treatment. The Plan may use and disclose such notes when needed by the Plan to defend against litigation filed by You. Uses and Disclosures that Require that You be Given an Opportunity to Agree or Disagree Prior to the Use or Release Disclosure of Your PHI to family members, other relatives and Your close personal friends is allowed if: the information is directly relevant to the family or friend' s involvement with Your care or payment for that care; and You have either agreed to the disclosure or have been given an opportunity to object and have not objected. Uses and Disclosures for which Consent, Authorization or Opportunity to Object is Not Required Use and disclosure of Your PHI is allowed without Your consent , authorization or request under the following circumstances: When required by law. When permitted for purposes of public health activities, including when necessary to report product defects, to permit product recalls and to conduct post -marketing surveil lance. PHI may also be used or disclosed if You have been exposed to a communicable disease or are at risk of spreading a disease or condition, if authorized by law. When authorized by law to report information about abuse, neglect or domestic violence to public authorities if there exists a reasonable belief that You may be a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. In such case, the Plan will promptly inform You that such a disclosure has been or will be made unless that notice would cause a risk of serious harm. For the purpose of reporting child abuse or neglect, it is not necessary to inform the minor that such a disclosure has been or will be made. Disclosure may generally be made to the minor 's parents or other representatives although there may be circumstances under federal or state law when the parents or other representatives may not be given access to the minor 's PHI. The Plan may disclose Your PHI to a public health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law. This incl udes uses or disclosures in civil, administrative or criminal investigations; inspections; licensures or disciplinary actions (for example, to investigate complaints against Providers); and other activities necessary for appropriate oversight of government benefit programs (for example, to investigate Medicare or Medicaid fraud). The Plan may disclose Your PHI when required for judicial or administrative proceedings. For example, Your PHI may be disclosed in response to a subpoena or discovery request prov ided certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is that satisfactory assurances must be given to the Plan that the requesting party has made a good faith attempt to provide written notice to You, and the notice provided sufficient information about the proceeding to permit You to raise an objection and no objections were raised or were resolved in favor of disclosure by the court or tribunal. When required for law enforcement purposes (for example, to report certain types of wounds). For law enfor cement purposes, including for the purpose of identifying or locating a suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing person. Also, when disclosing information about an individual who is or is suspected to be a victim of a crime but only if the individual agrees to the disclosure or the covered entity is unable to obtain the individual 's agreement because of emergency circumstances. Furthermore, the law enforcement official must represent that the information is not intended to be used against the indivi dual, the immediate law enforcement activity would be materially and adversely affected by waiting to obtain the individual 's agreement and disclosure is in the best interest of the individual as determined by the exercise of the Plan' s best judgment. When required to be given to a coroner or medical examiner for the purpose of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death or other duties as authorized by law. Also, disclosure is 4 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 permitted to funeral directors, consistent with applicable law, as necessary to carry out their duties with respect to the decedent. The Plan may use or disclose PHI for research, subject to conditions. When consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduct if the Plan, in good faith, believes the use or disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public and the disclosure is to a person reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the target of the threat. When authorized by and to the extent necessary to comply with workers' compensation or other similar programs established by law.

A Health Intervention may be medically indicated or otherwise be Medically Necessary, yet not be a Covered Service. See the Definitions Section for descriptions of Medically Necessar y and the types of Providers who deliver Covered Services. If benefits change while You are in the Hospital (or any other facility as an inpatient), coverage will be provided based upon the benefit in effect when the stay began.

Intravenous medications are otherwise covered under the applicable Medical Benefits Section(s). You can find a list of Prescription Medications eligible for dispensing through a professional Provider's office on the Claims Administrator's Web site. PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS CLAIMS AND ADMINISTRATION Preauthorization Some Prescription Medications may require preauthorization before they are dispensed. The Claims Administrator notifies participating Providers, including Pharmacies, which Prescription Medications require preauthorization. Prescription Medications that r equire preauthorization must have medical information provided by the prescribing Provider to determine Medical Necessity. Prescribed Medications that require preauthorization will not be covered until they are preauthorized.

Drug List Changes Any removal of a Prescription Medication from the Drug List will be posted on the Claims Administrator's Web site 30 days prior to the effective date of that change unless the removal is done on an emergency basis or if an equivalent Generic Medication becomes available without prior notice. In the case of an emergency removal, the change will be posted as soon as possible. If You are taking a Prescription Medication while it is removed from the Drug List and its removal was not due to the Prescription Medication being removed from the market, becoming available over -the-counter or issuance of a black box warning by the Federal Drug Administration, the Plan will continue to cover Your Prescription Medication for the time period required to use the drug list exception process to request continuation of coverage for the removed Prescription Medication and receive a decision through that process, unless patient safety requires an expedited replacement.

However, a Prescription Medication not on the Drug List may be covered in certain circumstances. \"Non -Drug List\" means those self -administered Prescription Medications not listed on the Drug List. To request coverage for a Prescription Medication not on the Drug List, You or Your Provider will need to request preauthorization so that the Claims Administrator can determine that a Prescription Medication not on the Drug List is Medically Necessary.

This responsibility includes but is not limited to reviews for medical necessity and appropriateness of care (utilization review) and preauthorization. This means that if You or Your Dependents receive services that are determined not to be medically necessary, or were not preauthorized, claims may be denied and You may be responsible to pay the Provider for these services outside of Your insurance coverage. Medically Necessary or Medical Necessi ty means health care services or products that a prudent health care professional would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an Illness or Injury or its symptoms in a manner that is: in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice in the United States; clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration; not primarily for the convenience of the patient, Physician, or other health care Provider; and covered under the Plan. When a medical question- of-fact exists, Medical Necessity shall include the most appropriate available supply or level of service for the individual in question, considering potential benefits and harms to the individual, and that is known to be effective. For Health Interventions not yet in widespread use, the effectiveness shall be based on Scientific Evidence. For established Health Interventions, the effectiveness shall be based on first Scientific Evidence; then professional standards; and then expert opinion. To ensure medical necessity the Claims Administrator has developed medical policy in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice in the United States. The medical policy manual is available on the Claims Administrator Web site at http://blue.regence.com/trgmedpol/ . 119 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Claims Administration This section explains administration of benefits and claims, including situations that may arise when Your health care expenses are the responsibility of a source other than the Plan. SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS AND REIMBURSEMENT When claims are submitted and payment is due, the Claims Administrator decides whether to pay You, the Provider or You and the Provider jointly. The Plan may make benefit payments for a child covered by a legal qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) directly to the custodial parent or legal guardian of such child. In-Network Provider or In-Network Dentist Claims and Reimbursement You must present Your identification card to an In- Network Provider and furnish any additional information requested. The Provider or Dentist will sub mit the necessary forms and information to the Claims Administrator for processing Your claim. The Plan will pay an In- Network Provider or Dentist directly for Covered Services. These Providers or Dentists may require You to pay any Deductible, Copayment and/or Coinsurance at the time You receive care or treatment. In- Network Providers and Dentists have agreed not to bill You for balances beyond any Deductible, Copayment and/or Coinsurance and to accept the Allowed Amount as payment in full for Covered Services. Out-of-Network Provider or Out -of-Network Dentist Claims and Reimbursement In order for the Claims Administrator to pay for Covered Services, You, the Out -of-Network Provider or Out-of-Network Dentist must first send the Claims Administrator a clai m. In most cases, the Plan may pay You directly for Covered Services provided by an Out -of-Network Provider , however the Plan may pay the Dentist directly for Covered Services provided by an Out -of-Network Dentist . Be sure the claim is complete and includes the following information: an itemized description of the services given and the charges for them; the date treatment was given; the diagnosis; the patient's name; Your identification number; and the group number. If the treatment is for an Injury, inc lude a statement explaining the date, time, place and circumstances of the Injury when You send the Claims Administrator the claim. Out-of-Network Providers and Out -of-Network Dentists have not agreed to accept the Allowed Amount as payment in full for Covered Services. You are responsible for paying any difference between the amount billed by the Out -of-Network Provider or Out -of-Network Dentist and the Allowed Amount in addition to any amount You must pay due to any Deductible, Copayment and/or Coinsurance. For Out -of-Network Providers and Out -of-Network Dentists , the Allowed Amount may be based upon the billed charges for some services, as determined by the Claims Administrator or as otherwise required by law . Timely Filing of Claims Written proof of loss (submission of a claim) must be received within one year after the date of service. Claims that are not filed in a timely manner will be denied, unless You can reasonably demonstrat e that the claim could not have been filed in a timely manner. Benefits or coverage will not be invalidated nor reduced if it can be shown that it was not reasonably possible to file the claim and that the claim was submitted as soon as reasonably possibl e. You may Appeal the denial in accordance with the Appeal process to demonstrate that the claim could not have been filed in a timely manner. If You were covered by more than one health plan on the date of service, see the text of Primary Health Plan in the Coordination of Benefits provision for an exception to this timely filing rule. 120 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Claim Determinations Within 30 days of the Claims Administrator's receipt of a claim, the Claims Administrator will notify You of their action. However, this 30- day period may be extended by an additional 15 days due to lack of information or extenuating circumstances. The Claims Administrator will notify You of the extension within the initial 30- day period and provide an explanation of why the extension is necessary. If the Claims Administrator requires additional information to process the claim, the Claims Administrator must allow You at least 45 days to provide it to them. If the Claims Administrator does not receive the requested information within the time allowed, the Claims Administrator will deny the claim. OUT -OF-AREA SERVICES The Claims Administrator has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"Inter -Plan Arrangements \". These Inter -Plan Arrangement s work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Whenever You access health care services outside the geographic area the Claims Administrator serves, the claim for those services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter- Plan Arrangements are described below. When Your network is ValueCare: When You receive care outside the Claims Administrator's service area, You may receive it from one of three kinds of Providers. Providers that contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\") as a preferred Provider are paid at the In -Network Provider level and will not bill You for balances beyond any Deductible, Copayment and/or Coinsurance for Covered Services. Providers that contract with the Host Blue as a participating Provider are paid at the Out -of-Network Provider level and may not bill You for balances beyond any Deductible, Copayment and/or Coinsurance. Some Providers (\"Out -of-Network Providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. The SPD further explains below how the Plan pays these different kinds of Providers. When Your network is Participating: When You receive care outside the Claims Administrator's service area, You will receive it from one of two kinds of Providers. Most Providers (\"In -Network Providers\") contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"Out -of-Network Providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. The SPD further explains below how the Plan pays these different kinds of Providers. BlueCard Program In the BlueCard Program, when You access Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, the Claims Administrator will remain responsible for doing what the Claims Administrator agreed to in the Agreement. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating Providers. Whenever You receive Covered Services outside the Claims Administrator's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount You pay for Covered Services is calculated based on the lower of: the billed covered charges for Your Covered Services; or the negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to the Claims Administrator. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to Your health care Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with Your health care Provider or Provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health care Providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price the Claims Administrator has used for Your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. 121 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Value-Based Programs If You receive Covered Services from a Value- Based Program inside a Host Blue's service area, You will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk -sharing, and/ or Care Coordination Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to the Claims Administrator through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. The following definitions apply: Value- Based Program: An outcomes -based payment arrangement and/or a coordinated care model facilitated with one or more local Providers that is evaluated against cost and quality metrics/factors and is reflected in Provider payment. Provider Incentive: An additional amount of compensation paid to a health care Provider by a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan, based on the Provider's compliance with agreed -upon procedural and/or outcome measures for a particular group of covered persons. Care Coordination Fee: A fixed amount paid by a Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee to Providers periodically for Care Coordination in a Value -Based Program. Inter -Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal law or state law may require a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to insur ed accounts . If applicable, the Claims Administrator will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to You. Out-of-Network Providers Outside the Claims Administrator's Service Area Your Liability Calculation . When Covered Services are provided outside of the Claims Administrator's service area, by Out -of-Network Providers, the amount You pay for such services will normally be based on either the Host Blue's Out -of-Network Provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state law. In these situations, You may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the Out -of-Network Provider bills and the payment the Claims Administrator will make for the Covered Service s as set forth in this paragraph. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern payments for Out -of-Network emergency services. Exceptions. In certain situations, the Claims Administrator may use other payment methods, such as billed covered charges, the payment the Claims Administrator would make if the health care services had been obtained within the Claims Administrator's service area, or a special negotiated payment to determine the amount the Claims Administrator will pay for services provided by Out-of- Network Providers. In these situations, You may be liable for the difference between the amount that the Out -of-Network Provider bills and the payment the Claims Administrator will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD GLOBAL\u00ae CORE If You are outside the United States (hereinafter \"BlueCard service area\"), You may be able to take advantage of Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core when accessing Covered Services. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core is not served by a Host Blue. As such, when You receive care from Providers outside the BlueCard service area, You will typically have to pay the Providers and submit the claims Yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. If You need medical assistance services (including locating a doctor or Hospital) outside the BlueCard service area, You should call the service center at 1 (800) 810 -BLUE or call collect at 1 (804) 673- 1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. An assistance coordinator, working with a medical professional, can arrange a Physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary. Inpatient Services In most cases, if You contact the service center for assistance, Hospitals will not require You to pay for covered inpatient services, except for Your applicable Deductible, Coinsurance, etc. In such cases, the Hospital will submit Your claims to the serv ice center to begin claims processing. However, if You paid in full at the time of services, You must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for Covered Services. 122 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Outpatient Services Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient Providers located outside the BlueCard service area will typically require You to pay in full at the time of services. You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered Services. Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim When You pay for Covered Servi ces outside the BlueCard service area, You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, You should complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core claim form and send the claim form with the Provider's itemized bil l(s) to the service center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. Following the instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of Your claim. The claim form is available from the service center or online at www.bcb sglobalcore.com . If You need assistance with Your claim submission, You should call the service center at 1 (800) 810 -BLUE or call collect at 1 (804) 673- 1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CLAIMS RECOVERY If the Plan pays a benefit to which You or Y our beneficiaries were not entitled, or if the Plan pays a person who is not eligible for benefits at all, the Plan has the right to recover the payment from the person the Plan paid or anyone else who benefited from it, including a Provider of services. The Plan's right to recovery for an erroneous payment made on the Participant's or any of their beneficiary's behalf includes the right to deduct the mistakenly paid amount from future benefits the Plan would provide the Participant or any of their beneficiaries under this Plan. The Claims Administrator regularly works to identify and recover claims payments that should not have been made (for example, claims that are the responsibility of another, duplicates, errors, fraudulent claims, etc.). The Plan will be credited all amounts recovered. This Claims Recovery provision in no way reduces the Plan's right to reimbursement or subrogation. Refer to the Subrogation and Right of Recovery provision for additional information. RIGHT OF REIMBURSEMENT AND SUBROGATION RECOVERY The provisions of this section apply to all current or former Claimants who incur claims and are or have been covered by the Plan. No adult Claimant hereunder, may assign any rights that they may have to recover expenses from any tort feasor or other person or entity to any minor child or children of said adult Claimant without the prior express written consent of the Plan. These provisions will apply to all claims arising from Your Illness or Injury, including, but not limited to, wro ngful death, survival or survivorship claims brought on Your, Your estate's or Your heirs' behalf, regardless of whether medical expenses were or could be claimed. \"You\" or \"Your\" includes anyone on whose behalf the Plan pays benefits. The Plan's Right of Subrogation or reimbursement, as set forth below, extend to all insurance coverage available to You due to an Illness, Injury or condition for which the Plan has paid medical claims (including, but not limited to, liability coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, personal umbrella coverage, medical payments coverage, workers compensation coverage, no fault automobile coverage or any first party insurance coverage). This Plan is always secondary to automobile no- fault coverage , personal injury protection coverage, or medical payments coverage, excess coverage or similar contract or insurance. No disbursement of any settlement proceeds or other recovery funds from any insurance coverage or other source will be made until this Pl an's subrogation and reimbursement interest are fully satisfied. Subrogation The \"Right of Subrogation\" means the Plan is entitled to pursue any claims that You may have in order to recover the benefits paid by the Plan. Immediately upon paying or providi ng any benefit under the Plan, the Plan shall be subrogated to (stand in the place of) all of Your rights of recovery with respect to any claim or potential claim against any party, due to an Illness, Injury or condition to the full extent of benefits provided or to be provided by the Plan. The Plan may assert a claim or file suit in Your name and take 123 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 appropriate action to assert its subrogation claim, with or without Your consent. The Plan is not required to pay You part of any recovery it may obtain, even if it files suit in Your name. Reimbursement If You receive any payment as a result of an Illness, Injury or condition, You agree to reimburse the Plan first from such payment for all amounts the Plan has paid and will pay as a result of that Illness, Injury or condition, up to and including the full amount of Your recovery. Benefit payments made under the Plan are conditioned upon Your agreement to reimburse the Plan in full from any recovery You receive for Your Illness, Injury or condition. Constructive Trust By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to You or made on Your behalf to any Provider) You agree that if You receive any payment as a result of an Illness, Injury or condition, You will serve as a constructive trustee over those funds. Failure to hold such funds in trust will be deemed a breach of Your fiduciary duty to the Plan. No disbursement of any settlement proceeds or other recovery funds from any insurance coverage or other source will be made until this Plan's subrogation and reimbursement interest are fully satisfied. Lien Rights Further, the Plan will automatically have a lien to the extent of benefits paid by the Plan for the treatment of the Illness, Injury or condition upon any recovery whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise, related to treatment for any Illness, Injury or condition for which the Plan paid benefits. The lien may be enforced against any party who possesses funds or proceeds representing the amount of benefits paid by the Plan includ ing, but not limited to, You, Your representative or agent, and/or any other source that possessed or will possess funds representing the amount of benefits paid by the Plan. Assignment In order to secure the Plan's recovery rights, You agree to assign to the Plan any benefits or claims or rights of recovery You have in any automobile policy or other coverage, to the full extent of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement claims. This assignment allows the Plan to pursue any claim You may have, whether or not You choose to pursue the claim. First -Priority Claim By accepting benefits from the Plan, You acknowledge that the Plan's recovery rights are a first priority claim and are to be repaid to the Plan before You receive any recovery for Your damages. The Plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement on a first -dollar basis from any payments, even if such payment to the Plan will result in a recovery which is insuf ficient to make You whole or to compensate You in part or in whole for the damages sustained. The Plan is not required to participate in or pay Your court costs or attorney fees to any attorney You hire to pursue Your damage claim. Applicability to All Settlements and Judgments The terms of this entire Subrogation and Right of Recovery provision shall apply and the Plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted and regardless of whether the settlement or judgm ent identifies the benefits the Plan provided or purports to allocate any portion of such settlement or judgment to payment of expenses other than expenses provided by the Plan. The Plan is entitled to recover from any and all settlements or judgments, ev en those designated as pain and suffering, non -economic damages and/or general damages only. The Plan's claim will not be reduced due to Your own negligence. Cooperation You agree to cooperate fully with the Plan's efforts to recover benefits paid. It is Your duty to notify the Plan within 30 days of the date when any notice is given to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of Your intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to Your Illness, Injury or condition. You and Your agents agree to provide the Plan or its representatives notice of any recovery You or Your agents obtain prior to receipt of such recovery funds or within five days if no notice was given prior to receipt of recovery funds. Further, You and Your agents agree to provide notice prior to any disbursement of settlement or any other recovery funds obtained. 124 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 You and Your agents shall provide all information requested by the Plan, the Claims Administrator or its representative including, but not limited to, completing and submitting any applications or other forms or statements as the Plan may reasonably request and all documents related to or filed in personal injury litigation. Failure to provide this information, failure to as sist the Plan in pursuit of its subrogation rights or failure to reimburse the Plan from any settlement or recovery You receive may result in the denial of any future benefit payments or claim until the Plan is reimbursed in full, termination of Your healt h benefits or the institution of court proceedings against You. You shall do nothing to prejudice the Plan's subrogation or recovery interest or prejudice the Plan's ability to enforce the terms of this Plan provision. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the Plan or disbursement of any settlement proceeds or other recovery prior to fully satisfying the Plan's subrogation and reim bursement interest. You acknowledge that the Plan has the right to conduct an investigation regarding the Illness, Injury or condition to identify potential sources of recovery. The Plan reserves the right to notify all parties and their agents of its lie n. Agents include, but are not limited to, insurance companies and attorneys. Workers' Compensation If the entity providing workers' compensation coverage denies Your claim and You have filed an appeal, benefits will be advanced for Covered Services provi ded the Plan is notified of such appeal by the Labor Commission. Future Medical Expenses Benefits for otherwise Covered Services may be excluded when You have received a recovery from another source relating to an Illness or Injury for which the Plan would normally provide benefits. However, the amount of any Covered Services excluded in this provision will not exceed the amount of Your recovery. Interpretation In the event that any claim is made that any part of this Subrogation and Right of Recovery prov ision is ambiguous or questions arise concerning the meaning or intent of any of its terms, the Claims Administrator shall have the sole authority to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of this provision. Jurisdiction By accepting benefits fr om the Plan, You agree that any court proceeding with respect to this provision may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction as the Plan may elect. By accepting such benefits, You hereby submit to each such jurisdiction, waiving whatever rights m ay correspond by reason of Your present or future domicile. By accepting such benefits, You also agree to pay all attorneys' fees the Plan incurs in successful attempts to recover amounts the Plan is entitled to per this provision. COORDINATION OF BENEFIT S If You are covered by any Other Plan (as defined below), the benefits in this SPD and those of the Other Plan will be coordinated in accordance with the provisions of this section. Coordination of Benefits with a Health Savings Account (HSA) Plan This high deductible health Plan was designed for use in conjunction with an HSA, but can be maintained without an HSA. Laws strictly limit the types of other coverages that an HSA participant may carry in addition to their high deductible health Plan. The be nefits of maintaining an HSA are jeopardized if impermissible types of other coverages are maintained. Benefits will be coordinated according to this Coordination of Benefits provision, regardless of whether other coverage is permissible per HSA law or not. It is Your responsibility to ensure that You do not maintain other coverage that might jeopardize any HSA tax benefit that You plan to claim. 125 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Definitions The following are definitions that apply to this Coordination of Benefits provision: Allowable Expense means, with regard to services that are covered in full or part by this Plan or any Other Plan(s) covering You, the amount on which that Plan would base its benefit payment for a service, including Coinsurance or Copayments and without reduction for any applicable Deductible, except that the following are examples of expenses that are not an Allowable Expense: An expense or portion of an expense not covered by any of Your involved Plans. Any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging You. The difference between the cost of a private Hospital room and the cost of a semiprivate Hospital room, unless one of Your involved Plans provides coverage for private Hospital rooms. Any amount by which a Primary Plan's benefits were reduced because You did not comply with that Plan's provisions regarding second surgical opinion or preauthorization. If You are covered by two or more Plans that: 1) compute benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement or other similar reimbursement methodology, any amount charged by the Provider in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specified benefit; or 2) that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, any amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees. If You are covered by a Plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees, relative value schedule reimbursement, or other similar reimbursement methodology and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement shall be the Allowable Expense for all Plans. However, if the Provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the Provider's contract permits, that negotiated fee or payment shall be the Allowable Expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service provided will be considered both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid. Birthday means only the day and month of birth, regardless of the year. Custodial Parent means the legal Custodial Parent or the physical Custodial Parent as awarded by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, Custodial Parent means the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the Calendar Year without regard to any temporary visitation. Group- T ype Coverage is a coverage that is not available to the general public and can be obtained and maintained only because of membership in or connection with a particular organization or group, including blanket coverage. Group -Type Coverage does not include an individually underwritten and issued guaranteed renewable coverage, even if the coverage is purchased through payroll deduction at a premium savings to You (since You would have the right to maintain or renew the coverage independently of continued employment with the employer). Other Pl an means any of the following with which this coverage coordinates benefits: individual and group accident and health insurance and subscriber contracts; uninsured arrangements of group or Group-Type Coverage; Group- Type Coverage; coverage through closed panel Plans (a Plan that provides coverage primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan and that excludes benefits for services provided by other Providers, except in the cases of emergency or referral by a panel member); medical care components of long- term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; and Medicare and other governmental coverages, as permitted by law. 126 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Other Plan does not include: hospital indemnity coverage benefits or other fixed indemnity coverage; accide nt only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; limited benefit health coverage; school accident -type coverages that cover students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a 24 -hour basis or on a \"to and from school\" basis; benefits provided in long- term care insurance policies for non -medical services (for example, personal care, adult day care, homemaker services, assistance with activities of daily living, respite care and Custodial Care) or for coverages that pay a fixed daily benefit without regard to expenses incurred or the receipt of services; Medicare supplement coverage; a Medicaid state plan; or a governmental Plan that, by law, provides benefits that are in excess to those of private insurance or other nongovernmental coverage. Primary Plan means the Plan that must determine its benefits for Your health care before the benefits of another Plan and without taking the existence of that Other Plan into consideration. (This is also referred to as the Plan being \" primary \" to another Plan.) There may be more than one Primary Plan. A Plan is a Primary Plan with regard to another Plan in any of the following circumstances: the Plan has no order of benefit determination provision or its order of benefit determination provision differs from the order of benefit determination provision included herein; or both Plans use the order of benefit determination provision included herein and by that provision the Plan determines its benefits first. Secondary Plan means a Plan that is not a Primary Plan. Year means Calendar Year (January 1 through December 31). Order of Benefit Determination The order of benefit determination is identified by using the first of the following rules that apply: Non- dependent or dependent coverage: A Plan that covers You other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder retiree, or subscriber, will be primary to a Plan for which You are covered as a dependent. Child covered under more than one Plan: Plans that cover You as a child shall determine the order of benefits as follows: When Your parents are married or living together (whether or not they have ever been married), the Plan of the parent whose Birthday falls earlier in the Year is the Primary Plan. If both parents have the same Birthday, the Plan that has covered a parent longer is the Primary Plan. When Your parents are divorced or separated or are not living together (if they have never been married) and a court decree states that one of Your parents is responsible for Your health care expenses or health care coverage, the Plan of that parent is primary to the Plan of Your other parent. If the parent with that responsibility has no health care coverage for Your health care expenses, but that parent's spouse does, the Plan of the spouse shall be primary to the Plan of Your other parent. If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for Your health care expenses or health care coverage, or if a court decree states that the parents have joint custody of You, without specifying that one of the parents is responsible for Your health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of the first bullet above (based on parental Birthdays) shall determine the order of benefits. 127 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for Your health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits is as follows: - The Plan of Your Custodial Parent shall be primary to the Plan of Your Custodial Parent's spouse; - The Plan of Your Custodial Parent's spouse shall be primary to the Plan of Your noncustodial parent; and - The Plan of Your noncustodial parent shall be primary to the Plan of Your noncustodial parent's spouse. If You are covered by more than one Plan and one or more of the Plans provides You coverage through individuals who are not Your parents (for example, a guardian or step- parent), the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicable using the provisions under the first or second bullets above, as if those individuals were Your parents. Active, retired, or laid -off employees: A Plan that covers You as an active employee (that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired) or as a dependent of an active employee, is primary to a Plan by which You ar e covered as a laid off or retired employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule will not apply. COBRA or state continuation coverage: A Plan that covers You as an empl oyee, member, subscriber or retiree or as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree, is primary to a Plan by which You are covered pursuant to COBRA or a right of continuation by state or other federal law. If the other Plan does not have this rule and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule will not apply. Longer/shorter length of coverage: When none of the paragraphs above establishes an order of benefit determination, the benefits of the Plan that has covered You for the longer period of time will be determined before the benefits of the Plan that has covered You for the shorter period of time. To determine the length of time You have been covered by a Plan, two successive Plans will be treated as one if You were eligible by the second Plan within 24 hours after the first Plan ended. The start of a new Plan does not include: a change in the amount or scope of a Plan's benefits; a change in the entity that pays, provides or administers the Plan's benef its; or a change from one type of Plan to another (such as from a single -employer Plan to a multiple employer Plan). Your length of time covered by a Plan is measured from Your first date of coverage with that Plan. If that date is not readily available f or a group Plan, the date You first became a member of the group will be used as the date from which to determine the length of time coverage with the present Plan has been in force. If an order of benefit determination is not identified by the preceding r ules, the Plans shall share equally in the Allowable Expenses. Each of the Plans by which You are covered, and each of the benefits within the Plan, will be considered separately in administering this Coordination of Benefits provision. Primary Health Plan Benefits When, in accordance with the order of benefit determination, this coverage is the Primary Plan, the Plan will pay the benefits of this coverage as if no other Plan exists. This Plan is considered to be Primary in relation to any pediatric dental benefits of another Plan. Despite the provisions of timely filing of claims, where this Plan is the Primary Plan, benefits will not be denied by this Plan on the ground that a claim was not timely submitted if the claim was timely submitted to one or more Secondar y Plans and was submitted to the Claims Administrator within 36 months of the date of service. 128 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Secondary Health Plan Benefits If, in accordance with the order of benefit determination, one or more other Plans are primary to this Plan, the benefits of this Plan will be calculated as follows: The Claims Administrator will calculate the benefits that the Plan would have paid for a service if this coverage were the Primary Plan. That calculated amount will be applied to any Allowable Expense for that service t hat is unpaid by the Primary Plan. This Plan will: reduce payment so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense for that claim; and credit to this Plan's Deductible (if applicable), any amounts that would have been credited for the service if this Plan were the Primary Plan. Nothing contained in this Coordination of Benefits provision requires this Plan to pay for all or part of any service that is not covered by this Plan. Further, in no event will this Coordination of Benefits provision operate to increase this Plan's payment over what would have been paid in the absence of this Coordination of Benefits provision. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply Coordination of Benefits provisions. The Claims Administrator has the right to decide which facts they need. The Claims Administrator may get needed facts from, or give them to, any other organization or person as permitted by law, and need not tell or get the consent of any person to do this. You will promptly furnish to the Claims Administrator any information necessary or appropriate to administer this Coordination of Benef its provision. Receipt of such information by the Claims Administrator will be a condition precedent to this Plan's obligation to provide benefits in this SPD. Right of Recovery If the Plan provides benefits to or on behalf of You in excess of the amount that would have been payable in this Plan by reason of Your coverage with any other Plan(s), the Claims Administrator will be entitled to the excess as follows: From You, if payment was made to You. Recovery would be by reversal of payments and be limited to a period within 24 months of the overpayment, unless reversal is necessitated by Your fraudulent act(s), fraudulent statement(s), or material misrepresentations. This Plan will be entitled to recover the amount of such excess by the reversal of payment from You and You agree to reimburse this Plan on demand for any and all such amounts. If a third -party collection agency or attorney is used to collect the overpayment, You agree to pay collection fees incurred, including, but not limited to, any court costs and attorney fees. If You do not pay, future benefits may be withheld to offset the amount owing to it. The Claims Administrator is responsible for making proper adjustments between insurers and Providers. From Providers, if payment was made to them. Recovery would be by reversal of payments and be limited to a period within 24 months of the overpayment, unless reversal is necessitated by Your fraudulent act(s), fraudulent statement(s), or material misrepresentation(s). The Claims Administrator is responsible for making proper adjustments between insurers and Providers. From the other Plan or an insurer. From other organizations. A Secondary Plan that provides benefits in the form of services may recover the reasonable cash value of the services fr om the Primary Plan to the extent that benefits for the services are covered by the Primary Plan and have not already been paid or provided by it. DUAL EMPLOYED COORDINATION OF BENEFITS Policy Holder Determination When You and Your spouse or Domestic Partner are both employed at Utah State University in benefit eligible positions and elect to cover themselves and eligible family members with medical and/or dental coverage, they have the option of enrolling in an enhanced \"dual employed\" benefi t package as described 129 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 below. When electing the dual employed benefit package, the individual assigned to the lowest salary tier, at the beginning of the Plan Year or at the effective date of coverage, will be enrolled as the insurance policy holder and t he spouse/children or partner/children will be enrolled as Dependents. Premium Determination For purposes of determining employee paid premium, the insurance policy holder (couple or family coverage) will be assigned to the individual in the lowest salary tier of the employee paid premium schedule. The other spouse/partner will be assigned to single coverage in their salary tier of the employee paid premium schedule. If one spouse/partner is working on a part -time basis (eligible for benefits), they will b e assigned a single, part-time coverage premium. The other spouse/partner who is working full -time will be assigned to family or couple coverage based on their salary tier of the employee paid premium schedule. If both You and Your spouse or Domestic Partner are working on a part -time basis (eligible for benefits) the individual in the lowest salary tier will be the policy holder and pay the couple or family coverage premium. If a dual covered employee experiences a salary increase or decrea se during the Plan Year, this will not change the policy holder unless the decrease is due to going part -time. Enhanced Dual Employed Benefits Under this dual employed arrangement, the following enhanced benefits are extended to all enrolled family members: DUAL OPTION MEDICAL Wellness (White) High Premium (Blue) Plan Year Deductible Per Claimant: $375 Per Family: You pay $15 per visit You pay $15 per visit Emergency Room Copayment You pay $125 per visit You pay $125 per visit Prescription Drugs Copayment/Coinsurance Generic: You pay You pay 10% Self-Administrable Cancer Chemotherapy Medications: 10% up to $75 for Preferred Generic, Generic, and Preferred Brand -Name medications; 15% up to $150 for Brand pay 10% Self-Administrable Cancer Chemotherapy Medications: 10% up to $75 for Preferred Generic, Generic, and Preferred Brand -Name medications; 15% up to $150 for Brand- Name medications No applicable Deducti ble, Copayment and/or Coinsurance when prescriptions are filled at a Participating Pharmacy for specific strengths or quantities of medications that are specifically designated as preventive medications (including, but not limited to, aspirin, fluoride, ir on and medications for tobacco use cessation) or for immunizations.

Loss of Dual Employed Benefits If a spouse or Domestic Partner covered under the \"dual employed\" benefit package loses their benefit eligibility, the employee and any covered Dependents remaining on the Plan must be moved to one of the standard, non -dual plan options. The spouse or Domestic Partner losing coverage may choose coverage as a Dependent of the remaining eligible employee, or they may elect COBRA coverage according to the continuation of coverage provisions in this SPD. 131 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Appeal Process If You or Your Representative (any Representative author ized by You) has a concern regarding a claim denial or other action by the Claims Administrator under the Plan and wishes to have it reviewed, You or Your Representative may Appeal. There are two levels of Appeal, as well as additional voluntary Appeal levels You or Your Representative may pursue. Certain matters requiring quicker consideration may qualify for a level of expedited Appeal and are described separately later in this section. FILING APPEALS Appeals can be initiated through either written or v erbal request. A written request can be made by sending it to the Claims Administrator at: Attn: ASO Appeals and Grievances , 9115 or facsimile 1 (877) 663 -7526. Verbal requests can be made by calling the Claims Administrator's Customer Service.

You, or Your Representative on Your behalf, will be given a reasonable opportunity to provide written materials. If You don't Appeal within this ti me period, You will not be able to continue to pursue the Appeal process and may jeopardize Your ability to pursue the matter in any forum. If You or Your treating Provider determines that Your health could be jeopardized by waiting for a decision from the regular Appeal process, You or Your treating Provider may specifically request an expedited Appeal. See Expedited Appeals later in this section for more information. First -Level Appeals First-level Appeals are reviewed by a Claims Administrator employee or employees who were not involved in the initial decision that You are Appealing. In Appeals that involve issues requiring medical judgment, the decision is made by the Claims Administrator's staff of health care professionals. For Post - Service Appeals, a written notice of the decision will be sent within 30 days of receipt of the Appeal. For Appeals involving a Pre- Service preauthorization of a procedure, the Claims Administrator will send a written notice of the decision within 15 days of receipt of the Appeal. Second-Level Appeals Second- level Appeals are reviewed by a Claims Administrator employee or employees who were not involved in, or subordinate to anyone involved in, the initial or the first -level decision. For Post -Service Appeals, a written notice of the decision will be sent within 30 days of receipt of the Appeal. For Appeals involving a Pre- Service preauthorization of a procedure, the Claims Administrator will send a written notice of the decision within 15 days of receipt of the Appeal. VOLUNTARY EXTERNAL APPEAL - INDEPENDENT REVIEW ORGANIZATION (IRO) A voluntary Appeal to an IRO is available for issues involving medical judgment (including, but not limited to, those based on the Plan's requirements for Medical Nece ssity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care or effectiveness of a Covered Service; or the determination that a treatment is Investigational), but only after You have exhausted all of the applicable non- voluntary levels of Appeal, or if the C laims Administrator has failed to adhere to all claims and internal Appeal requirements.

Choosing the voluntary external Appeal as the final level to determine an Appeal will be binding in accordance with the IRO's decision and this section, except to the extent other remedies are available under State or Federal law. The v oluntary external Appeal by an IRO is optional and You should know that other forums may be used as the final level of Appeal to resolve a dispute You have under the Plan. 132 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 EXPEDITED APPEALS An expedited Appeal is available if one of the following applies: the application of regular Appeal time frames on a Pre -Service or concurrent care claim either: - c ould jeopardize Your life, health or ability to regain maximum function; or - ac cording to a Provider with knowledge of Your medical condition, would subject You to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the disputed care or treatment. First -Level Expedited Appeal The first -level expedited Appeal request should state the need for a decision on an expedited basis and must include documentation necessary for the Appeal decision. First -level expedited Appeals are reviewed by the Claims Administrator's staff of healthcare professionals who were not involved in, or subordinate to anyone involved in, the initial denial determination. Verbal notice of the decision will be provided to You and Your Representative as soon as possible after the decision, but no later than 72 hours of receipt of the Appeal. A written notification of the decision will be mailed to You within three calendar days of the verbal notice. Voluntary Expedited External Appeal - IRO If You disagree with the decision made in the first -level expedited Appeal and You or Your Representative reasonably believes that preauthorization remains clinically urgent (Pre- Service or concurrent), You m ay request a voluntary expedited external Appeal to an IRO. The criteria for a voluntary expedited external Appeal to an IRO are the same as described above for voluntary external Appeal. The Claims Administrator coordinates voluntary expedited external Appeals, but the decision is made by an IRO at no cost to You. The Claims Administrator will provide the IRO with the Appeal documentation. The IRO will provide verbal notice of their decision to You and Your Representative as soon as possible after the decision, but no later than within 72 hours of receipt of Your request. A written notification of their decision will be mailed to You within 48 hours of the verbal notice. Choosing the voluntary expedited Appeal as the final level to determine an Appeal will be binding in accordance with the IRO's decision and this section, except to the extent other remedies are available under State or Federal law.

Continuation of coverage through COBRA will be offered to any Dependents who were covered under the Plan prior to Your death. If You die as an active employee after completing five or more continuous years of service, Your Enrolled Dependents (spouse and/o r child(ren) ) who were covered immediately preceding Your death may continue receiving the medical and/or dental insurance on the same subsidized basis as an active employee as defined by Utah State University policy. This continuation of coverage will run concurrent with COBRA and will be subsidized by Utah State University , at the level that the University contributes for active employees , for a maximum of 36 months. Coverage may extend beyond 36 months if the spouse or child(ren) pay the full premium. The following termination provisions will apply to this continuation coverage. If the enrolled surviving spouse reaches Normal Medicare Eligibility Age before the 36- month maximum time period is exhausted, medical coverage will terminate on the date of Medicare eligibility.

In no event will the employer continue subsidizing the premium once 36- months of continuation coverage is exhausted. At that point, the covered spouse and/or child(ren) will be responsible for paying the full premium until any of the terminat ion events described above occur. Eligible Dependents of Deceased Active Employees - Dual Employed Benefit Package If a spouse or Domestic Partner dies while both individuals work at the University in benefit eligible positions, and are covered under the \"dual employed\" benefit package, the employee remaining on the Plan must elect one of the available standard (non- \"dual employed\") plan options effective the first of the month following one month after the month in which death occurred. For example, if a dual employed employee passes away on February 15th, the surviving spouse must select a standard plan option that will be effective on April 1st. The amount of premium the employee and/or child(ren) will be required to pay will be based on the salary tier of the surviving employee at the time of his/her spouse's death. Eligible Dependents of Deceased Early Retiree If You, as an early retiree of Utah State University die, Your Enrolled Dependents (spouse and/or child(ren) ) who were covered immediately preceding Your death may continue receiving the medical and/or dental insurance on the same subsidized basis as prior to Your death.

If the enrolled surviving spouse reaches Normal Medicare Eligibility Age before the 36- month maximum time period is exhausted, medical coverage will terminate on the date of Medicare eligibility. Dental coverage may be extended beyond Normal Medicare Eligibility Age unt il one of the termination events described below occur. - Termination for enrolled surviving child (ren) will occur on the later of the child(ren) 's loss of eligibility for coverage as a Dependent due to attainment of maximum age (26) or 36 months from the early retiree' s death. - If the enrolled spouse or child (ren) become covered by another group health plan (which does not limit or exclude any preexisting condition the person might have, either because of no applicable preexisting condition or sufficient creditable coverage to eliminate any preexisting condition limitation) during the initial 36- month continuation of coverage or later, the spouse or child(ren) must notify Utah State University within 30 days and coverage under this plan will terminate on the date of eligibility for the other coverage. - If, after the initial 36- months of continuation coverage the enrolled spouse has remarried or remarries, the spouse must notify Utah State University within 30 days and coverage under the plan for the spouse and child(ren) will terminate on the date of the marriage. - At any time, coverage may be terminated by the enrolled spouse or child(ren) by providing written notice to the Plan Sponsor. 137 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 In no event will Utah State University continue subsidizing the premium once 36 -months of continuation coverage is exhausted.

Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) As required by the Federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93) and notwithstanding the above dependency requirement for coverage as a Dependent under this Plan, any child who is under 18 years of age, or who is any age and incapacitated from earning a living and without sufficient means, and who is an alternate recipient under a QMCSO (see N ote below) will be considered as having a right to Dependent coverage under thi s Plan. If a QMCSO requires that You provide health and dental coverage for Your child(ren) and You do not enroll the child(ren), the Plan must enroll the child(ren) upon application from their custodial parent, the state child support agency or Medicaid agency, as long as You are enrolled in the plan, and withhold from Your pay Your share of the cost of such coverage. You may not drop coverage for the child(ren) unless You submit written evidence to the Plan that the child support order is no longer in effect. The Plan may make benefit payments for a Nonparticipating Provider's treatment of a child covered by a QMCSO directly to the child's custodial parent or legal guardian. NOTE: A \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" is a judgment, decree, or order (including an approved settlement agreement) issued by a court of competent jurisdiction which: 1) provides for child support with respect to a participant under a group health plan or provides for health benefit coverage to such a child, is made pursuant to a state domestic relations law, and relates to benefits under such plan; or 2) enforces a law relating to medical child support described in section 1908 of the Social Security Act with respect to a group health plan. To be a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order,\" a medical child support order must clearly specify: 1) Your name and last known mailing address and the name and mailing address of the child for whom health insurance coverage is required; 2) a reasonable description of the type of coverage to be provided by the Plan to the child for whom health insurance coverage is required or the manner in which such type of coverage is to be determined; 3) the period to which such order applies; and 4) each plan to which such order applies. If a child is eligible for group medical insurance benefits at any place of employment as an employee, that child is not eligible for the Plan.

A serious Illness or Injury in the case of a covered service member means an Illness or Injury incurred by the service member in the line of duty while on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render t he service member medically unfit to perform the duties of the service member 's office, grade, rank, or rating. Persons entitled to coverage under this paragraph will not be entitled to any other extension of benefits described in this section for the same situation that entitles them to coverage under this paragraph. Entitlement to FMLA leave does not constitute a qualifying event for the purpose of COBRA continuation. However, a person entitled to COBRA continuation as a result of not returning to activ e employment following FMLA leave may be entitled to COBRA continuation coverage, the duration of which will be calculated from the date the person fails to return from the FMLA leave. Timely payment of the monthly premium must continue to be made through Your Employer. The provisions described here will not be available if this Plan terminates. If You and/or Your Dependents elect not to remain enrolled during the leave, You (and/or Your Dependents) will be eligible to be reenrolled under the Plan on the date You return from the FMLA leave. In order to reenroll after You return from a FMLA leave, You must sign a new application just as if You were a newly eligible employee. In this situation, if You reenroll within the required time, all of the terms and c onditions of the Plan will resume at the time of reenrollment as if there had been no lapse in coverage. You (and/or Your Dependents) will receive credit for any waiting period served prior to the FMLA leave and You will not have to re- serve any probation ary period under this Plan, although You and/or Your Dependents will receive no waiting period credits for the period of noncoverage. The provisions and administration described here are based on the requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 , as amended, and will be governed by the FMLA law and any subsequent amendments and regulations. If any conflicts arise between the provisions described here and FMLA, the 145 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 minimum requirements of FMLA will govern. This leave provision is available only to groups that are required by law to comply. The Plan must keep the Claims Administrator advised regarding the eligibility for coverage of any employee who may be entitled to the benefits extended by the Act. Military Leave of Absence If You take a leave of abs ence for active military duty, Y ou may continue coverage under the Plan as follows: If the leave of absence is 30 calendar days or less, You may continue cove rage through timely payment of Y our contribution of the month premium to the Plan Sponsor; or If the leave of absence is more than 30 calendar days, Y ou may continue coverage by paying the full monthly premium plus 2 percent for up to 24 months to the Plan Sponsor.

You may reenroll in coverage upon Y our return to work (if such return is within the time limits set by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act \"USERRA\" ), without a pre -existing condition waiting period. It is the intent of the Plan to comply with all existing regulations of USERRA. If the Plan differs from the actual regulations of USERRA, the Plan reserves the right to administer the Plan in accordance with the USERRA regulations. Coverage under this provision runs concurrently with coverage continued under COBRA. NOTE: The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 is a federal law addressing the rights of certain employees who return to their previous employers after service in the United States uniformed services under certain conditions. The law also allows such individuals to continue employer plan coverage during their absence for military service for the lesser of 24 months or the period of military service. Sabbatical Leave If You are on an approved paid sabbatical leave from Utah State University and currently insured under the Utah State University Plan, You receive full Plan benefits, including medical and dental insurance, during the sabbatical period. You are still considered an Employee of the Employer.

Please contact Human Resources for details relating to approved unpaid leaves of absence because some USU employee benefits unrelated to this he alth plan may have restrictions . LEAVE OF ABSENCE If You are granted a non -FMLA temporary leave of absence by Your employer, You can continue coverage for up to three months. Payments must be made through the employer in order to maintain coverage during a leave of absence. A leave of absence is a employer -granted period off work made at Your request during which You are still considered to be employed and are carried on the employer's employment records. A leave can be granted for any reason acceptable to Your employer. If You are on leave for an FMLA -qualifying reason, You remain eligible under the Plan only for a period equivalent to FMLA leave and may not also continue coverage with a non- FMLA leave. If You and/or Your Dependents elect not to remain enrolled during the leave of absence, You (and/or Your Dependents ) may reenroll under the Plan only during the next annual open enrollment period. 146 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 COBRA Continuation of Coverage This COBRA Continuation of Coverage Section applies only when the Employer is subject to the continuation of coverage provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, or COBRA. Under certain circumstances called qualifying events , Claimants may have the right to continue coverage beyond the time coverage would ordinarily have ended. The following rights and obligations regarding continuation of coverage are governed by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) as amended. In the event of any conflict between this continuation of coverage provision and COBRA, the minimum requirements of COBRA will govern. This provision will automatically cease to be effective when federal law requiring continuation of eligibility for coverage no longer applies to the Employer. This section does not provide a full description of COBRA and more complete information is available from the Employer. Additionally, there may be other coverage options for You and Your family. When key parts of the health care law take effect, You will be able to buy individual or family coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace in Your state. In the Marketplace, You could be eligible for a new kind of tax credit that will help You pay for this coverage (based upon income criteria). Being eligible for COBRA does not limit Your eligibility for coverage for a tax credit through the Marketplace. Who Is Eligible For Cobra Continuation And How Long It Lasts If Your health coverage terminates due to either of the following quali fying events , You may elect COBRA continuation coverage for a maximum of 18 months following the date that Your coverage normally would have been lost: termination of Your employment for reasons other than gross misconduct; or reduction in Your hours of em ployment , which results in a loss of eligibility for coverage. Your Dependents whose health coverage terminates due to either of these qualifying events may also elect this COBRA Continuation Cover age for a maximum of 18 months. If health coverage for any of Your Dependents terminates due to any of the following qualifying events , that Dependent may elect COBRA Continuation Coverage for a maximum of 36 months following the date their coverage would have normally been lost: Your death; You and Your spouse divorce or legally separate; You and Your Domestic Partner no longer meet requirements outlined in the definition of a Domestic Partner ; You become entitled to Medicare benefits; or Your Enrolled Dependent loses eligibility as a Dependent under the Plan. By electing COBRA continuation coverage, unless You specify to the contrary, You will automatically be maintaining benefits on behalf of Yourself, as well as Your Dependents. If COBRA continuation coverage is not desired for You or any of Your Dependents, each Enrollee (including You) may independently elect such coverage on behalf of him or herself. Any election by Your spouse will automatically continue coverage of Your children, unless specifi ed to the contrary. Social Security Disability: COBRA coverage following a termination of employment/reduction in hours qualifying event can be extended to a maximum of up to 29 total months if You or Your Dependent is determined to have been disabled for purposes of Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act at the time of the initial qualifying event or within the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage. To be eligible for the extension, You or Your Dependent must provide the Plan documentati on of the Social Security disability determination within 60 days of the date it is made and while still within the 18- month continuation period. The disability extension extends to You and Your Dependents, even if only one of You is disabled. Second Qual ifying Events: Enrolled Dependents who enrolled in COBRA coverage as a result of Your termination of employment or reduction in hours, who experience another qualifying event, may extend 147 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 COBRA coverage up to 36 months . You must provide the Employer writt en notice of the second qualifying event within 60 days from the date of the event. Second qualifying events include: Your death; You and Your spou se divorce or legally separate; You and Your Domestic Partner no longer meet requirements out lined in the definition of a Domestic Partner ; You become entitled to Medicare benefits; or Your Enrolled Dependent loses eligibility as a Dependent under the Plan. However in no event will COBRA continuation coverage extend beyond 36 months from the date coverage was first lost due to the termination of employment/reduction in hours qualifying event. You or Your Dependent must provide the Plan notice of the occurrence of one of these qualifying events . If You Become Entitled To M edicare Before Electing COBRA If You become entitled to Medicare before electing COBRA in connection with a termination of employment or reduction in hours qualifying event, You may maintain both Medicare and up to 18 months of COBRA coverage and Your Dependents will be allowed to cont inue their COBRA coverage until the later of: up to 18 months from the date coverage otherwise would be lost due to the termination of employment/reduction in hours, or up to 36 months from the date You became entitled to Medicare. When COBRA Continuation Coverage Ends COBRA continuation under this Plan will end for You and/or Your Dependents as of the last day of the monthly premium payment period in which any of the following occurs: failure to make premium payments necessary to bring premiums current wit hin 45 days of electing COBRA; failure to make the monthly premium payment within 30 days of the Premium Due Date; the date, after election of COBRA, that You and/or Your Dependents become covered under another group health plan (which does not limit or ex clude any Preexisting Condition the person might have, either because of no applicable Preexisting Condition or sufficient creditable coverage to eliminate any Preexisting Condition limitation) or become entitled to Medicare benefits; the date this Plan terminates; or the applicable period of COBRA continuation ends. COBRA Continuation under this Plan will end for You and/or Your Dependents who are covered under the extended coverage due to disability : when there is final determination that You and/or Your Dependents are no longer disabled for the purposes of Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act, as of the later of: - the last day of 18 months of continuation coverage; or - the first day of the month that is more than 30 days following the date of the final deter mination of the nondisability. - This event will terminate the continuation of all Claimants who had qualified to extend by virtue of the Clai mant 's disability and it is You r or Your Dependent 's responsibility to notify the Plan of such a final determination within 30 days of the day it is made. When You Acquire A New Child While You Are On COBRA Children born to You or placed with You for adoption while You are on COBRA may be added to COBRA coverage and have all the rights extended to You and/or Your other Dependents who have elected COBRA. Addition of such children must occur in accordance with the terms of the Who Is Eligible Section in this SPD. 148 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Notification Responsibilities In order to preserve rights under COBRA, Claimants and the Plan mus t meet certain notification, election and payment deadline requirements. Employee Notification Obligation: Under COBRA, You or one of Your Dependents must inform the Plan in writing within 60 days that begins on the later of: The date of the qualifying event (Your divorce or legal separation, or a loss of Dependent status); The date on which there is a Loss of Coverage; or The date on which the qualified Dependent is informed of this notice requirement by receiving this SPD or the General COBRA Notice. Plan Notification Obligation: The Plan is responsible for notifying the COBRA Administrator when coverage terminates due to qualifying events that are the Employee' s termination of employment or reduction in hours, death of the Employee, or the Employee becoming entitled to Medicare benefits due to age or disability. The Plan will notify the COBRA Administrator within 30 calendar days when these events occur. Once the COBRA Administrator is notified of a qualifying event, it will send You and/or Your Dependents information concerning continuation options within 14 days which will include the necessary COBRA continuation election forms. You and/or Your Dependents will have 60 days from the later of the date of the qualifying event or when You and/or Your Dependent receives notice from the Plan in which to make an election. As mentioned above, to be eligible for disability extension, You or Your Dependent must provide the Plan documentation of a Social Security disability deter mination within 60 days of the date it is made and while still within the 18 month COBRA Continuation period following a termination or reduction of hours qualifying event. The determination must reflect that You or Your Dependent was disabled for Social Security purposes at the time of the initial qualifying event or within the first 60 days of COBRA continuation. If a final determination is subsequently made that You or Your Dependent is no longer disabled for Social Security purposes, You or Your Depen dent must provide the Employer notice of that determination within 30 days of the date it is made. If Your Dependents experience any of the below second qualifying events, You must provide a written notice to the Employer within 30 days of the second quali fying event and during the original 18 month COBRA coverage period in order to extend COBRA coverage up to 36 months. Your death; You and Your spouse divorce or legally separate; You and Your Domestic Partner no longer meet requirements outl ined in the definition of a Domestic Partner ; You become entitled to Medicare benefits; or Your Enrolled Dependent loses eligibility as a Dependent under the Plan. However, in no event will COBRA continuation coverage extend beyond 36 months from the date coverage was first lost due to the termination of employment/reduction in hours qualifying event. You or Your Dependent must provide the Plan notice of the occurrence of one of these \"second \" qualifying events . Paying Continuation Premium If Claimants wish to continue coverage, they must pay for it. The premium will reflect the total cost (employer and employee portion) of the group health care coverage and up to a 2 percent administration fee. For those Claimants who receive COBRA Continuation Coverage due to a Social Security disability determination, the premium and administration fees will be 150 percent of the total cost for coverage. Coverage will cease if timely premium payments are not made. Claimants have a maximum of 45 days from the date that the election form is mailed to the Plan to submit the first payment. This first payment must retroactively cover any period of time after the date coverage was terminated. All subsequent payments are due on the first day of the month for which coverage is to be provided or within a 30- day 149 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 grace period thereafter. If, for whatever reason, any qualified Dependent receives any benefits under the Plan during a month for which the payment was not made on time, then the qualified Dependent will be required to reimburse the Plan for benefits received. If the COBRA Administrator receives a check that is missing informa tion or has discrepancies regarding the information on the check ( for example, the numeric dollar amount does not match the written dollar amount), the COBRA Administrator will provide a notice to the qualified Dependent and allow him/her 14 days to send i n a corrected check. If a corrected check is not received within the 14- day time frame, then the occurrence will be treated as non -payment and the qualified Dependent (s) will be termed from the Plan. Note that payment will not be considered made if a check is returned for non- sufficient funds. If COBRA coverage terminates due to non- payment of premium, it cannot be reinstated under any circumstances. If Claimants Do Not Elect COBRA Continuation If Claimants do not elect COBRA continuation coverage, cover age under the Plan will end according to the terms of the Plan and the Plan will not pay claims for services provided on and after the date coverage ends. Importance Of Keeping Information Current It is very important that You keep the Employer informed of the current address of all Claimants who are or may become qualified Dependents . 150 UUIHS BLPBK / UUIHSHSA3 BK / UUIHSEZPBK Utah State University, 10002583, Effective July 1, 2022 Post- Retirement C ontinuation Coverage In addition to those benefits described under the BENEFITS FOR RETIREES section, certain Claimants may qualify for the post -retirement continuation coverages described below. These coverages are conditioned upon election of COBRA and timely payment of any required premiums. These continuation coverages run concurrently with and satisfy all mandated continuation of coverage requirements under federal and state laws, including, but not limited to COBRA; that is, the first 36 months of these post - retirement continuation coverages will exhaust all rights of a continuing member to COBRA coverage and will comply with and be subject to all the terms, conditions, and requirements of COBRA. Maximum periods of post -retirement continuation are described below, but these continuation coverages will end before those maximum periods: for any Claimant who becomes entitled to Medicare (medical only) , for any Claimant for whom required premium is not paid in a timely manner ; or for all Claimants, if the Employer ceases to offer a group health plan to any of its employees. These are the \"early termination events \" and post -retirement continuation will end upon the date of the occurrence of any of them. The occurrence of any event after more than 36 months on post -retirement continuation coverage will not serve to add to the period of available coverage, even if su ch event would have been a further qualifying event were COBRA coverage in effect. Premiums for post -retirement continuation coverage are calculated as a percentage of an estimate of the premium for active Employees and Dependents and the percentage used for this purpose beyond 36 months of post - retirement continuation may be greater than that used for the first 36 months of continuation coverage. For purposes of the following, \"Normal Medicare Eligibility Age \" means the age at which an otherwise qualifie d individual may enroll in Medicare by virtue of attaining a specific number of years of age. At this time, normal Medicare eligibility age is 65 years of age, but references to this term will be amended automatically to reflect any subsequent statutory c hange in this age. Eligible Retiree An eligible Employee of the Employer who retires from service has the option to continue medical coverage at their own expense for himself or herself until the end of the month in which the retiree reaches Normal Medicar e Eligibility Age, but in any event for at least 18 months (unless one of the early termination events described above occurs first).

Also, under federal law, the Plan or issuer may not set the level of benefits or out -of-pocket costs so that any later portion of the 48- hour (or 96- hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or newborn than any earlier portion of the stay.
