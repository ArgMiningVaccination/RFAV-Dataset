Risk factors Important factors that could cause actual financial, business, research or operating results to differ materially from expectations are disclosed in this annual report, including without limitation the following risk factors. Investors should carefully consider all the information set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this document before deciding to invest in any of the Company's securities. In addition to the risks listed below, we may be subject to other material risks that as of the date of this report are not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial at this time. Risks relating to legal and regulatory matters Product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition Product liability is a significant risk for any pharmaceutical company, given that liability claims relating to our industry are unforeseeable by nature. The evolving regulatory environment worldwide (the ever-more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to the pharmaceutical industry, plus more stringent data, quality and supply obligations) clearly impacts our potential liability, and we may incur different liability claims to what we have handled in the past, with regard to their nature, scope and level. Substantial damages have been awarded by some jurisdictions and/or settlements agreed - notably in the United States and other common law jurisdictions - against pharmaceutical companies based on claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. Such claims can also lead to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, and/or be accompanied by consumer fraud claims by customers, third-party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of the product and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions. We are currently defending a number of product liability claims (see Note D.22.a.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report) notably with respect to Taxotere \u00ae, Zantac\u00ae and Depakine\u00ae and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending these claims, or that we will not face additional claims in the future. Establishing the full side effect profile of a pharmaceutical drug goes beyond data derived from preapproval clinical studies which may only involve several hundred to several thousand patients. Routine review and analysis of the continually growing body of post-marketing safety data and clinical trials provide additional information - for example, potential evidence of rare, population-specific or long-term adverse events or of drug interactions that were not observed in preapproval clinical studies. This causes product labeling to evolve over time following interactions with regulatory authorities, which may include restrictions of therapeutic indications, new contraindications, warnings or precautions and occasionally even the suspension or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization. Following any of these events, pharmaceutical companies can face significant product liability claims (see Note D.22.a.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report). Furthermore, we commercialize several devices (some of which use new technologies) which, if they malfunction, could cause unexpected damage and lead to product liability claims (see \"Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm\" below).PART I ITEM 1. Identity of Directors, Senior Management and Advisers 1 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Although we continue to insure a portion of our product liability with third-party carriers, product liability coverage is increasingly difficult and costly to obtain, particularly in the United States. In the future, it is possible that self-insurance may become the sole commercially reasonable means available for managing the financial risk associated with product liability in our pharmaceuticals and vaccines businesses (see \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \u2014 B.9. Insurance and Risk Coverage\"). In cases where we self-insure, the legal costs that we would bear for handling such claims, and potential damage awards to be paid to claimants, could have a negative impact on our financial condition. Due to insurance conditions, even when we have insurance coverage, recoveries from insurers may not be totally successful due to market-driven insurance limitations and exclusions. Moreover, insolvency of an insurer could affect our ability to recover claims on policies for which we have already paid a premium. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or the ultimate success of the our defense, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm our reputation, and can impact the demand for our products and generate speculative news flows and/or rumors relating to such claims. Substantial product liability claims could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and/or may have an impact on market perception of our company and negatively affect our stock price. Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights of workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition Our industry is heavily regulated and legal requirements vary from country to country, and new requirements are imposed on our industry from time to time. Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been strengthening implementation and enforcement activities in recent years, including in relation to anti-bribery, anti-corruption and ethical requirements with respect to medical and scientific research, interactions with healthcare professionals and payers, respect of the human rights of workers, and data protection legislation. We also operate in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients' and other individuals' personal information, and the operation of our business requires data to flow freely across borders of numerous countries. We have adopted a Code of Conduct that requires employees to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as the specific principles and rules of conduct set forth in the Code. We also have policies and procedures designed to help ensure that we, our officers, employees, agents, intermediaries and other third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations (including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the French Anti-Corruption measures law (\"Sapin II\"), the French duty of vigilance law and other anti-bribery laws and regulations). Notwithstanding these efforts, failure to comply with laws and regulations (including as a result of a business partner's breach) may occur and could result in liabilities for us and/or our management. With respect to data protection, legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) enacted in 2021 in China, or other significant privacy legislation, including in the United States the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and case law bring legal uncertainty regarding cross border data flows. Such uncertainty could result in an operational risk limiting or preventing the transfer of data across borders, which may have an impact on our activities (e.g. on clinical trials). The breach of these regulations could also carry financial sanctions and may also harm our reputation and those of our activities that rely on personal data processing. In addition, some uncertainty remains with respect to the legal and regulatory environment for these evolving privacy and data protection laws in the absence of clear guidance. Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries could become the subject of investigations or proceedings by various government entities or could face audits and/or litigation, including allegations of corruption, claims related to employment matters, patent and intellectual property disputes, consumer law claims and tax audits. We are currently defending ourselves in a number of lawsuits relating to pricing and marketing practices (including, for example, \"whistleblower\" litigation in the United States). With respect to tax issues, the complexity of the fiscal environment is such that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments that are greater or less than the amounts we have accrued. See \"Item 8. Financial Information \u2014 A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information \u2014 Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\" and Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. In addition, responding to such investigations is costly and may divert management's attention from our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters, or in similar matters that may arise in the future, could preclude the commercialization of our products, harm our reputation, negatively affect the profitability of existing products and subject us to substantial fines, punitive damages, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies, potentially leading to the imposition of additional regulatory controls, monitoring or self-reporting obligations, or exclusion from government reimbursement programs or markets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 2 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022in proprietary rights rules and regulations, see \"- We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could be adversely affected\" below; and in environmental rules and regulations, see \"- Management of the historical contamination related to our past industrial activities could adversely impact our results of operations and reputation\" below.The unpredictability of these proceedings could lead Sanofi, after consideration of all relevant factors, to enter into settlement agreements to settle certain claims. Such settlements may involve significant monetary payments and/or potential criminal penalties, and may include admissions of wrongdoing and may require entering into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (\"CIA\") or a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (in the United States), which is intended to regulate company behavior for a specified number of years. For example, on February 28, 2020, Sanofi US entered into a civil settlement with the United States Department of Justice and agreed to pay approximately $11.85 million to resolve allegations regarding certain charitable donations Sanofi US made to an independent patient assistance foundation that assisted patients being treated for Multiple Sclerosis. In connection with this settlement, Sanofi US also entered into a CIA with the Office of the Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services effective the same day, which will require us to meet and maintain certain compliance requirements in the United States. Our activities (including our products and manufacturing activities) are subject to significant government regulations and regulatory approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to anticipate the regulations, comply with them, maintain the required approvals, and/or adapt to changes in applicable regulations Obtaining a marketing authorization for a product is a long and highly regulated process requiring us to present extensive documentation and data to the relevant regulatory authorities either at the time of the filing of the application for a marketing authorization or later during its review. Each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements which can evolve over time. Each regulatory authority may also delay or refuse to grant approval even though a product has already been approved in another country. Regulatory authorities are increasingly strengthening their requirements on product safety and risk/benefit profiles. All of these requirements, including post-marketing requirements, have increased the costs associated with maintaining marketing authorizations. Moreover, to monitor our compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA, EMA, WHO and comparable national agencies in other jurisdictions routinely conduct regulatory inspections of our facilities, distribution centers, commercial activities and development centers (including hospitals), and may identify potential deficiencies. For example, in November 2020, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Application (BLA) for sutimlimab, an investigational monoclonal antibody being studied for the treatment of hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease, referring to certain deficiencies identified by the agency during a pre-license inspection of a third-party facility responsible for manufacturing. More generally, if we fail to adequately respond to regulatory inspection observations identified during an inspection, or fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at all or within the targeted timeline, we could be subject to enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA (such as a Warning Letter, injunction, seizure or cease and desist order), the EMA or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we have an obligation to monitor and report adverse events and safety signals. In order to comply with these duties, we must regularly train our employees and certain third parties (such as external sales forces and distributor employees) on regulatory matters, including on pharmacovigilance. If we fail to train these people, or fail to train them appropriately, or if they do not comply with contractual requirements, we may be exposed to the risk that safety events are not reported or not reported in a timely manner in breach of our reporting obligations. Due to geopolitical constraints, we may face delays in our clinical trials due to restrictions imposed on clinical trial sites, and/or delays in the initiation and enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, and/or disruptions related to regulatory approvals and/or delays in label expansions for existing products. We may not be able to fully mitigate these delays, which could negatively impact the timing of our pipeline development programs and may have a negative impact on our product development and launches and hence on future product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, all aspects of our business, including research and development, manufacturing, marketing, reimbursement, pricing and sales, are subject to extensive legislation and governmental regulation. Changes in applicable laws and the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the European Union regulations for Medical Devices (EU MDR), which entered into force in May 2021, Sanofi created the EU MDR task force. This task force was commissioned to address the risk of potential delays in approvals (for new drug-device combination products, for substantial changes to the design or intended purpose of the device component of already approved drug-device combination products, and for medical devices) and of product discontinuation (for some legacy medical devices), as well as compliance risks for existing products due to increased requirements for post-marketing surveillance, clinical evaluations, traceability and transparency. A similar task force was set up in the first quarter of 2021 to examine risks related to the new regulations for In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDR) implemented in May 2022. For information about risks related to changes: In addition, changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposures to additional tax liabilities around the world could negatively impact our operating results. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 3 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Furthermore, most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, the outcome of those mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims can be uncertain and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially different from the amounts accrued. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative to work toward a global tax framework that ensures inter alia a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions and also introduces a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution processes. We expect there to be a continued focus on tax reform, driven by initiatives by the OECD, as well as the European Union and several jurisdictions where we operate, to address the aforementioned tax challenges, which may result in significant changes to established tax principles and an increase in tax authority disputes. These may be costly, divert management attention and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with key stakeholders . We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products. If such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could be adversely affected Through patent and other proprietary rights, such as data exclusivity or supplementary protection certificates in Europe, we hold exclusivity rights for a number of our research-based products. However, the protection that we are able to obtain varies in its duration and scope. Furthermore, patents and other proprietary rights do not always provide effective protection for our products. We cannot be certain that we will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated. For example, governmental authorities are increasingly looking to facilitate generic and biosimilar competition for existing products through new regulatory proposals intended to achieve, or resulting in, changes to the scope of patent or data exclusivity rights and through the use of accelerated regulatory pathways for generic and biosimilar drug approvals. Such regulatory proposals could make patent prosecution for new products more difficult and time consuming or could adversely affect the exclusivity period for our products. Moreover, manufacturers of generic products or biosimilars are increasingly seeking to challenge patent validity or coverage before the patents expire, and manufacturers of biosimilars or interchangeable versions of the products are seeking to have their version of the product approved before the exclusivity period ends. Furthermore, in an infringement suit against a third party, we may not prevail and the decision rendered may not conclude that our patent or other proprietary rights are valid, enforceable or infringed. Our competitors may also successfully avoid our patents. Even in cases where we ultimately prevail in an infringement claim, legal remedies available for harm caused to us by infringing products may be inadequate to make us whole. Moreover, a successful result against a competing product for a given patent or in a specific country is not necessarily predictive of our future success against another competing product or in another country because of local variations in the patents and patent laws. In addition, if we lose patent protection as a result of an adverse court decision or a settlement, we face the risk that government and private third-party payers and purchasers of pharmaceutical products may claim damages alleging they have over-reimbursed or overpaid for a drug. For example, in 2009, in Australia, our patent on clopidogrel was ultimately held invalid. Following this decision, the Australian Government sought damages for its alleged over-reimbursement of clopidogrel drugs due to the preliminary injunction we had secured against the sale of generic clopidogrel during the course of the litigation. The Australian Government's claim was dismissed following a decision of the Federal Court of Australia on April 28, 2020. Sanofi is awaiting the judgment to be delivered by the Federal Court of Australia, following the appeal of the first instance decision by the Australian Government on May 26, 2020. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which we seek to protect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with licensees, employees, third-party collaborators, and consultants who may have access to such information. If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures should fail, then our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses. In certain cases, to terminate or avoid patent litigation we or our collaboration partners may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of third-party intellectual property rights. Any payments under these licenses may reduce our profits from such products and we may not be able to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all. Third parties may also request a preliminary or permanent injunction in a country from a court of law to prevent us from marketing a product if they consider that we infringe their patent rights in that country. If third parties obtain a preliminary or permanent injunction or if we fail to obtain a required license for a country where valid third-party intellectual property rights as confirmed by a court of law exist, or if we are unable to alter the design of our technology to fall outside the scope of third-party intellectual property rights, we may be unable to market some of our products in certain countries, which may limit our profitability. In addition, the pursuit of valid business opportunities may require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were improperly granted, including through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges may not always be successful. Third parties may claim that our products infringe one or more patents owned or controlled by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time-consuming to resolve, may delay or prevent product launches, and may result in significant royalty payments or damages.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 4 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022stricter price and access controls imposed by governments and other payers around the world: -requirements for greater transparency around drug pricing and drug development costs, -widespread use of international reference pricing and therapeutic reference pricing, among other pricing methodologies and caps, -mandatory price cuts, renegotiations, industry payback and rebates, -delisting from reimbursement and restrictions on the label population, -access restrictions for high-priced innovative medicines, -prescribing guidelines and binding medicine utilization controls, -greater use of tendering and centralized procurement (national/regional/class-wide level), -cross-country cooperation in price negotiations, contracting or procurement, which is already occurring to some extent (for example the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, the BeNeLuxA alliance in Europe, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)), -shifting of the payment burden to US patients and access disruptions through co-pay accumulator and maximizer programs as well as alternative funding programs, -increased utilization management and restrictive formularies (including stepped therapy, strict prior authorization criteria, formulary exclusions) mainly by US insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), and -discriminatory and non-transparent pricing and procurement policies (e.g. government procurement restrictions, import bans) in favor of domestic pharmaceutical companies; widespread use of health technology assessment (HTA) to inform coverage and reimbursement decisions: -more stringent evidence and value requirements (e.g. comparative effectiveness, patient preferences, real-word evidence, health economic modelling) by payers and HTA authorities, raising the bar for market entry, -unreasonable thresholds for cost-effectiveness, and -increasingly restrictive HTA decisions with significant variation across markets; increased generic and biosimilar competition, accelerating price erosion: -next-generation biosimilars coming to the market across major therapeutic areas, -potential savings from increased biosimilar use, expected to be a cumulative $285 billion globally through 2025 according to the IQVIA Institute, and -evolving regulatory landscapes to support interchangeability (e.g. in the US and EU) and pharmacy substitution (e.g. in the EU Nordic countries, Germany and France).Furthermore, some countries may consider granting a compulsory license to a third party to use patents protecting an innovator's product, which limits the value of the patent protection granted to such products. We have increased the proportion of biological therapeutics in our pipeline relative to traditional small molecule pharmaceutical products. Typically, the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of biological therapeutics is complicated by third-party intellectual property rights (otherwise known as freedom to operate (FTO) issues), to a greater extent than for the small molecule therapeutics, because of the types of patents allowed by national patent offices. Further, our ability to successfully challenge third-party patent rights is dependent on the legal interpretation and case law of national courts. In addition, we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. With the accelerated regulatory pathways provided in the United States and Europe for biosimilar drug approval, biosimilars can be a threat to the exclusivity of any biological therapeutics we sell or may market in the future and can pose the same issues as the small molecule generic threat described above. If a biosimilar version of one of our products were to be approved, it could reduce our sales and/or profitability of that product. We currently hold trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in many jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. As our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks and trade dress to differentiate us from our competitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. If our patents and/or proprietary rights to our products were limited or circumvented, our financial results could be adversely affected. Risks relating to our business The pricing and reimbursement of our products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governmental authorities and other third parties The commercial success of our existing products and our product candidates depends in part on their pricing and reimbursement conditions. Our products are negatively affected by continued downward pricing pressure and scrutiny due, inter alia, to:PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 5 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022In the United States, which accounted for 42.5% of our net sales in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted in August 2022 with drug pricing provisions that became effective in 2022, and will become effective in 2025 and 2026. Key policies related to federal government price negotiations, inflation penalties and Medicare Part D benefit redesign are likely to have a negative impact on industry revenue growth and future innovation, though there remains significant uncertainty over the negotiation provision and the impact of Medicare reforms. In addition, the continuing vertical integration and consolidation of the US health insurance market exposes the industry to greater pricing pressure. With the three largest pharmacy benefit manager group purchasing organizations (PBM GPOs) (i.e. Ascent, Emisar and Zinc) now covering over 85% of prescription drug claims, consolidation has led to increased utilization management and restrictive formularies, resulting in strong bargaining power to negotiate discounted prices, thereby adversely impacting our sales. Other risks include the increasing focus on price transparency, persistent supply chain challenges due to high dependency on API imports and interest in \"Buy American\" procurement rules. If we had to source APIs from the US, where they are more expensive than in other countries, the current cost containments would not allow us to reflect the corresponding increase on our prices which would impact the margins on our products. Other risks also include continued growth of the federal 340B drug pricing program. In China, we continue to face increasing local competition. Price pressure is likely to intensify across our portfolio as a growing number of our products are subject to national reimbursement drug list (NRDL) price negotiations and national volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders, with the lowest prices prevailing. Innovative oncology products, in particular, are experiencing additional access challenges, as seen with the exclusion of imported PD-1 inhibitors from the NRDL in the last two years, in favor of domestically developed treatments. Further expansion of the (VBP) policy to biologics and biosimilars also poses a growing threat to our key established products, with over 500 drugs targeted for inclusion by 2025. In Europe, there are risks of tighter cost-containment policies exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation and volatile energy prices. Industry payback and mandatory rebates are expected to increase at unprecedented rates in 2023 in major EU markets, particularly in Germany and the UK. At EU level, there continue to be growing concerns over the current direction of the European Commission's wide-ranging Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, and the related ongoing review of intellectual property protections and the Orphan Medicines Regulation. The policies under consideration could have a far-reaching impact on our Rare Diseases pipelines, and have the potential to jeopardize incentives for EU innovation and competitiveness. We will pursue our current efforts towards shaping and improving the EU pharmaceutical legislation, while creating the conditions of an EU biopharma innovation ecosystem, based on a vision combining pharmaceutical and industrial strategies. In addition, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of the EU HTA Regulation by 2025. Sanofi created an internal EU HTA task force in early 2022 in order to engage with stakeholders with one voice and ensure preparedness for the new EU framework. Furthermore, the EU joint procurement initiative aimed at combining the procurement actions of two or more contracting authorities, as used in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, may gain traction outside the health emergency context, in particular for high-cost medicines and vaccines. We therefore anticipate greater pricing pressure and potential risk of net price transparency. This could have an impact an impact on our Specialty Care portfolio, especially for oncology and rare diseases. Our research and development efforts may not succeed in adequately renewing our product portfolio Discovering and developing a new product is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. To be successful in the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development in order to develop new products to compensate for decreasing sales of products facing patent expiration and termination of regulatory data exclusivity, introduction of lower-priced generics, or competition from new products of competitors that are perceived as being superior or equivalent to our products. We must pursue both early-stage research and early and late development stages in order to propose a sustainable and well-balanced portfolio of products. In 2022, we spent \u20ac6,706 million on research and development, amounting to 15.6% of our net sales. Failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline. We prioritize five potentially transformative therapies in areas of high unmet patient need: tolebrutinib (multiple sclerosis). We also announced our decision to discontinue our research efforts in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and refocus our R&D strategy on oncology, immunology and inflammation, multiple sclerosis, neurology and rare diseases and rare blood disorders. In 2021, Sanofi acquired Translate Bio to accelerate the deployment of mRNA technology for the development of new vaccines, including for seasonal influenza, and beyond vaccines, therapeutics where there is a strong unmet medical need. However, mRNA technology is still in its early days and the ability of this technology to produce strong results and safety still remains to be fully asserted; we may also fail to improve our development productivity sufficiently to sustain our pipeline (see also \"- We may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realize the anticipated benefits from our strategic investments or divestments\" below). Other new innovations under investigations, such as natural killer (NK) cells and conditionally activated biologics, raise similar uncertainties.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 6 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022In addition, the competitive landscape includes a high level of uncertainty as numerous companies are working on or may be evaluating similar targets and a product considered as promising at the beginning of its development may become less attractive if a competitor addressing the same unmet need reaches the market earlier. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be proven safe or effective (see \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \u2014 B.5. Global Research & Development\"). Over these research and development cycles, usually spanning several years, there is a substantial risk at each stage of development - including pre-clinical activities and clinical trials - that we will not achieve our goals of safety and/or efficacy and that we will have to abandon a product in which we have invested substantial amounts of money and human resources. For instance, in 2022 patient enrollment of Phase III tolebrutinib trials paused globally after a decision of the FDA regarding potential side effects. As another example, the global clinical development program of amcenestrant (breast cancer) was discontinued in August 2022 following the outcome of the prespecified interim analysis of a Phase III trial. More and more trials are designed with clinical endpoints of superiority; failure to achieve those endpoints could damage the product's outlook and our overall development program. Decisions concerning the studies to be carried out can have a significant impact on the marketing strategy for a given product. Multiple in-depth studies can demonstrate that a product has additional benefits, facilitating the product's marketing, but such studies are expensive and time consuming and may delay the product's submission to regulatory authorities for approval. In addition, following (or in some cases contemporaneously with) the marketing authorization, the dossier is also submitted to governmental agencies and/or national or regional third-party payers (HTA bodies) for review. These HTA bodies evaluate evidence on the value of the new product, assess the medical need it serves, and provide recommendations on the corresponding reimbursement. Such analyses may require additional studies, including comparative studies, which may effectively delay marketing, change the population which the new product treats, and add costs to its development. Our continuous investments in research and development for future products and for the launches of newly registered molecules could therefore result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues, which would negatively affect our operating results and profitability. Lastly, there can be no assurance that all the products approved or launched will achieve commercial success. In addition, even after a product reaches the market, certain developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand for our products. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs have the potential to raise concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general, which could negatively affect the sales of such products or lead to increased volatility in market reaction. Breaches of data security, disruptions of information technology systems and cyber threats could result in financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational harm Our business depends heavily on the use of interdependent information technology systems, including internet-based systems and digital tools. Certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on our information systems (including cloud-based computing) or those of third-party providers (including for the storage and transfer of critical, confidential, sensitive or personal information regarding our patients, clinical trials, vendors, customers, employees, collaborators and others). We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents and misuse or manipulation of any of these IT systems could result in exposure of confidential information or the modification of critical data. We and our third-party service providers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors or other contracting third parties use, to the best of our ability, secure information technology systems for the protection of data and threat detection. Like many companies, we may experience certain of the following events which pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our sensitive data: breakdown, outages, service disruption or impairment, data loss or deterioration in the event of a system malfunction or increasing threat of data theft or corruption in the event of a cyber-attack, security breach, industrial espionage attacks, insider threat attacks, cybercrimes, including state- sponsored cybercrimes, malware, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Also, in the event of an attack, U.S. and European legislation related to the financing of terrorism imposes increasing restrictions on payments of ransom. As a result, our ability to recover the data might be limited. Therefore, our business continuity could be at risk if we are unable to recover data through back-ups and restorations. Each of these events could negatively impact important processes, such as scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of outcomes to health authorities for marketing authorizations, the functioning of production processes and the supply chain, compliance with legal requirements, trade secrets, security strategies and other key activities, including Sanofi's employees' ability to communicate between themselves as well as with third parties (see also \"- Product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\" above). This could result in material financial, legal, competitive, operational, business or reputational harm. Although we maintain relevant insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficiently available in the future to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems. For example, certain types of cyber-attacks could be considered as an Act of War subject to insurance exclusion.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 7 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The manufacture of our products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact our image Many of our products are manufactured using technically complex processes with production constraints, including the need for specialized facilities, trained and certified employees, and highly specific raw materials. We must ensure that all manufacturing processes comply with (i) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), (ii) other applicable regulations issued by governmental health authorities around the world, as well as (iii) our own quality standards. Third parties supply us with a portion of our raw materials, active ingredients and medical devices, which exposes us to the risk of a supply shortage or interruption in the event that these suppliers are unable to manufacture our products in line with quality standards or if they experience financial difficulties. For example, in 2021 Genzyme sold a manufacturing facility located in Allston Landing in the United States to a third party, which is in particular involved in the production of Cerezyme \u00ae. We now rely on that third party for certain manufacturing and testing operations pursuant to the terms and conditions of relevant contractual agreements with such third party. The manufacturing and testing operations performed on Genzyme's behalf at the Allston Landing facility are subject to the terms of a consent decree requiring ongoing compliance therewith, which was entered into between Genzyme and the US government in 2010. We now rely on the third party that acquired the Allston Landing site to perform manufacturing and testing services on our behalf and to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the aforementioned consent decree. We could be subject to product supply risk if the third party is unable to supply product to us and to regulatory action if the third party acquirer of the Allston Landing site fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including cGMP, when performing the relevant services. Epidemics and other public health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, expose us to risks of a slowdown or temporary suspension in the production of our APIs, raw materials, and some of our products. Any prolonged restrictive measures put in place in order to control an outbreak of contagious disease or other adverse public health development, in any of our principal production sites, may have a material and adverse effect on our manufacturing operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition (see \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \u2014 B.8. Production and Raw Materials\" for a description of these outsourcing arrangements and \"The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may adversely impact our business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain\" below). Our business may require the transformation and adaptation of our plants in order to ensure the continuity of production of our products in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand. This may be necessary to meet the need for the production of new products, including biologics, or to ensure the scaling up production of products under development once approved. This need may also result from new regulatory requirements; for example, the fact that insulin is no longer regulated by the FDA as a drug but rather as a biologic requires significant transformation and adaptation of our insulin manufacturing plant in Frankfurt, with no guarantee that we will manage to complete that plan within the expected time. Furthermore, our biological products, in particular, are subject to the risk of manufacturing stoppages or the risk of loss of inventory because of the difficulties inherent in the processing of biological materials and the potential difficulties in accessing adequate amounts of raw materials meeting required standards. In addition, specific storage and distribution conditions are required for many biological products (for example, cold storage is required for certain vaccines, insulin-based products and some hemophilia products). These production difficulties may also be encountered during testing, which is a mandatory requirement prior to drug products being released. For example, in early 2022, we encountered supply constraints of Kevzara \u00ae (sarilumab) due to an increase in the global demand for IL-6 receptor blockers and the tocilizumab shortage announced in mid-August 2021. We therefore needed to prioritize access for indicated patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The complexity of our production processes, as well as standards required for the manufacture of our products, subject us to risks because the investigation and remediation of any identified or suspected problems can cause production delays, substantial expense, product recalls or lost sales and inventories, and delay the launch of new products; this could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, and cause reputational damage and the risk of product liability (see \"- Product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\" above). In addition, some of our production sites, and some of our suppliers' and/or contractors' sites, are located in areas exposed to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and hurricanes. Such disasters could be exacerbated by climate change. In the event of a major disaster, we could experience severe destruction or interruption of our operations and production capacity at these sites. When manufacturing disruptions occur, we may not have alternate manufacturing capacity, particularly for certain biologics. In the event of manufacturing disruptions, our ability to use backup facilities or set up new facilities is more limited because biologics are more complex to manufacture and generally require dedicated facilities. Even though we aim to have backup sources of supply whenever possible, including by manufacturing backup supplies of our principal active ingredients at additional facilities when practicable, we cannot be certain they will be sufficient if our principal sources become unavailable. Switching sources and manufacturing facilities requires significant time and prior approval by health authorities. Supply shortages generate even greater negative reactions when they occur with respect to life saving medicines with limited or no viable therapeutic alternatives. Shortages of specific products can have a negative impact on the confidence of patients, customers and professional healthcare providers and the image of Sanofi and may lead to lower product revenues.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 8 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022A substantial share of the revenue and income of Sanofi depends on the performance of certain flagship products As part of the presentation of our strategy in December 2019 we announced our intent to prioritize our activities on growth drivers including Dupixent \u00ae and our Vaccines operations, which we have identified as key growth drivers. Nevertheless market expansion and new launches of medicines and vaccines may not deliver the expected benefits. We may also encounter failures or delays in our launch strategy (in terms of timing, pricing, market access, marketing efforts and dedicated sales forces), such that our products that may not deliver the expected benefits. The competitive environment for a given product may also have changed by the time of the actual launch, modifying our initial expectations. The need to prioritize the allocation of resources may also cause delays in or hamper the launch or expansion of some of our products. Also, we currently generate a substantial share of our net sales from certain key products (see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 A.2. Results of Operations \u2014 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared with year ended December 31, 2021 \u2014 A.2.1.3/Net Sales \u2014 Pharmaceuticals segment\"). For example, Dupixent \u00ae generated net sales of \u20ac8,293 million in 2022 representing 19.3% of our net sales for the year and is Sanofi's biggest product in terms of sales. Among our flagship products, Lantus\u00ae, Lovenox\u00ae and Plavix\u00ae already face generic competition on the market. Lantus\u00ae is particularly important; it was one of Sanofi's leading products in 2022 with net sales of \u20ac2,259 million. Aubagio\u00ae, another leading product, is expected to face generic competition in the U.S. starting from March 2023, following a settlement agreement entered into in 2017. In Europe, Aubagio\u00ae generic competition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. Jevtana\u00ae has faced generic competition since the end of March 2021 in Europe. More generally, an expiration of effective intellectual property protections for our products typically results in the market entry of one or more lower-priced generic competitors, often leading to a rapid and significant decline in revenues on those products (for information regarding ongoing patent litigation see Note D.22.b.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report). The introduction of a generic product results in adverse price and volume effects for our branded or genericized products. For example, although we do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the absence of generic competition, a comparison of our consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021 for the main products affected by generic and biosimilar competition shows a loss of \u20ac325 million of net sales on a reported basis (see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 A.1.2. Impacts of Competition from Generics and Biosimilars\"). However, other parameters may have contributed to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average price of certain products (e.g. Lantus \u00ae). Furthermore, in general, if one or more of our flagship products were to encounter problems (such as material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, product recalls, non-approval by the health authorities of a new indication for a marketed product, pricing pressure and manufacturing or supply issues), the adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be significant. We rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of our products Our industry is both highly collaborative and competitive, whether in the discovery and development of new products, in-licensing, the marketing and distribution of approved products, or manufacturing activities. We expect that we will continue to rely on third parties for key aspects of our business and we need to ensure our attractiveness as a potential partner. We conduct a number of significant research and development programs and market some of our products in collaboration with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. For example, we currently have a global strategic collaboration with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies for the development and (sarilumab) and SAR440340 (REGN3500- Presentation of Alliances \u2014 A.1.7.1/ Alliance Arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc\"). We rely upon Regeneron to successfully carry out their responsibilities with regard to the manufacture and supply of these collaboration antibodies. (see \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview\"). Finally, we may also rely on partners to design and manufacture medical devices, notably for the administration of our products. As regards products recently launched or under development for which we have a collaboration agreement with partners, the terms of the applicable alliance agreement may require us to share profits and losses arising from commercialization of such products with our partners. This differs from the treatment of revenue and costs generated by other products for which we have no alliance agreement, and such profit sharing may deliver a lower contribution to our financial results. We could also be subject to the risk that we may not properly manage the decision-making process with our partners. Decisions may be controlled by, or subject to the approval of our collaboration partners, who may have views that differ from ours. We are also subject to the risk that our partners may not perform effectively, which could have a detrimental effect when our collaboration partners are responsible for the performance of certain key tasks or functions, for example related to manufacturing. Any such failures in the development process or differing priorities may adversely affect our business, including the activities conducted through our collaboration arrangements. We also cannot guarantee that third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. For instance, following the completion of the spin-off of EUROAPI in May 2022, EUROAPI became a third-party manufacturer and will continue to manufacture a certain number of APIs for Sanofi. We are also subject to the risk that contract research organizations or other vendors (for instance regarding digital activities) retained by us or our collaboration partners may not perform effectively.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 9 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Any conflicts or difficulties with our partners during the course of these agreements or at the time of their renewal or renegotiation, or any disruption in the relationships with our partners, may affect the development, manufacturing, launch and/or marketing of certain of our products or product candidates and may cause a decline in our revenues or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations. We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers(1) We run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, which consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies. This risk is accentuated by recent concentrations among distributors and retailers, as well as by uncertainties around global credit and economic conditions, in particular in emerging markets. As a result, we may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. The United States poses particular customer credit risk issues because of the concentrated distribution system: our three main customers represented respectively 12%, 8% and 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2022. We are also exposed to large wholesalers in other markets, particularly in Europe. An inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to us could adversely affect our financial condition (see Note D.34. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report). In some countries, some customers are public or subsidized health systems. The economic and credit conditions in these countries may lead to an increase in the average length of time needed to collect on accounts receivable or the ability to collect 100% of receivables outstanding. Because of this context, we may need to reassess the recoverable amount of our debts in these countries during future financial years. Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for our business(2) Over the past several years, growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become increasingly tied to global economic growth. In this context, a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, major national economies or emerging markets could negatively affect growth in the global pharmaceutical market and, as a result, adversely affect our business. For example, unpredictable political conditions that currently exist in various parts of the world could have a material negative impact on our business. In particular, armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalated in 2022. The degree of impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine is difficult to predict and will depend on developments outside Sanofi's control, including, but not limited to the duration and severity of the conflict, and the consequences of the ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions imposed by governments in response. Other related issues have arisen or are arising such as regional instability; geopolitical uncertainties; adverse effects on fuel and energy costs, supply chains, macroeconomic conditions, inflation, and currency exchange rates in various regions of the world; and exposure of third parties to gas shortages. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and difficulties associated with international transactions. Unfavorable economic conditions have reduced the sources of funding for national social security systems, leading to austerity measures including heightened pressure on drug prices, increased substitution of generic drugs, and the exclusion of certain products from formularies among others (see \"\u2014 The pricing and reimbursement of our products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governments and other third parties\" above). Further, our net sales may be negatively impacted by the continuing challenging global economic environment, as high unemployment, increases in cost-sharing, and lack of developed third-party payer systems in certain regions may lead some patients to switch to generic products, delay treatments, skip doses or use other treatments to reduce their costs. In the United States there has been a significant increase in the number of beneficiaries in the Medicaid program, under which sales of pharmaceuticals are subject to substantial rebates and, in many US states, to formulary restrictions limiting access to brand-name drugs, including ours. Also, employers may seek to transfer a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees due to rising costs, which could lead to further downward price pressure and/or lower demand. Our Consumer Healthcare business could also be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions, as the financial resources of our customers may be reduced as a result of the economic situation. If economic conditions worsen, or in the event of default or failure of major players including wholesalers or public sector buyers financed by insolvent states, our financial situation, the profitability and results of our operations and the distribution channels of our products may be adversely affected. See also \"\u2014 We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers\" above. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related developments, including measures implemented in response thereto, may adversely impact our business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain We are unable to predict the impact on our business, operations and financial results that the COVID-19 pandemic would have if it continued or resumed with force, including insofar it could lead to lower sales and reduced patient demand and usage of certain of our products.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 10 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(1)The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Notes B.8.7., D.10. and D.34. to our consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18. of this annual report. (2)The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to our consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18. of this annual report.we are unable to quickly or efficiently integrate those activities or businesses; key employees leave; or we have higher than anticipated integration costs.While economies around the world tend to reopen their economies, the degree to which COVID-19 adversely impacts our results in the future is outside the Company's knowledge or control and will depend on the evolution of the outbreak, its mutation, its severity, the actions taken by government authorities to contain the virus or mitigate its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections or emergence of new epidemics could result in the imposition of new constraints and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. In an increasingly budget-constrained healthcare environment as economic disruption have continued due to the pandemic, we expect to see a higher pressure on drug prices worldwide and, in the longer term, a reallocation of funding across therapeutic areas, driven in particular by evolving public health priorities, which could negatively impact our business operations (see \"\u2014 The pricing and reimbursement of our products is negatively affected by increasing cost containment pressures and decisions of governmental authorities and other third parties\" above). For example, the pandemic may reduce our sales in targeted markets due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional activities. The global COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed us to a disruption or temporary suspension in production of APIs, raw materials and some of other products. A revival of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic could expose us to a revival of this risk. Extension of the restrictive measures put in place in order to control the pandemic may lead to manufacturing delays or disruptions and supply chain interruptions (including to the extent those measures apply to our third-party suppliers) and may have an adverse effect on our business (see \"\u2014 The manufacture of our products is technically complex, and supply interruptions, product recalls or inventory losses caused by unforeseen events may reduce sales, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, delay the launch of new products and negatively impact our image\" above). Also, a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products can result in short-term unavailability or shortages of raw materials. Finally, we cannot predict or reasonably estimate the impact of any potential long-term changes to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing use of social media platforms and new technologies present risks and challenges for our business and reputation We increasingly rely on social media, new technologies and digital tools to communicate about our products and about diseases or to provide health services. The use of these media requires specific attention, monitoring programs and moderation of comments. Political and market pressures may be generated by social media because of rapid news cycles. This may result in commercial harm, overly restrictive regulatory actions and erratic share price performance. In addition, unauthorized communications, such as press releases or posts on social media, purported to be issued by Sanofi, may contain information that is false or otherwise damaging and could have an adverse impact on our image and reputation and on our stock price. Negative or inaccurate posts or comments about Sanofi, our business, directors or officers on any social networking website could seriously damage our reputation. In addition, our employees and partners may use social media and mobile technologies inappropriately, which may give rise to liability for Sanofi, or which could lead to breaches of data security, loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property or public disclosure of sensitive information. Such uses of social media and mobile technologies could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks relating to Sanofi's structure and strategy We may fail to successfully identify external business opportunities or realizethe anticipated benefits from our strategic investments or divestments We pursue a strategy of selective acquisitions, in-licensing and collaborations in order to reinforce our pipeline and portfolio. We are also proceeding to selective divestments to focus on key business areas. The implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify transaction opportunities, mobilize the appropriate resources in order to enter into agreements in a timely manner, and execute these transactions on acceptable economic terms. Moreover, entering into in-licensing or collaboration agreements generally requires the payment of significant \"milestones\" well before the relevant products reach the market, without any assurance that such investments will ultimately become profitable in the long term (see Note D.21.1. to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report and also \"\u2014 We rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture, marketing and distribution of some of our products\" above). Once a strategic transaction is agreed upon with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all. For newly acquired activities or businesses, our growth objectives could be delayed or ultimately not realized, and expected synergies could be adversely impacted if, for example: For instance, in 2019 we had to book a \u20ac2.8 billion impairment on Eloctate \u00ae, acquired through the Bioverativ acquisition completed in 2018, due to revisions of previous sales projections. As another example, the Translate Bio acquisition referred to above which was completed in 2021 may not generate the expected results in terms of developing new mRNA-based products to meet existing or future needs, and the potential of Translate Bio's mRNA platform may not be realized to its full extent or because of the difficulty of integrating the activity quickly and efficiently into the Group.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 11 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022We may also miscalculate the risks associated with business development transactions at the time they are made or may lack the resources or ability to access all the relevant information to evaluate such risks properly, including with regard to the potential of research and development pipelines, manufacturing issues, tax or accounting issues, compliance issues, or the outcome of ongoing legal and other proceedings. It may also take a considerable amount of time and be difficult to implement a risk analysis and risk mitigation plan after the acquisition of an activity or business is completed due to lack of historical data. Acquired businesses may not always be in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Sanofi standards, including, for example, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), which can be costly and time consuming to remedy. As a result, risk management and coverage of such risks, particularly through insurance policies, may prove to be insufficient or ill-adapted. With respect to divestments, their financial benefit could be impacted if we face significant financial claims or significant post- closing price adjustments. Furthermore, the value of the assets to be divested may deteriorate while we are in the process of executing our divestment strategy, with the risk that we do not realize the anticipated benefits. Because of the active competition among pharmaceutical groups for business development opportunities, there can be no assurance of our success in completing these transactions when such opportunities are identified. The globalization of our business exposes us to increased risks in specific areas As part of the presentation of our strategy in December 2019, we identified our strong presence in China among our core drivers, with revenue amounting to 7.3% of our net sales in 2022. Nevertheless, the difficulties in operating in emerging markets, a significant decline in the anticipated growth rate or an unfavorable movement of the exchange rates of currencies against the euro could impair our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For instance, while it continues to be impossible as of the date of this report to predict the economic impact and the magnitude of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, if a long-lasting epidemic and prolonged or repeated restrictive measures to control the outbreak were to result in an economic slowdown in any of our targeted markets, it would reduce our sales due to lower healthcare spending on other diseases and fewer promotional activities, and could significantly impact our business operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict if or how the current health crisis will impact any particular affected jurisdiction, or to what extent (see also \"\u2014 Global economic conditions and an unfavorable financial environment could have negative consequences for our business\" and \"The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related developmental authorities, including measures implemented in response thereto, may impact our business, operations and financial performance remains uncertain\" above). Emerging markets also expose us to more volatile economic conditions, political instability (including a backlash in certain areas against free trade), competition from multinational or locally based companies that are already well established in these markets, the inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of emerging markets (particularly with respect to their underdeveloped judicial systems and regulatory frameworks), difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel or maintaining the necessary internal control systems, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels (particularly with respect to counterfeit products), and compliance issues including corruption and fraud (see particularly \"\u2014 Claims and investigations relating to ethics and business integrity, competition law, marketing practices, pricing, human rights of workers, data protection and other legal matters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\" above). We may fail to develop or take advantage of digitalization and prioritizing data as an organizational asset We have undertaken a number of digital initiatives. Examples include the opening in March 2022 of our Accelerator, an internal unit that functions like a startup within Sanofi to develop products and solutions that will support our mission to transform the practice of medicine with the use of digital, data and artificial intelligence; the Future4Care initiative of June 2021, where we joined a startup incubator along with other CAC40 companies to help nurture the latest and greatest in health tech; our enabled manufacturing facility in the US; and our Darwin real-world data platform. Our success in these efforts will depend on many factors including data quality; technology architecture; entering into successful partnerships and alliances with technology companies; a profound transformation of the organization, including a cultural change among our employees and the development of relevant skills; attracting and retaining employees with appropriate skills and mindsets in a tight labor market; and successfully innovating across a variety of technology fields. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated our digital transformation, including in the ways we engage and interact with our stakeholders. However, there is no guarantee that our efforts toward a digital transformation will succeed. More generally, we may fail to capture the benefits of digitalization and valuing data as an enterprise asset at an appropriate cost and/or in a timely manner, and/or enter into appropriate partnerships. Competitors, including new entrants such as tech companies, may outpace us in this fast-moving area. If we fail to adequately integrate digital capabilities into our organization and business model, we could lose patients and market share. This could have an adverse impact on our business, prospects and results of operations. The success of digital initiatives will also depend on our ability to shift our culture to a data-driven culture. This calls for clear ownership and a collectively-owned operating model with supporting tools and competencies to manage data as an asset, and for the definition of a robust life-cycle management process for data that is applied consistently across Sanofi. Good overall management of data supports our overall operations and the delivery of exponential capabilities, including artificial intelligence and machine learning to fulfil our innovation and efficiency ambitions. Failure to do so could result in business, operational and financial harm.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 12 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022that we currently own or operate; that we formerly owned or operated; or where waste from our operations was disposed.We may fail to accelerate our operational efficiency As part of our strategy, we announced our intent to improve our operating efficiencies to fund growth and expand our business operating income margin. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to fully deliver these operating efficiencies within the targeted timeline or generate the expected benefits. Unsuccessful management of environmental, social and governance matters could adversely affect our reputation and we may experience difficulties to meet the expectations of our stakeholders Companies are increasingly expected to behave in a responsible manner on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, by governmental and regulatory authorities, counterparties such as vendors and suppliers, customers, investors, the public at large and others. This context, driven in part by a rapidly changing regulatory framework in the US and in Europe, is raising new challenges and influencing strategic decisions that companies must take if they wish to optimize their positive impact and mitigate their negative impact on ESG matters. We have adopted an ESG strategy that aims at ensuring global access and affordability, addressing unmet needs with transformative therapies, and minimizing the impact of our activities and products on the climate and the environment. The strategy includes leveraging our personnel's experience and making societal impact a key driver of our employees' engagement. However, despite our strong commitment we could be unable to meet our ESG or other strategic objectives in an efficient and timely manner, or at all. We may also be unable to meet the ever more demanding criteria used by rating agencies in their ESG assessments process, leading to a downgrading in our rating. Financial investments in companies which perform well in ESG assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have made known their interest in investing in such companies. Depending on ESG assessments and on the rapidly changing views on acceptable levels of action across a range of ESG topics from investors, we may be unable to meet society's or investors' expectations, our reputation may be harmed, we may face increased compliance or other costs and demand for securities issued by us and our ability to participate in the debt and equity markets may decrease. Our success depends in part on our senior management team and other key employees and our ability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals in the face of intense competition Our success depends on the expertise of our senior management team and other key employees. In 2022, there were 2,361 \"Senior Leaders\" within Sanofi. In addition, we rely heavily on recruiting and retaining talented people to help us meet our strategic objectives. We face intense competition for qualified individuals for senior management positions, or in specific geographic regions or in specialized fields such as clinical development, biosciences and devices, or digital and artificial intelligence. Our ability to hire qualified personnel also depends in part on our ability to reward performance, incentivize our employees and pay competitive compensation. Laws and regulations on executive compensation may restrict our ability to attract, motivate and retain the required level of talented people. The inability to attract, integrate and/or retain highly skilled personnel, in particular those in leadership positions, may weaken our succession plans, may materially adversely affect the implementation of our strategy and our ability to meet our strategic objectives, and could ultimately adversely impact our business or results of operations. Environmental and safety risks of our industrial activities Risks from manufacturing activities and the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect our results of operations and reputation Manufacturing activities, such as the chemical manufacturing of the active ingredients in our products and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and waste, expose us to risks of industrial accidents that may lead to discharges or releases of toxic or pathogenic substances or other events that can cause personal injury, property damage and environmental contamination, and may result in additional operational constraints, including the shutdown of affected facilities and/or the imposition of civil, administrative, criminal penalties and/or civil damages, and affect Sanofi's reputation. The occurrence of an industrial accident may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility and adversely affect our operating results and reputation. Although we maintain property damage, business interruption and casualty insurance that we believe is in accordance with customary industry practices, this insurance may not be adequate to fully cover all potential hazards incidental to our business. Management of the historical contamination related to our past industrial activities could adversely impact our results of operations and reputation The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on our Company to manage and/or remediate contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites:PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 13 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022These environmental remediation obligations could reduce our operating results. Sanofi accrues provisions for remediation when our management believes the need is probable and that it is reasonably possible to estimate the cost. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \u2014 B.10. Health, Safety and Environment\" for additional information regarding our environmental policies. In particular, our provisions for these obligations may be insufficient if the assumptions underlying these provisions prove incorrect or if we are held responsible for additional, currently undiscovered contamination. These judgments and estimates may later prove inaccurate, and any shortfalls could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For more detailed information on environmental issues, see \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 B. Business Overview \u2014 B.10. Health, Safety and Environment and Notes B.12. and D.19.3. to the consolidated financial statements\". We are or may become involved in claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters. Some current and former Sanofi subsidiaries have been named as \"potentially responsible parties\" or the equivalent under the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (also known as \"Superfund\"), and similar statutes or obligations in France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and elsewhere. As a matter of statutory or contractual obligations, we and/or our subsidiaries may retain responsibility for environmental liabilities at some of the sites of our predecessor companies, or of subsidiaries that we demerged, divested or may divest. We have disputes outstanding regarding certain sites no longer owned or operated by the Company. An adverse outcome in such disputes might have an adverse effect on our operating results. See Note D.22.d) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report and \"Item 8. Financial Information \u2014 A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information \u2014 Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings\". Environmental regulations are evolving . For example, in Europe, new or evolving regulatory regimes include the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation; the Classification and Labelling regulations applicable to hazardous chemicals; directives related to the control of major-accident hazards (the \"Seveso\" directives); the Industrial Emission regulations; the Waste Framework Directive; the Emission Trading Scheme Directive; the Water Framework Directive; the Directive on Taxation of Energy Products and Electricity; as well as other regulations aimed at preventing climate change. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities to our Company and could subject our handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants, site restoration and compliance to more rigorous scrutiny than is currently the case. Consequently, compliance with these laws could result in capital expenditures as well as other costs and liabilities, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. Risks related to financial markets(3) Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Because we sell our products in numerous countries, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to movements in exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and currencies in emerging markets. In 2022, 42.5% of our net sales were generated in the United States, 23.3% in Europe, and 34.2% in the Rest of the World region (see the definition in \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 A/ Operating results\"), including countries that are, or may in future become, subject to exchange controls (including 7.3% in China and 3.8% in Japan). While we incur expenses in those currencies, the impact of currency exchange rates on these expenses does not fully offset the impact of currency exchange rates on our revenues. As a result, currency exchange rate movements can have a considerable impact on our earnings. When deemed appropriate and when technically feasible, we enter into transactions to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risks. These efforts, when undertaken, may fail to offset the effect of adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations or financial condition. For more information concerning our exchange rate exposure, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\".PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 14 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(3)The information in this section supplements the disclosures required under IFRS 7 as presented in Note B.8.7. to our consolidated financial statements, provided at Item 18. of this annual report.Risks relating to an investment in our shares or ADSs Foreign exchange fluctuations may adversely affect the US dollar value of our ADSs and dividends (if any) regardless of our operating performance Holders of ADSs face exchange rate risks. Our ADSs trade in US dollars and our shares trade in euros. The value of the ADSs and our shares could fluctuate substantially as the exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate. If and when we pay dividends, they would be denominated in euros. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar will affect the US dollar amounts received by owners of ADSs upon conversion by the depositary of cash dividends, if any. Moreover, these fluctuations may affect the US dollar price of the ADSs on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) whether or not we pay dividends, in addition to any amounts that a holder would receive upon our liquidation or in the event of a sale of assets, merger, tender offer or similar transaction denominated in euros or any foreign currency other than US dollars. Persons holding ADSs rather than shares may have difficulty exercising certain rights as a shareholder Holders of ADSs may have more difficulty exercising their rights as a shareholder than if they directly held shares. For example, if we issue new shares and existing shareholders have the right to subscribe for a pro rata portion of the new issuance, the depositary is allowed, at its own discretion, to sell this right to subscribe for new shares for the benefit of the ADS holders instead of making that right available to such holders. In that case, ADS holders could be substantially diluted. Holders of ADSs must also instruct the depositary how to vote their shares. Because of this additional procedural step involving the depositary, the process for exercising voting rights will take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of shares. ADSs for which the depositary does not receive timely voting instructions will not be voted at any meeting. US investors may have difficulty in serving process or enforcing a judgment against us or our directors or executive officers. Sales of our shares may cause the market price of our shares or ADSs to decline Sales of large numbers of our shares, or a perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price for our shares and ADSs. To our knowledge, L'Or\u00e9al, our largest shareholder, is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the sale of the shares it holds in our Company. L'Or\u00e9al does not consider its stake in our Company as strategic. Our largest shareholder owns a significant percentage of the share capital and voting rights of Sanofi As of December 31, 2022, L'Or\u00e9al held approximately 9.38% of our issued share capital, accounting for approximately 16.77% of the voting rights (excluding treasury shares) of Sanofi. See \"Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions \u2014 A. Major Shareholders\". Affiliates of L'Or\u00e9al currently serve on our Board of Directors. To the extent L'Or\u00e9al continues to hold a large percentage of our share capital and voting rights, it will remain in a position to exert greater influence in the appointment of the directors and officers of Sanofi and in other corporate actions that require shareholders' approval.PART I ITEM 3. Key Information 15 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Item 4. Information on the Company Introduction Sanofi is a leading global healthcare company, focused on patient needs and engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing of therapeutic solutions. In the remainder of this section, a product is referred to either by its international non-proprietary name (INN) or its brand name, which is generally exclusive to the company that markets it. In most cases, the brand names of our products, which may vary from country to country, are protected by specific registrations. In this document, products are identified by their brand names used in France and/or in the US. Sanofi has three principal activities: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare, and Vaccines. These activities are operating segments within the meaning of the IFRS 8 accounting standard (see Note D.35. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report). Our activities comprise: Dupixent \u00ae; Neurology & Immunology; Rare Diseases; Oncology; Rare Blood Disorders; General Medicines Core products and General Medicines Non-Core products; Consumer Healthcare; and Vaccines. Unlike our Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare activities, which are also operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8, our Pharmaceuticals activities are franchises whose performance is monitored primarily on the basis of net sales; the products sold by each of those franchises are included in our Pharmaceuticals operating segment. For a presentation of the net sales of our activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to \"Item 5.A.2. \u2014 Results of Operations \u2014 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021\". In 2022, healthcare authorities issued a number of marketing approvals for Sanofi products. In the United States and Europe, Dupixent \u00ae (dupilumab) obtained full authorization for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, and extensions to expand the severe asthma indication to children aged 6 to 11 years and the moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis indication to children aged 6 months to 5 years. At the end of September 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent \u00ae as the first and only treatment indicated to treat prurigo nodularis for adult patients in the United States, and on December 15, 2022, Dupixent \u00ae became the first and only targeted medicine approved by the European Commission (EC) to treat prurigo nodularis. The FDA also approved Xenpozyme\u00ae (olipudase alfa-rpcp) for the treatment of non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in adult and pediatric patients. The EC granted marketing authorization for Enjaymo\u00ae (sutimlimab) for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). CAD is a rare, serious and chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy red blood cells and causes their rupture, known as hemolysis. In Vaccines, the EC approved Beyfortus\u00ae (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. Beyfortus\u00ae is the first and only single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population; it is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. The EC also approved VidPrevtyn\u00ae Beta as a booster for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Designed to provide broad protection against multiple variants, this protein-based vaccine is based on the Beta variant antigen and includes GSK's pandemic adjuvant. VidPrevtyn \u00ae Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral COVID vaccine. Collaborations are essential to our business and a certain number of our products, whether on the market or under development, are in-licensed products relying on third-party rights or technologies. A. History and development of the Company The current Sanofi corporation was incorporated under the laws of France in 1994 as a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme , a form of limited liability company, for a term of 99 years. Since May 2011, we have operated under the commercial name \"Sanofi\" (formerly known as Sanofi-Aventis). Our registered office is located at 46, avenue de la Grande Arm\u00e9e - 75017 Paris - France, our main telephone number is +33 1 53 77 40 00, and our website (which contains information about the company and information filed with and provided to the SEC) is Our principal US subsidiary's office is located at 55 Corporate Drive, Bridgewater, NJ 08807; telephone: +1 (908) 981 5000. The SEC maintains an internet site at that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Main events over the last three years On January 23, 2020, following a tender offer, we acquired control of Synthorx , a US clinical-stage biotechnology company based in La Jolla, California, focused on prolonging and improving the lives of people suffering from cancer and autoimmune disorders. On September 28, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Principia Biopharma Inc ., a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for autoimmune diseases.On April 8, 2021, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of Kymab , a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing fully human monoclonal antibodies with a focus on immune-mediated diseases and immuno-oncology therapeutics.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the Company 16 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022www.sanofi.com. http://www.sec.govDupixent\u00ae (dupilumab)(1) - By leveraging the product's unique mechanism of action targeting the type 2 inflammation pathway and its favorable safety profile. Sanofi has raised the Dupixent\u00ae sales peak ambition to more than \u20ac13 billion (2). Vaccines - Our Vaccines business is expected to deliver mid-to-high single digit net sales growth(3) through differentiated products, market expansions and launches. Contributors to growth are expected to be pediatric combinations, boosters, influenza vaccines, meningitis and the launch of nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody addressing Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (4). Sanofi has progressed in the field of mRNA technology with the recently established Center of Excellence and the integration of Translate Bio. Of the 10 new vaccine candidates planned to enter the clinic by 2025, 6 will use mRNA technologies to target diseases with high unmet needs and disease burden such as chlamydia and acne. The long-term ambition is to more than double Vaccines sales by the end of the decade based on 2018 sales. Pipeline - We are focusing our investments on priority projects, including six potentially transformative therapies in oncology, immunology, hematology, neurology, and vaccines.On September 2021, of Translate Bio , a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company. On November 9, 2021, Sanofi completed the acquisition of Kadmon Holdings, Inc . a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and markets transformative therapies for disease areas of significant unmet medical need. On February 8, 2022, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of the immuno-oncology company Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amunix), thereby gaining access to Amunix's innovative Pro-XTEN TM technology and a promising pipeline of immunotherapies. On May 3, 2022, Sanofi's General Meeting of Shareholders approved the decision to distribute approximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI , a European leader in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), in the form of an exceptional dividend in kind to Sanofi shareholders. On the dividend payment date of May 10, 2022 (further to the admission of EUROAPI shares to listing on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on May 6, 2022), Sanofi divested control over EUROAPI and its subsidiaries, resulting in their deconsolidation from the Sanofi consolidated financial statements as of that date. On June 17, 2022 (the date of delivery of the EUROAPI shares to the French State via the French Tech Souverainet\u00e9 fund), EPIC Bpifrance acquired a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI. Following completion of those transactions, Sanofi retains an equity interest of 30.1% in EUROAPI, which has been accounted for using the equity method since the date of loss of control (see note D.6. to the consolidated financial statements). More detailed information about these changes is provided in Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F. B. Business overview B.1. Strategy The market context for Sanofi A number of fundamental trends continue to point to a positive outlook for the pharmaceutical industry. The global population is growing, and aging, and unmet medical needs remain high. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, health needs have further increased, strengthening the key roles of innovation in R&D activities and cutting-edge manufacturing. The industry has taken steps to increase R&D productivity, with the objective of launching a higher number of innovative medicines and vaccines. Patients around the world - including a rising middle class in emerging markets - are demanding better healthcare, empowered by access to more and more information. It is a particularly exciting time scientifically and technologically: the promise of genomics is being realized, immuno-oncology is transforming cancer treatments, and big data is generating new insights into how to diagnose and treat diseases. Digital technologies and advanced data analytics are having a transformative effect across sales and marketing activities, R&D and manufacturing, and are acting as enablers for new businesses. At the same time, increased geopolitical uncertainties, the economic crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, supply shortages, and issues around budget tightening will continue to put pressure on healthcare costs, and on the entire healthcare value chain. Although we believe that pharmaceuticals and vaccines will remain a fundamentally attractive business within that value chain, the bar for innovation will most likely continue to rise. Payers will continue to put scrutiny on prices and reimbursement criteria, and demand demonstration of real-life outcomes to confirm the efficacy of medicines and vaccines. This will be coupled with more innovative pricing and contracting practices, and more transparent policies. In view of growing concerns over increasing healthcare costs across global markets, the pharmaceutical industry will be increasingly judged by its contribution to improved access for patients and to the development of innovative, highly cost-effective medicines. Strategic framework The Sanofi \"Play to Win\" strategy is organized around four key priorities: (1) focus on growth; (2) lead with innovation; 1) Focus on growthPART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 17 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(3) accelerate efficiency; and (4) reinvent how we work to drive innovation and growth. (1)In partnership with Regeneron.

Specialty Care Dupixent\u00ae Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. Dupilumab is jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation. The dupilumab development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase III trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple inflammatory diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, a pre-filled syringe for use in a clinic or at home by self-administration as a subcutaneous injection or in a pre-filled pen for at-home administration, providing patients with a more convenient option. Dupixent \u00ae is available in all major markets including the US (since April 2017), most European Union countries (the first launch was in Germany in December 2017), and Japan (since April 2018). Atopic Dermatitis Moderate-to-severe AD, a form of eczema and a chronic inflammatory disease, is characterized by rashes that sometimes cover much of the body and can include intense, persistent itching and skin dryness, cracking, redness, crusting and oozing. 85 to 90 percent of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age, which can often continue through adulthood.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 19 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022In 2014 the FDA granted Dupixent\u00ae Breakthrough Therapy designation and after a Priority Review evaluation, in March 2017 it granted Dupixent\u00ae marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. In 2016, the FDA granted Dupixent\u00ae Breakthrough Therapy designation for adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years and in March 2019, the FDA extended the marketing authorization for this age group. In 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for Dupixent\u00ae for the treatment of severe AD in children aged 6 months to 11 years. On May 26, 2020, Dupixent\u00ae was approved as the first biologic medicine for children aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe AD. On June 7, 2022, after accepting Dupixent\u00ae for Priority Review in February, the FDA approved Dupixent\u00ae for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable, making Dupixent\u00ae the first biologic medicine to significantly reduce signs and symptoms in children as young as 6 months. The European Commission (EC) approved Dupixent\u00ae in September 2017 for use in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy, and extended the marketing authorization in August 2019 to include adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. On November 30, 2020, the EC extended the marketing authorization to children aged 6 to 11 years with severe AD and on June 28, 2021, the Dupixent\u00ae Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) was updated with long-term data for up to 3 years, reinforcing the product's well-established safety profile in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. On January 27, 2023 the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Dupixent \u00ae recommending expanded approval in the EU to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. The EC is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. On June 19, 2020, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China approved Dupixent \u00ae for adults for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD after identifying dupilumab as an overseas medicine regarded as urgently needed in clinical practice, leading to an expedited review and approval process. On December 28, 2020, the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) officially announced the results of the 2020 National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) negotiations, with Dupixent \u00ae 300 mg included in the updated NRDL effective March 1, 2021. Dupixent\u00ae was approved in China in September 2021 for adolescents aged 12-17 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The indication for children aged 6 years and over, along with the adolescent and adult AD indications, was included in the current NRDL reimbursement scope, which was reviewed during the Dupixent \u00ae NRDL renewal in 2022 in accordance with the two-year cycle for the China access process. In March 2022, at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD 2022), Sanofi presented results from a long-term efficacy open-label study where dupilumab demonstrated robust and sustained efficacy with progressive improvement of AD signs and symptoms in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who completed up to 4 years of treatment: the longest duration of data for any biologic medicine in this disease. Additionally, the long-term safety data from a 52-week open- label extension trial in 6 months to 5 years reinforces the well-established safety profile of Dupixent \u00ae observed across all other approved age groups. This data built on the existing wealth of evidence supporting the selective way Dupixent\u00ae inhibits IL4/IL-13 pathways, both key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation, thereby significantly improving itch and skin lesions and other important measures that impact a patient's quality of life. Asthma Dupixent\u00ae was granted marketing authorization by the FDA in October 2018 as an add-on maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. In May 2019, the European Commission approved Dupixent \u00ae for use as an add-on maintenance treatment in severe asthma patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 inflammation whose symptoms are inadequately reduced by other treatments. In September 2020, new long-term data from a Phase III open-label extension trial showed sustained improvement in lung function and reduction in severe exacerbations in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma. On May 17, 2021, detailed results from a Phase III trial showed Dupixent \u00ae significantly reduced severe asthma attacks, and within two weeks rapidly improved lung function in children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Moreover, Dupixent \u00ae significantly improved overall asthma symptom control and reduced an airway biomarker of type 2 inflammation, called fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), that plays a major role in asthma. In October 2021, the FDA approved Dupixent\u00ae as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged 6 to 11 years with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma, thereby bringing a new treatment for children who may be suffering from life-threatening asthma attacks and poor lung function affecting their ability to breathe, which could potentially continue into adulthood. On April 7, 2022, the European Commission approved Dupixent \u00ae for use in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), whose symptoms are inadequately reduced with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 20 20-F 2022Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) CRSwNP a disease of the upper airway that obstructs the sinuses and nasal passages. It can lead to breathing difficulties, nasal congestion and discharge, reduced or loss of sense of smell and taste, and facial pressure. In June 2019, the FDA approved Dupixent\u00ae for use with other medicines to treat CRSwNP in adults whose disease is not controlled. In October 2019, the European Commission approved Dupixent\u00ae for use as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids in adults with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery do not provide adequate disease control. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) EoE is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly; swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. In severe cases, a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper calorific intake and adequate nutrition. Of the approximately 209,000 patients aged 12 years and older living with EoE in the US who are currently treated with therapies not specifically approved for the disease, about 42,000 continue to experience symptoms despite multiple treatments. On September 14, 2020, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent \u00ae for the treatment of patients 12 years and older with EoE, and subsequently accepted the file for Priority Review on April 4, 2022. On May 20, 2022, the FDA approved Dupixent\u00ae to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older. With this approval, Dupixent\u00ae became the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in the U.S. On December 16, 2022, EMA's CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending the approval of dupilumab in the EU to treat adults and adolescents with EoE. On January 30, 2023, the EC expanded marketing authorization for Dupixent in the EU to treat EoE in adults and adolescents 12 years and older, submissions to regulatory authorities in additional countries are planned in 2023. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for children under 12 years of age with EoE. On July 14, 2022, a Dupixent \u00ae Phase III trial showed positive results in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE, making this the fifth pediatric pivotal trial across three type 2 inflammatory diseases to reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent\u00ae. The corresponding data will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world, starting with the FDA in 2023. Prurigo Nodularis (PN) Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient's quality of life among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense, persistent itch, with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful - with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin - and can negatively affect mental health, daily living activities and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. The FDA evaluated the Dupixent\u00ae application for prurigo nodularis under Priority Review on May 31, 2022. On September 29, 2022, the FDA approved Dupixent\u00ae for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis. With this approval, Dupixent\u00ae became the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the US. The FDA approval was based on data from two Phase III trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent\u00ae in adults with prurigo nodularis. Efficacy in these trials assessed the proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful reduction in itch, clearing of skin, or both. On December 15, 2022, the EC has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent \u00ae in the EU to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy, after the positive recommendation earlier on November 11, 2022. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) CSU is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the sudden onset of hives on the skin and/or swelling deep under the skin. Despite standard-of-care treatment, people with CSU often experience symptoms including a persistent itch or burning sensation, which can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life. Swelling often occurs on the face, hands and feet, but can also affect the throat and upper airways. On July 29, 2021 a pivotal Phase III trial evaluating Dupixent \u00ae in patients with moderate-to-severe CSU met its primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks. Adding Dupixent\u00ae to standard- of-care antihistamines significantly reduced itch and hives for biologic-naive patients, compared to those treated with antihistamines alone (placebo) in Study A (the first of two trials) of the LIBERTY CUPID clinical program. Study B of the clinical trial evaluated Dupixent\u00ae in adults and adolescents who remain symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and are intolerant or incomplete responders to an anti-IgE therapeutic (omalizumab). Although positive numerical trends in reducing itch and hives were observed, the study was stopped due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis. The safety data were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent \u00ae in its approved indications. In December 2022, CSU was submitted to FDA, if granted Dupixent\u00ae has the potential to add additional ~308K patients in the US. Life cycle management Dupixent\u00ae is currently being evaluated in clinical development programs for diseases that are driven by type 2 inflammation. These include, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic inducible cold Global Research & Development\".PART I ITEM 4.

See Note D.22.b.) to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. Neurology & Immunology Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurological disease in which a person's immune system attacks the central nervous system, damaging myelin, the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers. This causes a break in communication between the brain and the rest of the body, ultimately destroying the nerves themselves, and causing irreversible damage. More than 2.5 million people suffer from MS worldwide. Our MS franchise consists of Aubagio \u00ae (teriflunomide), a once-daily, oral immunomodulator, and Lemtrada\u00ae monoclonal antibody. Both products treat patients with relapsing forms of MS. Aubagio\u00ae Aubagio\u00ae (teriflunomide), a small molecule is a once-daily oral therapy.Aubagio \u00ae is approved in more than 80 countries around the world including the US (since September 2012) for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS; the EU (since August 2013) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting MS; and China (since July 2018). In June 2021, the European Commission (EC) approved Aubagio\u00ae for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In the European Union, generic competition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2017, Sanofi reached settlement with all 20 generic Aubagio \u00ae ANDA first filers, granting each a royalty-free license to enter the US market on March 12, 2023. Lemtrada\u00ae Lemtrada\u00ae (alemtuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD52 antigen. Lemtrada\u00ae is administered by intravenous infusion as two short courses 12 months apart; for the majority of patients no further treatment is necessary, making Lemtrada\u00ae the only disease-modifying therapy (DMT) that can provide long term durable efficacy in the absence of continuous dosing. Lemtrada\u00ae is approved in more than 70 countries including the EU (since September 2013) and the US (since November 2014). Because of its safety profile, the FDA approved the use of Lemtrada\u00ae in patients with relapsing forms of MS who have had an inadequate response to two or more drugs indicated for the treatment of MS, and included a black-box warning on potential side effects. In the US, Lemtrada\u00ae is only available through a restricted distribution program called the Lemtrada\u00ae Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. In January 2020, the EMA updated the indication for Lemtrada\u00ae to include treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis if the disease is highly active despite treatment with at least one disease-modifying therapy, or if the disease is worsening rapidly. The EMA also added new contra-indications for patients with certain heart, circulation or bleeding disorders, and those who have autoimmune disorders other than MS. Bayer Healthcare receives contingent payments based on alemtuzumab global sales revenue.

Information on the company 22 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Rare diseases Our Rare Diseases business is focused on products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases and other rare chronic debilitating diseases of high unmet medical need, including lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), a group of metabolic disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies. Cerezyme\u00ae Cerezyme\u00ae (imiglucerase) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat Gaucher disease, a chronic, inherited, progressive and potentially life-threatening LSD. Gaucher disease is caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase; this causes a fatty substance called glucosylceramide (also called GL-1) to build up in certain areas of the body including the spleen, liver, and bone. Gaucher disease exhibits diverse manifestations, a broad range of age of onset of symptoms, and a wide clinical spectrum of disease severity. It is estimated that Gaucher disease occurs in approximately one in 120,000 newborns in the general population and one in 850 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population worldwide, but incidence and patient severity vary among regions. Cerezyme \u00ae has been marketed in the US since 1994, in the EU since 1997, in Japan since 1998 and in China since 2008, and is approved to treat Type 1 Gaucher disease in more than 85 countries. It has also been approved to treat the systemic symptoms of Type 3 Gaucher disease in most non-US markets, including the EU and Japan. Cerezyme \u00ae is typically given by intravenous infusions for 1-2 hours every two weeks at an infusion center, a doctor's office, or at home as medically appropriate. Cerdelga\u00ae Cerdelga\u00ae (eliglustat) is the first and only first-line oral therapy for Gaucher disease Type 1 adult patients. A potent, highly specific ceramide analog inhibitor of GL-1 synthesis with broad tissue distribution, Cerdelga\u00ae has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of naive Gaucher disease patients and in patients who switch from enzyme replacement therapy. Cerdelga\u00ae has been approved to treat Type 1 Gaucher disease in the US (2014), and in the EU and Japan (2015). It is also in development for the treatment of type I Gaucher disease in pediatric patients. See \"\u2014 B.5. Global Research & Development\". Myozyme\u00ae and Lumizyme\u00ae Myozyme\u00ae (alglucosidase alfa) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat both Infantile Onset and Late Onset Pompe disease (IOPD and LOPD). Pompe disease is an inherited, progressive and often fatal neuromuscular disease, caused by a genetic deficiency or dysfunction of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) that results in the glycogen in the muscles' cells. For infantile-onset Pompe disease, symptoms begin within a few months of birth and there is impact to the heart in addition to skeletal muscle weakness. Other symptoms include difficulties breathing, frequent chest infections, problems feeding that result in failure to gain weight as expected, and failure to meet certain developmental milestones. Patients with late-onset Pompe disease typically present symptoms any time after the first year of life to late adulthood and rarely manifest cardiac problems. The hallmark symptom of late-onset Pompe disease is skeletal muscle weakness, which often leads to walking disability and reduced respiratory function. Patients often require wheelchairs to assist with mobility and may require mechanical ventilation to help with breathing. Pompe disease occurs in approximately one in 40,000 newborns worldwide, but incidence and patient severity vary among regions. Myozyme \u00ae was first approved in 2006 in the EU and has since been approved in more than 70 countries. In the US, alglucosidase alfa has been marketed as Lumizyme\u00ae since 2010. Nexviazyme\u00ae Nexviazyme\u00ae (avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt) is a monotherapy treatment designed for spectrum of infantile-onset and late-onset Pompe disease (IOPD, LOPD), for both switch and na\u00efve patients. It is the first new treatment option approved for the Pompe community in more than 15 years. Nexviazyme\u00ae was first approved in the US by the FDA on August 6, 2021 for LOPD patients aged one and above, and has successfully launched in countries like the US, Japan and Australia, where the majority of eligible patients have switched to Nexviazyme \u00ae. On June 24, 2022, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Nexviadyme\u00ae as a potential new standard of care for the long-term treatment of both LOPD and IOPD. In 2023, it is anticipated that Nexviazyme\u00ae will be launched in many additional markets worldwide. Investment in the clinical development of Nexviazyme\u00ae continues with an ongoing trial in patients with IOPD aged less than 12 months. Nexviazyme\u00ae is administered as a monotherapy enzyme replacement therapy every two weeks. Fabrazyme\u00ae Fabrazyme\u00ae (agalsidase beta) is an enzyme replacement therapy used to treat Fabry disease. Fabry disease (FD) is a multisystemic, progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or absent lysosomal - galactosidase A activity resulting in progressive globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) accumulation in the lysosomes of various tissues. Fabry disease affects both genders. With age, progressive organ damage develops, leading to potentially life-threatening renal, cardiac and/or cerebrovascular complications. Fabry disease is characterized by different symptom severities and rates of progression, ranging from classic disease with early symptom onset to late onset disease with cardiac and/or renal complications later in life. Fabry disease occurs in approximately one in 35,000 newborns worldwide, but incidence and patient severity vary among regions. Fabrazyme \u00ae has been marketed in the EU since 2001 and in the US since 2003, and is approved in more than 70 countries.PART I ITEM 4.

Strategy\" ) has been implemented to drive innovation and growth so that we can seek breakthroughs with our most promising medicines, to address significant patient needs. Global research and development (R&D) has focused efforts in therapeutic areas where patient needs are most urgent: oncology, immunology, neurology, rare diseases, and rare blood disorders. As part of our strategic framework, five potentially transformative therapies in areas of high unmet patient need were prioritized: fitusiran and nirsevimab (prevention of respiratory syncytial virus). Our aspiration is to build an R&D pipeline of first-in-class or truly differentiated best-in-class medicines, with two-thirds of the biologic compounds and two-thirds of the pipeline directly derived from Sanofi internal research. However, discovering and developing new medicines is a costly, lengthy, and uncertain process and our continuous investments in R&D for future products and for the launches of newly registered medicines could result in increased costs without a proportionate increase in revenues. See \" Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors\" for further information. In 2022, the reshaping and consolidation of our R&D portfolio in oncology and immune diseases was pursued, as exemplified by the acquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (adding to our early portfolio SAR446309, a HER2 T cell engager, formerly known as AMX-818); the restructuring of our global immuno-oncology license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and collaboration and license agreements with Exscientia, Blackstone Life Sciences, Seagen, IGM Biosciences, Innovent Biologics and Innate Pharma (for further information, see sections \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 A. History and development of the Company\"; \"\u2014 B.1. Strategy\"; \"\u2014 B.2.

Phase I studies are the first studies performed in humans, who are mainly healthy volunteers, except for studies in oncology, where Phase I studies are performed in patients. Their main objective is to assess the tolerability, the pharmacokinetic profile (the way the product is distributed and metabolized in the body and the manner by which it is eliminated) and where possible the pharmacodynamic profiles of the new drug (i.e. how the product may react on some receptors). Phase II studies are early controlled studies in a limited number of patients under closely monitored conditions to show efficacy and short-term safety, and to determine the dose and regimen for Phase III studies. Phase III studies have the primary objective of demonstrating or confirming the therapeutic benefit and the safety of the new drug in the intended indication and population. They are designed to provide an adequate basis for registration.PART I ITEM 4.

SAR442501 is an anti-FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) antibody (Fab format) that directly targets overactive FGFR3 in achondroplasia, a skeletal dysplasia with high unmet medical need. SAR442501 is being investigated in a Phase I study for the treatment of patients with achondroplasia with unfused growth plates (typically younger than 18 years of age). SAR443809 , a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the activated fragment of factor B (termed Bb) in the alternative pathway of the complement system, is being evaluated in a Phase I trial for the treatment of rare renal diseases. SAR439459 is a monoclonal antibody targeting transforming growth factor beta (TGF ); in December 2022, a Phase I study was initiated to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of a single dose of SAR439459 in adult participants with Osteogenesis imperfecta, also called brittle bone disease, a rare disease in which bones fracture easily. Orphan Drug Designation was granted by the FDA for this indication. e) Rare Blood Disorders ALTUVIIIOTM (efanesoctocog alfa/BIVV001) is an investigational factor VIII replacement therapy developed in collaboration with Sobi\u00ae for people with hemophilia A, a rare and life-threatening bleeding disorder. In 2022, the FDA accepted for priority review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for ALTUVIIIOTM for the treatment of hemophilia A. On February 22, 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ALTUVIIIO TM. The approval was supported by data from the pivotal XTEND-1 Phase III study, that demonstrated a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds and superiority to prior factor prophylaxis based on an intra-patient comparison in people 12 years of age or older. A Phase III study evaluating efanesoctocog alfa in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age is ongoing; availability of data and regulatory submission in the European Union are expected in 2023. Fitusiran (SAR439774) is a siRNA targeting antithrombin developed in collaboration with Alnylam for the prophylactic treatment of patients with hemophilia A or B, rare congenital bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency of factor VIII and IX, respectively. In 2022, positive data were reported from the Phase III ATLAS-PPX study evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-monthly fitusiran (80 mg) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over) with severe hemophilia A or B who were previously treated with prior factor or bypassing agent prophylaxis. Collectively with results from the ATLAS A/B and ATLAS-INH Phase III studies, these data add to a growing body of evidence supporting the potential of 80 mg dose, monthly fitusiran prophylaxis to transform treatment for all people with hemophilia. The clinical program is continuing with an amended protocol with two lower doses to optimize the benefit/risk profile of fitusiran. Data with lower doses are expected in the second half of 2023; the first submission is planned for 2024. The ATLAS-PEDS study assessing fitusiran in pediatric patients aged 12 years and under is ongoing. Rilzabrutinib (SAR444671) is being investigated in a Phase III trial for the treatment of adults and adolescents with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP); the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for this indication. In 2022, a Phase II study assessing rilzabrutinib in adults with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) enrolled its first participants. SAR445088 is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits C1s, thereby inhibiting classical pathway (CP) of complement activity. Activation of the CP of complement is associated with a variety of immune disorders involving the presence of autoantibodies. Inhibition of autoantibody-mediated CP activation on the surface of erythrocytes via C1s binding prevents complement opsonin deposition on red blood cells and protects them from phagocytosis and extravascular hemolysis in autoimmune hemolytic anemia such as cold agglutinin disease (CAD); SAR445088 is currently under evaluation in a Phase II study in this indication.

Sarclisa\u00ae is also under investigation in a Phase II trial for the subcutaneous treatment of adults with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAiHA), a rare blood disorder. Libtayo\u00ae (cemiplimab) is a monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1), approved in several countries for the treatment of skin cancers (metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma), for the treatment of NSCLC, and for second-line treatment of cervical cancer. Libtayo\u00ae has been jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement originally entered into in 2015. As detailed in section \" \u2014 B.5. Global research & development\", the agreement was amended and restated in June 2022 and Sanofi granted Regeneron worldwide exclusive license rights to Libtayo \u00ae. In January 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron announced the voluntary withdrawal of the supplemental Biologics License Application for second-line treatment of cervical cancer in the US. In the last quarter of 2022, Libtayo\u00ae was approved in Europe and in Japan for second-line treatment of cervical cancer. In November 2022, Libtayo\u00ae in chemotherapy combination was approved by the FDA for the first-line treatment of non small cell lung cancer. Libtayo\u00ae is currently under review by the EMA in the same indication; the final decision is expected in February 2023. Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the IL-4 receptor subunit and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, jointly developed with Regeneron. Dupixent\u00ae has received regulatory approvals in several countries for use in patients with AD, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), EoE or prurigo are provided below. Atopic dermatitis In February 2022, the product was approved in China for the treatment of children aged 6-11 years with moderate-to-severe AD. In June 2022, it was approved in the US for the treatment of children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD. Asthma : Dupixen t\u00ae was approved in the EU in April 2022 for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation. The approval was based on Phase III data showing significant reduction of severe asthma attacks and also improvement of lung function and health-related quality of life for children. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) In May 2022, the FDA approved Dupixent \u00ae to treat patients with EoE aged 12 years and older after granting the medicine Priority Review. In January 2023, Dupixent\u00ae was approved by European Commission for the treatment of patients with EoE aged 12 years and older.A Phase III trial assessing the investigational use of Dupixent \u00ae in children aged 1 to 11 years with EoE met its primary endpoint of histological disease remission at 16 weeks with both higher and lower dose weight-tiered regimens. Filing for the treatment of this pediatric population is expected in 2023. Prurigo nodularis Dupixent\u00ae was approved in the US in September 2022 after Priority Review for the treatment of adults with prurigo nodularis. With this approval, Dupixent\u00ae became the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the US. In December 2022, the European Commission expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab) in the EU to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases.PART I ITEM 4.

(b) Hib = Haemophilus influenzae type b.Enhancements of existing vaccines Fluzone\u00ae: QIV HD is a higher dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine licensed in the US and in Europe for the elderly population, who do not respond as well to standard-dose influenza vaccines due to aging of the immune system (immuno-senescence). Safety and efficacy in the pediatric population will be assessed in a Phase III trial. mRNA Quadrivalent influenza vaccine is a quadrivalent influenza vaccine based on mRNA technology, which is currently in Phase I. Following results of Phase I, the product should be moving to Phase III in 2023. Shan6\u00ae is an all-in-one liquid hexavalent combination vaccine. It comprises detoxified whole-cell pertussis as well as diphtheria influenzae type b PRP-T, inactivated poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 and hepatitis B virus components. Shan6 \u00ae has been approved in India and obtained WHO pre-qualification in November 2022. Following a strategic assessment of the whole-cell pertussis market, Sanofi has decided to cease the production of the Shan5\u00ae and Shan6\u00ae vaccines produced in Hyderabad, India. MenQuadfi\u00ae: Sanofi's Men ACYW-TT vaccine is our latest advance in meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccination, designed to help protect an expanded patient group including infants and adolescents through older adults. MenQuadfi\u00ae is already licensed in the US (for people aged 2 years and over), and in Europe and several other countries (for people aged 12 months and over). Marketing authorization is also pending in additional countries. In January 2022, MenQuadfi \u00ae received WHO for pre-qualification for people aged 12 months and above. Additionally, Phase III trials are ongoing to evaluate immunogenicity and safety in infants aged 6 weeks and above, and allow for extension of the age indication down to 6 weeks of age. Rabies Vaccine: a next-generation purified human rabies vaccine (VRVg) is under development, aimed at replacing both of Sanofi's currently commercialized rabies vaccines (Imovax\u00ae Rabies and Verorab\u00ae). It will be cultured on Vero cells and will be free of animal or human material. VRVg is currently in Phase III trials in order to support pre and post exposure indications. Vero Yellow Fever (vYF) vaccine candidate is a next generation freeze-dried live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine produced on a Vero cell line, for subcutaneous and intra-muscular administration in people aged nine months and older. This vaccine aims to replace Stamaril \u00ae and YF-VAX\u00ae with a single product. In January 2020, the first Phase I/II trial was initiated in the US. In the first quarter of 2023, Phase II data against standard of care will be available. Novel targets Nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody engineered to have a long half-life, so that only one dose would be needed for the entire respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season to provide passive immunity and prevent RSV infection in all infants for their first RSV season (and in high-risk infants, for their first and second RSV seasons). Sanofi has an agreement with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize nirsevimab. The positive primary analysis of the Phase IIb trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2020, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nirsevimab, has been confirmed and enhanced in other Phase II and Phase III trials. The Phase III MELODY study, initiated in 2019, achieved its primary endpoint of protection against medically attended RSV lower respiratory tract infection in healthy full-term and late pre-term infants. The MEDLEY Phase II/III study, conducted in preterm infants and infants with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease, showed positive safety and pharmacokinetics when compared to standard of care. Regulatory submissions started in 2022. Nirsevimab, which will be commercialized under the name of Beyfortus \u00ae, received European and UK approvals in November 2022. The file was also submitted in the US, and FDA acceptance was received in January 2023. First launches are expected in 2023. Nirsevimab was also selected by the Japanese Agency for Medical Research and Development as a priority medicine, and received breakthrough therapy designation in China in January 2021. We initiated a Phase III study in China in November 2021. RSV toddler vaccine : Sanofi has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US National Institute of Health (NIH) to develop a live attenuated RSV vaccine for immunization of infants aged 6 months and older. We initiated the Phase I/II study in the US in September 2020, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of two doses of an intranasal delivery device in infants, the goal being to extend the immunity offered by nirsevimab to additional RSV seasons. Positive data from this study were obtained in the fourth quarter of 2022. RSV older adult vaccine: Sanofi initiated Phase I with an mRNA vaccine against RSV for the older adults population. This vaccine aims at providing protection against RSV as a standalone vaccine, and in combination with other respiratory viruses in the future. Meningococcal Group B (Men B): this vaccine candidate is intended to provide active immunization against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (Men B) for all age groups. A Phase I/II study was initiated in March 2021 with positive interim data in the fourth quarter of 2022. Early-stage development studies are underway to combine the four meningococcal serogroups represented in MenQuadfi \u00ae with Men B to a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) : Sanofi is collaborating with SK Chemicals (South Korea) to develop a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that will provide expanded protection against pneumococcal disease globally in at risk populations and in different age groups. Data from Phase II studies assembled between mid-2022 and mid-2023 will define the pathway to Phase III.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 40 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022B.5.3. R&D Expenditures for late stage development Expenditures on research and development amounted to \u20ac6,706 million in 2022 (\u20ac5,692 million in 2021), comprising \u20ac5,067 million in the Pharmaceuticals segment; \u20ac187 million in the Consumer Healthcare segment; \u20ac936 million in the Vaccines segment; and \u20ac516 million allocated to \"Other\", representing the R&D support function. Research and development expenditures represented approximately 15.6% of our net sales in 2022, compared with approximately 15.1% in 2021. The increase was mainly due to additional investments in Immunology and the mRNA vaccines platform, while cost control efforts continue. Preclinical research expenditures in the Pharmaceuticals segment amounted to \u20ac884 million in 2022, compared with \u20ac718 million in 2021. Clinical development expenditure in the Pharmaceuticals segment amounted to \u20ac3,460 million in 2022; compared with \u20ac2,892 million in 2021. B.6.

A breakdown of our aggregate net sales by geographical region is presented in \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 Results of Operations \u2014 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021.\" Sanofi is the ninth largest pharmaceutical company globally by sales. Our main markets in terms of net sales are respectively: Although specific distribution patterns vary by country, we sell prescription drugs primarily to wholesale drug distributors, independent and chain retail drug outlets, hospitals, clinics, managed-care organizations and government institutions. Some products in Rare Diseases and Oncology may also be sold directly to physicians. With the exception of Consumer Healthcare products, our drugs are ordinarily dispensed to patients by pharmacies upon presentation of a doctor's prescription. Our Consumer Healthcare products are also sold and distributed through e-commerce, which is a growing trend in consumer behavior. Our vaccines are sold and distributed through multiple channels including physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, private companies and distributors in the private sector, and governmental entities and non-governmental organizations in the public and international donor markets. We use a range of channels from in-person to digital to disseminate information about and promote our products among healthcare professionals, ensuring that the channels not only cover our latest therapeutic advances but also our established prescription products, which satisfy patient needs in some therapy areas. We regularly exhibit at major medical congresses. In some countries, products are also marketed directly to patients by way of television, radio, newspapers and magazines, and digital channels (such as the internet). National education and prevention campaigns can be used to improve patients' knowledge of their conditions. Our sales representatives, who work closely with healthcare professionals, use their expertise to promote and provide information on our drugs. They represent our values on a day-to-day basis and are required to adhere to a code of conduct and to internal policies on which they receive training. Although we market most of our products through our own sales forces, we have entered into and continue to form partnerships to co-promote/co-market certain products in specific geographical areas. Our major alliances are detailed at \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 Financial Presentation of Alliances.\" See also \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 We rely on third parties for the discovery, manufacture and marketing of some of our products.\" B.6.2. Competition The pharmaceutical industry continues to experience significant changes in its competitive environment. There are four primary types of competition in the prescription pharmaceutical market:PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 41 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022competition among vaccine companies to research and develop new patented products or address unmet medical needs; and competition among different patented (or non-patented) vaccine products marketed for the same therapeutic indication. the centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs derived from biotechnologies; new active substances designed for human use to treat HIV, viral diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and auto-immune diseases; orphan drugs; and innovative products for veterinary use. When an application for human use is submitted to the EMA, the scientific evaluation of the application is carried out by the EMA's CHMP and a scientific opinion is prepared. This opinion is sent to the European Commission, which adopts the final decision and grants an EU marketing authorization. Such a marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU, and the drug may be marketed within all EU Member States; if a company is seeking a national marketing authorization in more than one Member State, two procedures are available to facilitate the granting of harmonized national authorizations across Member States: the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure. Both procedures are based on the recognition by national competent authorities of a first assessment performed by the regulatory authority of one Member State; national authorizations are still possible, but are only for products intended for commercialization in a single EU Member State or for line extensions to existing national product licenses.Generics manufacturers who have received all necessary regulatory approvals for a product may decide to launch a generic version before the patent expiry date, even in cases where the owner of the original product has already commenced patent infringement litigation against the generics manufacturer. Such launches are said to be \"at risk\" for the promoter of the generic product because it may be required to pay damages to the owner of the original product in the context of patent infringement litigation; however, such launches may also significantly impair the profitability of the pharmaceutical company whose product is challenged. Drug manufacturers may also face intra-product competition through parallel trading, or parallel importation or reimportation, where permitted. This may take place when drugs sold in a foreign market under the same brand name as in a domestic market are permitted to be imported into that domestic market by parallel traders or importers, who may repackage or resize the original product or sell it through alternative channels such as mail order or the internet. This situation is of particular relevance to the EU with its common market, where such practices have been encouraged by the current regulatory framework. Parallel traders or importers take advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions (such as intermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices. Finally, pharmaceutical companies face illegal competition from substandard and falsified drugs. The WHO estimates that falsified products account for 10% in low- and middle-income countries. All therapeutic areas are affected, including vaccines. Worldwide, falsified products are an issue in part due to the exponential increase in internet connectivity of those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of substandard and falsified medical products. The same types of competition apply in Consumer Healthcare, except that in this business there are two types of generic products: private labels and store brands. In Vaccines, there are two primary types of competition: Generics and biosimilars are not an issue in vaccines at present, since vaccines are still mostly produced from proprietary viral or bacterial strains. As with pharmaceutical drugs, vaccine manufacturers can face competition through parallel trading. However, the extent of such practices is limited by the need for cold chain distribution of vaccines, and by the fact that vaccines are sold and administered through pharmacies or dispensing physicians. B.6.3. Regulatory framework The pharmaceutical and health-related biotechnology sectors are highly regulated. National and supranational health authorities administer a vast array of legal and regulatory requirements that dictate pre-approval testing (including testing in human subjects) and quality standards to maximize the safety and efficacy of a new medical product. These authorities also regulate product labeling, manufacturing, importation/exportation, safety reporting and marketing, as well as mandatory post-approval requirements and commitments. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that a license or approval to market will be granted. Furthermore, each regulatory authority may impose its own requirements during product development or during the application review. It may refuse to grant approval or require additional data before granting approval, even in circumstances in which the same product has already been approved in other countries. Regulatory authorities also have the authority to request product recalls and product withdrawals, to impose penalties for violations of regulations, and ultimately the ability to revoke product licensure or approval. Product review and approval can vary from six months or less to several years from the date of application submission depending upon the country and regulatory jurisdiction. Factors such as the quality of data and evidence, the review procedures, the nature of the product and the condition to be treated, play a major role in the length of time a product is under review, and whether or not the product is ultimately licensed or approved. In the EU , there are three main procedures for applying for marketing authorization: In the EU , vaccines are treated as pharmaceutical products, and therefore have to obtain marketing authorization under the centralized procedures described above.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 42 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Generic products are subject to the same marketing authorization procedures. A generic product must contain the same active medicinal substance as a reference product approved in the EU. Generic applications are abridged: generic manufacturers only need to submit quality data and demonstrate that the generic drug is \"bioequivalent\" to the originator product (i.e., performs in the same manner in the patient's body), but do not need to submit safety or efficacy data since regulatory authorities can refer to the reference product's dossier. Another relevant aspect in the EU regulatory framework is the \"sunset clause\" under which any marketing authorization ceases to be valid if it is not followed by marketing within three years, or if marketing is interrupted for a period of three consecutive years. In the US , applications for pharmaceutical approval and biological product licensure are submitted for review to the FDA, which has broad regulatory jurisdiction over all pharmaceutical and biological products that are intended for sale and marketing in the US. To commercialize a product in the US, a new drug application (NDA) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, or a Biological License Application (BLA) under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, must be submitted to the FDA for filing and pre- market review. Specifically, the FDA must decide whether the product is safe and effective for its proposed use; if the benefits of the product outweigh its risks; whether the product labeling is adequate; and if the manufacturing of the product and the controls used for maintaining quality are adequate to preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Based upon this review, the FDA can stipulate post-approval commitments and requirements. Changes to an approved product, including but not limited to a new indication, require submission of a supplemental NDA (sNDA) for a drug or a supplemental BLA (sBLA) for a biological product. The FD&C Act provides another option for NDA product approval via the 505(b)(2) pathway. This 505(b)(2) application contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For example, under the 505(b)(2) pathway an applicant may seek to rely on literature or earlier FDA findings of safety and effectiveness for approved drugs. Sponsors wishing to market a generic drug can file an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) under 505(j) of the FD&C Act. These applications are \"abbreviated\" because they are generally not required to include data to establish safety and efficacy but need to demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in humans in the same manner as the originator's product) to a reference product. Consequently, the length of time and cost required for development of generics can be considerably less than for the innovator's drug. The ANDA pathway in the US can only be used for generics of drugs that can be referenced as having been approved under the FD&C Act. In Japan , the entire process of approval review from review-related inspections and clinical trial consultation to review for the drugs approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) is undertaken by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The PMDA conducts first scientific review of the NDA submitted, assessing particularly the safety, efficacy and quality of the product or medical device proposed. Results of this primary evaluation are then submitted to the PMDA's external experts. After a second evaluation based on the external experts' feedback, a report is provided; the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Foods Sanitation Council (PAFCS) - one of the councils organized under the J-MHLW as advisory commission - is consulted, and advises the MHLW on final approvability. For Japanese registrations, clinical data for Japanese patients are necessary. The regulatory authorities can require local clinical studies, though they also accept multi-regional studies including Japan. In some cases, bridging studies have been conducted to verify extrapolability of foreign clinical data to Japanese patients and to obtain data to determine the appropriateness of the dosages for Japanese patients. The MHLW may require additional post-approval studies (Phase IV) for some specific cases, to further evaluate safety and/or to gather information on the use of the product under specified conditions. In approval of new drugs, new indications, new dosages or new administrations, the re-examination period is determined by the MHLW. Post-marketing information on a drug for the predetermined period after approval is collected to reconfirm its efficacy, safety and quality at the end of the period. This collection process involves both post-marketing surveillance (PMS), which is a non-interventional study, and post-marketing clinical trials. For generic products, the data necessary for filing are similar to EU and US requirements. Companies only need to submit quality data, and data demonstrating bioequivalence to the originator product, unless the drug is biopharmaceutical. Common Technical Document (CTD) submission for generics has been mandatory since March 2017. The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) was created in 1990 and reformed in 2015. The ICH currently includes 20 Members and 35 Observers. Harmonization is achieved through the development of ICH Guidelines via a process of scientific consensus with regulatory and industry experts working side-by-side. In addition to the joint efforts, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have proven to be one of the best ways to open up foreign markets to exporters and to allow for discussions on harmonization topics for regulatory authorities. Some agreements, such as the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), are international in nature, while others are between specific countries. The requirements of many countries (including Japan and several EU Member States) to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement rates for pharmaceutical products with government regulators significantly extend the time to market entry beyond the initial marketing approval. While marketing authorizations for new pharmaceutical products in the EU have been largely centralized within the European Commission in collaboration with the EMA, pricing and reimbursement remain a matter of national competence.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 43 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), which combine the functions of health insurance, delivery of care, and administration. MCOs use specific provider networks and specific services and products. There are four primary types of managed care plans: Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs), Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs), and Point of Service (POS) plans; and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which serve as intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmacies and manufacturers to negotiate rebates and discounts on formulary placement for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans, and federal and state government employee plans. Medicare , which provides health insurance for retirees and for people with permanent disabilities. The basic Medicare scheme (Part A) provides hospital insurance only, and the vast majority of retirees purchase additional cover through some or all of three other plans named Part B, Part C and Part D. Part D enables Medicare beneficiaries to obtain outpatient drug coverage. Almost two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in Part D plans; and Medicaid , which provides health insurance for low-income families, certain qualified pregnant women and children, individuals receiving supplemental security income, and other eligible persons determined on a state-by-state basis; TRICARE , which provides health insurance for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families including comprehensive healthcare, prescription and dental coverage.B.6.4. Pricing & reimbursement We are operating in a highly complex and volatile market access and launch environment globally. Faced with mounting budget pressure, governments and payers are using various drug price control policies, among others, price referencing for imported drugs, increased patient co-payments, restrictive formularies, prescribing guidelines, tendering procedures, generic and biosimilar substitution, and medico-economic evaluations of healthcare products. In addition, pharmaceutical companies are expected to continuously demonstrate value throughout the product life cycle (such as through comparative efficacy studies, real-world patient data, and budget modelling), while s tringent payer evidence requirements that differ from country to country are raising the bar for market entry. Despite many challenges, payers and regulators are becoming more committed to providing early access to new innovative therapies , with greater emphasis on real-world evidence (RWE). These trends are likely to continue in the coming year, mainly driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. United States Overview of the US health insurance system: Commercial insurance is offered widely as part of employee benefit packages and is the main source of employee access to subsidized healthcare. Some individuals purchase private health plans directly or through marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act, while publicly subsidized programs provide coverage for retirees, the indigent, the disabled, uninsured children, and serving or retired military personnel. Double coverage can occur. Commercial insurance includes: Government insurance includes: The Biden administration's efforts remain focused on lowering health care and prescription drug costs. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted with drug pricing provisions, which will be phased in over the next few years . For the first time, the federal government will negotiate the prices of selected drugs with high budget impact on Medicare Part B (physician-administered) and Part D (retail prescription drugs), starting with 10 drugs in 2026 and increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 and beyond. Manufacturers will also be required to pay mandatory rebates if drug prices increase faster than the rate of inflation (based on the Consumer Price Index, all urban consumers [CPI-U]), beginning in October 2022 for Part D and January 2023 for Part B). Other measures of the Act will redesign the Medicare Part D benefit, including a monthly $35 insulin cap in 2023 and an annual $2,000 out-of-pocket (OOP) spending cap in 2025 for Medicare beneficiaries. Altogether, the IRA is expected to reduce federal drug spending by about $290 billion over the next decade according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The new legislation is also likely to have a negative impact on industry revenue growth and future innovation, through there remains significant uncertainty over the price negotiation provision and the impact of Medicare reforms. Federal and state governments are also seeking to step up price transparency requirements for hospitals, insurers and health plans as contained in the CMS Transparency in Coverage Rule, officially effective since July 1, 2022. In addition, more than half of US states have passed or are pursuing laws to bring greater transparency and prevent price gouging - an issue that has led to intense debate on insulin costs in recent years. After years of slow growth, biosimilar adoption is likely to accelerate with 36 biosimilars approved to date by the FDA, including two interchangeable products (insulin glargine and adalimumab). According to IQVIA, savings are projected to potentially exceed $100 billion over the next five years, though uncertainty remains on the impact of interchangeability on biosimilar uptake and pricing in the long term. Moreover, the continuing vertical integration and consolidation within the US health insurance market exposes the industry to greater pricing pressure . With the three largest PBM group purchasing organizations (GPOs) (i.e., Ascent, Emisar and Zinc) now covering over 85% of US prescription drug claims, consolidation has led to increased utilization management and restrictive formularies, resulting in strong bargaining power for negotiating discounted prices, thereby adversely impacting sales.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 44 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022China China continues to pursue reforms towards Healthy China 2030 . Healthcare is one of the growth priorities under the country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), with policies aimed at addressing a large and increasing burden of disease (especially cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases), while balancing access to innovation and costs. China continues to improve regulatory timelines. For example, Dupixent\u00ae received approval for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in June 2020, within 6 months of filing through an accelerated review process. Pricing pressure is expected to intensify as a growing number of products are subject to National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) price negotiations and volume-based procurement (VBP) tenders, with the lowest price prevailing to compete with domestic companies. Access to innovative therapies has been rapidly increasing in recent years, fueled by annual NRDL updates, albeit with steep price cuts across therapy areas. According to the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA), 111 new drugs were added to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in January 2023, an increase of 36% over 2022. The latest additions included 23 cancer drugs, 17 treatments for infectious diseases, 7 for rare diseases and 2 for COVID-19, with an average price reduction of 60.1% - in line with recent years. Over the past five years, 618 - drugs have been added to the NRDL, bringing the total number of covered medicines to 2,967 - 1,586 Western drugs and 1,381 traditional Chinese medicines. Further expansion of the volume-based procurement (VBP) policy will drive down the prices of a growing number of products, with more than 500 drugs targeted for inclusion by 2025. Europe In Europe, health systems are under mounting financial pressure caused by high public debt, rising inflation and slow economic growth. Biosimilar uptake and tighter cost-containment policies will continue to exert downward pressure on EU drug prices. Importantly, industry payback and mandatory rebates are expected to increase at unprecedented rates in 2023 in major EU markets, particularly in Germany and the UK. The new EU HTA regulation was adopted in December 2021, after years of joint work between Member States, and will be implemented in a staged process by 2025. Under the new rules, Member States will be cooperating on conducting future joint clinical assessments (JCAs) and joint scientific consultations (JCSs). However, significant uncertainty remains over the implementation of the new framework. Furthermore, the access environment is poised to become more challenging in the context of the European Commission's wide- ranging Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe adopted in November 2020. The European Commission's most concerning proposals relate to revamping incentives in unmet need areas such as rare and pediatric diseases, reducing intellectual property for earlier market entry of generics and biosimilars, promoting greater transparency around pricing and drug development costs, and cross-border collaboration on pricing and procurement. Policy options under consideration could have far-reaching impacts on the rare disease pipeline, and have the potential to undermine EU innovation and competitiveness. Similar pressures are being felt in other regions and countries around the globe. To address the multiple challenges mentioned above, we are continuously adapting and future-proofing our pricing and market access strategies. B.7. Patents, intellectual property and other rights B.7.1. Patents Patent protection We own a broad portfolio of patents, patent applications and patent licenses worldwide. These patents are of various types and may cover: active ingredients; pharmaceutical formulations; product manufacturing processes; intermediate of use; technology platforms; delivery systems; digital applications; and enabling technologies, such as assays. Patent protection for individual products typically extends for 20 years from the patent filing date in countries where we seek patent protection. A substantial part of the 20-year life span of a patent on a new molecule (small molecule or biologic) has generally already passed by the time the related product obtains marketing authorization. As a result, the effective period of patent protection for an approved product's active ingredient is significantly shorter than 20 years. In some cases, the period of effective protection may be extended by procedures established to compensate regulatory delay in Europe (via Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC), in the US (via Patent Term Extension or PTE), and in Japan (PTE). The protection a patent provides to the related product depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage, and may also vary from country to country. In Europe, applications for new patents may be submitted to the European Patent Office (EPO). A European Patent (EP) application may cover the 38 European Patent Convention Member States, including all Member States of the EU. The granted EP establishes corresponding national patents with uniform patent claims among the Member States. In 2013, EU legislation was adopted to create a European Unitary Patent and a Unified Patent Court. It is expected to come into force on June 1, 2023.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 45 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022We monitor our competitors and vigorously seek to challenge patent infringers when such infringement would negatively impact our business objectives. See \"Item 8. \u2014 A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information \u2014 Information on Legal or Arbitration Proceedings \u2014 Patents\" of this annual report. The expiration or loss of a patent covering a new molecule, typically referred to as a compound patent, may result in significant competition from generic products and can result in a dramatic reduction in sales of the original branded product (see \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors\"). In some cases, it is possible to continue to benefit from a commercial advantage through product manufacturing trade secrets or other types of patents. Certain categories of products, such as traditional vaccines and insulin, were historically relatively less reliant on patent protection and may in many cases have no patent coverage. It is nowadays increasingly frequent for novel vaccines also to be patent protected. Regulatory exclusivity In some markets, including the EU and the US, many of our pharmaceutical products may also benefit from multi-year regulatory exclusivity periods, during which a generic or biosimilar competitor may not rely on our clinical trial and safety data in its drug application. This exclusivity operates independently of patent protection and may protect the product from generic competition even if there is no patent covering the product. In the US, the FDA will not grant final marketing authorization to a generic competitor for a New Chemical Entity (NCE) until the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period (five years) that commences upon the first marketing authorization of the reference product. Significant line extensions of existing NCEs may qualify for an additional three years of regulatory exclusivity if certain conditions are met. In the US, a different regulatory exclusivity period applies to biological drugs. The BPCIA (Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act) provides that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed. In the EU, regulatory exclusivity is available in two forms: data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity. Generic drug applications will not be accepted for review until eight years after the first marketing authorization (data exclusivity). This eight-year period is followed by a two-year period during which generics cannot be marketed (marketing exclusivity). The marketing exclusivity period can be extended to three years if, during the first eight-year period, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which are deemed to provide a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies. This is known as the \"8+2+1\" rule. In Japan, the regulatory exclusivity period varies: four years for medicinal products with new indications, formulations, dosages, or compositions with related prescriptions; six years for new drugs containing a medicinal composition or requiring a new route of administration; eight years for drugs containing a new chemical entity; and ten years for orphan drugs or new drugs requiring pharmaco-epidemiological study. Pediatric extension In the US and the EU, under certain conditions, it is possible to extend a product's regulatory exclusivity for an additional period of time by providing data on pediatric studies. In the US, under certain conditions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, it may result in the FDA extending regulatory exclusivity and patent life by six months, to the extent these protections have not already expired (the so-called \"pediatric exclusivity\"). In Europe, a regulation on pediatric medicines provides for pediatric research obligations with potential associated rewards including extension of supplementary patent protection and six-month regulatory exclusivity for pediatric marketing authorization (for off-patent medicinal products). In Japan, there is no pediatric research extension of patent protection for patented medicinal products. However, regulatory exclusivity may be extended from eight to ten years. Orphan drug exclusivity Under certain conditions, orphan drug exclusivity may be granted in the US to drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Orphan drug exclusivities also exist in the EU and Japan. Emerging markets One of the main limitations on our operations in emerging market countries is the lack of effective intellectual property protection or enforcement for our products, which frequently do not provide non-patent exclusivity for innovative products. While the situation has gradually improved, the lack of protection for intellectual property rights or the lack of robust enforcement poses difficulties in certain countries. Additionally, in recent years and especially during the pandemic, a number of countries have waived or threatened to waive intellectual property protection for specific products, for example through compulsory licensing of generics. See \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Relating to Sanofi's Structure and Strategy \u2014 The globalization of our business exposes us to increased risks in specific areas\". Product overview We summarize below the intellectual property coverage (in some cases through licenses) of our most significant marketed products in terms of sales, in our major markets. In the discussion of patents below, we focus on active ingredient patents (compound patents) and, in the case of NCEs, on any later filed patents listed as applicable in the FDA's list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the \"Orange Book\") or in its foreign equivalents. For biologics, the Orange Book listing does not apply.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 46 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022These patents or their foreign equivalents tend to be the most relevant in the event of an application by a competitor to produce a generic or a biosimilar version of one of our products (see \"\u2014 Challenges to Patented Products\" below). In some cases, products may also benefit from pending patent applications or from patents not eligible for Orange Book listing (in the case of NCEs for example, patents claiming industrial processes). In each case below, we specify whether the active ingredient is claimed by an unexpired patent. Where patent terms have been extended to compensate for US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in patent prosecution (Patent Term Adjustment - PTA) or for other regulatory delays, the extended dates are indicated below. The US patent expirations presented below reflect USPTO dates, and also reflect six-month pediatric extensions when applicable. Where patent terms have expired we indicate such information and mention whether generics are on the market. We do not provide later filed patent information relating to formulations already available as an unlicensed generic. References below to patent protection in Europe indicate the existence of relevant patents in most major markets in the EU. Specific situations may vary by country. We additionally set out any regulatory exclusivity from which these products continue to benefit in the US, EU or Japan. Regulatory exclusivities presented below incorporate any pediatric extensions obtained. While EU regulatory exclusivity is intended to be applied throughout the EU, in some cases Member States have taken positions prejudicial to our exclusivity rights.

(a) See also \"It em 5. \u2014 A.1.2. Impacts of competition from generics and biosimilars\". (b) In Europe, Aubagio\u00ae competition with certain generic companies is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.Patents held or licensed by Sanofi do not in all cases provide effective protection against a competitor's generic version of our products. For example, notwithstanding the presence of unexpired patents, competitors launched generic versions of Allegra\u00ae in the US (prior to the product being switched to over-the-counter status) and Plavix\u00ae in the EU. We caution the reader that there can be no assurance that we will prevail when we assert a patent in litigation and that there may be instances in which Sanofi determines that it does not have a sufficient basis to assert one or more of the patents mentioned in this report, for example in cases where a competitor proposes a formulation not appearing to fall within the claims of our formulation patent; a salt or crystalline form not claimed by our composition of matter patent; or an indication not covered by our method of use patent. See \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters \u2014 We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected\". As disclosed in Item 8. of this annual report, we are involved in significant litigation concerning the patent protection of a number of our products. Challenges to patented products \u2014 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) In the US, generic companies have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) containing challenges to patents related to a number of our small molecule products. An ANDA is an application by a drug manufacturer to receive authority to market a generic version of another company's approved product, by demonstrating that the purportedly generic version has the same properties (safety and other technical data) as the original approved product. As a result of regulatory protection of our safety and other technical data, ANDA applications are generally four years after FDA approval, and include a challenge to a patent listed in the FDA's Orange Book. If the patent holder or licensee brings suit in response to the patent challenge within the statutory window, the FDA is barred from granting final approval to an ANDA during the 30 months following the expiry of the 5-year regulatory exclusivity (this bar is referred to in our industry as a \"30-month stay\") unless, before the end of the 30 months, the parties reach settlement or a court decision has determined either that the ANDA does not infringe the listed patent or that the listed patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. FDA approval of an ANDA after this 30-month period does not resolve outstanding patent disputes, but it does remove the regulatory impediments to a product launch by a generic manufacturer willing to take the risk of later being ordered to pay damages to the patent holder. Accelerated ANDA-type procedures are potentially applicable to many, but not all, of the products we manufacture. See \"\u2014 B.6.3. Regulatory Framework \u2014 6.3.2. Biosimilars\" and \"- Regulation\" above. We seek to defend our patent rights vigorously in these cases. Success or failure in the assertion of a given patent against a competing product is not necessarily predictive of the future success or failure in the assertion of the same patent. See \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters \u2014 We rely on our patents and other proprietary rights to provide exclusive rights to market certain of our products, and if such patents and other rights were limited, invalidated or circumvented, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected\". \u2014 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications in the US Our products and patents are also subject to challenge by competitors via another abbreviated approval pathway, under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This pathway allows for approval for a wide range of products, especially for those products that represent only a limited change from an existing approved drug. The 505(b)(2) pathway is distinct from the ANDA pathway, which allows for approval of a generic product based on a showing that it is equivalent to a previously approved product. Similarly, entities wishing to market a generic biologic can utilize an abbreviated approval pathway established in the PHS Act. This \u00a7351(k) pathway enables an applicant to rely on a reference product sponsor's data when seeking approval of a biological product shown to be biosimilar (highly similar with no clinically meaningful differences) or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference BLA product. \u2014 Europe In the EU, a generic drug manufacturer may only reference the data of the regulatory file for the original approved product after data exclusivity has expired. However, there is no patent listing system in Europe comparable to the Orange Book, which would allow the patent holder to prevent the competent authorities from granting marketing authorization by bringing patent infringement litigation prior to approval. As a result, generic products may be approved for marketing following the expiration of marketing exclusivity without regard to the patent holder's rights. Nevertheless, in most of these jurisdictions once the competing product is launched, and in some jurisdictions even prior to launch (once launch is imminent), the patent holder may seek an injunction against such marketing if it believes its patents are infringed. See Item 8. of this annual report. B.7.2. Trademarks - Domain names - Copyright Our products are sold around the world under trademarks that we consider to be of material importance in the aggregate. Our trademarks help to identify our products and to protect the sustainability of our growth. We generate new assets (trademarks, domain names, service marks) when creating global brands for new, innovative products. We support the development of the product, from the branding of biotech platforms to the protection of service marks for patient support programs. Trademarks are particularly important to the commercial success of our products and services in a competitive marketplace, providing a strong visibility and assuring patients of the origin of the products.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 48 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022global sites, which serve all markets: located mainly in Europe, these facilities are dedicated to the manufacture of our active ingredients, injectable products, and a number of our main solid-form products; regional sites, which serve markets at regional level, giving us a strong industrial presence in emerging markets; and local sites, which serve their domestic market only. the Specialty Care facilities in the United States (Framingham MA and Northborough MA), France (Lyon Gerland, Vitry-sur-Seine, Le Trait), Germany (Frankfurt), Ireland (Waterford) and Belgium (Geel); the General Medicines facilities in Germany (Frankfurt), France (Aramon, Sisteron, Ploermel, Ambar\u00e8s and Tours), Italy (Anagni and Scoppito), Singapore (Jurong) and the United States (Ridgefield NJ); the Consumer Healthcare facilities in France (Compi\u00e8gne) and the United States (Chattanooga TN); and the Vaccines facilities in France (Marcy l'\u00c9toile, Le Trait, Val-de-Reuil and Neuville-sur-Sa\u00f4ne), the United States (Swiftwater PA) and Canada (Toronto).Domain names are essential to inform a range of communities about what we do. We also pay close attention to ensuring that no damage is done to our reputation online. We aim to ensure that the product trademarks we submit to healthcare authorities to obtain marketing authorizations are available, and are protected. In certain cases, we may enter into a coexistence agreement with a third party that owns potentially conflicting rights in order to avoid any risk of confusion and to secure our rights. Ongoing digitization emphasizes the importance of securing copyright protection for software and web layouts.We monitor and defend our trademarks based on a specific policy designed to prevent counterfeiting, trademark infringement and/or unfair competition. B.8. Production and raw materials We have opted to manufacture the majority of our products in-house. There are three principal stages in our production process: the manufacture of active ingredients, the transformation of those ingredients into drug products or vaccines, and the final packaging. Our general policy is to produce our key active ingredients and main drug products at our own plants in order to reduce our dependence on external suppliers. We also rely on third parties for the manufacture and supply of specific active ingredients, drug products and medical devices. Active ingredients are manufactured using raw materials sourced from suppliers who have been subject to rigorous selection and approval procedures, in accordance with international standards and our own internal directives. We have outsourced some of our production under supply contracts associated with acquisitions of products or businesses or with Sanofi plant divestitures, or to establish a local presence to capitalize on growth in emerging markets. Our pharmaceutical subcontractors follow our general quality and logistics policies, as well as meeting other criteria. Our manufacturing activities require significant amounts of energy, the costs of which have increased in 2022 and are expected to increase in 2023 and beyond as a result of inflationary pressures and supply constraints due to the war in Ukraine. The Group uses supply contracts and hedging to mitigate these costs. See \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Relating to Our Business\". We also obtain active ingredients from third parties under collaboration agreements. This applies in particular to the monoclonal antibodies developed with Regeneron. Our production sites are divided into three categories: Vaccines produces vaccines at various sites, with the main locations situated in France, the United States, Canada, India, Mexico and China. The pharmaceutical site at Le Trait (France) also contributes to Vaccines' industrial operations by making its sterile filling facilities available for vaccine manufacturing. All of our production facilities are good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliant, in line with international regulations. Our main sites are approved by the US FDA: Wherever possible, we seek to have multiple plants approved for the production of key active ingredients and our strategic finished products (this is the case with Lovenox \u00ae and Dupixent\u00ae, for example). More details about our manufacturing sites are given below at section \"D. Property, Plant and Equipment\". B.9. Insurance and risk coverage We are protected by five main insurance programs, relying not only on the traditional corporate insurance and reinsurance market but also on our direct insurance company, Carraig Insurance DAC (Carraig). These five key programs cover Property & Business Interruption; General & Product Liability; Stock & Transit; loss and liability arising from cyber and digital risks; and Directors & Officers Liability. Carraig participates in our coverage for various lines of insurance including Property, Stock & Transit, Cyber/Digital, and General & Product Liability. Carraig is run under the supervision of the Irish and European regulatory authorities, is wholly owned by Sanofi, and has sufficient resources to meet those portions of our risks that it has agreed to cover. Carraig sets premiums for our entities at market rates. Claims are assessed using the traditional models applied by insurance and reinsurance companies, and the company's reserves are regularly verified and confirmed by independent actuaries.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 49 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Our Property & Business Interruption program covers all our entities worldwide, in all territories where it is possible to use a centralized program operated by Carraig. By sharing risk between our entities, this approach enables us to set deductibles and cover appropriate to the needs of local entities before the market attachment point. It also incorporates a prevention program, including a comprehensive site visit schedule covering our production, storage, research and distribution facilities and standardized repair and maintenance procedures across all sites. The Stock & Transit program protects all goods owned by Sanofi while they are in transit nationally or internationally whatever the means of transport, and all our inventories wherever they are located. Sharing risk between our entities through Carraig means that we can set deductibles at appropriate levels, for instance differentiating between goods that require temperature controlled distribution and those that do not. We have developed a prevention program with assistance from experts, implementing best practices in this area at our distribution sites. Our Cyber/Digital insurance program protects our operations against loss originating from various sources, and against liability in respect of data security. Centralized through Carraig, the program enables us to set deductibles and cover appropriate to the needs of local entities before the market attachment point. Our General & Product Liability program was renewed in 2022 for all our subsidiaries worldwide in all territories where it was possible to do so, despite reluctance in the insurance and reinsurance market to cover product liability risks for large pharma-biotech groups. For several years, insurers have been reducing product liability cover because of the difficulty of transferring risk for some products that have been subject to numerous claims. The principal risk exposure for our pharmaceutical products is covered with low deductibles at country level, with a greater proportion of risk being retained. The level of risk self-insured by Sanofi (including via Carraig) before the market attachment point enables us to retain control over the management and prevention of risk. Our negotiations with third-party insurers and reinsurers are tailored to our specific risks. In particular, they allow for differential treatment of products in the development phase; for discrepancies in risk exposure between European countries and the United States; and for specific issues arising in certain jurisdictions, such as generics or biosimilar coverage in the United States. Coverage is adjusted every year to take account of the relative weight of new product liability risks such as those arising out of biotechnologies and new technology platforms. Our cover for risks that are not specific to the pharma-biotech industry (general liability) is designed to address the potential impacts of our operations. For all the insurance programs handled by Carraig, outstanding claims are covered by provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not paid at the balance sheet date, whether reported or not, together with all related claims handling expenses. Where there is sufficient data history from Sanofi or from the market for claims made and settled, management - with assistance from independent actuaries - prepares an actuarial estimate of our exposure to unreported claims for the risks covered. The actuaries perform an actuarial valuation of the company's IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) and ALAE (Allocated Loss Adjustment Expense) liabilities at year end. Two ultimate loss projections (based upon reported losses and paid losses, respectively) are computed each year using various actuarial methods including the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method; those projections form the basis for the provisions set. The Directors & Officers Liability program protects all legal entities under our control, and their directors and officers. Carraig is not involved in this program. We also operate other insurance programs, but these are of much lesser importance than those described above. All our insurance programs are backed by highly-rated insurers and reinsurers and are intented to be designed in such a way that we can integrate most newly acquired businesses without interruption of cover. Our insurance cover has been designed to reflect our risk profile and the capacity available in the insurance market. By centralizing our major programs, we are able to provide excellent, cost effective protection. B.10. Health, Safety and Environment Our manufacturing and research operations are subject to increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental (HSE) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and rapidly changing, and Sanofi invests the necessary sums in order to comply with them. This investment, which aims to respect health, safety and the environment, varies from year to year. Applicable environmental laws and regulations may require us to eliminate or reduce the effects of chemical substance discharge at our various sites. The sites in question may belong to Sanofi, and may be currently operational, or may have been owned or operational in the past. In this regard, Sanofi may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on, under or in the sites concerned, or on sites where waste from activities has been stored, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or under certain circumstances caused the presence of the contaminants, or at the time site operations occurred the discharge of those substances was authorized. As is the case for a number of companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical and intense agrochemical industries, soil and groundwater contamination has occurred at some of our sites in the past, and may still occur or be discovered at others. In Sanofi's case, such sites are mainly located in the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. As part of a program of environmental surveys conducted over the last few years, detailed assessments of the risk of soil and groundwater contamination have been carried out at current and former Sanofi sites. In cooperation with national and local authorities, Sanofi regularly assesses the rehabilitation work required and carries out such work when appropriate. Long-term rehabilitation work is in progress or planned in Mount Pleasant, Portland in the United States; Frankfurt in Germany; Dagenham in in France; and on a number of sites divested to third parties and covered by contractual environmental guarantees granted by Sanofi.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 50 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022We may also have potential liability for investigation and cleanup at several other sites. We have established provisions for the sites already identified and to cover contractual guarantees for environmental liabilities for sites that have been divested. In France specifically, we have provided the financial guarantees to the authorities as required under French regulations for environmental protection in connection with the operation of activities on French sites. Potential environmental contingencies arising from certain business divestitures are described in Note D.22.d. to the consolidated financial statements. In 2022, Sanofi spent \u20ac39 million on rehabilitating sites previously contaminated by soil or groundwater pollution. Due to changes in environmental regulations governing site remediation, our provisions for remediation obligations may not be adequate due to the multiple factors involved, such as the complexity of operational or previously operational sites, the nature of claims received, the rehabilitation techniques involved, the planned timetable for rehabilitation, and the outcome of discussions with national regulatory authorities or other potentially responsible parties, as in the case of multiparty sites. Given the long industrial history of some of our sites and the legacy obligations arising from the past involvement of Aventis in the chemical and agrochemical industries, it is impossible to quantify the future impact of these laws and regulations with precision. See \"Item 3.D. Risk Factors \u2014 Environmental and safety risks of Our Industrial Activities\". We have established, in accordance with our current knowledge and projections, provisions for cases already identified and to cover contractual guarantees for environmental liabilities relating to sites that have been divested. In accordance with Sanofi standards, a comprehensive review is carried out once a year on the legacy of environmental pollution. In light of data collected during this review, we adjusted our provisions to \u20ac526 million as of December 31, 2022 versus \u20ac650 million as of December 31, 2021. The terms of certain business divestitures, and the environmental obligations and retained environmental liabilities relating thereto, are described in Note D.22. to our consolidated financial statements. To our knowledge, Sanofi did not incur any liability in 2022 for non-compliance with current HSE laws and regulations that could be expected to significantly jeopardize its activities, financial situation or operating income. We also believe that we are in substantial compliance with current HSE laws and regulations and that all the environmental permits required to operate our facilities have been obtained. Regular HSE audits are carried out by Sanofi in order to assess compliance with standards (which implies compliance with regulations) and to initiate corrective measures (36 internal audits performed in 2022). Moreover, more than 100 specific visits were performed jointly with experts representing our insurers. Sanofi has implemented a worldwide master policy on health, safety and environment to promote the health and well-being of the employees and contractors working on its sites and respect for the environment. We consider this master policy to be an integral part of our commitment to social responsibility. In order to implement this master policy, Sanofi key requirements have been drawn up in the key fields of HSE management, HSE leadership, safety in the workplace, process safety, occupational hygiene, health in the workplace and protection of the environment. However, despite these efforts, Sanofi may be unsuccessful in the implementation of its policy to reduce and mitigate the harmful effects of its activities on the health and safety of its employees, customers or the general public and on the environment more generally. See \"Item 3.B. Risk Factors\" for further information. Health From the development of compounds to the commercial launch of new drugs, Sanofi research scientists continuously assess the effect of products on human health. This expertise is made available to employees through two committees responsible for chemical and biological risk assessment. Sanofi's COVALIS (Comit\u00e9 des Valeurs Limites Internes Sanofi) Committee is responsible for the hazard determination and classification of all active pharmaceutical ingredients and synthesis intermediates handled at Sanofi facilities. This covers all active ingredients handled in production at company sites or in processes sub-contracted for manufacture. Any important issues involving raw materials or other substances that lack established occupational exposure limits may also be reviewed. The COVALIS Committee determines the occupational exposure limits required within Sanofi. Our TRIBIO Committee is responsible for classifying all biological agents according to their degree of pathogenicity, and applies rules for their containment and the preventive measures to be respected throughout Sanofi. See \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 Environmental and safety risks of Our Industrial Activities \u2014 Risks from manufacturing activities and the handling of hazardous materials could adversely affect our results of operations and reputation\". Appropriate occupational hygiene practices and programs are defined and implemented in each site. These practices consist essentially of containment measures for collective and individual protection against chemical and biological exposure in all workplaces where chemical substances or biological agents are handled. All personnel are monitored with an appropriate medical surveillance program, based on the results of professional risk evaluations linked to their duties. In addition, dedicated resources have been created to implement the European Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the European Regulation on Classification, Labeling and Packaging of chemicals (CLP). To fully comply with REACH, Sanofi has registered the relevant hazardous chemical substances with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 51 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Safety Sanofi has rigorous policies to identify and evaluate safety risks and to develop preventive safety measures, and methods for checking their efficacy. Additionally, Sanofi invests in training that is designed to instill in all employees a sense of concern for safety, regardless of their duties. These policies are implemented on a worldwide scale to ensure the safety of all employees and to protect their health. Each project, whether in research, development or manufacturing, is subject to evaluation procedures, incorporating the chemical substance and process data communicated by the COVALIS and TRIBIO Committees described above. The preventive measures are designed primarily to reduce the number and seriousness of work accidents and to minimize exposures involving permanent and temporary Sanofi employees as well as our sub-contractors. The French chemical manufacturing sites in Aramon and Sisteron are listed Seveso III (from the name of the European directive that deals with potentially dangerous establishments where dangerous substances may be present in quantities exceeding certain thresholds to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences). In accordance with French law on technological risk prevention, the French sites are also subject to heightened security inspections due to the toxic or flammable materials stored on the sites and used in the operating processes. Risk assessments of processes and installations are drawn up according to standards and internal guidelines incorporating the best state of the art benchmarks for the industry. These assessments are used to fulfill regulatory requirements and are regularly updated. Particular attention is paid to any risk-generating changes such as process or installation changes, as well as changes in production scale and transfers between industrial or research units. We are using specialized process safety-testing laboratories that are fully integrated into our chemical development activities, apply methods to obtain the physico-chemical parameters of manufactured chemical substances (intermediate chemical compounds and active ingredients) and apply models to measure the effect of potentially leachable substances in the event of a major accident. In these laboratories the parameters for qualifying hazardous reactions are also determined, in order to define scale-up process conditions while transferring from development stage to industrial scale. We use these data to enhance the relevance of our risk assessments. We believe that the safety management systems implemented at each site, the hazard studies carried out and the risk management methods implemented, as well as our third-party property insurance policies covering any third-party physical damage, are consistent with legal requirements and the best practices in the industry, although no guarantee can be given that they will prevent accidents of various kinds. Environment Beyond healthcare, we have committed to an ambitious policy aimed at minimizing the environmental impacts of our products and activities while strengthening our resilience in the face of environmental changes. We have identified six major environmental challenges relating to our businesses: greenhouse gas emissions and climate disruption; eco-design; water; pharmaceuticals in the environment; waste; and biodiversity. The initiatives already implemented since 2010 are continuing, and we have been keen to give them fresh impetus through the Planet Care program. Reflecting our environment strategy out to 2030 and 2045, the program sets more ambitious targets for reducing environmental impacts across the entire value chain. Planet Care is a global project that involves all of the Company's resources in defining objectives and engaging with external partners. Compared with 2019 figures, we are undertaking to reduce our carbon emissions by 55% (scope 1 and 2) by the end of 2030, building the path to carbon-neutral status by 2030 on our scope 1, 2 & 3 (direct and indirect emissions for all activities), and net zero by 2045. We have also set ourselves the target of achieving sustainable water resource management, especially at sites which are under hydric stress. On this new scope, by the end of 2022, we had reduced CO 2 emissions by 29% (scope 1 and 2) and water withdrawals by 13%. Overall waste valorization at sites is already above 86% and is expected to be more than 90% by the end of 2025. The landfill rate had dropped to 5% at the end of 2022 and we have committed to move towards no more than 1% by 2025. Biodiversity management at our sites is also a priority, with the aim of making all employees aware of this challenge and implementing risk assessment and management plans at priority sites by 2025. Finally, we are pursuing the policy we began in 2010 of managing pharmaceutical products in the environment throughout their life cycles. At the end of 2022, all priority production sites have engaged specific programs to monitor, manage and reduce emissions. In line with this approach, we have committed to the \"Roadmap AMR 2020\" initiative, which aims to combat microbial resistance to antibiotics. The initiative brings together thirteen of the major players in the pharmaceutical industry, and will involve co-producing reference guides and methodologies for sustainable management of antibiotics in the pharmaceutical sector. The initiative includes a specific commitment with respect to antibiotic production sites that are operated by signatories or their suppliers, involving firstly the definition and deployment of a shared framework for managing potential waste, and secondly the establishment of environmental thresholds. See \"Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements\" and \"Item 3.D. Risk Factors\".PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 52 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022C. Organizational Structure C.1.

Our property, plant and equipment is held mainly by the following companies: C.3. Financing and financial relationships between group companies The Sanofi parent company raises the bulk of the Company's external financing and uses the funds raised to meet, directly or indirectly, the financing needs of its subsidiaries. The parent company operates a cash pooling arrangement under which any surplus cash held by subsidiaries is managed centrally. There is also a centralized foreign exchange risk management system in place, whereby the parent company contracts hedges to meet the needs of its principal subsidiaries. Consequently, at December 31, 2022, the Sanofi parent company held 98% of our external financing and 91% of our surplus cash.Sanofi European Treasury Center SA (SETC), a 100%-owned Sanofi subsidiary incorporated in 2012 under the laws of Belgium, is dedicated to providing financing and various financial services to our subsidiaries. D. Property, plant and equipment D.1. Overview Our headquarters are located in Paris, France. See \"\u2014 D.4. Office Space\" below.

Description of our sites Sanofi industrial sites As part of the process of transforming Sanofi and creating Global Business Units, we are continuing to adapt the organization of the Manufacturing & Supply department in support of our new business model. The Manufacturing & Supply department focuses on customer needs and service quality; the sharing of \"Sanofi Manufacturing System\" good manufacturing practices; and the development of a common culture committed to quality. In 2020, Manufacturing & Supply department modified its organization to align on the new Global Business Units structure comprising Specialty Care, General Medicines, Vaccines and Consumer Health Care. In February 2020, we announced a plan to create a major leading European company dedicated to the production and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to third parties as well as to Sanofi. This involved creating a standalone company combining our API commercial and development activities with six of our European API production sites: Brindisi (Italy), Frankfurt Chemistry (Germany), Haverhill (UK), Saint-Aubin-les-Elbeuf (France), \u00dajpest (Hungary), and Vertolaye (France). EUROAPI was listed on Euronext Paris on May 6, 2022. See \"Item 4. Information on the Company \u2014 A. History and development of the Company\". The Manufacturing & Supply department is also responsible for Sanofi Global HSE and Global Supply Chain.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 54 SANOFI FORM 20-F 20228 sites for our Specialty Care operations; 29 sites for our General Medicines operations; 12 sites for our Consumer Healthcare operations; and 10 sites for the industrial operations of Vaccines.At the end of 2022, we were carrying out industrial production at 59 sites in 28 countries: The quantity of units sold in 2022, including in-house and outsourced production and excluding EUROAPI, was 4.4 billion.

Our main production sites by volume are: Research & Development sites In Pharmaceuticals, research and development activities are conducted at the following sites: Vaccines research and development sites are: D.3. Acquisitions, capital expenditures and divestitures The carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2022 was \u20ac9,869 million. During 2022, we invested \u20ac1,748 million (see Note D.3. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report), mainly in increasing capacity and improving productivity at our various production and R&D sites. Our principal acquisitions, capital expenditures and divestitures in 2020, 2021 and 2022 are described in Notes D.1. & D.2. (\"Changes in the scope equipment\") and D.4. (\"Goodwill and other intangible assets\") to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report. As of December 31, 2022, our firm commitments in respect of future capital expenditures amounted to \u20ac861 million. The principal locations involved were: for the Pharmaceuticals segment, the industrial facilities at Frankfurt (Germany); Le Trait, Maisons-Alfort, the Vaccines segment, the facilities at Swiftwater (United States), Toronto (Canada), Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, Neuville-sur-Sa\u00f4ne and Val-de-Reuil (France), and Singapore. In the medium term and assuming no changes in the scope of consolidation, we expect to invest on average some \u20ac1.4 billion a year in property, plant and equipment. We believe that our own cash resources and the undrawn portion of our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these expenditures. Our principal ongoing capital expenditures are described below.PART I ITEM 4. Information on the company 55 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Speciality care Our Specialty Care industrial operations are organized around two end-to-end clusters. We have four dedicated biotechnology hubs: Paris/Lyon (France), Frankfurt (Germany), Geel (Belgium) and Boston Area (United States). The Bioatrium project, a joint venture between Sanofi and Lonza (Switzerland) set up in 2017 to increase bioproduction capacity, is proceeding on schedule. Exploiting the innovative techniques on which biotech relies, including cell and microbiological culture and the development of viral vectors, calls for highly specific knowledge and expertise backed by dedicated production platforms to support global product launches. The Waterford and Le Trait sites manufacture pre-filled Dupixent \u00ae syringes. General medicines Our General Medicines industrial operations are organized through end-to-end clusters, with chemistry, pharmaceutical and injectable sites organized through a network of over 28 regional and local industrial sites in 18 countries, supporting growth in those markets. This new organization encompasses a dedicated Launch Sites cluster from API manufacturing to finished goods packaging (Sisteron, Aramon, Ambar\u00e8s, Scoppito). The Frankfurt facility is our principal site for the manufacture of diabetes treatments. Consumer healthcare The pharmaceutical industrial operations of our Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business are spread across a dedicated network. Global markets are supplied from our facilities at Compi\u00e8gne (France) and Cologne (Germany). We have recently invested in new production capacities in Suzano (Brazil) and Narita (Japan). Vaccines The industrial operations of our Vaccines business are in a major investment phase, preparing for the upcoming growth of our influenza and Polio/Pertussis/Hib franchises, plus the mid-term growth linked to our mRNA roadmap and New Vaccines pipeline. Major investments were announced in 2020 and 2021 with a new Evolutive Facility in France (Neuville-Sur-Saone) and a new facility in Singapore for our New Vaccines pipeline. Other major investments are under way in France (including construction of a new influenza vaccine building at Val-de-Reuil), Canada (a new pertussis vaccine building), the US and Mexico. Innovation and culture of industrial excellence The ambition of our Manufacturing & Supply department is to continue to raise safety, quality and operating standards in Sanofi's production activities, and to remain a world leader and a benchmark in the global pharmaceutical industry. To achieve this goal, all our activities share a common culture of industrial excellence, enshrined in the Sanofi Manufacturing System. This sets out a series of priorities (such as customer service, constant improvement, site network optimization and transverse optimization) that constitute our industrial vision and will be crucial to our mutual success. In terms of operational excellence, we continue to build on our Top Decile performance program, focused on core sites and fully leveraging digital opportunities and technology innovations. We are also reinforcing the Sanofi Manufacturing System to drive more improvement directly from the sites and reach our performance goals, while creating a culture of best practices shared across the industrial network. D.4. Office space As we progress on our Sanofi Work Experience journey, we continue to shape our work environment by bringing our teams together and transforming our workplaces into spaces where every Sanofian feels included, valued, and able to bring their best selves to work every day. Along with state-of-the-art projects delivered in 2022, such as the renovation of the Gentilly Campus near Paris, the Cambridge Crossing Campus in the US, and the innovative new \"La Maison Sanofi\" site in Paris, our roadmap continues to evolve, covering all regions worldwide. A number of projects are currently under way to deliver the next generation of work experience and hybrid work. Divestment of sites that our non-core to our business model and office space rationalization remain an important goal to help us achieve a responsible environmental footprint. Item 4A.

Unless otherwise stated, all financial variations in this item are given on a reported basis. The discussion of our operating and financial review and prospects for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, can be found in Part I, Item 5. of our Form 20-F filed on February 23, 2022, including a presentation of our consolidated income statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 in \"Item 5. \u2014 A.2. Results of operations\" of our Form 20-F filed on February 23, 2022. A. Operating results A.1. Significant operating information A.1.1. 2022 Overview During 2022, Sanofi continued to implement its \"Play to Win\" strategy, involving major decisions and positive actions to support and rebuild the competitive margins necessary for Sanofi to continue to deliver on its mission. The strategy is based on four major priorities: focus on growth, lead with innovation, accelerate efficiency, and reinvent how we work. For further information about our strategy, refer to \"\u2014 Item 4. \u2014 B.1. Strategy\". Other significant events of the year are described below. On January 7, 2022, Sanofi announced a research collaboration and license agreement with Exscientia plc (Exscientia) to develop up to 15 novel small molecule candidates across oncology and immunology, leveraging Exscientia's end-to-end AI-driven platform using actual patient samples. The companies have been working together since 2016 and in 2019, Sanofi in-licensed Exscientia's novel bispecific small molecule candidate capable of targeting two distinct targets in inflammation and immunology. On February 8, 2022, Sanofi announced the completion of its acquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Amunix), adding a pipeline of T-cell engager immunotherapies and cytokine therapies. The acquisition also gives access to Amunix's Pro- XTEN TM, XPAT, and XPAC technologies to deliver next-generation Conditionally Activated Biologics. This technology platform complements our existing R&D platforms, and supports our efforts to accelerate and expand our contribution to developing innovative medicines for oncology patients, with approximately 20 molecules currently in development. On March 15, 2022, Sanofi and Blackstone announced a strategic risk-sharing collaboration under which funds managed by Blackstone Life Sciences (BXLS) will invest up to \u20ac300 million to accelerate the global pivotal studies and clinical development program for the subcutaneous formulation and delivery of the anti-CD38 antibody Sarclisa \u00ae to treat patients with multiple myeloma (MM). That amount will be paid to Sanofi on the basis of development expenses incurred. In addition, Sanofi would be required to pay royalties on any future sales of any products developed as part of this program. On March 16, 2022, Sanofi and Seagen Inc . announced an exclusive collaboration agreement to design, develop, and commercialize antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for up to three cancer targets. The collaboration will utilize Sanofi's proprietary monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology and Seagen's proprietary ADC technology. ADCs are antibodies engineered to deliver potent anti-cancer drugs to tumor cells expressing a specific protein, and Sanofi currently has one ADC in development. During the March 29, 2022 investor conference, Sanofi gave an update on how the company is advancing its immunology strategy. The focus of the event was on Dupixent \u00ae (dupilumab), a key growth driver for Sanofi, and on the company's rapidly advancing pipeline of other products which features dermatological, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases as priority therapeutic areas. Sanofi has raised its peak sales ambition for Dupixent \u00ae. This new ambition does not include the potential for further potential sales of Dupixent\u00ae to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with pivotal readouts from clinical trials in this indication anticipated in 2023. On March 29, 2022, Sanofi and IGM Biosciences, Inc . announced the signing of an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement to create, develop, manufacture, and commercialize IgM (immunoglobulin M) antibody agonists against three oncology targets and three immunology/inflammation targets. Engineered IgM antibodies represent a new class of potential therapeutics that combine the multi-valency of IgM antibodies and have ten binding sites, as opposed to conventional IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies that have only two target binding sites.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 57 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022On June 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their IO LCA. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated IO LCA, Regeneron holds exclusive worldwide licensing rights to Libtayo\u00ae with effect from July 1, 2022. In July 2022, Sanofi received as consideration an upfront payment of $900 million (\u20ac856 million), which was recognized within Other operating income on the date of receipt. The same line item also includes a regulatory milestone payment of $100 million (\u20ac96 million) following the US FDA approval in November 2022 of Libtayo\u00ae in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for NSCLC. In addition, Sanofi is entitled to royalties of 11% and to milestone payments linked to global net sales of Libtayo\u00ae, which are recognized within Other operating income in line with the pattern of sales (\u20ac111 million in 2022). For further information, see Note C. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F. On May 3, 2022, Sanofi's General Meeting of Shareholders approved the decision to distribute approximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI , a European leader in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), in the form of an exceptional dividend in kind to Sanofi shareholders. The dividend was paid on May 10, 2022 following the admission of EUROAPI shares to listing on the regulated market of Euronext Paris; on May 6, 2022, Sanofi divested control over EUROAPI and its subsidiaries, resulting in their deconsolidation from the Sanofi consolidated financial statements as of that date. On June 17, 2022 (the date of delivery of the EUROAPI shares to the French State via the French Tech Souverainet\u00e9 fund), EPIC Bpifrance acquired a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI. Following completion of those transactions, Sanofi retains an equity interest of 30.1% in EUROAPI, which has been accounted for using the equity method since the date of loss of control. On August 4, 2022, Sanofi and Innovent Biologics (Innovent) announced a collaboration to bring innovative medicines to patients in China with difficult-to-treat cancers and to accelerate the development and commercialization of two Sanofi key clinical stage oncology assets - Phase III SAR408701 - in combination with sintilimab, the leading checkpoint inhibitor in China. In addition to the collaboration and license agreement, Sanofi has invested \u20ac300 million in Innovent by subscribing to its new common shares. On August 17, 2022, Sanofi discontinued the global clinical development program of amcenestrant , an investigational oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). The decision was based on the outcome of a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase III AMEERA-5 trial evaluating amcenestrant in combination with palbociclib compared to letrozole in combination with palbociclib in patients estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Sanofi will continue to review the data, and plans to share the results with the scientific community in the future. All other studies of amcenestrant, including in early-stage breast cancer (AMEERA-6), will be discontinued. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, based on external and internal data about the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of non-alpha IL2, a new Phase I/II program was programmed for SAR444245 , focused on schedule intensification to solidify the foundation for a best-in-class target profile. In parallel, the ongoing Phase II trials with the 3-weekly dose schedule were discontinued, as the efficacy observed in the early look at the data was lower than projected. This decision was not based on any safety-related issues. On December 19, 2022, Sanofi and Innate Pharma SA (Innate) announced an expansion of their collaboration, with Sanofi licensing a natural killer (NK) cell engager Therapeutics) platform. Sanofi will also have the option to add up to two additional ANKETTM targets. Upon candidate selection, Sanofi will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization. Innate and Sanofi signed a first NK cell engagers collaboration in 2016 for the generation and evaluation of up to two bispecific NK cell engagers; these are currently being evaluated by Sanofi's R&D team, with one of them already in clinical studies. In 2022, healthcare authorities issued a number of marketing approvals for Sanofi products. In the United States and Europe, Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab) obtained full authorization for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, and extensions to expand the severe asthma indication to children aged 6 to 11 years and the moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis indication to children aged 6 months to 5 years. At the end of September 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent\u00ae as the first and only treatment indicated to treat prurigo nodularis for adult patients in the United States, and on December 15, 2022, Dupixent\u00ae became the first and only targeted medicine approved by the European Commission (EC) to treat prurigo nodularis. The FDA also approved Xenpozyme\u00ae (olipudase alfa-rpcp) for the treatment of non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) in adult and pediatric patients. The EC granted marketing authorization for Enjaymo\u00ae (sutimlimab) for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adult patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). CAD is a rare, serious and chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy red blood cells and causes their rupture, known as hemolysis. In Vaccines, the EC approved Beyfortus\u00ae (nirsevimab) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants during their first RSV season. Beyfortus\u00ae is the first and only single-dose passive immunization for the broad infant population; it is being developed jointly by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. The EC also approved VidPrevtyn\u00ae Beta as a booster for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Designed to provide broad protection against multiple variants, this protein-based vaccine is based on the Beta variant antigen and includes GSK's pandemic adjuvant. VidPrevtyn\u00ae Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral COVID vaccine. For further information about the pharmaceutical products and vaccines we sell, and about our research and development portfolio, refer to \"\u2014 Item 4.B. \u2014 Business Overview\".PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 58 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Our net sales for 2022 amounted to \u20ac42,997 million, an increase of 13.9% from 2021. At constant exchange rates (CER(1)), net sales rose by 7.0%, mainly reflecting strong growth for Dupixent\u00ae and increased sales for our Vaccines business, more than offsetting lower sales for our Non Core assets franchise. Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to \u20ac8,371 million for 2022, compared with \u20ac6,223 million in 2021, a \u20ac2,148 million increase. Earnings per share was \u20ac6.69 in 2022, compared with \u20ac4.97 in 2021. Business net income(2) was \u20ac10,341 million, up 25.9% on 2021, while business earnings per share (business EPS(2)) was 25.9% higher than in 2021 at \u20ac8.26. Our net debt(3) decreased from \u20ac9,983 million as of December 31, 2021 to \u20ac6,437 million as of December 31, 2022. At the Annual General Meeting on May 25, 2023, we will ask our shareholders to approve a dividend of \u20ac3.56 per share for the 2022 financial year, representing a payout of 43.1% of our Business net income (see \"\u2014 Item 5.B.2. \u2014 Consolidated balance sheet and debt.\"). A.1.2. Impacts of competition from generics and biosimilars Some of our flagship products continued to suffer sales erosion in 2022 under the impact of competition from generics and biosimilars. We do not believe it is possible to state with certainty what level of net sales would have been achieved in the absence of generic competition. A comparison of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (see \"\u2014 A.2. Results of Operations \u2014 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2021\" below) for the main products affected by generic and biosimilar competition shows a loss of \u20ac325 million of net sales on a reported basis. To be noted that other parameters can also contributed to the loss of sales, such as a fall in the average selling price of certain products. The table below sets forth the change by product. We expect the erosion caused by generic competition to continue in 2023, with a negative impact on our net income. The products likely to be impacted in 2023 include those that already faced generic competition in 2022, but whose sales can reasonably be expected to be subject to further sales erosion in 2023 (see products listed in the table above). We also expect generic competition in the United States for Aubagio \u00ae from March 2023 and for Mozobil\u00ae from August 2023, following expiry of exclusivity in that country. In Europe, Aubagio\u00ae generic competition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2022, the aggregate consolidated net sales of those products in Europe, the United States and Japan were \u20ac2,162 million; this comprised \u20ac774 million in the United States (including \u20ac757 million in net sales of Lantus \u00ae); \u20ac1,300 million in Europe; and \u20ac88 million in Japan. The negative impact on our 2023 net sales is likely to represent a substantial portion of those sales, but the actual impact will depend on a number of factors such as the impact of generics and biosimilars on our molecules, but also the market entry of generics of molecules that are in competition with our products. In China, the authorities have implemented a range of healthcare cost containment measures, including the Volume Based Procurement (VBP) reverse auction that particularly impacts our insulin-based products, Plavix \u00ae, Aprovel\u00ae, and Lovenox\u00ae (see also \u2014 B.6.4. Pricing & Reimbursement\"). A large number of molecules were selected to submit tenders under successive waves of the VBP program, with the successful bidders being awarded a high level of market share in return for offering lower prices. We participated in a number of VBP bids and were selected for only part of the volumes awarded for 2022 and 2023 in respect of insulins (Toujeo \u00ae and Lantus\u00ae), Plavix\u00ae and Aprovel\u00ae, in return for a considerable reduction in unit prices.PART I ITEM 5.

(3)Non-IFRS financial measure: see definition in \"\u2014 B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.A.1.3. Purchase accounting effects Our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 have been significantly affected by our past acquisitions (acquisition of Aventis in August 2004, acquisition of Genzyme in April 2011, exchange of our Animal Health business (Merial) for Boehringer Ingelheim's Consumer Healthcare business in January 2017, acquisition of Bioverativ in 2018, and certain other transactions). See \"\u2014 A.1.11. Critical accounting and reporting policies \u2014 2/ Business combinations\" below for an explanation of the impact of business combinations on our results of operations. The Genzyme business combination has generated significant amortization of intangible assets (\u20ac535 million in 2022, and \u20ac529 million in 2021). The exchange of Merial for Boehringer Ingelheim's Consumer Healthcare business has generated amortization of intangible assets (\u20ac188 million in 2022, and \u20ac195 million in 2021). The Bioverativ business combination has generated significant amortization of intangible assets (\u20ac377 million in 2022, and \u20ac320 million in 2021). The Kadmon acquisition has generated amortization of intangible assets (\u20ac159 million in 2022, and \u20ac20 million in 2021). In order to isolate the purchase accounting effects of all acquisitions and certain other items, we use a non-IFRS financial measure that we refer to as \"business net income\" (see definition in \"\u2014 A.1.5. Segment Information \u2014 3. Business Net Income\" below). A.1.4. Sources of revenues and expenses Revenues. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement within Net sales . Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, consumer health care products, active ingredients and vaccines, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized, as a reduction of sales revenue. See Note B.13.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. We sell pharmaceutical products and vaccines directly, through alliances, and by licensing arrangements throughout the world. When we sell products directly, we record sales revenues as part of our consolidated net sales. When we sell products through alliances, the revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements are based on the contractual arrangements governing those alliances. For more information about our alliances, see \"\u2014 A.1.7. Financial Presentation of Alliances\" below. The line item Other revenues is used to recognize all revenue that falls within the scope of IFRS 15 but does not relate to sales of Sanofi products. It mainly comprises (i) royalties received from licensing intellectual property rights to third parties; (ii) VaxServe sales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers; and (iii) revenue received under agreements for Sanofi to provide manufacturing services to third parties. Royalties received under licensing arrangements are recognized over the period during which the underlying sales are recognized. VaxServe is a Vaccines segment entity whose operations include the distribution within the United States of vaccines and other products manufactured by third parties. Cost of Sales . Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of purchasing raw materials and active ingredients, labor and other costs relating to our manufacturing activities, packaging materials, payments made under licensing agreements and distribution costs. We have license agreements under which we manufacture, sell and distribute products that are patented by other companies. When we pay royalties, we record them in Cost of sales . Operating Income . Our operating income reflects our revenues, our cost of sales and the remainder of our operating expenses, the most significant of which are research and development expenses and selling and general expenses. For our operating segments, we also measure our results of operations through an indicator referred to as \"Business Operating Income,\" which we describe below under \"A.1.5. Segment Information \u2014 2/ Business Operating Income\". A.1.5. Segment information and Business net income 1/ Operating segments In accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segment information reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal management data provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. The performance of those segments is monitored individually using internal reports and common indicators. The operating segment disclosures required under IFRS 8 are provided in Notes B.26. and D.35. (\"Segment Information\") to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report. As indicated in Note B.26., Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines, and Consumer Healthcare. The Pharmaceuticals segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations of the following global franchises: Specialty Care (Dupixent \u00ae, Neurology & Immunology, Rare Diseases, Oncology, and Rare Blood Disorders) and General Medicines (Core and Non-Core Assets), together with research, development and production activities dedicated to the Pharmaceuticals segment. This segment also includes associates whose activities are related to pharmaceuticals. The Vaccines segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations of Vaccines, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to vaccines. The Consumer Healthcare segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations for Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare products, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to those products. Inter-segment transactions are not material.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 60 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The costs of Sanofi's global support functions (Corporate Affairs, Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics & Business Integrity, Information Solutions & Technologies, Sanofi Business Services, etc.) are primarily managed centrally at the group-wide level. The costs of those functions are presented within the \"Other\" category. That category also includes other reconciling items such as retained commitments in respect of divested activities. 2/ Business operating income We report segment results on the basis of \"Business operating income\". This indicator is used internally by Sanofi's chief operating decision maker to measure the performance of each operating segment and to allocate resources. For a definition of \"Business operating income\", and a reconciliation between that indicator and Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method , refer to Note D.35. to our consolidated financial statements. \"Business operating income\" at Group level is a non-IFRS financial measure, which is reconciled with IFRS Operating income . IFRS Operating income for 2022 amounted to \u20ac10,656 million versus \u20ac8,126 million for 2021. Our ratio of Operating Income to Net Sales was 24.8% in 2022 versus 21.5% in 2021. Our \"Business for amounted to \u20ac13,040 million, versus \u20ac10,714 million for 2021, while our \"Business income margin\" 30.3%, versus for 2021. \"Business operating income margin\" is a non-IFRS financial measure, which we define as the ratio of our \"Business operating income\" to Net sales . Because our \"Business operating income\" and \"Business operating income margin\" are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures. Although management uses those non-IFRS measures to set goals and measure performance, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how Sanofi's management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with our IFRS financials and performance measures. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors. 3/ Business net income (non-IFRS Financial measure) We believe that the understanding of our operational performance by our management and our investors is enhanced by reporting \"Business net income\". This non-IFRS financial measure represents Business operating income , less net financial expenses and the relevant income tax effects. \"Business net income\" is a non-IFRS financial measure, which is reconciled with IFRS Net income attributable to equity income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi amounted to \u20ac8,371 million for 2022, compared with \u20ac6,223 million in 2021. \"Business net \u20ac10,341 million, up on 2021 \"Business earnings per share\" (\"Business EPS\"), a non-IFRS financial measure we define as \"Business net income\" divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. \"Business EPS\" was \u20ac8.26 for 2022, 25.9% higher than the 2021 figure of \u20ac6.56, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,251.9 million for 2022 and 1,252.5 million for 2021. The table below reconciles our \"Business operating income\" to our \"Business net income\": amortization and impairment losses charged against intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature); fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration relating to business combinations or divestments or acquisition of intangible assets; other impacts associated with acquisitions (including impacts relating to investments accounted for using the equity method); restructuring costs and similar items (presented within the line item Restructuring costs and similar items ); gains and losses on major disposals of assets, asset groups or operations (presented within the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation ); costs related to major litigation (presented within the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation ); upfront payments and regulatory milestone payments recognized with the line item Other operating income and arising from transactions outside the scope of Sanofi's ordinary activities; the tax effects of the items listed above, and the effects of major tax disputes; the share of profits/losses from investments accounted for using the equity method, except for joint ventures and associates with which Sanofi has a strategic alliance; acquisition-related effects and restructuring costs relating to investments accounted for using the equity method (joint ventures and associates with which Sanofi has a strategic alliance); andWe define \"Business net income\" as Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi determined under IFRS, excluding the following items:PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 61 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(\u20ac million) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Business operating income 13,040 10,714 Financial income and expenses (234) (328) Income tax expense (2,465) (2,173) Business net income 10,341 8,213 holders . Netthe portion attributable to non-controlling interests of the items listed above. The table below reconciles our \"Business net income\" to Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi : The most significant reconciling items between \"Business net income\" and Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi relate to (i) the purchase accounting effects of our acquisitions and business combinations, particularly the amortization and impairment of intangible assets (other than software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature) and (ii) the impacts of restructurings or transactions regarded as non-recurring, where the amounts involved are particularly significant. We believe that excluding those impacts enhances an investor's understanding of our underlying economic performance, because it gives a better representation of our recurring operating performance. We believe that eliminating charges related to the purchase accounting effect of our acquisitions and business combinations (particularly amortization and impairment of some intangible assets) enhances comparability of our ongoing operating performance relative to our peers. Those intangible assets (principally rights relating to research, development and commercialization of products) are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) and hence may be subject to remeasurement. Such remeasurements are not made other than in a business combination. We also believe that eliminating the other effects of business combinations (such as the incremental cost of sales arising from the workdown of acquired inventories remeasured at fair value in business combinations) gives a better understanding of our recurring operating performance. Eliminating restructuring costs and similar items enhances comparability with our peers because those costs are incurred in connection with reorganization and transformation processes intended to optimize our operations. Finally, we believe that eliminating the effects of transactions that we regard as non-recurring and that involve particularly significant amounts (such as major gains and losses on disposals, and costs and provisions associated with major litigation and other major non-recurring items) improves comparability from one period to the next. We remind investors, however, that \"Business net income\" should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, Net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reported in accordance with IFRS. In addition, we strongly encourage investors and potential investors not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our financial statements, including the notes thereto, carefully and in their entirety. We compensate for the material limitations described above by using \"Business net income\" only to supplement our IFRS financial reporting and by ensuring that our disclosures provide sufficient information for a full understanding of all adjustments included in \"Business net income\". Because our \"Business net income\" and \"Business EPS\" are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures.PART I ITEM 5.

Presentation of net sales In the discussion below, we present our consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021. We analyze our net sales by various categories including segment, franchise, product, and geographical region. In addition to reported net sales, we analyze non-IFRS financial measures designed to isolate the impact on our net sales of currency exchange rates and changes in the structure of our group. When we refer to changes in our net sales at constant exchange rates (CER), that means that we have excluded the effect of exchange rates by recalculating net sales for the relevant period using the exchange rates that were used for the previous period. When we refer to changes in our net sales on a constant structure basis, that means that we eliminate the effect of changes in structure by restating the net sales for the previous period as follows: A presentation of consolidated net sales for 2021 compared with 2020 is available in our Form 20-F filed on February 23, 2022, Item 5., section \"A.2.1. Net Sales\". A.1.7. Financial presentation of alliances We have entered into a number of alliances for the development, co-promotion and/or co-marketing of our products. We believe that a presentation of our two principal alliances is useful to an understanding of our financial statements. 1/ Alliance arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Regeneron) Collaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies In November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements (amended in November 2009) relating to human therapeutic antibodies: (i) the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, and (ii) the License and Collaboration Agreement, relating to clinical development and commercialization. Under the License and Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi had an option to develop and commercialize antibodies discovered by Regeneron under the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement. Discovery and development Because Sanofi decided not to exercise its option to extend the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, that agreement expired on December 31, 2017. As a result of Sanofi's exercise of an option with respect to an antibody under the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, such antibody became a \"Licensed Product\" under the License and Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which Sanofi and Regeneron co-develop the antibody with Sanofi initially being wholly responsible for funding the development program. On receipt of the first positive Phase III trial results for any antibody being developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement, the subsequent development costs for that antibody are split 80% Sanofi, 20% Regeneron. Amounts received from Regeneron under the License and Collaboration Agreement are recognized by Sanofi as a reduction in the line item Research and development expenses . Co-development with Regeneron of the antibodies Dupixent \u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae and REGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) is ongoing under the License and Collaboration Agreement as of December 31, 2022. Once a product begins to be commercialized, and provided that the share of quarterly results under the agreement represents a profit, Sanofi is entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron's profit-share (capped at 20% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits since April 1, 2022, and at 10% until March 31, 2022) until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties in the collaboration (see Note D.21.1.). On the later of (i) 24 months before the scheduled launch date or (ii) the first positive Phase III trial results, Sanofi and Regeneron share the commercial expenses of the antibodies co-developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement. Commercialization Sanofi is the lead party with respect to the commercialization of all co-developed antibodies, and Regeneron has certain option rights to co-promote the antibodies. Regeneron has exercised its co-promotion rights in the United States and in certain other countries. Sanofi recognizes all sales of the antibodies. Profits and losses arising from commercial operations in the United States are split 50/50. Outside the United States, Sanofi is entitled to between 55% and 65% of profits depending on sales of the antibodies, and bears 55% of any losses. The share of profits and losses due to or from Regeneron under the agreement is recognized within the line items Other operating income or Other operating expenses , which are components of Operating income . In addition, Regeneron is entitled to receive payments contingent on the attainment of specified levels of aggregate sales on all antibodies outside the United States, on a rolling twelve-month basis. A liability for those payments is recognized on the balance sheet when it is probable that the specified level of aggregate sales will be met. The opposite entry for that liability is capitalized within Other intangible assets on the balance sheet. Two payments of $50 million each were made in 2022, following attainment first of $2.0 billion and then of $2.5 billion in sales of all antibodies outside the United States on a rolling twelve-month basis. In the event that $3.0 billion in sales on a rolling twelve-month basis is attained, Regeneron is entitled to a final milestone payment of $50 million.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 63 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Amendments to the collaboration agreements In January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a set of amendments to their collaboration agreements, including an amendment that allowed for the funding of additional programs on Dupixent\u00ae and REGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) with an intended focus on extending the current range of indications, finding new indications, and improving co-morbidity between multiple pathologies. Effective April 1, 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a Cross License and Commercialization Agreement for Praluent \u00ae, whereby Sanofi obtained sole ex-US rights to Praluent\u00ae, and Regeneron obtained sole US rights to Praluent\u00ae along with a right to 5% royalties on Sanofi's sales of Praluent\u00ae outside the United States. Each party is solely responsible for funding the development, manufacturing and commercialization of Praluent\u00ae in their respective territories. Although each party has responsibility for supplying Praluent\u00ae in its respective territory, Sanofi and Regeneron have entered into agreements to support manufacturing needs for each other. Effective September 30, 2021, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to specify allocations of responsibilities and associated resources between the two parties in connection with the co-promotion of Dupixent\u00ae in certain countries. The terms of the collaboration relating to REGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) are unchanged. Effective July 1, 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to increase the additional portion of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits attributable to Sanofi from 10% to 20% with retroactive impact as of April 1, 2022. Immuno-oncology (IO) collaboration agreements On July 1, 2015, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements - the IO Discovery and Development Agreement and the IO License and Collaboration Agreement (IO LCA) - relating to new antibody cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology. The Amended IO Discovery Agreement, effective from December 31, 2018, was terminated through a Letter Amendment dated March 16, 2021 in which Sanofi formalized its opt-out from the BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 programs. Libtayo\u00ae (cemiplimab) Under the 2015 IO LCA as amended in January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron committed funding of no more than $1,640 million, split on a 50/50 basis ($820 million per company), for the development of REGN2810 (cemiplimab, trademark Libtayo \u00ae), a PD-1 inhibitor antibody. The funding was raised to $1,840 million by way of amendment effective on September 30, 2021. Regeneron was responsible for the commercialization of Libtayo \u00ae in the United States, and Sanofi in all other territories. Sanofi has exercised its option to co-promote Libtayo\u00ae in the United States. In 2021, Regeneron exercised its option to co-promote Libtayo\u00ae in certain other countries. The IO LCA also provided for a one-time milestone payment of $375 million by Sanofi to Regeneron in the event that sales of a PD-1 product were to exceed, in the aggregate, $2 billion in any consecutive 12-month period. Under the IO LCA Sanofi and Regeneron shared equally in profits and losses generated by the commercialization of collaboration products, except that Sanofi was entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron's profit-share (capped at 10% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits) until Regeneron had paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties under the IO Discovery Agreement, as amended. Libtayo \u00ae is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of two types of locally advanced or metastatic skin cancer (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is also approved in Brazil and Canada as a second line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it was approved in the United States in association with chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and in Europe and Japan as a second line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. Libtayo \u00ae is currently approved in more than 30 countries. In June 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their IO LCA. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated IO LCA, Regeneron holds exclusive worldwide licensing rights to Libtayo \u00ae with effect from July 1, 2022. In July 2022, Sanofi received as consideration an upfront payment of $900 million (\u20ac856 million), which was recognized within Other operating income on the date of receipt. The same line item also includes a regulatory milestone payment of $100 million (\u20ac96 million) following the US FDA approval in November 2022 of Libtayo \u00ae in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for NSCLC. In addition, Sanofi is entitled to royalties of 11% and to milestone payments (\u20ac111 million in 2022) linked to global net sales of Libtayo \u00ae which are recognized within Other operating income in line with the pattern of sales. All of the cash inflows relating to the above items (\u20ac967 million for the year ended December 31, 2022) are presented within Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The amendment to the terms of the IO LCA resulted in Sanofi recognizing an accelerated amortization charge of \u20ac226 million; this was allocated to the Libtayo\u00ae product rights included within the residual carrying amount of the intangible asset recognized in July 2015 to reflect rights to an antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) under the Sanofi/Regeneron alliance. The transaction also includes a time-limited transitional services agreement with Regeneron which includes manufacturing, distribution (for which Sanofi acts as agent), and promotion.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 64 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Investor agreement In 2014 and 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron amended the investor agreement entered into by the two companies in 2007. Under the terms of the amendments, Sanofi accepted various restrictions, including \"standstill\" provisions that contractually prohibit Sanofi from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of Regeneron or acquiring more than 30% of Regeneron's capital stock (consisting of the outstanding shares of common stock and the shares of Class A stock). This prohibition remains in place until the earlier of (i) the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the Zaltrap \u00ae collaboration agreement with Regeneron (related to the development and commercialization of Zaltrap\u00ae) or the collaboration agreement with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies (see \"Collaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies\" above), each as amended and (ii) other specified events. Starting in 2018 Sanofi began to sell shares of Regeneron stock and announced on May 29, 2020 the closing of its sale of 13 million shares of Regeneron common stock in a registered offering and a private sale to Regeneron (see Note D.2.). Pursuant to subsequent sales, as of December 31, 2022 Sanofi no longer holds any shares of Regeneron stock. 2/ Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) Two of Sanofi's products were jointly developed with BMS: the On September 27, 2012, Sanofi and BMS signed an agreement relating to their alliance following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae in many major markets. Under the terms of this agreement, effective January 1, 2013, BMS returned to Sanofi its rights to Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae in all markets worldwide with the exception of Plavix\u00ae in the United States and Puerto Rico (\"Territory B\"), giving Sanofi sole control and freedom to operate commercially in respect of those products. In exchange, BMS received royalty payments on Sanofi's sales of branded and unbranded Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae worldwide (except for Plavix\u00ae in Territory B) until 2018, and also received a payment of $200 million from Sanofi in December 2018, part of which is for buying out the non-controlling interests. Rights to Plavix \u00ae in Territory B remained unchanged and continued to be governed by the terms of the original agreement until February 28, 2020. In all of the territories managed by Sanofi (including the United States and Puerto Rico for Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae) as defined in the new agreement, Sanofi recognized in its consolidated financial statements the revenue and expenses generated by its own operations. Since January 2019 onwards, there has no longer been any share of profits reverting to BMS (previously presented within Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the income statement). In Territory B for Plavix \u00ae, which was managed by BMS, the Plavix\u00ae business was conducted through the Territory B partnerships, which were jointly owned by BMS and Sanofi. Sanofi recognized its share of profits and losses within the line item Share of profit/ (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method . On February 28, 2020, Sanofi purchased all BMS's interests (50.1%) in each of the Territory B partnerships for a cumulative purchase price of $12 million. Following a transition period, Sanofi has been commercializing Plavix \u00ae under its own label since July 1, 2020. A.1.8. Impact of exchange rates We report our consolidated financial statements in euros. Because we earn a significant portion of our revenues in countries where the euro is not the local currency, our results of operations can be significantly affected by exchange rate movements between the euro and other currencies, primarily the US dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen, and currencies in emerging countries. We experience these effects even though certain of these countries do not account for a large portion of our net sales. In 2022, we earned 42.5% of our net sales in the United States. An increase in the value of the US dollar against the euro has a positive impact on both our revenues and our operating income. A decrease in the value of the US dollar against the euro has a negative impact on our revenues, which is not offset by an equal reduction in our costs and therefore negatively affects our operating income. A variation in the value of the US dollar has a particularly significant impact on our operating income, which is higher in the United States than elsewhere. For a description of arrangements entered into to manage operating foreign exchange risks as well as our hedging policy, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\", and \"Item 3. Key Information \u2014 D. Risk Factors \u2014 Risks Related to Financial Markets \u2014 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\".PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 65 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022A.1.9. Divestments On May 3, 2022, Sanofi's General Meeting of Shareholders approved the decision to distribute approximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI , a European leader in the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), in the form of an exceptional dividend in kind to Sanofi shareholders. On the dividend payment date of May 10, 2022 (further to the admission of EUROAPI shares to listing on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on May 6, 2022), Sanofi divested control over EUROAPI and its subsidiaries, resulting in their deconsolidation from the Sanofi consolidated financial statements as of that date. On June 17, 2022 (the date of delivery of the EUROAPI shares to the French State via the French Tech Souverainet\u00e9 fund), EPIC Bpifrance acquired a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI. Following completion of those transactions, Sanofi retains an equity interest of 30.1% in EUROAPI, which has been accounted for using the equity method since the date of loss of control. The cash impact of the deconsolidation of EUROAPI, presented within the line item Disposals of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the statement of cash flows, was a net cash inflow of \u20ac101 million. For further details about the divestments mentioned above, see Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. A.1.10. Acquisitions On February 8, 2022, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of the immuno-oncology company Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amunix), thereby gaining access to Amunix's innovative Pro-XTEN TM technology and a promising pipeline of immunotherapies. The acquisition price of Amunix comprises a fixed payment of \u20ac970 million, plus contingent consideration in the form of milestone payments based on attainment of certain future development objectives of up to $225 million, the fair value of which as of the acquisition date was \u20ac156 million. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of \u20ac852 million. On April 8, 2021, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of Kymab for an upfront payment of $1.1 billion (\u20ac973 million) and up to $350 million (\u20ac295 million) contingent upon reaching certain development milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of \u20ac965 million of other intangible assets . The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of \u20ac932 million. On April 16, 2021, Sanofi completed the public offering for Kiadis. As of the end of the post-closing acceptance period on April 29, 2021, Sanofi held 97.39% of the share capital of Kiadis, and launched a statutory public buy-out procedure in order to obtain 100% of the share capital. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of \u20ac339 million of other intangible assets .

On April 9, 2021, Sanofi acquired Tidal Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $160 million (\u20ac136 million), and up to $310 million (\u20ac261 million) contingent upon reaching certain development milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of \u20ac130 million of other intangible assets . The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of \u20ac135 million. On September 14, 2021, Sanofi completed the acquisition of Translate Bio for a purchase price of \u20ac2.6 billion. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of goodwill amounting to \u20ac2,118 million. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of \u20ac2,333 million. On November 9, 2021, Sanofi completed the acquisition of Kadmon in a transaction valued at $1.9 billion (\u20ac1.6 billion) on a fully- diluted basis. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of \u20ac1,739 million of other intangible assets. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of \u20ac1,575 million. On December 3, 2021, Sanofi completed the acquisition of Origimm Biotechnology GmbH, for an initial payment of \u20ac55 million, and up to \u20ac95 million contingent upon reaching certain development phases. The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of \u20ac55 million of other intangible assets. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 is a net cash outflow of \u20ac50 million. For further information about the acquisitions mentioned above, see Notes D.1. and D.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 66 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022A.1.11. Critical accounting and reporting policies Our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting and reporting policies that we use. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, and in some cases the application of these critical policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting and reporting policies that we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are the following: 1/ Revenue recognition Our policies with respect to revenue recognition are discussed in Note B.13. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement within Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, consumer healthcare products, active ingredients and vaccines, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. In accordance with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), such revenue is recognized when Sanofi transfers control over the product to the customer. Control refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the products. For the vast majority of contracts, revenue is recognized when the product is physically transferred, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customer. For contracts entered into by Sanofi Pasteur, transfer of control is usually determined by reference to the terms of release (immediate or deferred) and acceptance of batches of vaccine. As regards contracts with distributors, Sanofi does not recognize revenue when the product is physically transferred to the distributor in case of products sold on consignment, or if the distributor acts as an agent. In such cases, revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the end customer, and the distributor's commission is presented within the line item Selling and general expenses in the income statement. We offer various types of price reductions on our products. In particular, products sold in the United States are covered by various programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to healthcare authorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives based on the selling price to the end customer, under specific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. The discounts, incentives and rebates described above are estimated on the basis of specific contractual arrangements with our customers or of specific terms of the relevant regulations and/or agreements applicable for transactions with healthcare authorities, and of assumptions about the attainment of sales targets. We also estimate the amount of sales returns, on the basis of contractual sales terms and reliable historical data. Discounts, incentives, rebates and sales returns are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized within Net Sales , as a reduction of gross sales. For additional details regarding the financial impact of discounts, incentives, rebates and sales returns, see Note D.23. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. Revenues from non-Sanofi products, mainly comprising royalty income from license arrangements and sales of non-Sanofi products by our US-based entity VaxServe, are presented within Other revenues . This line item also includes revenues arising from the distribution of Eloctate \u00ae and Alprolix\u00ae under Sanofi's agreements with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Sobi) and revenue received under agreements for Sanofi to provide manufacturing services to third parties. 2/ Business combinations As discussed in Note B.3. \"Business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method. The acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are measured initially at their fair values as at the acquisition date, except for (i) non-current assets classified as held for sale, which are measured at fair value less costs to sell and (ii) assets and liabilities that fall within the scope of IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Business combinations completed on or after January 1, 2010 are accounted for in accordance with the revised IFRS 3 and IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements). In particular, contingent consideration payable to former owners agreed in a business combination, e.g. in the form of payments upon the achievement of certain R&D milestones, is recognized as a liability at fair value as of the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent consideration was originally recognized as a liability, subsequent adjustments to the liability are recognized in profit or loss (see Note D.18. \"Liabilities related to business combinations and non-controlling interests\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report). 3/ Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets As discussed in Note B.6. \"Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments accounted for using the equity method\" and in Note D.5. \"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, we test our intangible assets for impairment periodically or when there is any internal or external indication of impairment. Such indicators could include primarily but not exclusively (i) increased market competition resulting from (for example) the introduction of a competitor's product; (ii) earlier than expected loss of exclusivity; (iii) increased pricing pressure; (iv) restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities on the manufacture or sale of a product; (v) delay in the projected launch of a product; (vi) different from expected clinical trial results; (vii) higher than expected development costs or (viii) lower than expected economic performance. We test for impairment on the basis of the same objective criteria that were used for the initial valuation. Our initial valuation and ongoing tests are based on the relationship of the value of our projected future cash flows associated with the asset to either the purchase price of the asset (for its initial valuation) or the carrying amount of the asset (for ongoing tests for impairment).PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 67 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022sales . Net(iii) projected pricing and operating margin levels; (iv) likely changes in the regulatory, legal or tax environment; and (v)management's estimates of terminal growth or attrition rates.Significant underlying assumptions requiring the exercise of considerable judgement are applied in the future cash flow projections used to determine the recoverability of intangible assets, including primarily but not exclusively (i) therapeutic class market growth drivers; (ii) expected impacts from competing products (including but not exclusively generics and biosimilars); The recoverable amounts of intangible assets related to research and development projects are determined based on future net cash flows, which reflect the development stage of the project and the associated probability of success of marketization of the compound. The projected cash flows are discounted to present value using a discount rate, which factors in the risks inherent in cash flow projections. Changes in facts and circumstances, assumptions and/or estimates may lead to future additional impairment losses or reversal of impairment previously recorded. Key assumptions relating to goodwill impairment are the perpetual growth rate and the post-tax discount rate. A sensitivity analysis to the key assumptions is disclosed in Note D.5. \"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. 4/ Pensions and post-retirement benefits As described in Note B.23. \"Employee benefit obligations\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, we recognize our pension and retirement benefit commitments as liabilities on the basis of an actuarial estimate of the rights vested in employees and retirees at the end of the reporting period, net of the fair value of plan assets held to meet those obligations. We prepare this estimate at least on an annual basis taking into account financial assumptions (such as discount rates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement age, employee turnover, and the rate of salary increases). We recognize all actuarial gains and losses (including the impact of a change in discount rate) immediately through equity.Depending on the key assumptions used, the pension and post-retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. A sensitivity analysis to these key assumptions is set forth in Note D.19.1. \"Provisions for pensions and other benefits\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. 5/ Taxes As discussed in Note B.22. \"Income tax expense\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, we recognize deferred income taxes on tax loss carry-forwards and on temporary differences between the tax base and carrying amount of assets and liabilities. We calculate our deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates applicable for the years during which we estimate that the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We do not recognize deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The recognition of deferred tax assets is determined on the basis of profit forecasts for each tax group, and of the tax consequences of the strategic opportunities available to Sanofi. The positions adopted by Sanofi in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Some of those positions may be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, Sanofi assesses the amount of the tax liability on the basis of the following assumptions: that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities on the basis of all relevant information; that a technical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, and established practice; and that each position is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions. Those assumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reporting period. When an uncertain tax liability is regarded as probable, it is measured on the basis of Sanofi's best estimate and recognized as a liability; uncertain tax assets are not recognized. 6/ Provisions for risks Sanofi and its subsidiaries and affiliates may be involved in litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights, compliance and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. As discussed in Note B.12. \"Provisions for risks\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report, we record a provision where we have a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of resources. We also disclose a contingent liability in circumstances where we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect that will result from the ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash outflow is not probable. For additional details regarding the financial impact of provisions for risks see Notes D.19.3. \"Other provisions\" and D.22. \"Legal and Arbitral Proceedings\" to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 68 SANOFI FORM 20-F 20227/ Provisions for restructuring costs Provisions for restructuring costs include collective redundancy or early retirement benefits, compensation for early termination of contracts, and rationalization costs relating to restructured sites. Refer to Note D.19.2. to our consolidated financial statements included at Item 18. of this annual report. Provisions are estimated on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the end of the reporting period and of past experience, and to the best of management's knowledge at the date of preparation of the financial statements. The assessment of provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Given the inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, the actual outflows resulting from the realization of those risks could differ from our estimates. A.2.

Net sales Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac42,997 million, 13.9% higher than in 2021 in a reported basis. Exchange rate fluctuations had a positive effect of 6.9 percentage points overall, due mainly to favorable trends of the US dollar and Chinese yuan against the euro. At constant exchange rates (CER (4)), net sales rose by 7.0%, mainly reflecting strong growth for Dupixent\u00ae and increased sales for our Vaccines business, more than offsetting lower sales for our Non Core Assets franchise. Reconciliation of net sales to net sales at constant exchange rates We calculate net sales CER by recalculating net sales for the relevant period using the exchange rates that were used for the previous period. To facilitate analysis and comparisons with prior periods, some figures are given at constant exchange rates (CER). 1/ Net sales by operating segment and global business unit (GBU) Our net sales comprise the net sales generated by our Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare segments.PART I ITEM 5.

Operating and financial review and prospects 71 SANOFI FORM 20-F 20223/ Net sales - Pharmaceuticals segment In 2022, net sales for the Pharmaceuticals segment amounted to \u20ac30,688 million, up 13.8% on a reported basis and 6.9% at constant exchange rates (CER). The year-on-year reported-basis increase of \u20ac3,718 million reflects positive exchange rate effects of \u20ac1,849 million, and the following principal effects at constant exchange rates: solid performances from Dupixent\u00ae (+\u20ac2,297 million), the launch of Nexviazyme\u00ae (+\u20ac162 million), and sales growth for Sarclisa\u00ae (+\u20ac106 million); and growth for the Core Assets franchise within the General Medicines GBU (+\u20ac302 million), partly offsetting lower sales for the Non Core Assets franchise (-\u20ac689 million). Comments on the performances of our major Pharmaceuticals segment products are provided below. Specialty Care Dupixent\u00ae Dupixent\u00ae (developed in collaboration with Regeneron) generated net sales of \u20ac8,293 million in 2022, up 58.0% versus 2021 on a reported basis and 43.8% at constant exchange rates. In the United States, sales of Dupixent\u00ae reached \u20ac6,346 million in 2022, up 41.6% CER, boosted by continuing strong demand in the product's approved indications (atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps); the launches in atopic dermatitis for children aged 6 months and over, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prurigo nodularis. Total prescriptions of Dupixent rose 38%, and new-to-brand prescriptions by 41% compared to 2021. In Europe, the product posted 2022 net sales of \u20ac940 million, up 44.4% CER, driven by continuing growth in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps. In the Rest of the World region, Dupixent \u00ae posted net sales of \u20ac1,007 million (+56.6% CER), including \u20ac364 million in Japan (+33.0% CER) and \u20ac237 million in China (+197.3% CER). Neurology and immunology In 2022, the Neurology and Immunology franchise generated net sales of \u20ac2,450 million, up 5.4% on a reported basis and down 2.5% CER, mainly reflecting lower sales of Aubagio\u00ae. Aubagio\u00ae posted net sales of \u20ac2,031 million in 2022 (-4.3% CER), due to negative price effects and to lower sales in the United States (-3.8% CER at \u20ac1,420 million, due to increased competition) and the Rest of the World region (-26.0% CER at \u20ac100 million). In the United States, Aubagio \u00ae generic competition will be able to enter the market on March 12, 2023, as agreed in 2017 with the generics manufacturers. In Europe, Aubagio\u00ae generic competition is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. In 2022, net sales of Lemtrada\u00ae amounted to \u20ac80 million, down 8.5% CER, on a decline in sales in the United States (-20.0% CER at \u20ac31 million) and Europe (-8.3% CER at \u20ac22 million). Net sales of Kevzara\u00ae (developed in collaboration with Regeneron) in 2022 reached \u20ac339 million, up 11.8% CER. Rare diseases In 2022, net sales for the Rare Diseases franchise totaled \u20ac3,445 million, up 10.2% on a reported basis and 5.7% at constant exchange rates (CER), reflecting a rise in all three regions and franchises. The Rest of the World region is driving growth with net sales up 7.8% CER at \u20ac974 million, followed by the United States, where net sales advanced by 6.3% CER to \u20ac1,367 million. In Europe, net sales for the franchise rose by 3.3% CER to \u20ac1,104 million. Net sales for the Gaucher disease franchise ( Cerezyme\u00ae and Cerdelga\u00ae) reached \u20ac995 million 2022, up CER. Cerezyme\u00ae sales were up 2.6% CER at \u20ac707 million, helped by a solid performance in the Rest of the World region (+9.0% CER at \u20ac274 million), driven by new patients on therapy and benefiting from favorable pricing. In parallel, sales of Cerdelga \u00ae rose by 6.7% CER to \u20ac288 million, driven by the United States (+7.6% CER at \u20ac160 million), Europe (+5.7% CER at \u20ac111 million), and the Rest of the World region (+5.9% CER at \u20ac17 million) as new patients adopted the product or switched treatment. Net sales of the Pompe disease franchise (Myozyme\u00ae/Lumizyme\u00ae and Nexviazyme\u00ae) were up 7.3% CER in 2022 at \u20ac1,154 million, driven by the Nexviazyme\u00ae launch in the United States, Europe and Japan. Nexviazyme\u00ae sales reached \u20ac196 million, including \u20ac158 million in the United States. Sales of Myozyme\u00ae/Lumizyme\u00ae were down year-on-year (-8.8% CER at \u20ac958 million) due to switches of eligible Pompe patients (advanced stage) to Nexviazyme\u00ae. Net sales of the Fabry disease treatment Fabrazyme\u00ae in 2022 were \u20ac938 million (+5.2% CER), propelled by the United States (+5.8% CER at \u20ac471 million), the Rest of the World region (+7.1% CER at \u20ac239 million) and Europe (+2.2% CER at \u20ac228 million), due to more patients adopting the product and better observance of the treatment. Xenpozyme \u00ae (olipudase alfa), the first and only treatment for non-neurological manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency (ASMD) has been approved by the FDA and EMA, in Japan, and in Brazil. Xenpozyme\u00ae has been launched in six countries and reported sales of \u20ac15 million in Europe, \u20ac5 million in the US and \u20ac1 million in the Rest of the World region. Oncology In 2022, net sales for the Oncology franchise amounted to \u20ac952 million, up 4.4% on a reported basis and down 1.5% CER, reflecting the end of consolidation of Libtayo\u00ae sales from the beginning of July. Excluding Libtayo\u00ae, Oncology sales were up 3.8% CER, as strong growth for Sarclisa\u00ae more than offset the impact of declining Jevtana\u00ae sales due to generic competition in Europe and increased competition in the US.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 72 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Sanofi stopped consolidating non-US Libtayo\u00ae sales from the start of the third quarter of 2022 following the restructuring of its immuno-oncology collaboration with Regeneron, pursuant to which Regeneron obtained the worldwide exclusive licensing rights to Libtayo\u00ae. Previously, the companies had split Libtayo\u00ae worldwide operating profits equally and co-commercialized Libtayo\u00ae in the US, with Sanofi solely responsible for commercialization in the rest of the world. In 2022, net sales of Sarclisa\u00ae reached \u20ac294 million, up 60.2% CER, driven by a very strong performance in the United States (+\u20ac127 million, up 68.7% CER), in Europe (\u20ac88 million, up 35.9% CER), and in Japan (\u20ac66 million, up 75.0% CER). Jevtana\u00ae posted net sales of \u20ac391 million in 2022 (-20.0% CER), as sales decreased in Europe (-70.5% CER at \u20ac33 million) following the arrival of generic competition in some European markets at end March 2021. In the United States, Jevtana\u00ae is currently covered by four Orange Book listed patents: US 7,241,907, US 8,927,592, US 10,583,110 and US 10,716,777. Sanofi has filed patent infringement suits under Hatch-Waxman against generic filers asserting the '110 patent, the '777 patent and the '592 patent in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. Sanofi has since reached settlement agreements with most of the defendants, and the suit against the remaining defendant (Sandoz) is ongoing. In August 2022, the district court dismissed Sanofi's infringement claim related to the '592 patent. A three-day trial took place on January 11 through January 13, 2023, and Sandoz agreed not to launch any generic cabazitaxel product until the earlier of a district court decision in favor of Sandoz or four months after the completion of the post-trial briefing. Jevtana \u00ae sales in the United States were down 3.2% CER at \u20ac275 million. Rare Blood Disorders In 2022, the Rare Blood Disorders franchise generated net sales of \u20ac1,317 million, up 15.4% on a reported basis and 5.6% at constant exchange rates, mainly as a result of growth for Alprolix\u00ae and Cablivi\u00ae and the launch of Enjaymo\u00ae, more than offsetting lower sales of Eloctate\u00ae. Eloctate\u00ae, indicated in the treatment of hemophilia A, generated net sales of \u20ac580 million in 2022, down 5.9% CER, due to competitive pressure and lower sales in the Rest of the World region (-3.0% CER). In 2022, net sales of Alprolix\u00ae, indicated in the treatment of hemophilia B, were \u20ac504 million, up 10.4% CER. In the United States, sales of the product reached \u20ac406 million, up 8.7% CER, reflecting patient switching to prophylactic treatments. Cablivi\u00ae, which treats acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) in adults, posted net sales of \u20ac211 million in 2022, up 20.7% CER, reflecting increased ATTP awareness and treatment in line with guidelines from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) recommending first line use of Cablivi\u00ae for all aTTP patients. Sales reached \u20ac110 million in the United States (+21.0% CER), while in Europe net sales were up 16.0% CER at \u20ac94 million mainly due to higher market penetration as a result of increased product awareness. Net sales of Enjaymo \u00ae, the first-ever treatment for cold agglutinin disease, reached \u20ac22 million. The product was launched in the United States and Japan during 2022, and approved in Europe in November 2022. General Medicines In 2022, net sales for the General Medicines GBU decreased by 4.2%. Core assets accounted for 47% of total General Medicines sales in 2022, compared with 43% in 2021 (excluding industrial sales). Divestments of non-core assets had a negative impact of 0.8 ppt, and the deconsolidation of EUROAPI third party sales, a negative impact of 2.4 ppt. In 2022, Industrial sales were \u20ac620 million, down 26.2%, reflecting the impact of the deconsolidation of EUROAPI third party sales. Core Assets In 2022, global Core Assets sales were \u20ac6,389 million, up 10.8% on a reported basis and 5.2% at constant exchange rates, with double-digit growth for Praluent\u00ae and Thymoglobulin\u00ae and a strong contribution from Toujeo\u00ae, Multaq\u00ae, and Rezurock\u00ae, partly offset by lower sales of Lovenox\u00ae. Sales rose in all geographies during the period, with the strongest growth in China (+19.1% CER at \u20ac795 million). Net sales of Lovenox\u00ae were \u20ac1,310 million in 2022, down 13.8% CER, reflecting lower COVID-19-related demand compared to 2021, which also led to a contraction in the Low Weight Molecular Heparins market. At the same time, penetration of biosimilars increased. In 2022, Toujeo\u00ae posted net sales of \u20ac1,117 million, up 9.8% CER, driven by the Rest of the World region (+23.7% CER at \u20ac413 million. In China, there was increased demand and a favorable comparative base, reflecting price and inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2021 in anticipation of the implementation of the Value Based Procurement program for insulins. Europe also reported growth (+7.1% CER at \u20ac421 million). Net sales of Plavix\u00ae were up by 2.5% at \u20ac983 million in 2022, reflecting consistent volume growth in China (+10.3% CER at \u20ac462 million) more than offset lower sales in Europe (-12.2% CER) and in the US (-11.1% CER). Net sales of Multaq\u00ae totaled \u20ac383 million in 2022, up 4.3% CER, mainly due to growth in US sales (+5.5% CER). In 2022 net sales of Praluent\u00ae were \u20ac376 million, up 65.1% CER, reflecting a solid performance in Europe (+41.6% CER, at \u20ac229 million) and an accelerated ramp-up in China due to inclusion in the National Drug Reimbursement List (NDRL) effective January 2022.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 73 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Net sales of Soliqua\u00ae were up 1.5% CER at \u20ac215 million in 2022. Growth was driven by the Rest of the World region (+23.5% CER at \u20ac67 million), partly offset by a decrease in US sales to \u20ac119 million (-7.8% CER). Soliqua\u00ae was approved in China in January 2022, and Sanofi will work with the authorities with a view to the product being added to the NRDL. Sales of Rezurock\u00ae were \u20ac207 million in 2022. Since its launch, more than 1,400 patients have been treated with Rezurock\u00ae (over 30% of the current potential patient population worldwide), with strong persistency rates. Non-Core Assets In 2022, net sales of Non-Core Assets amounted to \u20ac7,222 million, down 5.5% on a reported basis and 9.0% at constant exchange rates (and down 7.4% excluding the impact of divestments), reflecting the impact of VBP in China on sales of Lantus\u00ae, Eloxatin\u00ae and Taxotere\u00ae, along with lower sales of Lantus\u00ae in the United States. Net sales of Lantus\u00ae in 2022 were down 14.4% CER at \u20ac2,259 million, reflecting lower sales in the United States (-22.1% CER), impacted by prior formulary losses and erosion of the basal insulin market. In Europe, Lantus\u00ae sales were down 10.1% at \u20ac426 million, due to biosimilar competition and switches to Toujeo\u00ae. In the Rest of the World region, sales were also down, by 10.4% CER at \u20ac1,076 million, mainly as a result of the rollout of the VBP program in China in May 2022. In China, Sanofi participated in the VBP tender for basal insulin analogs in November 2021, and was among the bidding winners in Group A with Toujeo\u00ae and Lantus\u00ae. In 2022, sales of Toujeo\u00ae and Lantus\u00ae in China amounted to \u20ac447 million (-10.7%), reflecting high volumes but at significantly lower prices. Net sales of Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00ae were \u20ac478 million, up 7.6% CER, driven by regaining market share in the Rest of the World region following supply constraints in the previous year. 4/ Net sales - Vaccines segment/GBU In 2022, the Vaccines segment posted net sales of \u20ac7,229 million, up 14.3% on a reported basis and 6.3% CER. The main drivers were the progressive recovery of travel vaccines (+57.8% CER, at \u20ac510 million), other vaccines (+86.9% CER at \u20ac167 million), and influenza vaccines (+2.4% CER at \u20ac2,977 million). At the same time, sales of meningitis vaccines decreased by 3.6% CER to \u20ac703 million. Sales of influenza vaccines rose by 2.4 % CER in 2022 to \u20ac2,977 million, as new manufacturing capacity in the US took influenza vaccines sales to record levels. This perfrormance was once again driven by the ongoing conversion to differentiated premium priced vaccines, such as Fluzone \u00ae HD in the US and Efluelda\u00ae in Europe, that have demonstrated improved efficacy against a standard dose vaccine in randomized controlled trials. Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines generated net sales of \u20ac2,285 million in 2022, up 2.5% CER, sustained by growth in the Rest of the World region (+7.2% CER at \u20ac1,504 million), especially in China. In Europe, net sales of PPH vaccines were up 6.9% CER at \u20ac325 million, while in the United States sales were down 13.8% CER at \u20ac456 million. As a reminder, Vaxelis \u00ae US sales are not consolidated, and the profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck & co. Net sales of Meningitis/Pneumonia vaccines for 2022 were \u20ac703 million, down 3.6% CER, mainly on lower sales in the United States (-4.9% CER at \u20ac531 million). Sales in the Rest of the World region were down 8.2% CER at \u20ac157 million. In 2022, sales of Booster vaccines advanced by 11.3% CER to \u20ac587 million, driven by the Rest of the World region. Net sales of travel and endemics vaccines in 2022 were \u20ac510 million, up 57.8% CER, reflecting growth across all geographies in a post-pandemic environment. Net sales of other vaccines were \u20ac167 million (+86.9% CER), and include sales of the recently approved monovalent recombinant- protein COVID-19 booster vaccine VidPrevtyn\u00ae Beta. 5/ Net sales - Consumer Healthcare segment/GBU In 2022, net sales for the Consumer Healthcare (CHC) segment increased by 13.7% on a reported basis and 8.6% at CER to \u20ac5,080 million, driven by double-digit growth in Europe and the Rest of the World region. In 2022, divestments of non-core products had a negative impact of 1.0 ppt. CHC therefore achieved organic growth of 9.6% in 2022 excluding divestments. In the United States , CHC net sales amounted to \u20ac1,290 million in 2022, up 0.8% CER. In Europe , CHC net sales were up 13.1% CER in 2022 at \u20ac1,501 million, reflecting a more intense Cough & Cold season. In the Rest of the World region, CHC net sales were up 10.0% CER at \u20ac2,289 million in 2022, driven mainly by growth in Cough, Cold and Allergy products.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 74 SANOFI FORM 20-F 20226/ Net sales by geographical region The table below sets forth our net sales for 2022 and 2021 by geographical region: In 2022, net sales in the United States reached \u20ac18,275 million, up 27.0% on a reported basis and 12.2% at constant exchange rates, reflecting a strong performance from Dupixent\u00ae (+41.6 CER at \u20ac6,346 million) and the Core Assets franchise (\u20ac1,653 million, representing 11.6 % growth). In Europe , net sales advanced by 2.5% on a reported basis and 2.4% at constant exchange rates in 2022 to \u20ac9,999 million. A substantial rise in sales for Dupixent\u00ae (+44.4% CER at \u20ac940 million) and sales growth for the CHC GBU (+13.1% CER at \u20ac1,501 million) more than offset lower sales for the Non Core Assets franchise (-10.9% CER). In the Rest of the World region, net sales for 2022 increased by 8.1% on a reported basis and 4.8% at constant exchange rates to \u20ac14,723 million, due to exceptional performances from Dupixent\u00ae (+56.6% CER, at \u20ac1,007 million), Sarclisa\u00ae (+82.2% CER, at \u20ac79 million) and Booster and Travel Vaccines. China led the way in terms of growth, with net sales up 6.2% CER at \u20ac3,123 million, driven by an acceleration in sales of Dupixent\u00ae. In Japan , net sales rose by +3.1% CER to \u20ac1,613 million, also on higher sales of Dupixent\u00ae. Sales in Turkey also registered a very strong rise (+53.4% CER at \u20ac405 million). Dupixent\u00ae was also a growth driver in Russia , with sales of the product up 88.9%. Total sales in Russia increased by 0.7% CER. In March 2022, Sanofi suspended new spending not directly related to the supply of its essential medicines and vaccines in Russia. This includes advertising and promotional activities. Although the long-term repercussions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in 2022, including accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the activities of our subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine represented less than 1% of our consolidated assets and revenues. A.2.2. Other income statement items 1/ Other revenues Other revenues increased by 69.2% to \u20ac2,392 million in 2022 (versus \u20ac1,414 million in 2021). This line item mainly comprises VaxServe sales of non-Sanofi products (\u20ac1,567 million in 2022 versus \u20ac1,078 million in 2021, recorded within the Vaccines segment). The year-on-year increase also reflects higher revenues from manufacturing services contracts, including those related to the COVID-19 vaccine. 2/ Gross profit Gross profit for 2022 amounted to \u20ac31,694 million compared with \u20ac26,920 million in 2021, an increase of 17.7%. Gross margin (the ratio of gross profit to net sales) also rose, reaching 73.7% in 2022, versus 71.3% in 2021. The year-on-year increase in gross margin reflects in particular stronger gross margin for the Pharmaceuticals segment, which reached 77.7% in 2022 versus 75.2% in 2021, driven largely by productivity gains in Manufacturing & Supply and a favorable portfolio mix. It also reflects an improvement in gross margin for the Vaccines segment to 66.3% in 2022 (versus 63.1% in 2021), largely due to growth in other revenues (23.0%, versus 17.3% in 2021). 3/ Research and development expenses Research and development (R&D) expenses amounted to \u20ac6,706 million in 2022, versus \u20ac5,692 million in 2021, an increase of 17.8%. The increase was mainly due to additional expenditures in pharmaceuticals priority assets and early-stage projects, as well as the mRNA vaccines platform. R&D expenses represented 15.6% of net sales in 2022, versus 15.1% in 2021. 4/ Selling and general expenses Selling and general expenses amounted to \u20ac10,492 million in 2022 (24.4% of net sales), versus \u20ac9,555 million in 2021 (25.3% of net sales); the 9.8% increase was a result of increased promotional expenditures, mainly in Specialty Care. The reduction in the ratio of selling and general expenses to net sales was due to operational excellence. 5/ Other operating income and expenses Other operating income amounted to \u20ac1,969 million in 2022 (versus \u20ac859 million in 2021), and other operating expenses to \u20ac2,531 million, versus \u20ac1,805 million in 2021.PART I ITEM 5. Operating and financial review and prospects 75 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(\u20ac million) 2022 2021Change on a reported at exchange rates United States 18,275 14,385 +27.0 % +12.2 % Europe 9,999 9,759 Rest of the World 14,723 % % of which China of which Japan 1,613 1,657 -2.7 % +3.1 % of which Brazil 927 815 +13.7 % -2.0 % of which Russia 674 575 +17.2 % +0.7 Total net sales 42,997 37,761 +13.9 % +7.0 %Overall, this represented a net expense of \u20ac562 million in 2022, compared with a net expense of \u20ac946 million in 2021. The increase of \u20ac384 million mainly reflects (i) an increase of \u20ac237 million in gains on asset disposals and (ii) a decrease of \u20ac142 million in the net expense relating to our pharmaceutical alliance partners, following the recognition of the proceeds derived from the restructuring of the Immuno-Oncology (IO) collaboration agreement between Sanofi and Regeneron applicable effective July 1, 2022 (see Note C.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18 of this Annual Report on Form 20-F); those effects were partly offset by an increase in the share of profits/losses generated by the Regeneron alliance under the collaboration agreement (see Note C.1. to our consolidated financial statements due mainly to higher sales of Dupixent \u00ae. For 2021, other operating income also includes a payment of \u20ac119 million received from Daiichi Sankyo relating to the ending of a vaccines collaboration agreement in Japan. The contribution of our alliance with Regeneron to this line item is as follows: -a reversal of \u20ac2,154 million relating to Eloctate franchise assets, following FDA approval of the marketing authorization request for ALTUVIIIO (the commercial name of efanesoctocog alpha, corresponding to the BIVV001 project); and -an impairment loss of \u20ac1,586 million relating to the development project for SAR444245 (non-alpha interleukin-2), based on revised cash flow projections reflecting unfavorable developments in the launch schedule.6/ Amortization of intangible assets Amortization charged against intangible assets amounted to \u20ac2,053 million in 2022, compared with \u20ac1,580 million in 2021. This \u20ac473 million increase was mainly due to (i) an accelerated amortization charge of \u20ac226 million taken against Libtayo\u00ae rights following the restructuring of the IO LCA with Regeneron (see Note C.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual report on Form 20-F); and (ii) the impact of the acquisition of Kadmon in November 2021, which triggered the amortization of the intangible asset relating to Rezurock \u00ae as from that date (\u20ac159 million). 7/ Impairment of intangible assets, net of reversals For 2022, this line shows a net gain of \u20ac454 million, mainly comprising: For 2021, this line item shows net impairment losses of \u20ac192 million taken against intangible assets, relating primarily to the discontinuation of the development of sutimlimab in Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) and the termination of various research projects in Vaccines. 8/ Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration Fair value remeasurements of contingent consideration recognized in acquisitions represented a net gain of \u20ac27 million in 2022, versus a net loss of \u20ac4 million in 2021. 9/ Restructuring costs and similar items Restructuring costs and similar items represented a total charge of \u20ac1,336 million in 2022, versus a charge of \u20ac820 million in 2021. The amount charged in 2022 includes employee-related expenses of \u20ac507 million and net expenses, gains and losses on assets (including asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation and amortization) of \u20ac261 million. The year-on-year increase mainly reflects provisions for separation costs associated with announcements made in 2022. Charges, gains and losses on assets mainly reflect a strategic decision to close an industrial facility outside France. The costs of Sanofi's transformation program (as defined in Note B.19. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F) amounted to \u20ac547 million in 2022. In 2021, restructuring costs and similar items represented a total charge of \u20ac820 million, including employee-related expenses of \u20ac193 million, relating primarily to the creation of the new standalone Consumer Healthcare entity and of EUROAPI (the newPART I ITEM 5.

The 2021 figure also includes net expenses, gains and losses on assets (including asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation and amortization) of \u20ac110 million. 10/ Other gains and losses, and litigation For 2022, this line item showed a net loss of \u20ac370 million, including the pre-tax loss arising on the deconsolidation of EUROAPI (see Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F) and costs associated with major litigation (including estimated future defense costs to which Sanofi may be exposed in connection with the Zantac \u00ae litigation). For 2021, this line item shows a net loss of \u20ac5 million. 11/ Operating income Operating income amounted to \u20ac10,656 million in 2022, versus \u20ac8,126 million in 2021. The year-on-year increase was largely due to the reversal of imparment losses totaling \u20ac2,154 million following the approval by the FDA on February 22, 2023 of the marketing authorization application for ALTUVIIIO, part of the Eloctate franchise. 12/ Financial income and expenses Net financial expenses were \u20ac234 million in 2022, versus \u20ac328 million in 2021, a decrease of \u20ac94 million. The cost of our net debt (see the definition in \"B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below) was \u20ac124 million in 2022, compared with \u20ac259 million in 2021; the reduction of \u20ac135 million was largely due to an increased return on cash, cash equivalents and associated derivatives (\u20ac241 million in 2022 versus \u20ac54 million in 2021, an increase of \u20ac187 million). A further factor was an increase in expenses arising from the unwinding of discounting of provisions and net interest costs on employee benefits and leases, which amounted to \u20ac107 million in 2022 compared with \u20ac90 million in 2021, a rise of \u20ac17 million (see Note D.29. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F). 13/ Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method reached \u20ac10,422 million in 2022, versus \u20ac7,798 million in 2021. 14/ Income tax expense Income tax expense represented \u20ac2,006 million in 2022, versus \u20ac1,558 million in 2021, giving an effective tax rate based on consolidated net income of 19.2% in 2022, compared with 20.0% in 2021. The increase in income tax expense was mainly due to taxation of Libtayo \u00ae income from out-licensing (\u20ac246 million in 2022) and the reversal of impairment losses relating to ALTUVIIIO (\u20ac503 million in 2022) following FDA approval. The increase in tax expense is partly offset by the positive tax effect of the divestment of a 70% equity interest in EUROAPI recognized in the period (\u20ac111 million in 2022). The effective tax rate on our business net income is a non-IFRS financial measure (see definition under \"A.1.5. Segment information \u2014 3. Business Net Income\" above). It is calculated on the basis of business operating income, minus net financial expenses and before (i) the share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method and (ii) net income attributable to non-controlling interests. We believe the presentation of this measure, used by our management, is also useful for investors as it provides a means to analyze the effective tax cost of our current business activities. It should not be seen as a substitute for the effective tax rate based on consolidated net income. When calculated on business net income, our effective tax rate was 19.3% in 2022, compared with 20.9% in 2021.The table below reconciles our effective tax rate based on consolidated net income to our effective tax rate based on business net income: 15/ Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method Investments accounted for using the equity method contributed net income of \u20ac68 million in 2022, versus \u20ac39 million in 2021. 16/ Net income Net income amounted to \u20ac8,484 million in 2022, compared with \u20ac6,279 million in 2021. 17/ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was \u20ac113 million in 2022, versus \u20ac56 million in 2021.PART I ITEM 5.

Basic earnings per share for 2022 was \u20ac6.69 versus \u20ac4.97 for 2021, based on an average number of shares outstanding of 1,251.9 million in 2022 and 1,252.5 million in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for 2022 was \u20ac6.66 versus \u20ac4.95 for 2021, based on an average number of shares after dilution of 1,256.9 million in 2022 and 1,257.9 million in 2021. A.2.3. Segment results Our business operating income, as defined in Note D.35. (\"Segment information\") to our consolidated financial statements, amounted to \u20ac13,040 million in 2022, compared with \u20ac10,714 million in 2021, an increase of 21.7%. That represents 30.3% of our net sales, compared with 28.4% in 2021. The table below sets forth our business operating income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: B. Liquidity and capital resources Our operations generate significant positive cash flows. We fund our day-to-day investments (with the exception of significant acquisitions) primarily with operating cash flow, and pay regular dividends on our shares. \"Net debt\" is a non-IFRS financial indicator which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful information to measure our overall liquidity and capital resources. We define \"net debt\" as (i) the sum total of short term debt, long term debt, and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to manage debt, minus (ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to manage cash and cash equivalents. Lease liabilities are not included in net debt. As of December 31, 2022 our net debt was \u20ac6,437 million, compared with \u20ac9,983 million as of December 31, 2021 mainly reflecting the free cash flow generated in the year as described below. In order to assess our financing risk, we also use the \"gearing ratio\", a non-IFRS financial measure (see table in section \"B.2. Consolidated Balance Sheet and Debt\" below). We define the gearing ratio as the ratio of net debt to total equity. As of December 31, 2022, our gearing ratio was 8.6%, compared with 14.5% as of December 31, 2021. Because our net debt and gearing ratio are not standardized measures, they may not be directly comparable with the non-IFRS financial measures of other companies using the same or similar non-IFRS financial measures. Despite the use of non-IFRS measures by management in setting goals and measuring performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. B.1. Consolidated statement of cash flows Generally, factors that affect our earnings - for example, pricing, volume, costs and exchange rates - flow through to cash from operations. The most significant source of cash from operations is sales of our branded pharmaceutical products and vaccines. Receipts of royalty payments also contribute to cash from operations.

This increase mainly resulted from an improvement in operating cash flow before changes in working capital (which amounted to \u20ac11,233 million in 2022, versus \u20ac9,113 million in 2021) and a net reduction of \u20ac707 million in the working capital requirement in 2022, versus a net increase of \u20ac1,409 million in 2021.Net cash provided by/used in investing activities represented a net cash outflow of \u20ac2,075 million in 2022, compared with a net outflow of \u20ac7,298 million in 2021. In 2022, the net cash outflow was mainly due to the acquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc (\u20ac852 million), partly offset by the proceeds of \u20ac150 million from the sale of a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI to EPIC Bpifrance. The net cash outflow in 2021 was attributable mainly to the acquisitions of Translate Bio (\u20ac2,333 million), Kadmon (\u20ac1,575 million), Kymab (\u20ac932 Tidal (\u20ac135 million) and Origimm (\u20ac50 million). Acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac2,201 million, versus \u20ac2,043 million in 2021. There were \u20ac1,606 million of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment (versus \u20ac1,479 million in 2021), most of which (\u20ac1,025 million) related to the Pharmaceuticals segment, primarily in industrial facilities. The Vaccines segment accounted for \u20ac504 million of acquisitions of property, plant and equipment during 2022. Acquisitions of intangible assets (\u20ac595 million, versus \u20ac564 million in 2021) mainly comprised contractual payments for intangible rights under license and collaboration agreements. After-tax proceeds from disposals (\u20ac1,488 million in 2022, \u20ac676 million in 2021) included divestments of assets and activities related to the streamlining of the portfolio, and disposals of equity and debt instruments. Net cash provided by/used in financing activities represented a net cash outflow of \u20ac5,821 million in 2022, compared with a net cash outflow of \u20ac7,056 million in 2021. The 2022 figure includes the redemption of bond issues totaling \u20ac2,700 million, and a new bond issue of \u20ac1,500 million carried out in April 2022. Other movements included the dividend payout to our shareholders of \u20ac4,168 million (versus \u20ac4,008 million in 2021), and the effect of changes in our share capital (repurchases of our own shares, net of capital increases), representing a net cash outflow of \u20ac309 million in 2022 versus a net cash outflow of \u20ac196 million in 2021. The net change in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 was an increase of \u20ac2,638 million, versus an increase of \u20ac3,817 million in 2021. \"Free cash flow\" for the year ended December 31, 2022 was \u20ac8,483 million, an increase on the 2021 figure of \u20ac8,096 million. This reflects our operational performance (including the effect of cost containment measures), and proceeds from disposal made during the period (see the table below). \"Free cash flow\" is a non-IFRS financial indicator which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful information to measure the net cash generated from our operations that is available for strategic investments(1) (net of divestments(1)), for debt repayment, and for payments to shareholders. \"Free cash flow\" is determined from our \"Business net income\"(2) after adding back (in the case of expenses and losses) or deducting (in the case of income and gains) the following items: depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of undistributed earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method, gains & losses on disposals, net change in provisions including pensions and other post-employment benefits, deferred taxes, share-based payment expense and other non-cash items. It also includes net changes in working capital, capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions(3) net of disposal proceeds(3), and payments related to restructuring and similar items. \"Free cash flow\" is not defined by IFRS, and is not a substitute for Net cash provided by operating activities as reported under IFRS. Management recognizes that the term \"Free cash flow\" may be interpreted differently by other companies and under different circumstances.

Consolidated balance sheet and debt Total assets were \u20ac126,722 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with \u20ac120,242 million as of December 31, 2021, an increase of \u20ac6,480 million. Total equity was \u20ac75,152 million as of December 31, 2022, versus \u20ac69,031 million as of December 31, 2021. The year-on-year net change reflects the following principal factors: Net debt was \u20ac6,437 million as of December 31, 2022, versus \u20ac9,983 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in 2022 reflects the \u20ac8,483 million of free cash flow generated in the year, more than offsetting cash outflows that included \u20ac992 million on acquisitions of consolidated entities and the \u20ac4,168 million dividend payout to our shareholders. \"Net debt\" is a non-IFRS financial measure which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful information to measure our overall liquidity and capital resources. We define \"net debt\" as (i) the sum total of short term debt, long term debt, and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to manage debt, minus (ii) the sum total of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to manage cash and cash equivalents. To assess our financing risk, we use the \"gearing ratio\", a non-IFRS financial measure. This ratio (which we define as the ratio of net debt to total equity) decreased from 14.5% as of December 31, 2021 to 8.6% as of December 31, 2022. Analyses of debt as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by type, maturity, interest rate and currency, are provided in Note D.17.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F. We expect that the future cash flows generated by our operating activities will be sufficient to repay our debt. The financing arrangements in place as of December 31, 2022 at the Sanofi parent company level are not subject to covenants regarding financial ratios and do not contain any clauses linking fees to Sanofi's credit rating. As of December 31, 2022, we held 8.2 million of our own shares, recorded as a deduction from equity and representing 0.65% of our share capital. Goodwill and Other intangible assets (\u20ac71,532 million in total) increased by \u20ac2,069 million year-on-year, the main factors being the acquisition of Amunix, partly offset by impairment losses net of impairment reversals recognized on certain intangible assets (in particular, an impairment loss against IL-2, and a reversal relating to Eloctate \u00ae franchise assets). Investments accounted for using the equity method (\u20ac677 million) increased by \u20ac427 million, mainly reflecting the equity investment of EUROAPI from May 10, 2022 (see Note D.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F). Other non-current assets amounted to \u20ac3,095 million, a year-on-year decrease of \u20ac32 million, with a reduction in funds held to cover pension obligations partly offset by an increase in prepaid expenses. Net deferred tax assets amounted to \u20ac3,540 million as of December 31, 2022, versus \u20ac2,981 million as of December 31, 2021, a year-on-year increase of \u20ac559 million. This mainly reflects deferred taxes arising on the capitalization of R&D expenses, and consolidation adjustments for intragroup margin in inventory. Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities (\u20ac6,341 million) showed a decrease of \u20ac380 million, mainly related to actuarial gains on defined-benefit plans (recognized in Other comprehensive income). Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests (\u20ac779 million) were \u20ac65 million higher year-on- year. The main movement in this line item during 2022 was the recognition of the \u20ac156 million contingent consideration liability arising on the acquisition of Amunix.PART I ITEM 5.

Liquidity We expect that our existing cash resources and cash from operations will be sufficient to finance our foreseeable working capital requirements, in both the short term (i.e. the 12 months following the year ended December 31, 2022) and the long term (i.e. beyond such additional 12-month period). At year-end 2022, we held cash and cash equivalents amounting to \u20ac12,736 million, substantially all of which were held in euros (see Note D.13. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this Annual Report on Form 20-F). As at December 31, 2022, \u20ac439 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by captive insurance and reinsurance companies in accordance with insurance regulations. We run the risk of delayed payments or even non-payment by our customers, who consist principally of wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and government agencies (see \"Item 3.D. Risk Factors \u2014 2. Risks Relating to Our Business \u2014 We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers\"). Deteriorating credit and economic conditions and other factors in some countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in an increase in the average length of time taken to collect our accounts receivable in these countries. Should these factors continue, it may require us to re-evaluate the collectability of these receivables in future periods. We carefully monitor sovereign debt issues and economic conditions and evaluate accounts receivable in these countries for potential collection risks. We have been conducting an active recovery policy, adapted to each country and including intense communication with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action. Over our business as a whole, the amount of trade receivables overdue by more than 12 months (which primarily consists of amounts due from public sector bodies) decreased from \u20ac56 million as of December 31, 2021 to \u20ac51 million as of December 31, 2022 (see Note D.10. to our consolidated financial statements). At year-end 2022, we had no commitments for capital expenditures that we consider to be material to our consolidated financial position. Undrawn confirmed credit facilities amounted to a total of \u20ac8,000 million at December 31, 2022. For a discussion of our treasury policies, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\" We expect that cash from our operations will be sufficient to repay our debt. For a discussion of our liquidity risks, see \"Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\" C. Off balance sheet arrangements/Contractual obligations and other commercial commitments We have various contractual obligations and other commercial commitments arising from our operations. Our contractual obligations and our other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2022 are shown in Notes D.3., D.17., D.18., and D.21. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report.

The table above does not include ongoing annual employer's contributions to plan assets, estimated at \u20ac38 million for 2023.We may have payments due to our current or former research and development partners under collaboration agreements. These agreements typically cover multiple products, and give us the option to participate in development on a product-by-product basis. When we exercise our option with respect to a product, we pay our collaboration partner a fee and receive intellectual property rights to the product in exchange. We are also generally required to fund some or all of the development costs for the products that we select, and to make payments to our partners when those products reach development milestones. We have entered into collaboration agreements under which we have rights to acquire products or technology from third parties through the acquisition of shares, loans, license agreements, joint development, co-marketing and other contractual arrangements. In addition to upfront payments on signature of the agreement, our contracts frequently require us to make payments contingent upon the completion of development milestones by our alliance partner or upon the granting of approvals or licenses. Because of the uncertain nature of development work, it is impossible to predict (i) whether Sanofi will exercise further options for products, or (ii) whether the expected milestones will be achieved, or (iii) the number of compounds that will reach the relevant milestones. It is therefore impossible to estimate the maximum aggregate amount that Sanofi will actually pay in the future under existing collaboration agreements. Given the nature of its business, it is highly unlikely that Sanofi will exercise all options for all products or that all milestones will be achieved. The main collaboration agreements relating to development projects are described in Note D.21.1. to our consolidated financial statements, included at Item 18. of this annual report. Milestone payments relating to development projects under these agreements included in the table above exclude projects still in the research phase (\u20ac18.0 billion in 2022, and \u20ac6.7 billion in 2021) and payments contingent upon the attainment of sales targets once a product is on the market (\u20ac18.5 billion in 2022, and \u20ac8.1 billion in 2021).PART I ITEM 5.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees A. Directors and Senior Management Since January 1, 2007, Sanofi has separated the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Annual evaluations conducted since that date have indicated that this governance structure is appropriate to Sanofi's current configuration. With the term of office of the current Chairman, Serge Weinberg, coming to an end, the Board of Directors has decided to continue separating the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes this governance structure is still appropriate to the current context in which Sanofi operates and its share ownership structure, as well as protecting the rights of all of its stakeholders. The Chairman organizes and directs the work of the Board, and is responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the corporate decision-making bodies in compliance with good governance principles. The Chairman coordinates the work of the Board of Directors with that of its Committees. He ensures that the Company's management bodies function properly, and in particular that the directors are able to fulfil their duties. The Chairman is accountable to the Shareholders' General Meeting, which he chairs. In addition to these roles conferred by law, the Chairman: The Chairman is also required to develop and maintain a proper relationship of trust between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, so as to ensure that the latter consistently and continuously implements the orientations determined by the Board. In fulfilling his remit, the Chairman may meet with any individual, including senior executives of the Company, while avoiding any involvement in directing the Company or managing its operations, which are exclusively the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer. Finally, the Chairman reports to the Board on the fulfilment of his remit. The Chairman carries out his duties during the entire period of his term of office, subject to the caveat that a director who is a natural person may not be appointed or reappointed once that director has reached the age of 70. The Chief Executive Officer manages the Company, and represents it in dealings with third parties within the limit of the corporate purpose. The Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of the Company, subject to the powers that are attributed by law to the Board of Directors and to the Shareholders' General Meeting and within the limits set by the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer must be less than 65 years old. Limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer set by the Board With effect from March 6, 2018, the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer are specified in the Board Charter. Without prejudice to legal provisions regarding authorizations that must be granted by the Board (regulated agreements, guarantees, divestments of equity holdings or real estate, etc.), prior approval from the Board of Directors is required for transactions or decisions resulting in an investment or divestment, or an expenditure or guarantee commitment, made by the Company and its subsidiaries, in excess of: When such transactions, decisions or commitments give rise to installment payments to the contracting third party (or parties) that are contingent upon future results or objectives, such as the registration of one or more products, attainment of the caps is calculated by aggregating the various payments due from signature of the contract until (and including) the filing of the first application for marketing authorization in the United States or in Europe.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 83 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Attainment of the above caps is also assessed after taking into account all commitments to make payments upon exercising a firm or conditional option with immediate or deferred effect, and all guarantees or collateral to be provided to third parties over the duration of such commitments. The prior approval procedure does not apply to transactions and decisions that result in the signature of agreements that solely involve subsidiaries and the Company itself. Board of Directors Composition As of December 31, 2022 our Board of Directors had 16 directors, including ten independent directors and two directors representing employees. It also has one non-voting member since September 2, 2022. Each year, the Board of Directors conducts a review to ensure that there is an appropriate balance in its composition and in the composition of its Committees. In particular, the Board seeks to ensure gender balance and a broad diversity of competencies, experiences, nationalities and ages, reflecting our status as a diversified global business. The Board investigates and evaluates not only potential candidates, but also whether existing directors should seek reappointment. Above all, the Board seeks directors who show independence of mind and are competent, dedicated and committed, with compatible and complementary personalities. 43% of the directors (excluding directors representing employees and the non-voting member, in accordance with regulations) are women, and 47% of the directors (including directors representing employees and the non-voting member) are non-French nationals. Acting on proposals from the Chief Executive Officer and in liaison with the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, the Board sets objectives for gender balance on Sanofi's executive bodies, and more generally ensures that an inclusion (non-discrimination) and diversity policy is applied within the Company. That policy is fully embedded in our Play to Win strategy. As of December 31, 2022, 20% of the ten Executive Committee members were women, and 73% were non-French nationals. For more details on changes to our Executive Committee, see the section entitled \"Executive Committee\" below. The Board of Directors is also kept informed, in particular on the occasion of its annual discussion on equal opportunity and equal pay policy, on how Sanofi's inclusion and diversity policy is cascaded down to \"Senior Leaders\" and \"Executives\" (the positions in Sanofi with the highest level of responsibility). Mission The Board of Directors establishes the orientation of the Company's activities and ensures that they are implemented, paying due consideration to social and environmental issues. Subject to those powers expressly attributed to Shareholders' General Meetings and within the limits set by the corporate purpose, it addresses any issue of relevance to the proper conduct of the Company's affairs and, through its deliberations, settles matters concerning the Company. The Board monitors progress on our CSR strategy, as recalibrated in 2021, paying particularly close attention to tracking delivery on our CSR program including our climate commitments. Since 2020, 15% of the annual variable compensation of our CEO has been linked to CSR criteria, including an objective to cut our greenhouse gas emissions; and starting in 2023, our equity-based compensation plans will also include CSR criteria - see section B. below. The Board committees are also involved in sustainable development issues - see section \"\u2014 C. Board practices below\" - and their members work together on specific topics. For example, discussions have taken place between the Compensation Committee and the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee on determination of the extra-financial criteria applicable to the various elements of compensation awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and other beneficiaries of variable compensation (annual variable compensation, equity-based compensation). The rules and operating procedures of our Board of Directors are defined by law, by our Articles of Association, and by our Board Charter (English language versions of which are reproduced in full as Exhibit 1.1 and Exhibit 1.2 to this Annual Report on Form 20-F). Term of Office The term of office of directors is four years. Directors are required to seek reappointment by rotation, such that members of the Board are required to seek reappointment on a regular basis in the most equal proportions possible. Exceptionally, the Shareholders' Ordinary General Meeting may appoint a director to serve for a term of one, two or three years, in order to ensure adequate rotation of Board members. Each director standing down is eligible for reappointment. Should one or more directorships fall vacant as a result of death or resignation, the Board of Directors may make provisional appointments in the period between two Shareholders' General Meetings, in accordance with applicable laws. Directors may be removed from office at any time by a Shareholders' General Meeting. A natural person cannot be appointed or reappointed as a director once he or she reaches the age of 70. As soon as the number of directors aged over 70 represents more than one-third of the directors in office, the oldest director shall be deemed to have resigned; his or her term of office shall end at the date of the next Shareholders' Ordinary General Meeting.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 84 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Selection Process for Board members The Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee has a remit to organize a procedure for selecting future independent directors. Once the desired profile and skillset for a new director has been defined, a search for potential candidates is conducted by external consultants. Once a shortlist has been established, the Committee interviews two or three candidates. After completing the interviews, the Committee makes a recommendation to the Board on the candidate with the best fit for the profile, supporting that recommendation with an explanation of how the interviews were conducted and giving reasons why a candidate was selected.

More specifically, a director can only be regarded as independent if he or she: The influence of other factors such as the ability to understand challenges and risks, and the courage to express ideas and form a judgment, is also evaluated before it is decided whether a director can be regarded as independent. In accordance with our Board Charter and pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors' meeting of February 22, 2023 discussed the independence of the current directors. Of the 16 directors in office on that date, 10 were deemed to be independent directors by reference to the independence criteria used by the Board of Directors pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code: Rachel Duan, Emile Voest and Antoine Yver. In accordance with the rules described above, Paul Hudson (who is an executive director of Sanofi), Serge Weinberg (who has been a director for more than 12 years), and Barbara Lavernos and Christophe Babule (who were appointed on the recommendation of L'Or\u00e9al, a major shareholder of Sanofi), are not deemed independent. Consequently, the proportion of independent directors is 71%. This complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation of at least 50% in companies with dispersed ownership and no controlling shareholder (which is the case for Sanofi). In accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, directors representing employees and elected by trade unions are excluded when calculating the proportion of independent directors.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 85 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Failure to fulfil one of the criteria does not automatically disqualify a director from being independent. In assessing the criterion related to significant business relationships (criterion 3), the Board of Directors took into account the various relationships between directors and Sanofi and concluded that no relationships were of a kind that might undermine their independence. The Board of Directors noted that the Company and its subsidiaries had, in the normal course of business, over the past three years, sold products and provided services to, and/or purchased products and received services from, companies in which certain of the Company's directors who are classified as independent (or their close family members) were senior executives or employees during 2022. In each case, the amounts paid to or received from such companies over the past three years were determined on an arm's length basis and not at amounts that the Board regarded as undermining the independence of the directors in question. Other information about Board members As of December 31, 2022, no corporate officer has been the subject of any conviction or court order, or been associated with any bankruptcy or winding-up order. As of this day, there is no potential conflict of interest between any corporate officer and Sanofi. Under current French legislation, and given that employees own less than 3% of our share capital, the Board does not include a director representing employee shareholders. As of December 31, 2022, the members of our Board of Directors collectively held (directly, or via the employee share ownership fund associated with the Group savings scheme) 23,831 of our shares, representing 0.0019% of our share capital.PART I ITEM 6.

The Charter also requires a formal evaluation to be performed at least every three years under the direction of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, with assistance from an independent consultant. In 2021, a formal evaluation was conducted under the direction of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, with the assistance of a specialist consulting firm (the same one as conducted the previous formal evaluation). Following this evaluation, a series of actions were taken in 2022 to address the areas of progress and vigilance summarized below: the directors particularly emphasized the quality of relations with management, which have become more fluid, especially due to the return of physical meetings; the work of the Board gained in scientific expertise as well as in strategic vision; the further development and increased length of executive sessions mean that they are seen positively as a necessary space to discuss critical issues without management present; finance and compensation issues, and HR policy, are adequately covered, and the Board is properly involved in areas around strategy, business, operations and risks; the Chairman succession process has been very well received; and directors who followed the enhanced induction program expressed themselves satisfied. there is room for improvement in the information and documentation supplied to the Board, and in reports on the work of the Committees;The Chairman provided feedback on each Board member's individual performance over the course of the year. The 2022 evaluation was conducted internally, using a detailed questionnaire sent to directors by the Secretary to the Board. Each director was allowed a few weeks to complete the questionnaire using a secure digital platform. At the end of that period, the responses were analyzed by the Secretary to the Board, and supplemented by one-on-one interviews. The results were then presented to, and discussed by, a meeting of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee. The detailed report prepared for that meeting was then submitted to the Board meeting of February 22, 2023. The results of this 2022 evaluation show continuous improvement in the functioning of the Board: The areas of improvement identified are: some directors felt the Board should be more involved in research and development issues; the Board should be even more involved in CSR and research and development issues; delivery on CSR strategy should continue to be monitored; the focus on the global review of the strategy through strategic seminars should be continued; and field trips should be resumed, with directors keen to visit sites, especially research and development sites.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 87 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Areas of progress and vigilance identified in the 2021 evaluation Actions taken in 2022 The preparation of the Chairman's succession must be continued and accelerated, under the leadership of an independent director.At the instigation of Serge Weinberg, and subsequently under the chairmanship of Giles Schnepp, the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee carried out preparatory work with assistance from a consultancy firm, including consideration of the profile required for the new Chairman and discussions with Board members. That work was picked up and formalized by the Committee in 2022. Following the selection process, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a was appointed as non-voting member on September 2, 2022, with the intention of proposing that he be appointed as an independent director at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, and subsequently of appointing him to succeed Serge Weinberg as Chairman. Implementation of the CSR strategy will have to be subject to tighter monitoring.In 2022, the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee held an extra meeting compared to previous years, giving it an opportunity to examine each of the four pillars of our CSR strategy as well as extra-financial ratings. Strategic seminars should be more devoted to discussing strategy rather than reviewing activities.The strategy seminars held in April and October 2022 each devoted half a day to Sanofi strategy. The duration of the two executive sessions should be extended to allow for more in-depth discussion.Executive sessions were extended from one hour to one and a half hours. The induction program for new directors, made difficult due to the health crisis linked to COVID-19, will have to be reinforced.Until 2021, the induction program for new directors was devised on an ad hoc basis. In 2022, Sanofi provided an induction session on risks for each new director. Board members stated that COVID had not harmed the working of the Board but they expressed a desire for a rapid return to physical meetings as well as normal social activities.The format of meetings returned to normal in 2022.unplanned vacancy due to prohibition, resignation or death; forced vacancy due to poor performance, mismanagement or misconduct; and planned vacancy due to retirement or expiration of term of office. provides the Board with progress reports, in particular at executive sessions; co-ordinates with the Compensation Committee. In that regard, having a director that sits on both Committees is a great advantage; works closely with the Chief Executive Officer to (i) ensure the succession plan is consistent with the Company's own practices and market practices, (ii) ensure high-potential internal prospects receive appropriate support and training, and (iii) check there is adequate monitoring of key posts likely to fall vacant; meets with key executives as needed; and involves the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer insofar as each has a key role in planning for his own successor, though without them directing the process. a long-list of potential candidates was put forward by external consultants; three candidates were short-listed by the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee; the three candidates were interviewed by members of the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee, after which the Committee ranked the candidates; and the highest-ranked candidate was then interviewed by the Chair of each of the Board committees.Succession planning General principles The remit of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee includes preparing for the future of the Company's executive bodies, in particular through the establishment of a succession plan for executive officers. The succession plan, which is reviewed at meetings of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, addresses various scenarios: Through its work and discussions, the Committee seeks to devise a succession plan that is adaptable to situations arising in the short, medium or long term, but which also builds in diversity - in all its facets - as a key factor. To fulfill its remit, the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee: In fulfilling their remit, Committee members are acutely conscious of confidentiality issues. Although aware that separating the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides continuity of power, the Committee nonetheless assesses the situation of the Chairman as well as that of the executive team. Succession of Serge Weinberg Serge Weinberg's current term of office expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders called to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and cannot be renewed as he will have reached the age limit stipulated in the Articles of Association. At the instigation of Serge Weinberg, and subsequently under the chairmanship of Gilles Schnepp, the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee carried out preparatory work with assistance from a consultancy firm, including consideration of the profile required for the new Chairman and discussions with Board members. That work was formalized by the Appointments, Governance & CSR Committee as follows: On completion of this process, and there being no vacancies on the Board, the Board decided to appoint Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a as a non-voting member on a transitional basis, with the intention of proposing his appointment as a director at the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2023, and to appoint him as Chairman of the Board of Directors after the close of that meeting. Succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer is subject to regular review by the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee.

Competencies of Board members The Board of Directors, in liaison with the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, must ensure that the composition of the Board is balanced, diverse and fit for purpose. In assessing its composition, the Board takes account of the new challenges facing Sanofi and the corporate strategy, and determines whether the qualities of serving directors are sufficient for the Board to deliver on its remit. Over the past several years, the Board has adapted its composition in line with its roadmap by:PART I ITEM 6.

Compensation Compensation and other arrangements for corporate officers Compensation policy for corporate officers This section describes the compensation policy for corporate officers of Sanofi, as established pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code. That policy describes all the components of compensation awarded to corporate officers of Sanofi as consideration for holding office, and explains the process by which it is determined, divided, reviewed and implemented. Our compensation policy for corporate officers has three distinct elements: (i) the compensation policy for directors; (ii) the compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board; and (iii) the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer. Each of those policies is submitted for approval by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, in accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code. The compensation policy approved in any given year applies to any person holding corporate office in that year. Moreover, when a corporate officer is appointed between two Annual General Meetings, their compensation is defined applying the terms of the compensation policy approved by the most recent Annual General Meeting of shareholders. Process for determining the compensation policy for corporate officers The compensation policy for corporate officers is established by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors applies the AFEP-MEDEF Code when determining the compensation and benefits awarded to our executive and non-executive corporate officers. All members of the Compensation Committee are independent, and were chosen for their technical competencies and their good understanding of current standards, emerging trends and Sanofi's practices. To fulfill their remit, the Committee regularly invites the Chief People Officer and the Head of Reward and Performance of the Group to attend their meetings, although the latter absent themselves when the Committee deliberates. Committee members also work with the Chairman and the Secretary of the Board, who have contacts with our principal institutional shareholders ahead of the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Chairman of the Committee: The compensation policy is not subject to annual review, although some arrangements for implementing the policy - such as the performance criteria applicable to the Chief Executive Officer's annual variable compensation, for example - are defined by the Board of Directors on an annual basis.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 113 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022the policy must be simple; the policy must prioritize long-term performance; the level of compensation must be competitive, so that we can attract and retain talent; and there must be a fair balance between the corporate interest, the challenges of delivering on our strategy, and the expectations of our stakeholders.After consulting the Compensation Committee and as the case may be the other Board Committees, the Board of Directors may, under the second paragraph of item III of Article L. 225-37-2 of the French Commercial Code, temporarily derogate from the approved compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer in exceptional circumstances and to the extent that the changes are aligned with the corporate interest and necessary to safeguard the continuity or viability of Sanofi. Derogations from the approved policy are possible in respect of the performance conditions applied to the Chief Executive Officer's compensation, and may result in either an increase or a decrease in compensation. The circumstances in which it is possible to apply such a derogation are (i) a change in the structure of the Sanofi group or (ii) major events affecting the markets. Such derogation may only be temporary and must be properly substantiated. Moreover, it will remain subject to approval by the next General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders. General principles and objectives Our compensation policy is based on the following general principles: The Compensation Committee must ensure that trends in the compensation of corporate officers over the medium term are not uncorrelated with trends in the compensation of all our employees. In terms of annual variable compensation and equity-based compensation, the Compensation Committee aims to achieve convergence between the performance criteria applied to our Senior Leaders and those applied to the Chief Executive Officer. Our equity-based compensation policy, which aims to align employee and shareholder interests and reinforce loyalty to Sanofi, is a critical tool for our worldwide attractiveness as an employer. With effect from June 2019, grantees of equity based compensation plans (including our Chief Executive Officer) can only be awarded performance shares. Awarding performance shares reduces the dilutive effect of equity based compensation plans while maintaining the same level of motivation for grantees. Acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determines the performance conditions attached to equity-based compensation for all beneficiaries at Sanofi and its subsidiaries worldwide, thereby furthering the attainment of our objectives. Our equity-based compensation plan rules are made available to our shareholders on the governance page of our website in the same form as that distributed to our employees. The Board of Directors makes any grant of performance shares contingent on multiple, exacting multi-year performance criteria in order to ensure that our equity-based compensation plans incentivize overall performance. Failure to achieve those criteria over the entire performance measurement period results in a reduction or loss of the initial grant. In order to align equity-based compensation with our long-term performance, performance is measured over three financial years (the \"vesting period\"). Awards of performance shares are also contingent on continued employment in the Sanofi group during the vesting period, followed by stringent lock-up obligations in the case of the Chief Executive Officer (see below). The terms of prior awards cannot be reset subsequently, for instance with less exacting performance conditions. Compensation policy for directors Directors hold office for a four-year term, as specified in our Articles of Association. They may be removed from office by a shareholders' meeting, at any time and without restriction. The maximum annual amount of overall compensation allocated to the directors has been set at \u20ac2,000,000 since 2020. Given the increasing number of Board and committee meetings and in order to be able to compensate the Directors in accordance with the compensation policy, the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders will be asked to amend this maximum annual amount to \u20ac2,500,000, with effect from the 2023 financial year. The fixed and variable compensation for directors will remain unchanged. The arrangements for allocating the overall annual amount set by the Annual General Meeting between the directors are determined by the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee. Directors' compensation comprises (i) an annual fixed amount of \u20ac30,000, apportioned on a time basis for directors who assumed or left office during the year, and (ii) a variable amount, allocated by the Board according to actual attendance at Board and Committee meetings. As required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, directors' compensation is allocated predominantly on a variable basis. The table below shows how the variable amount payable to directors for attendance at Board and committee meetings is determined; the allocation was last changed in 2020.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 114 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022 (www.sanofi.com)if on the day of a Shareholders' General Meeting, the Board of Directors meets both before and after the Meeting, only one payment is made for the two Board meetings; and if on the same day a director participates in a meeting of the Compensation Committee and a meeting of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, only the higher of the two payments is made to cover both meetings.Directors who take part via videoconference receive compensation equivalent to that paid to a director resident in France attending in person. Committee Chairs continue to receive the usual compensation in respect of the Committee they chair. As an exception, in certain cases two meetings held on the same day give entitlement only to a single payment: The introduction of a separate compensation scale depending on whether or not the director is a European resident is intended to take into account the significantly longer travel time required to attend meetings in person. Directors do not receive any exceptional compensation or equity-based compensation and have no entitlement to a top-up pension plan. Neither the Chairman of the Board nor the Chief Executive Officer receives any compensation for serving as a director.In accordance with Sanofi's Articles of Association, the Board may compensate non-voting members by allocating sums from the annual amount allotted by the Annual General Meeting to Board members (see above). Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, which took into account the time spent by the non-voting member on the induction process ahead of his future appointment as Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors decided to allocate him the same compensation as is allocated to the other Board members. Compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors The term of office of the Chairman of the Board is the same as that of the other directors (four years), and the Chairman's term is aligned with his term of office as a director. He may be removed from office at any time by the Board of Directors. The compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors is discussed by the Compensation Committee, which then makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Committee, and does not attend meetings where his compensation is discussed. The compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors (where the office of Chairman is separate from that of Chief Executive Officer, as is currently the case) consists solely of fixed compensation and benefits in kind and excludes any variable or exceptional compensation, any awards of stock options or performance shares, and any compensation for serving as a director. The annual fixed compensation awarded to the current Chairman of the Board of Directors is \u20ac800,000 gross, unchanged since 2021. At its meeting of February 22, 2023, the Board of Directors considered the compensation of the future Chairman of the Board of Directors. Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, which took into account the practices of comparable CAC 40 companies, the Board set the compensation of the future Chairman of the Board of Directors at \u20ac880,000 gross with effect from May 26, 2023. That amount also takes account of the specific remit of the Chairman of the Board of Directors as described in the Sanofi Board Charter, and of the intention to propose that the future Chairman of the Board of Directors will sit on the same committees as the current Chairman of the Board of Directors. The compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not subject to annual review.Where the office of Chairman is separate from that of Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board is not entitled to the Sanofi top-up defined-contribution pension plan. Nor is he entitled to a termination benefit or a non-compete indemnity.The Chairman of the Board does not receive compensation for chairing Board meetings, or as a member of Board committees.PART I ITEM 6.

He may be removed from office on legitimate grounds at any time by the Board of Directors. The compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer is established by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. The compensation structure is not subject to annual review and is applicable for as long as it remains unchanged. The arrangements for implementing the policy may vary from year to year; a table showing the changes made to those arrangements in 2023 and 2022 is provided at the end of the present section. The compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is determined with reference to compensation awarded to the chief executive officers of the following 12 leading global pharmaceutical companies (1): Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd. This panel comprises companies that are comparable to Sanofi, with no limitation as to geographical region given that Sanofi operates in a particularly competitive international environment. Consistency with market practice is fundamental in order to attract and retain the talents necessary to our success. In 2022, on the basis of information published as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 20-F, the median fixed compensation of the chief executive officers of the aforementioned twelve leading global pharmaceutical companies was in the region of \u20ac1,613,000; the median of the annual variable compensation awarded was in the region of \u20ac2,665,000; and the median of the long-term compensation awarded (whether equity-based or in cash) represented around 790% of fixed compensation. Within this peer group, Paul Hudson's overall compensation (fixed, variable and equity-based compensation) lies in the low range of the second quartile of the compensation paid by the panel companies. The practices of the main CAC 40 companies are also taken into account (1). on the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, to reflect the new appointee's competencies and/or then current market practice; and in exceptional circumstances, to take account of changes in (i) the role or responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer, for example in terms of market conditions or the size of the Sanofi group or (ii) the performance level of Sanofi over a given period.On taking up office When the Chief Executive Officer is an outside appointment, the Board of Directors may decide, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, to compensate the appointee for some or all of the benefits he may have forfeited on leaving his previous employer. In such a case, the terms on which the Chief Executive Officer is hired aim to replicate the diversity of what was forfeited, with a comparable level of risk (variable portion, medium-term equity-based or cash compensation). During the term of office Compensation structure Our policy aims at achieving and maintaining a balance in the compensation structure between fixed compensation, benefits in kind, short-term variable cash compensation, and medium-term variable equity-based compensation. The compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer is designed to motivate and reward performance by ensuring that a significant portion of compensation is contingent on the attainment of financial, operational and extra-financial criteria that reflect Sanofi's objectives, and are aligned with the corporate interest and with the creation of shareholder value. Variable cash compensation and equity-based compensation are the two principal levers for action, and are intended to align the interests of the Chief Executive Officer with those of our shareholders and stakeholders. During the meeting that follows the Board meeting held to close off the financial statements for the previous year, the Compensation Committee examines the levels of attainment of variable compensation for that year. In advance of that meeting, the Chief Executive Officer presents the Committee with a report containing narrative and quantitative information necessary to measure attainment of the objectives. The members of the Compensation Committee then discuss the information provided and report to the Board on those discussions, giving an evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance against each of the criteria (determining the level of attainment for quantitative objectives, and evaluating the level of attainment for qualitative objectives). Annual fixed compensation The annual fixed compensation of the Chief Executive Officer has been set at \u20ac1,400,000 gross since 2022. It had previously remained unchanged since 2019. The amount of fixed compensation is not subject to annual review. It may however be changed, provided that such changes are not material:PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 116 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(1)Surveys conducted on the basis of data communicated by Pay Governance and Boracay.Annual variable compensation 50% based on financial indicators published by the Company: sales growth, business net income (BNI), free cash flow (FCF) and business operating income (BOI) margin and growth in new assets, each accounting for 10%. FCF and BOI margin were chosen because they are in line with the Company's strategic roadmap; and 50% based on specific individual objectives, including criteria linked to CSR criteria for Sanofi (partly quantitative), underlining the Board's commitment to long-term value creation. The individual objectives set for variable remuneration for 2023 are described in \"\u2014 Compensation and benefits of all kinds awarded to corporate officers in respect of 2023\" below. internal criteria based upon: -BNI and FCF - financial criteria, and -Affordable Access and Healthy Planet - extra-financial criteria; and an external criterion based upon total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a benchmark panel of twelve of the leading global pharmaceutical companies: Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd.Annual variable compensation is in a range between 0% and 250% of fixed compensation, with a target of 150%. It is subject to a range of varied and exacting performance criteria, both quantitative and qualitative. The criteria are reviewed annually in light of the strategic objectives determined by Sanofi. The Board of Directors sets the criteria for each year at the start of that year on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. For 2023, the criteria are: Overall, the quantitative element of the financial and individual objectives is in a range between 65% and 70%. The percentage of variable compensation linked to the attainment of quantitative criteria may be scaled down regardless of actual performance, in order to give greater weight to the attainment of qualitative criteria. This flexibility can only operate to reduce the amount of variable compensation, and cannot compensate for underperformance on quantitative criteria. Payment of annual variable compensation in a given year in respect of the previous year is contingent on a favorable shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting. Equity-based compensation The Chief Executive Officer's equity-based compensation, which can only be in the form of performance shares, may not exceed 250% of his target short-term compensation (fixed plus variable). The Chief Executive Officer's equity-based compensation is contingent upon attainment of exacting performance conditions, all of them quantitative, measured over a three-year-period. Such awards are contingent upon both: The inclusion in equity-based compensation plans from 2023 of measurable, material extra-financial criteria aligned with Sanofi's strategy follows a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, which took the view that such a policy would embed a link in the long-term compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and all other beneficiaries of equity-based compensation plans. The valuation of performance shares is calculated at the date of grant, weighted between (i) fair value determined using the Monte Carlo model and (ii) the market price of Sanofi shares at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends expected during the vesting period. Each award to our Chief Executive Officer takes into account previous awards and his overall compensation. In any event, the maximum number of shares to be delivered may not be more than the number of performance shares initially awarded. For details of the award to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of 2023, refer to \"\u2014 Compensation and benefits of all kinds awarded to corporate officers in respect of 2023\" below. Share ownership and lock-up obligation of the Chief Executive Officer The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the same obligations regarding share ownership specified in our Articles of Association and Board Charter as our other corporate officers. In addition, until he ceases to hold office the Chief Executive Officer is required to retain a quantity of Sanofi shares equivalent to 50% of any gain (net of taxes and social contributions) arising on the vesting of performance shares, calculated as of the date on which those shares vest. Those shares must be retained in registered form until he ceases to hold office. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and our Board Charter, the Chief Executive Officer must undertake to refrain from entering into speculative or hedging transactions. Multi-year variable compensation The Chief Executive Officer does not receive multi-year variable compensation. Compensation for serving as a director Executive officers of Sanofi do not receive any compensation for serving as directors. Consequently, the Chief Executive Officer does not receive compensation in his capacity as a director or as a member of the Strategy Committee. Exceptional compensation No exceptional compensation can be awarded to the Chief Executive Officer.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 117 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022On leaving office if the level of attainment for variable compensation is equal to or greater than the target (i.e. 150% of fixed compensation), 100% of the contribution is paid; if the level of attainment for variable compensation is less than 100% of fixed compensation, no contribution is paid; and between those two limits, the contribution is calculated on a prorata basis. 50% as a gross insurance premium to the fund manager; and 50% to the Chief Executive Officer, to indemnify him for the social security and tax charges for which he will become immediately liable. removal from office for gross or serious misconduct (faute grave ou lourde) ; if the Chief Executive Officer elects to leave Sanofi to take up another position; if the Chief Executive Officer is assigned to another position within Sanofi; or if the Chief Executive Officer takes his pension.The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a top-up defined-contribution pension plan, a termination benefit, and a non-compete indemnity. Such arrangements are part of the overall compensation package generally awarded to executive officers; in line with recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF code, there are very strict rules about how they are implemented. The termination benefit and non-compete indemnity are intended to compensate for the fact that the Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any time. Each of those benefits is taken into account by the Board of Directors when fixing the overall compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. Pension arrangements The Chief Executive Officer is entitled to benefits under the top-up defined-contribution pension plan introduced within Sanofi on January 1, 2020. This is a collective plan falling within the scope of Article 82 of the French General Tax Code. It is also offered to members of our Executive Committee and all senior executives whose position is classified within the Sanofi grade scale as \"Executive Level 1 or 2\". The Chief Executive Officer's entitlement under this plan may be withdrawn by a decision of the Board of Directors, but not retroactively. Under the terms of the plan, the Chief Executive Officer receives an annual contribution the amount of which (subject to attainment of a performance condition) may be up to 25% of his reference compensation (annual fixed and variable cash-based compensation only; all other compensation is excluded). The rights accruing under the plan are those that are generated by the capitalization contract taken out with the insurer, and vest even if the Chief Executive Officer does not remain with Sanofi until retirement. The Chief Executive Officer may elect for the rights to be transferable as a survivor's pension. The performance condition is as follows: Because this performance condition is linked to the attainment of the performance criteria for annual variable compensation (which itself is determined with reference to the strategic objectives of Sanofi), it ensures that no pension contributions could be made in the event that the Chief Executive Officer fails to deliver. The plan is wholly funded by Sanofi, which pays the full amount of the gross contributions. Because it is treated as equivalent to compensation, the contribution is subject to payroll taxes and employer's social security charges, and to income tax in the hands of the Chief Executive Officer; all of the above are charged on the basis of the bands, rates and other conditions applicable to compensation, paid and declared on his payslips for the contribution period. Subject to (i) formal confirmation by the Board of Directors that the performance condition for the previous year has been met and (ii) approval of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation package for that year by the Annual General Meeting of our shareholders, the annual gross contribution is paid as follows: In accordance with Article 39.5 bis of the French General Tax Code, deferred compensation as defined in section 4 of Article L. 22-10.9 of the French Commercial Code can be offset against corporate profits as a taxable expense up to a limit set at three times the annual social security ceiling per beneficiary. The pension entitlement is not cumulative with (i) any termination benefit paid in the event of forced departure or (ii) any non- compete indemnity. Termination arrangements The termination benefit only becomes payable if the departure of the Chief Executive Officer is forced, i.e. in the event of removal from office or resignation linked to a change in strategy or control of the Company. Compensation for non-renewal of the term of office is irrelevant in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, because this office is held for an indefinite term. In addition, no termination benefit is payable and the arrangement is deemed to have been rescinded in the following circumstances: Payment of the termination benefit is contingent upon fulfillment of a performance condition, which is deemed to have been met if the attainment rate for the individual variable compensation objectives exceeded 90% of the target; that condition is assessed over the three financial years preceding the Chief Executive Officer leaving office.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 118 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The amount of the termination benefit is capped at 24 months of the Chief Executive Officer's most recent total compensation on the basis of (i) the fixed compensation effective on the date of leaving office and (ii) the last variable compensation received prior to that date subject to fulfilment of the performance condition. The amount of the termination benefit is reduced by any amount received as consideration for the non-compete undertaking, such that the aggregate amount of those two benefits may never exceed two years of total fixed and variable compensation. Non-compete undertaking In the event of his departure from the Company, the Chief Executive Officer undertakes, during the 12-month period following his departure, not to join a competitor of Sanofi as an employee or corporate officer, or to provide services to or cooperate with such a competitor. In return for this undertaking, he receives an indemnity corresponding to one year's total compensation, based on his fixed compensation effective on the day he leaves office and on the last individual variable compensation he received prior to that date. This indemnity is payable in 12 monthly installments. However, the Board of Directors reserves the right to release the Chief Executive Officer from that undertaking for some or all of that 12-month period. In such cases, the non-compete indemnity would not be due for the period of time waived by the Company. Consequences of the Chief Executive Officer's departure for equity-based compensation If the Chief Executive Officer leaves Sanofi for reasons other than resignation or removal from office for gross or serious misconduct (in which case any award of equity-based compensation is forfeited in full), the overall allocation percentage is prorated to reflect the amount of time the Chief Executive Officer remained with Sanofi during the vesting period. If at any time prior to the expiration of the vesting period of his performance shares the Chief Executive Officer joins a competitor of Sanofi as an employee or corporate officer, or provides services to or cooperates with such a competitor, he irrevocably loses those performance shares regardless of any full or partial discharge by the Board of Directors of the non-compete undertaking relating to his office as Chief Executive Officer. Since 2021, if the Chief Executive Officer retires at statutory retirement age prior to the expiration of the vesting period of his performance shares, the overall allocation rate will be apportioned on a prorata basis to reflect the amount of time for which the Chief Executive Officer remained in the employment of Sanofi during the vesting period. Summary of benefits awarded to the Chief Executive Officer on leaving office The table below presents a summary of the benefits (as described above) that could be claimed by the Chief Executive Officer on leaving office, depending on the terms of his departure. The information provided in this summary is without prejudice to any decisions that may be made by the Board of Directors.PART I ITEM 6.

(f) In this case, the Chief Executive Officer remains subject to the terms of the plans, including the performance conditions and the non-compete clause.Policy to recover erroneously-awarded compensation (\"clawback\") On November 28, 2022, the SEC adopted rules, pursuant to Section 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requiring national securities exchanges and national securities associations, such as the NASDAQ, to amend their relevant listing standards no later than November 28, 2023 to require companies with listed securities to put in place a policy whereby listed companies will recover erroneously-awarded variable compensation from the Chief Executive Officer and certain other \"executive officers\" as defined in Section 10D-1(d). As of the date of publication of this Annual Report on Form 20-F, the NASDAQ listing standards have not yet been amended pursuant to Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act. Consequently, Sanofi will adopt a clawback mechanism once the final rules are adopted. In particular, in accordance with Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and the requirements to be adopted by NASDAQ in its revised listing rules, the Board of Directors will adopt a clause requiring the recovery in full or in part of the components of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation that are wholly or partially contingent on the attainment of financial performance criteria based on financial information that has been determined to be erroneous and has required restatement of the financial statements for accounting purposes. The compensation policy of the Chief Executive Officer will be presented to our shareholders at our Annual General Meeting to be held on May 25, 2023. Summary of changes made to the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer The table below summarizes adjustments made to how the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer is implemented. Some of them been thoroughly discussed with our shareholders. 2023 2022 Annual variable compensation: - To reflect shareholder expectations, Sanofi is from now on disclosing the content of the qualitative criteria. Variable equity-based compensation: - In order to link share-based compensation (long-term compensation) to the execution of the Group's CSR strategy, measurable and material CSR criteria have been introduced into performance share plans awarded in or after 2023. Clawback Policy:- Pursuant to Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, SEC regulations and NASDAQ listing rules, the Board of Directors will adopt a clause allowing for the recovery of some or all of the components of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation that are wholly or partially contingent on the attainment of financial performance criteria based on erroneous financial information (see above).Annual fixed compensation: - Annual fixed compensation is increased to \u20ac1,400,000 gross with effect from 2022. Annual variable compensation:- Sanofi now publishes the content of the individual CSR performance objective (sub-criteria). Variable equity-based compensation:- The external criterion based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will no longer be measured in absolute value (ranking) but in relative terms (variation from the previous ranking), with the caveat that for the Chief Executive Officer any TSR-linked payment will remain contingent on Sanofi achieving a rank greater than or equal to the median of the TSR panel. Arrangements in favor of executive officers in office as of December 31, 2022 (table No. 11 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code) Compensation and benefits of all kinds paid during 2022 or awarded in respect of 2022 to corporate officers The section below constitutes the report on compensation of corporate officers required by Article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code. The arrangements described therein will be submitted for approval by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 pursuant to Article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code. Compensation elements and benefits of all kinds paid during 2022 or awarded in respect of 2022 to directors (table No. 3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code) The compensation policy for directors (as described above in the section entitled \"\u2014 Compensation policy for directors\") defines the fixed amount of compensation, and the principles for allocating the variable portion between directors, up to the limit of the overall amount approved by the Annual General Meeting. Directors' compensation includes an annual fixed payment, apportioned on a time basis for directors who assumed or left office during the year; and a variable amount, allocated by the Board according to actual attendance at Board and Committee meetings. As required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, directors' compensation is allocated predominantly on a variable basis. For 2022, directors' compensation was determined in accordance with the compensation policy for directors as described above in the section entitled \"\u2014 Compensation policy for directors\". The table below shows amounts paid in respect of 2022 and 2021 to each member of our Board of Directors, including those whose term of office ended during those years. Directors' compensation for 2021, the amount of which was approved at the Board meeting of February 22, 2022, was partially paid in July 2021, with an additional payment in 2022.PART I ITEM 6.

The notional amount of compensation to which directors were entitled for 2022 exceeded the maximum annual amount set by the Annual General Meeting, due to more Board and committee meetings (eight extra meetings in total) being held in 2022; (ii) most of those meetings being face-to-face; and the international profile of two of the new directors. As a result, compensation was apportioned between the directors on a pro rata basis, such that directors had to be paid less than the agreed amount per meeting (variable portion). Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, which took into account the time spent by the non-voting member on the induction process ahead of his future appointment as Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors decided to allocate him the same compensation as is allocated to the other Board members. The amounts reported are gross amounts before taxes. Each of the two directors representing employees has a contract of employment with a Sanofi subsidiary, under which they receive compensation unrelated to their office as director. Consequently, that remuneration is not disclosed. Variable compensation allocated to directors in respect of 2022 represented 82% of their total compensation.PART I ITEM 6.

He has never had, and does not currently have, a contract of employment with Sanofi. He will leave office at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on May 25, 2023. The Chairman of the Board is a member of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee (which he chaired until December 15, 2021), the Scientific Committee and the Strategy Committee. The remit of the Chairman of the Board is specified in the Board Charter, which is reproduced in its entirety in Exhibit 1.2. to this Annual Report on Form 20-F. During the course of 2022, the Chairman's activities included: chairing all the meetings of the Board of Directors (12 in 2022) and of the Committees of which he is a member (six meetings of the Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee, four meetings of the Strategy Committee and six meetings of the Scientific Committee), and participating in Committee meetings to which he was invited (Audit Committee and Compensation Committee); close monitoring of the proper implementation of the decisions taken by the Board; meetings with directors, including (i) on the appointment of Carole Ferrand, Emile Voest and Antoine Yver, to explain to them how the Board operates and answer their questions, (ii) in connection with the evaluation of the Board's operating procedures, and (iii) on matters relating to the projects presented to the Board; regular meetings with the members of the Executive Committee; meetings with Sanofi employees; visits to subsidiaries of Sanofi; meetings with biotechs and medtechs; organizing two strategy seminars, in April and October 2022; and representing Sanofi at events or official meetings (in France and abroad) with representatives of the public authorities and other stakeholders, in line with his remit as defined by the Board Charter. The Chairman also has a role in explaining positions taken by the Board within its sphere of competence, especially in terms of strategy, governance and executive compensation. In furtherance of this role, Serge Weinberg drew on his experience of corporate communication in: answering letters from investors and shareholders; holding meetings with certain shareholders and proxy advisors; and attending a meeting of the Individual Shareholders Committee at Sanofi headquarters in March 2022, to discuss what Sanofi had achieved in 2021 and answer questions about the Company's latest news, future prospects and dividend policy. Those tasks were carried out in coordination with the Chief Executive Officer. Compensation awarded in respect of the 2022 financial year On February 22, 2022, acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determined the components of Serge Weinberg's compensation for the 2022 financial year, taking into account the nature of his duties and the level of his involvement in the work of the Board and in broader corporate governance matters. For the 2022 financial year, Serge Weinberg's annual fixed compensation was \u20ac800,000, unchanged from 2021. In line with our compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board, as approved by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of May 3, 2022, he did not receive any variable compensation and was not awarded any stock options or performance shares. He received no compensation for serving as a director, and no compensation from any company included in Sanofi's scope of consolidation within the meaning of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code. The amount reported for benefits in kind (\u20ac7,740 in 2022) relates to a company car with a driver. Serge Weinberg is not covered by the Sanofi defined-contribution pension plan.

For 2022, the individual objectives set by the Board were: -business transformation (15%) - quantitative and qualitative objective; (12.5%) - quantitative objective; -people and - quantitative and qualitative objective; and -CSR (15%) - quantitative and qualitative objective.The objectives applicable to annual variable compensation are: Overall, the quantitative element of the financial and individual objectives is in a range between 65% and 70%. At the start of 2022, the Board established a precise matrix for determining each individual objective. For confidentiality reasons, the level of attainment required (target) for the quantitative criteria cannot be disclosed. To reflect shareholder expectations, Sanofi is from now on disclosing the content of the qualitative criteria. Those criteria are always assessed by reference to the performances of the leading global pharmaceutical companies. Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of February 22, 2023 reviewed the attainment level of each criterion and sub-criterion.

Payment of Paul Hudson's variable compensation in respect of the 2022 financial year is contingent on approval of his compensation package by the shareholders in an Ordinary General Meeting, on the terms stipulated in Article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 126 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(a) For a definition, see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - A.1.5. Business net income\" in Sanofi's 2022 Annual Report on Form 20-F.Phantom stock units Having waived all equity-based compensation not yet vested when he left his previous employer, upon joining Sanofi, Paul Hudson was awarded on joining Sanofi a medium-term incentive plan providing for a cash bonus subject to continuous presence and performance conditions. Under the terms of the plan, which compensated for approximately 50% of the incentive plans that Paul Hudson waived, he was awarded Phantom Stock Units, the vesting of which was contingent on (i) his continuous presence and (ii) attainment of performance conditions, with the attainment level of those conditions to be determined for half of the award, i.e. 25,000 phantom stock units, as of March 30, 2021 (the \"First Tranche\") and for the other half of the award, i.e. 25,000 phantom stock units, as of March 31, 2022 (the \"Second Tranche\"). The cash bonuses corresponding to the 50,000 Phantom Stock Units were paid in 2021 (First Tranche) and 2022 (Second Tranche); the bonus for the Second Tranche amounted to \u20ac2,013,534. The main terms of the plan, including the performance conditions applicable to the Phantom Stock Units, are described on pages 114 to 116 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 20-F. Equity-based compensation Using the authorizations granted by our shareholders via the 24th resolution at the Annual General Meeting of April 30, 2021, and acting on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of May 3, 2022 decided to award Paul Hudson 82,500 performance shares in respect of 2022. The valuation of that award as of May 3, 2022, determined in accordance with IFRS and incorporating a market-related condition, was \u20ac6,967,950, equivalent to 4.97 times his fixed compensation. The entire amount of the award is contingent upon both internal criteria based upon BNI and FCF, and upon an external criterion based on improvement in TSR relative to that of a benchmark panel of twelve leading global pharmaceutical companies (plus Sanofi): Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd. To align equity-based compensation on our medium-term performance, a three-year period (2022-2024) is used to measure performance. The above criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation on the strategy adopted by Sanofi. The arrangements relating to these awards are as follows: the performance criterion based on BNI accounts for 50% of the award. That criterion corresponds to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, of actual BNI to budgeted BNI. It represents the average actual-to-budget ratio attained over the entire period. Budgeted BNI is derived from the budget as approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each financial year. The BNI objective may not be lower than the bottom end of the full-year guidance range publicly announced by Sanofi at the beginning of each year. If the attainment level is less than 95%, the corresponding performance shares are forfeited. the FCF criterion accounts for 30% of the award. This criterion was selected because it is aligned with Sanofi's current strategic objectives, and is transparent both within and outside the company. The FCF criterion represents the average actual-to-budget FCF ratio attained over the entire period. The award is based on a target FCF, below which some or all of the performance shares are forfeited.PART I ITEM 6.

The Endpoint Sanofi TSR is equal to the following formula: (average prices of 2024 - average prices of 2021 + dividends per share 2022 to 2024) / average of 2021. ++3 or more 150% ++2 100% ++1 50% The criterion based on the Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") Rank Improvement accounts for 20% of the award. It corresponds to the evolution in rank of Sanofi's TSR when compared to the TSR of peer companies included in a panel. The TSR corresponds to the trading price of Sanofi shares increased by the dividends per share during the measurement periods, without reinvestment. Sanofi TSR Rank Improvement is determined by comparing the Endpoint Sanofi TSR rank to the Baseline Sanofi TSR rank. Our TSR is compared wit h the benchmark panel of twelve companies listed above, so as to determine the ranking of Sanofi within the panel. The number of performance shares vesting depends upon the improvement in our TSR ranking, as follows: Sanofi's improvement in the rankings TSR allocation rate No improvement \u2014% Even if there is an improvement in Sanofi's TSR ranking based on the principles set out above, no TSR allocation can be made if Sanofi's ranking is below median TSR, defined as the performance of the company ranked 7th in the panel. Paul Hudson is under an obligation to retain, until he ceases to hold office, a quantity of Sanofi shares equivalent to 50% of any gain (net of taxes and social contributions) arising on the vesting of his performance shares, calculated as of the date on which those shares vest. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and our Board Charter, Paul Hudson has undertaken to refrain from entering into speculative or hedging transactions, and so far as Sanofi is aware no hedging instruments have been contracted. In the interests of transparency, we disclose below attainment levels and allocation rates for the most recent performance-linked equity-based compensation plans awarded to our Chief Executive Officer (bearing in mind that only the April 28, 2020 Plan applies to Paul Hudson, since this was the first plan he was awarded following his appointment in 2019): Attainment level Allocation rate BNI ROA TSR options and 38,360 performance shares BNI FCF April 30, 2019 stock opt ions and 48,500 performance Performance shares awarded to Paul Hudson in 2022 (table No. 6 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code) Each performance share awarded on May 3, 2022, was valued at \u20ac84.46, valuing the total benefit at \u20ac6,967,950. The General Meeting of May 3, 2022 decided to restrict the number of performance shares that can be awarded to executive officers to 5% of the overall limit (1.5% of the share capital). The number of shares awarded to Paul Hudson in 2022 represents 0.43% of the total limit approved by that Meeting and 0.006% of our share capital at the date of grant.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 128 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Source Plan dateValuation of performance shares (\u20ac)Number of performance Under the terms of our Board Charter, Paul Hudson is required to retain a quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain arising on the vesting of the shares, net of the associated taxes and social contributions.Performance shares awarded to Paul Hudson which became available in 2022 (table No. 7 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code) Because Paul Hudson took office on September 1, 2019, he was not awarded any performance shares prior to the 2020 financial year. Consequently, no performance shares became available to him in 2022. Because awards of stock options to our Chief Executive Officer are not permitted under our compensation policy, tables No.4 and No. 5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code are not applicable. Pension rights Paul Hudson is entitled to benefits under the top-up defined-contribution pension plan introduced within Sanofi on January 1, 2020. Under the terms of the plan, the Chief Executive Officer receives (subject to attainment of a performance condition) an annual contribution of up to 25% of his reference compensation (annual fixed and variable compensation). The performance condition for the vesting of pension rights is linked to the attainment of the performance criteria for 2022 variable compensation. The Board of Directors, at its meeting of February 22, 2023, ascertained whether that performance condition had been met, noting that the attainment level for the variable portion of Paul Hudson's compensation for the 2022 financial year was 111.30%, i.e. 166.95% of his fixed compensation. The annual gross contribution is paid as follows: 50% as a gross insurance premium to the fund manager - the amount due to the fund manager with respect to 2022 is \u20ac467,162.50; and 50% to Paul Hudson, to indemnify him for the social security and tax charges for which he will become immediately liable. The amount due to Paul Hudson with respect to 2022 was set by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 22, 2023 at \u20ac467,162.50. Payment of those amounts is contingent on approval of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation package by the shareholders in an Ordinary General Meeting, on the terms stipulated in Article L. 22-10-34 II of the French Commercial Code. Social welfare and health insurance Paul Hudson is subject to, benefits from and contributes to the same health cover, and death and disability plans as are applicable to other employees of Sanofi based in France. He also benefits from an unemployment insurance scheme. Benefits in kind the scope includes Sanofi SA (the parent company) and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries located in France, and hence covers more than 80% of total payroll of permanent employees in France. No separate ratios are published for Sanofi SA (the parent company), as the low headcount at Sanofi SA means that such ratios would not be representative of our total headcount in France; the employee compensation used in the calculation is the full time equivalent (FTE) compensation of permanent employees with at least two financial years of uninterrupted employment; compensation includes fixed compensation awarded during the reference year, and variable compensation related to the previous year and paid during the reference year. All compensation amounts are gross amounts; in order to maintain consistency, we have excluded from the numerator (i) compensation items not included in the denominator and (ii) non-recurring compensation items. This applies in particular to accommodation expenses related to the relocation to France of the Chief Executive Officer (Paul Hudson) in 2020, and to expenses related to unemployment insurance; long term variable compensation: performance shares and stock options awarded during each reference year are valued at the date of grant in accordance with international financial reporting standards. The valuation of performance shares that include the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition incorporates market conditions where applicable. Awards are subject to a continuing employment condition (three years minimum) and to performance conditions. Consequently, the valuation at the date of grant is not necessarily indicative of the value of stock options and performance shares at the end of the vesting period, especially if the performance conditions are not met;The benefits in kind received by Paul Hudson in 2022 were valued at \u20ac13,497, and correspond to a company car with a driver.

His 2019 variable compensation, paid in 2020, has been annualized for the purpose of calculating the ratios. (b) 2020: Paul Hudson took office on September 1, 2019. The 2020 CEO compensation includes Paul Hudson's 2020 fixed compensation (\u20ac1.3 million), his 2019 variable compensation paid in 2020 and annualized (\u20ac1,950 million), and 75,000 performance shares awarded in 2020. (c) The change in average employee compensation in France between 2020 and 2021 was driven primarily by differences in the average compensation levels of employees who left the company versus those who joined.Compensation and benefits of all kinds awarded in respect of 2023 to Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer Fixed and variable compensation Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of February 22, 2023 determined the components of Paul Hudson's compensation for the 2023 financial year. Paul Hudson's annual compensation comprises (i) annual fixed gross compensation of \u20ac1,400,000 (see the explanations provided under \"Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer\" in the section entitled \"Compensation policy for corporate officers\" above) and (ii) annual variable compensation in a range from 0% to 250% of his annual fixed compensation, with a target of 150%, and subject to both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Those objectives are 50% based on financial indicators (sales growth, BNI, FCF, BOI margin, and growth of new assets, each accounting for 10%), and 50% based on specific individual objectives. The individual objectives for 2023 are shown below: Equity-based compensation Acting on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors meeting of February 22, 2023 proposes awarding 82,500 performance shares to Paul Hudson in respect of 2023. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the entire award will be subject to criteria that are both internal (based on our BNI, FCF and CSR) and external (based on the improvement in TSR as compared with that of a panel of the 12 leading global pharmaceutical companies: Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd.). For the plan applicable to Executive Committee members, the TSR criterion is measured in relative terms (variation from the previous ranking). That variation (the \"Sanofi TSR Rank Improvement\") is determined by comparing the Endpoint Sanofi TSR Rank (established over a 3-year measurement period) to the Baseline Sanofi TSR Rank (established over a 1-year measurement period). TSR-linked awards would be 50% if the ranking improved by 1; 100% if it improved by 2; and 150% if it improved by 3. For the Chief Executive Officer, any TSR-linked payment will remain contingent on Sanofi achieving an Endpoint Rank greater than or equal to the median of the TSR panel. 1. Affordable Access: providing essential medicines to non-communicable disease patients through Sanofi Global Health. 2. Planet Care: Carbon Footprint Reduction, scope 1&2 (CO 2 emissions reduction vs 2019).With effect from the 2023 awards, the plan applicable to the Chief Executive Officer and top executives includes the following extra-financial criteria, both of which are quantitative and which count for 10% of the award: Following the introduction of the CSR criteria, the business net income criterion counts for 45%; the free cash flow criterion for 25%; and the TSR Rank Improvement criterion for 10% (unchanged). We will make details of the terms of the plan available to shareholders on the governance page of our corporate website in advance of the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2023. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Paul Hudson is bound by rules on insider trading that impose blackout periods, as contained in our Board Charter.

In addition to fixed compensation, they receive variable compensation. Their target variable compensation depends on their position, and can represent up to 100% of their fixed compensation. The target amount of individual variable compensation is determined in line with market practice. It rewards the joint contribution of all Executive Committee members to Sanofi's performance. For 2022, the variable component consisted of two elements: attainment of quantitative objectives (accounting for 50%) which are measured at consolidated level: sales growth 30%, ratio of BOI to net sales (\"BOI margin\") 35%, and development outcomes 20%, and FCF 15%; and attainment of quantitative and qualitative objectives both individually (30%) and collectively (20%) within the Executive Committee (together accounting for 50%). The indicators used are intended to measure Sanofi's annual performance objectives; individual objectives; and the attainment of people objectives like gender parity in senior executive roles, individual career development plans, and transformation of the corporate culture to align with the \"Play to Win\" strategy. In addition, Executive Committee members may be awarded performance shares. For 2022, the total gross compensation paid and accrued in respect of members of the Executive Committee (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) was \u20ac17 million, including \u20ac8 million in fixed compensation. A total of 189,887 performance shares were awarded in 2022 to members of the Executive Committee (excluding the award to the Chief Executive Officer). No stock options were awarded in 2022 to members of the Executive Committee or the Chief Executive Officer. In compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, these entire awards are contingent upon two internal criteria, based on BNI (1), FCF; and on an external criterion, based on TSR. Those criteria were selected because they align medium-term equity-based compensation with the strategy adopted by Sanofi. The Board believes that the performance conditions applied are good indicators of shareholder value creation in terms of the quality of investment decision and the commitment to deliver exacting financial results in a difficult economic environment. The arrangements relating to these awards are as follows: the BNI performance criterion accounts for 50% of the award. This criterion corresponds to the ratio, at constant exchange rates, of actual BNI to budgeted BNI. It represents the average actual-to-budget ratio attained over the entire period. Budgeted BNI is derived from the budget as approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each financial year. The BNI objective may not be lower than the bottom end of the full-year guidance range publicly announced by Sanofi at the beginning of each year. If the ratio is less than 95%, the corresponding performance shares are forfeited. the FCF criterion accounts for 30% of the award. It represents the average actual-to-budget ratio of FCF attained over the entire period. The award is based on a target FCF, below which some or all of our performance shares are forfeited. The criterion based on the Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") Rank Improvement accounts for 20% of the award. It corresponds to the evolution in rank of Sanofi's TSR when compared to the TSR of peer companies included in a panel. The TSR corresponds to the trading price of Sanofi shares increased by the dividends per share during the measurement periods,PART I ITEM 6.

For a definition, see \"Item 5. - Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - Business Net Income\". The Baseline Sanofi TSR is equal to the following formula: (average prices of 2021 - average prices of 2020 + dividends per share 2021) / average prices of 2020 The Endpoint Sanofi TSR is equal to the following formula: (average prices of 2024 - average prices of 2021 + dividends per share 2022 to 2024) / average prices of 2021 definitions: -median TSR (\"M\") is the performance of the company ranked seventh in the panel, -the upper bound (\"H\") is the arithmetical average of the performances of the panel companies ranked first, second and third, and -the intermediate level is calculated as M + [(H-M)/2]; the TSR allocation rate will be calculated as follows based on Sanofi's ranking within the panel: -if Sanofi's TSR is below be 0%, -if Sanofi's TSR is M, the TSR allocation rate will be 50%, -if Sanofi's TSR is equal to the intermediate level, the TSR allocation rate will be 100%, -if Sanofi's TSR is H, the be 150%, and -if Sanofi's TSR is above M but below H, the TSR allocation rate will be calculated using linear interpolation; with effect from the 2022 awards, for the plan applicable to members of the Executive Committee, the mechanism of the TSR criterion was modified as follows: -the TSR criterion is no longer measured in absolute value (ranking) but in relative terms (variation from the previous ranking). That variation (the \"Sanofi TSR Rank Improvement\") will be determined by comparing the Endpoint Sanofi TSR Rank (established over a 3-year measurement period) to the Baseline Sanofi TSR Rank (established over a 1-yearmeasurement period). TSR-linked awards would be 50% if the ranking improved by 1, 100% if it improved by 2, and 150% if itimproved by 3, and -a multiplier is applied that will uplift the number of performance shares vesting by 10% if (i) the maximum TSR allocation rate is attained and (ii) Sanofi ranks greater than or equal to the median for the TSR benchmark panel; the number of performance shares actually vesting depends on the overall allocation rate, which for the vesting period is the weighted average of the BNI allocation rate (50%), the FCF allocation rate (30%) and the TSR allocation rate for the vesting period (20%); in order to align equity-based compensation with medium-term performance, performance is measured over three financial years; vesting is subject to a non-compete clause; the entire award is forfeited in the event of resignation, or dismissal for gross or serious misconduct; in the event of individual dismissal other than for gross or serious misconduct or retirement before the age of 60, or if the beneficiary's employer ceases to be part of the Sanofi group, the overall allocation percentage is prorated to reflect the amount of time the person remained with the Sanofi group during the vesting period; if any of the following events occur, full rights to the award are retained: (i) dismissal as part of a collective redundancy plan or of an equivalent collective plan negotiated and approved by the Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi; (ii) retirement on or after reaching the statutory retirement age, or early retirement under a statutory or contractual early retirement plan implemented by the relevant Sanofi entity and duly approved by the Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi; (iii) disability classified in the second or third categories stipulated in Article L. 314-4 of the French Social Security Code; or (iv) death of the beneficiary.without reinvestment. Sanofi TSR Rank Improvement is determined by comparing the Endpoint Sanofi TSR rank to the Baseline Sanofi TSR rank. The TSR obtained will be compared with that of each of the companies in a panel of peers to generate a ranking that includes Sanofi and the 12 companies in the panel: Amgen, AstraZeneca plc, Bayer AG, Bristol-Myers-Squibb Inc., Eli Lilly and Company Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Merck Inc., Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer Inc., and Roche Holding Ltd; Pension arrangements The total amount accrued as of December 31, 2022 in respect of corporate pension plans for persons who have held an executive position during the year 2021 was \u20ac10 million. That amount includes an expense of \u20ac1 million recognized in profit or loss during 2022.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 134 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022C. Board Practices Neither we nor our subsidiaries have entered into service contracts with members of our Board of Directors or corporate officers providing for benefits upon termination of employment. With respect to the Chief Executive Officer, see also \"\u2014 B. Compensation \u2014 Compensation and arrangements for corporate officers\" above. Application of the AFEP-MEDEF Code The AFEP-MEDEF Code requires us to report specifically on the application of its recommendations and if any of them have not been applied, explain why. At the close of the Annual General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders held on May 3, 2022, a director representing employees was appointed as a member if the Compensation Committee. Consequently, Sanofi no longer diverges from the AFEP-MEDEF code on that point. Currently, our departures from this Code are as follows: The Appointments, Governance and CSR Committee examined this point during its meeting of February 15, 2023 and plans to change the practice from 2023 towards an assessment of the individual contribution of directors. 24.4 Non -compet ition agreementIn any event, no benefit can be paid over the age of 65.Under the compensation policy for our Chief Executive Officer, he undertakes in the event he leaves the Company not to join a competitor of the Company as an employee or corporate officer, or to provide services to or cooperate with such a competitor. In return for this undertaking, he receives an indemnity corresponding to one year's total compensation based on his fixed compensation effective on the day he ceases to hold office and the last individual variable compensation received prior to that date. The indemnity is payable in 12 monthly installments. However, the Board of Directors may decide at the time the Chief Executive Officer leaves office (regardless of his age) to release him from the non-compete undertaking for some or all of the 12-month period. In such a case, the non-compete indemnity would not be due for the period of time waived by the Company. Th e Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation of the Compensation Committee, decided not to alter the compensation policy and non-compete undertaking of the Chief Executive Officer such that his indemnity would not be payable after he reaches the age of 65, on the basis that this is out of line with the actual situation. In practice, many executive officers continue to work after they leave office, often in a consultancy role. Consequently, enforcing such a rule could deprive Sanofi of legal protection in the event that the Chief Executive Officer were to engage in a competing activity immediately after leaving the Company. Activities of the Board of Directors in 2022 the directors; the Secretary to the Board; frequently: members of the Executive Committee; and occasionally: the statutory auditors, managers of our global support functions, and other company employees.During 2022, the Board of Directors met 14 times (including strategy seminars), with an overall attendance rate among Board members of 95%. Individual attendance rates of serving directors varied between 86% and 100%. The following persons attended meetings of the Board of Directors: The agenda for each meeting of the Board is prepared by the Secretary after consultation with the Chairman, taking account of the agendas for the meetings of the specialist Committees and the suggestions of the directors. Approximately one week prior to each meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors each receive a file containing the agenda, the minutes of the previous meeting, and documentation relating to the agenda. The minutes of each meeting are expressly approved at the next meeting of the Board of Directors.In compliance with our Board Charter, certain issues are examined in advance by the various Committees according to their areas of competence to enable them to make a recommendation; those issues are then submitted for a decision by the Board of Directors.PART I ITEM 6.

Employees Number of Employees In 2022, Sanofi employed 91,573,442 people worldwide, 3,869 fewer than in 2021. The tables below give a breakdown of employees by geographical area and function as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Employees by Geographical Area Employees by Function Industrial Relations In all countries where we operate, we seek to strike a balance between our economic interests and those of our employees, which we regard as inseparable. Our responsibility towards our employees is based on the basic principles of our Social Charter, which outlines the rights and duties of all Sanofi employees. The Social Charter addresses our key commitments towards our workforce: equal opportunity for all people without discrimination, the right to health and safety, respect for privacy, the right to information and professional training, social protection for employees and their families, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, and respect for the principles contained in the Global Compact on labor relations and ILO conventions governing the physical and emotional well-being and safety of children. Our labor relations are based on respect and dialogue. In this spirit, management and employee representatives meet regularly to exchange views, negotiate, sign agreements and ensure that agreements are being implemented. Employee dialogue takes place in different ways from country to country, as dictated by specific local circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, employee dialogue relating to information, consultation and negotiation processes may take place at national, regional or company level. It may be organized on an interprofessional or sectorial basis, or both. Employee dialogue may be informal or implemented through a specific formal body, or a combination of both methods. Whatever the situation, Sanofi encourages employees to voice their opinions, help create a stimulating work environment and take part in decisions aiming to improve the way we work. These efforts reflect one of the principles of the Social Charter, whereby improving working conditions and the necessary adaptation to our business environment go hand-in-hand. Profit-sharing Schemes, Employee Savings Schemes and Employee Share Ownership Profit-sharing schemes All employees of our French companies belong to voluntary and statutory profit-sharing schemes.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 143 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022As of December 31, 2022 schemes (int\u00e9ressement des salari\u00e9s) are collective schemes that are optional for the employer and contingent upon performance. The aim is to give employees an interest in the growth of the business and improvements in its performance. The amount distributed by our French companies during 2022 in respect of the voluntary scheme for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented 2.53% of total payroll. Sanofi did not distribute any profit-sharing in 2021 under voluntary schemes in respect of the 2020 financial year, as the special profit-sharing reserve exceeded the maximum amount, as determined by application of the criteria defined by the profit-sharing agreement. In April 2020, we entered into a new fixed-term statutory profit-sharing agreement for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, which applies to all employees of our French companies. Under the agreement, Sanofi pays collective variable compensation determined on the basis of the more favorable of (i) growth in consolidated net sales (at constant exchange rates and on a constant structure basis) or (ii) BOI margin. For each of those criteria, a matrix determines what percentage of total payroll is to be allocated to the scheme. An additional sum may be distributed, based on a CSR-related performance condition reflecting progress in environmental matters (reduction in greenhouse gas emissions) and capped at 0.5% of total payroll. This overall allocation is reduced by the amount required by law to be transferred to a special profit-sharing reserve. The balance is then distributed between the employees unless the transfer to the reserve equals or exceeds the maximum amount determined under the specified criteria, in which case no profit share is paid to the employees. Statutory scheme The statutory scheme (participation des salari\u00e9s aux r\u00e9sultats de l'entreprise) is a French legal obligation for companies with more than 50 employees that made a profit in the previous financial year. 60% prorated on the basis of time spent in the Company's employment in the year; and 40% prorated on the basis of gross annual salary received during the year, subject to a lower limit equal to the social security ceiling and an upper limit of three times the social security ceiling.The amount distributed by our French companies during 2022 in respect of the statutory scheme for the year ended December 31, 2021 represented 8.52% of total payroll. Distribution formula In order to favor lower-paid employees, the voluntary and statutory profit-sharing agreements entered into since 2005 split the benefit between those entitled as follows: Employee savings schemes and collective retirement savings plan The employee savings arrangements operated by Sanofi are based on a collective savings scheme (Plan d'\u00c9pargne Groupe) and a collective retirement savings scheme (Plan d'\u00c9pargne pour la Retraite Collectif) . Those schemes reinvest the sums derived from the statutory and voluntary profit-sharing schemes, plus voluntary contributions from employees. In June 2022, 89.1% of the employees who benefited from the profit-sharing schemes opted to invest in the collective savings scheme, and nearly 80.3% opted to invest in the collective retirement savings scheme. Sanofi supplements the amount invested by employees in these schemes by making a top-up contribution. In 2022, \u20ac143.4 million and \u20ac60.1 million were invested in the collective savings scheme and the collective retirement savings scheme respectively through the voluntary and statutory schemes for 2021, and through top-up contributions. Employee share ownership As of December 31, 2022, shares held under the collective savings scheme or in registered form by employees of Sanofi, employees of related companies and former employees amounted to 2.05% of our share capital. For more information about our most recent employee share ownership plan, refer to \"Item 10. Additional Information \u2014 Changes in Share Capital \u2014 Increases in Share Capital\". E. Share Ownership Senior Management Members of the Executive Committee hold shares of our Company amounting in the aggregate to less than 1% of our share capital. Existing Option Plans as of December 31, 2022 In 2019, the Board of Directors reviewed Sanofi's compensation policy and decided that stock options would no longer be awarded from 2020 onwards. That decision was taken to standardize the terms of equity-based compensation awards within Sanofi, and in response to feedback from some shareholders and proxy advisors who had concerns about stock options given their dilutive effect and potential unintended consequences.PART I ITEM 6. Directors, senior management and employees 144 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Share Purchase Option Plans As of December 31, 2022 there were no stock purchase option plans outstanding. Share Subscription Option Plans a plan under which 459 beneficiaries classified as \"Senior Executives\" were awarded a total of 1,146,431 shares; a plan under which 1,869 beneficiaries not classified as \"Senior Executives\" were awarded a total of 2,000,627 shares; a plan under which 82,500 performance shares were awarded to the Chief Executive Officer.In 2022, 19,362 stock options were exercised by individuals who were Executive Committee members as of December 31, 2022. All of the plans involved post-date the creation of the Executive Committee: Sanofi plan of March 5, 2012, exercise price \u20ac56.44; and Sanofi plan of March 5, 2013, exercise price \u20ac72.19. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 1,837,969 stock subscription options remained outstanding. As of the same date, 1,624,569 options were immediately exercisable. Existing Performance Share Plans as of December 31, 2022 The Board of Directors awards shares to certain employees in order to give them a direct stake in our future and performances via trends in the share price, as a partial substitute for the granting of stock options. Shares are awarded to employees by the Board of Directors on the basis of a list submitted to the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors sets terms of the awards, including continuing employment conditions and performance conditions (measured over three financial years). The employee plans have a three-year vesting period, with no lock-up period.At its meeting of May 3, 2022, the Board of Directors awarded a share performance plan, cascaded down into three sub-plans: Of the 7,277 beneficiaries, 48% were women.PART I ITEM 6.

The entirety of those awards is contingent upon criteria based on business net income (BNI) and free cash flow (FCF); in the case of employees classified as \"Senior Executives\", an additional criterion based on total shareholder return (TSR) is added, accounting for 20% of the total. Vesting is subject to a non-compete clause. The number of shares awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in 2022 represents 0.4% of the total limit approved by our shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of April 30, 2021 (1.5% of our share capital) and 2.48% of the total amount awarded to all beneficiaries in 2022. The 2022 awards represent a dilution of approximately 0.26% of our undiluted share capital as of December 31, 2022. Not all of our employees were awarded performance shares, but a new voluntary profit-sharing agreement was signed in April 2020 which gives all of our employees an interest in Sanofi's performance (for more details refer to \"\u2014 Profit-Sharing Schemes, Employee Savings Schemes and Employee Share Ownership\", above).

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions A. Major Shareholders The table below shows the ownership of our shares as of January 31, 2023, indicating the beneficial owners of our shares. To the best of our knowledge and on the basis of the notifications received as disclosed below, except for L'Or\u00e9al and BlackRock, Inc., no other shareholder currently holds more than 5% of our share capital or voting rights. Our Articles of Association provide for double voting rights for shares held in registered form for at least two years. All of our shareholders may benefit from double voting rights if these conditions are met, and no shareholder benefits from specific voting rights. For more information relating to our shares, see \"Item 10. Additional Information \u2014 B. Memorandum and Articles of Association.\" Neither L'Or\u00e9al nor BlackRock holds different voting rights from those of our other shareholders. To the best of our knowledge, no other shareholder currently holds, directly or indirectly and acting alone or in concert, more than 5% of our share capital or voting rights. Furthermore, we believe that we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or government, or by any other natural or legal persons. To our knowledge, there are no arrangements that may result in a change of control. During the year ended December 31, 2022 we received several share ownership declarations informing us that a legal threshold had been passed, as required under Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code. Dodge & Cox, acting on behalf of its clients and funds under its management, declared that on June 22, 2022 it had passed below the 5% threshold in terms of share capital, and holds, on behalf of its clients and funds, 4.96% of the share capital and 4.42% of the voting rights. Dodge & Cox, acting on behalf of its clients and funds under its management, declared that on October 14, 2022 it had passed above the 5% threshold in terms of voting rights, and holds, on behalf of its clients and funds, 5.01% of the share capital and 4.45% of the voting rights. In addition to the statutory requirement to inform the Company and the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF, the French Financial Markets Regulator) that they hold a number of shares (or of securities equivalent to shares or of voting rights pursuant to Article L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code) representing more (90%) or nineteen-twentieths (95%) of the share capital or theoretical voting rights within four trading days after crossing any such ownership threshold (Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code), any natural or legal person who directly or indirectly comes to hold a percentage of the share capital, voting rights or securities giving future access to the Company's capital that is equal to or greater than 1% or any multiple of that percentage, is obliged to inform the Company thereof by registered mail, return receipt requested, indicating the number of securities held, within five trading days following the date on which each of the thresholds was crossed. If such declaration is not made, the shares in excess of the fraction that should have been declared will be stripped of voting rights at shareholders' meetings, if on the occasion of such meeting, the failure to declare has been formally noted and one or more shareholders collectively holding at least 5% of the Company's share capital or voting rights so request at that meeting. Any natural or legal person is also required to inform the Company, in the forms and within the time limits stipulated above for passing above a specified threshold, if their direct or indirect holding passes below any of the aforementioned thresholds. Since January 1, 2023 Sanofi has only received share ownership declarations of statutory threshold.PART I ITEM 7.

Financial Statements.\" Dividends on Ordinary Shares We paid annual dividends for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and our shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of an annual dividend of 3.56 per share for the 2022 fiscal year at our next annual shareholders' meeting. If approved, this dividend will be paid on June 1, 2023. We expect that we will continue to pay regular dividends based on our financial condition and results of operations. The proposed 2022 dividend equates to a distribution of 43.1% of our business net income. For information on the non-IFRS financial measure \"business earnings per share\" see \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 Business Net Income.\" The following table sets forth information with respect to the dividends paid by our Company in respect of the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years and the dividend that will be proposed for approval by our shareholders in respect of the 2022 fiscal year at our May 25, 2023 shareholders' meeting. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will be determined by majority vote of the holders of our shares at an ordinary general meeting, following the recommendation of our Board of Directors. Any declaration will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our shareholders. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future on a continuous and regular basis. Under French law, we are required to pay dividends approved by an ordinary general meeting of shareholders within nine months following the meeting at which they are approved. Disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the United States Exchange Act of 1934 Sanofi engages in limited business activities with Iran related to human health products - namely, sales of bulk and branded pharmaceuticals and vaccines. These activities, which are disclosed pursuant to Section 13(r) of the United States Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are not financially material to Sanofi and contributed well under 1% of Sanofi's consolidated net sales in 2022. Sanofi's US affiliates and non-US affiliates owned or controlled by Sanofi's US affiliates either do not engage in Iran-related activities or act under licenses issued by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Sanofi and certain non-US Sanofi affiliates engage in limited business activities that neither are expressly authorized by OFAC nor require such authorization. In 2016, Sanofi and the Iran Food and Drug Administration (IFDA), an entity affiliated with the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education, signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) regarding: (i) potential future projects to reinforce current partnerships with reputable Iranian manufacturers (in particular, to enhance industrial quality standards); (ii) collaborating with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education on programs for the prevention and control of certain chronic and non-communicable diseases (in particular, diabetes); and (iii) potential future collaboration on epidemiological studies. In 2022, activities conducted under the MOC did not generate any revenue or net profits. Certain non-US Sanofi affiliates engage in limited business with Iranian counterparties associated with the Iranian Ministry of Health, such as public hospitals or distributors. In 2022, those business activities generated approximately \u20ac28.2 million in gross revenue and contributed no more than \u20ac7.6 million in net profits. Finally, a representative office in Tehran incurs incidental expenses from state-owned utilities.Sanofi believes that it and its affiliates' activities are compliant with applicable law, and in light of the nature of the activities concerned, Sanofi and its affiliates intend to continue their ongoing activities in Iran.PART I ITEM 8.

Significant Changes \u2014 Updates to Note D.22.\". Sanofi and its subsidiaries are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularly claims against generic companies seeking to limit the patent protection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. As a result, we may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and could affect our business and reputation. While we do not currently believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable. As a consequence, we may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows and/or our reputation. Government investigations and related litigation From time to time, subsidiaries of Sanofi are subject to governmental investigations and information requests from regulatory authorities inquiring as to the practices of Sanofi with respect to the sales, marketing, and promotion of its products. From 2017 through 2022, several government agencies issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) or other discovery requests calling for the production of documents and information relating to Sanofi's trade and pricing practices for its insulin products and/or Lantus\u00ae-related litigation. Sanofi US is cooperating with each of the previously reported investigations, (including those by the State Attorney General's offices in Washington, California, New York, Colorado and Vermont); none of which has been closed. In addition, Sanofi US is cooperating with investigations initiated by the US Federal Trade Commission in June of 2022, by the Texas State Attorney General's office in August 2022, and by the Ohio Attorney General's office in October 2022. In September 2019, Sanofi US received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the US Department of Justice concerning Dupixent \u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae, Praluent\u00ae and Zaltrap\u00ae. In June 2021, the government declined to intervene in the underlying complaint which was filed in November 2018. The government investigation into this matter is now closed. Relators, however, filed their First Amended Complaint in October 2021 and Defendants filed motions to dismiss in January 2022. In February 2020, Genzyme Corporation received a CID from the US Department of Justice. The CID requests documents and information relating to Genzyme Corporation's payments made to vendors or developers of electronic health record technology. Genzyme Corporation is cooperating with this investigation. In October 2022, Sanofi US received a CID from the Ohio State Attorney General's office, seeking documents and information about the pricing, sale, and distribution of pharmaceuticals and pharmacy benefit manager services in the State of Ohio. Sanofi US is cooperating with this investigation. Insulin Related Litigation In December 2016 and January 2017, two putative class actions were filed against Sanofi US and Sanofi GmbH in the US Federal Court in Massachusetts on behalf of direct purchasers of Lantus \u00ae alleging certain antitrust violations. Sanofi GmbH was later dismissed from the actions. In January 2018, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' consolidated amended complaint against Sanofi US. Plaintiffs appealed that order to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which issued its decision on February 13, 2020 reversing and remanding to the district court. In January 2021, Sanofi-Aventis Puerto Rico, Inc. (\"Sanofi PR\") was added as a defendant. In October 2022, Plaintiffs informed Sanofi US and Sanofi PR that they would proceed via joinder rather than move for class certification. Consistent with the Court's joinder deadline, new plaintiffs moved to intervene on January 3, 2023. There are a number of insulin-related litigation matters pending in the US federal and state courts. These include cases brought on behalf of putative classes of consumers, wholesale purchasers of insulin, and state and local governments. The cases, which have been filed against Sanofi US along with other insulin manufacturers and, in some cases, pharmacy benefit managers, challenge those entities' insulin pricing practices (including Sanofi's pricing practices for Lantus \u00ae, Apidra\u00ae, Toujeo\u00ae and/or Soliqua\u00ae). The suits allege some combination of: violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO Act\"); violations of various state unfair/deceptive trade practices statutes, unjust enrichment, common-law fraud, and civil conspiracy. The status of these matters varies from initial motions to dismiss the complaints to active discovery.PART I ITEM 8. Financial information 151 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022B. Significant Changes Updates to Note D.22. N/A Other Changes On January 5, 2023, Sanofi announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for nirsevimab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants entering or during their first RSV season and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. On January 11, 2023, Sanofi Ventures announced an additional multi-year commitment from Sanofi, with an increase in capital to more than $750 million to the evergreen venture fund. In addition to serving as a financial partner to top-tier early-to-mid-stage portfolio companies, the fund supports future efforts for business development and M&A opportunities within Sanofi. The additional capital, confirmed by the executive committee, will also fuel the expansion and investment capacity of the Sanofi Ventures investment team on a global scale. On January 30, 2023, the European Commission (EC) expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent \u00ae (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, who are inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to, or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. With this approval, Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat EoE in Europe and the U.S. On February 13, 2023, Sanofi announced that Dr. John Reed, its Global Head of R&D, will be leaving the company to pursue a new opportunity outside Sanofi. The company warmly thanks Dr. Reed for his leadership over these last years. Since joining Sanofi in 2018, John has laid the foundation for the company's R&D transformation. He helped reshape Sanofi's discovery and development of therapeutics, focusing efforts on first and best in class medicines that have the potential to transform the practice of medicine and improve the lives of people with serious diseases, whilst managing the integration and development of new technology platforms and partnerships, and driving R&D productivity. On February 23, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl], previously referred to as efanesoctocog alfa, a first-in-class, high-sustained factor VIII replacement therapy. ALTUVIIIO is indicated for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment to control bleeding episodes, as well as perioperative management (surgery) for adults and children with hemophilia A. ALTUVIIIO is the first and only hemophilia A treatment that delivers normal to near-normal factor activity levels (over 40%) for most of the week with once-weekly dosing, and significantly reduces bleeds compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis.PART I ITEM 8.

The LEI number of the Company is 549300E9PC51EN656011. In this section, we summarize material information concerning our share capital, together with material provisions of applicable French law and our Articles of Association (statuts) , an English translation of which has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report. For a description of certain provisions of our Articles of Association relating to our Board of Directors and statutory auditors, see \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees\". You may obtain copies of our Articles of Association in French from the greffe (Clerk) of the Registre du Commerce et des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de Paris (Registry of Commerce and Companies of Paris, France, registration number: 395 030 844). Please refer to that full document for additional details. Our Articles of Association specify that our corporate affairs are governed by: Article 3 of our Articles of Association specifies that the Company's corporate purpose, in France and abroad, is: -and, more generally: all commercial, industrial, real or personal property, financial or other transactions, connected directly or indirectly, totally or partially, with the activities described above and with all similar or related activities and even with any other purposes likely to encourage or develop the Company's activities. Directors Transactions in which directors are materially interested Under French law, any agreement entered into (directly or through an intermediary) between our Company and any one of the members of the Board of Directors that is not entered into (i) in the ordinary course of our business and (ii) under normal conditions, is subject to the prior authorization of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. The same provision applies to agreements between our Company and another company if one of the members of the Board of Directors is the owner, general partner, manager, director, general manager or member of the executive or supervisory board of the other company, as well as to agreements in which one of the members of the Board of Directors has an indirect interest. The Board of Directors must also approve any undertaking taken by our Company for the benefit of our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) or his delegates (directeurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s) pursuant to which such persons will or may be granted compensation, benefits or any other advantages as a result of the termination of or a change in their offices or following such termination or change, in accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees \u2014 B. Compensation\" for a description of the process for establishing and authorizing such compensation policy. Directors' compensation The aggregate amount of compensation of the Board of Directors is determined at the Shareholders' Ordinary General Meeting. The Board of Directors then divides this aggregate amount among its members by a simple majority vote. In addition, the Board of Directors may grant exceptional compensation (r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations exceptionnelles) to individual directors on a case-by-case basis for special assignments following the procedures described above at \"\u2014 Transactions in which directors are materially Interested\". The Board of Directors may also authorize the reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, as well as other expenses incurred by Directors in the corporate interest. See also \"Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees.\" Furthermore, under our Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may compensate any observers (censeurs) to the Board of Directors, which would reduce by the same amount the total annual compensation available for allocation to the Board of Directors. Board of Directors' borrowing powers All loans or borrowings on behalf of the Company may be decided by the Board of Directors within the limits, if any, imposed by the Shareholders' Extraordinary General Meeting. There are currently no limits imposed on the amounts of loans or borrowings that the Board of Directors may approve.

Extraordinary corporate actions include: Special meetings of shareholders of a certain category of shares or shares with certain specific rights (such as shares with double voting rights) are required for any modification of the rights derived from that category of shares. The resolutions of the shareholders' general meeting affecting these rights are effective only after approval by the relevant special meeting.PART I ITEM 10.

This meeting must be held within six months of the end of each fiscal year. The Board of Directors may also convene an ordinary or extraordinary general shareholders' meeting upon proper notice at any time during the year. If the Board of Directors fails to convene a shareholders' meeting, our independent auditors may call the meeting. In case of bankruptcy, the liquidator or court-appointed agent may also call a shareholders' meeting in some instances. In addition, any of the following may request the court to appoint an agent for the purpose of calling a shareholders' meeting: Under our Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may take decisions by written consultation under the conditions permitted by law and as specified in the Board Charter (an English language version of which is reproduced in full as Exhibit 1.2 to this Annual Report on Form 20-F), including the possibility to convene an ordinary or extraordinary general meeting, Notice of shareholders' meetings All prior notice periods provided for below are minimum periods required by French law and cannot be shortened, except in case of a public tender offer for our shares. We must announce general meetings at least thirty-five days in advance by means of a preliminary notice (avis de r\u00e9union) , which is published in the Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoires , or BALO . The preliminary notice must first be sent to the French Financial markets authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers , the \"AMF\"), with an indication of the date on which it will be published in the BALO . It must be published on our website at least twenty-one days prior to the general meeting. The preliminary notice must contain, among other things, the agenda, a draft of the resolutions to be submitted to the shareholders for consideration at the general meeting and a detailed description of the voting procedures (proxy voting, electronic voting or voting by mail), the procedures permitting shareholders to submit additional resolutions or items to the agenda and to ask written questions to the Board of Directors. The AMF also recommends that, prior to or simultaneously with the publication of the preliminary notice, we publish a summary of the notice indicating the date, time and place of the meeting in a newspaper of national circulation in France and on our website. At least fifteen days prior to the date set for a first convening, and at least ten days prior to any second convening, we must send a final notice (avis de convocation) containing the final agenda, the date, time and place of the meeting and other information related to the meeting. Such final notice must be sent by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares in registered form for more than one month prior to the date of the final notice and by registered mail, if shareholders have asked for it and paid the corresponding charges. The final notice must also be published in a newspaper authorized to publish legal announcements in the local administrative department (d\u00e9partement) in which our Company is registered as well as in the BALO , with prior notice having been given to the AMF for informational purposes. Even if there are no proposals for new resolutions or items to be submitted to the shareholders at the meeting, we must publish a final notice in a newspaper authorized to publish legal announcements in the local administrative department (d\u00e9partement) in which our Company is registered as well as in the BALO . Other issues In general, shareholders can only take action at shareholders' meetings on matters listed on the agenda. As an exception to this rule, shareholders may take action with respect to the appointment and dismissal of directors even if this action has not been included on the agenda. Additional resolutions to be submitted for approval by the shareholders at the shareholders' meeting may be proposed to the Board of Directors, for recommendation to the shareholders at any time from the publication of the preliminary notice in the BALO until twenty-five days prior to the general meeting and in any case no later than twenty days following the publication of the preliminary notice in the BALO by: Within the same period, the shareholders may also propose additional items ( points ) to be submitted and discussed during the shareholders' meeting, without a shareholders' vote. The shareholders must substantiate the reasons for their proposals of additional items. The resolutions and the list of items added to the agenda of the shareholders' meeting must be promptly published on our website. The Board of Directors must submit the resolutions to a vote of the shareholders after having made a recommendation thereon. The Board of Directors may also comment on the items that are submitted to the shareholders' meeting.PART I ITEM 10.

The Board of Directors must respond to these questions during the meeting or may refer to a Q&A section located on our website in which the question submitted by a shareholder has already been answered. Attendance at shareholders' meetings; proxies and votes by mail In general, all shareholders may participate in general meetings either in person or by proxy. Shareholders may vote in person, by proxy or by mail. The right of shareholders to participate in general meetings is subject to the recording (inscription en compte) of their shares on the second business day, 12:00 a.m. (Paris time), preceding the general meeting: Attendance in person Any shareholder may attend ordinary general meetings and extraordinary general meetings and exercise its voting rights subject to the conditions specified in the French Commercial Code, the French Civil Code and our Articles of Association. An attendance sheet and written minutes are established for each shareholders' meeting; failure to do so could lead to cancellation of the decisions at the shareholders' meeting. Proxies and votes by mail Proxies are sent to any shareholder upon a request received between the publication of the final notice of meeting and six days before the general meeting and must be made available on our website at least twenty-one days before the general meeting. In order to be counted, such proxies must be received at our registered office, or at any other address indicated on the notice of the meeting or by any electronic mail indicated on the notice of the meeting, prior to the date of the meeting (in practice, we request that shareholders return proxies at least three business days prior to the meeting; electronic proxies must be returned before 3 p.m. Paris time, on the day prior to the general meeting). A shareholder may grant proxies to any natural person or legal entity. The agent may be required to disclose certain information to the shareholder or to the public. A proxy is only valid for one meeting (or by way of exception for two meetings, one being ordinary and the other extraordinary, held on the same day or within a single 15-day period); it remains valid in the event such meeting is convened multiple times for the same agenda, and may be revoked by written statement of the shareholder granting the proxy. Alternatively, the shareholder may send us a blank proxy without nominating any representative. In this case, the chairman of the meeting will vote the blank proxies in favor of all resolutions proposed or approved by the Board of Directors and against all others. With respect to votes by mail, we must send shareholders a voting form upon request or must make available a voting form on our website at least twenty-one days before the general meeting. The completed form must be returned to us at least three days prior to the date of the shareholders' meeting. For holders of registered shares, in addition to traditional voting by mail, instructions may also be given via the internet. Quorum The French Commercial Code requires that shareholders holding in the aggregate at least 20% of the shares entitled to vote must be present in person, or vote by mail or by proxy, in order to fulfill the quorum requirement for: For any other extraordinary general meeting the quorum requirement is at least 25% of the shares entitled to vote, held by shareholders present in person, voting by mail or by proxy. For a special meeting of holders of a certain category of shares, the quorum requirement is one third of the shares entitled to vote in that category, held by shareholders present in person, voting by mail or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at a meeting, the meeting is adjourned. However, only questions that were on the agenda of the adjourned meeting may be discussed and voted upon once the meeting resumes.PART I ITEM 10. Additional information 157 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022When an adjourned meeting is resumed, there is no quorum requirement for meetings cited in the first paragraph of this \"Quorum\" section. In the case of any other reconvened extraordinary general meeting or special meeting, the quorum requirement is 20% of the shares entitled to vote (or voting shares belonging to the relevant category for special meetings of holders of shares of such specific category), held by shareholders present in person or voting by mail or by proxy. If a quorum is not met, the reconvened meeting may be adjourned for a maximum of two months with the same quorum requirement. No deliberation or action by the shareholders may take place without a quorum. C. Material Contracts N/A D. Exchange Controls French exchange control regulations currently do not limit the amount of payments that we may remit to non-residents of France. Laws and regulations concerning foreign exchange controls do require, however, that all payments or transfers of funds made by a French resident to a non-resident be handled by an accredited intermediary. E. Taxation General The following generally summarizes the material French and US federal income tax consequences to US holders (as defined below) of purchasing, owning and disposing of our ADSs and ordinary shares (collectively the \"Securities\"). This discussion is intended only as a descriptive summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the purchase, ownership or disposition of our Securities. All of the following is subject to change. Such changes could apply retroactively and could affect the consequences described below. This summary does not constitute a legal opinion or tax advice. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of Securities in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any US federal, state, local or other national tax laws. A set of tax rules is applicable to French assets that are held by or in foreign trusts. These rules provide inter alia for the inclusion of trust assets in the settlor's net assets for purpose of applying the French real estate wealth tax, for the application of French gift and death duties to French assets held in trust, for a specific tax on capital on the French assets of foreign trusts not already subject to the French real estate wealth tax and for a number of French tax reporting and disclosure obligations. The following discussion does not address the French tax consequences applicable to Securities held in trusts. If Securities are held in trust, the grantor, trustee and beneficiary are urged to consult their own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities. The description of the French and US federal income tax consequences set forth below is based on the laws (including, for US federal income tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), final, temporary and proposed US Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof) in force as of the date of this annual report, the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital of August 31, 1994 (the \"Treaty\"), which entered into force on December 30, 1995 (as amended by any subsequent protocols, including the protocol of January 13, 2009), and the tax regulations issued by the French tax authorities within the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Imp\u00f4ts (the \"Regulations\") in force as of the date of this report. US holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits, especially with regard to the \"Limitations on Benefits\" provision, in light of their own particular circumstances. No advance ruling has been obtained with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Securities from either the French or US tax authorities. Thus, there can no assurances that either or both of such authorities will not take a position concerning said tax consequences different from that set out herein or that such a position would not be sustained by a court. For the purposes of this discussion, a US holder is a beneficial owner of Securities that is (i) an individual who is a US citizen or resident for US federal income tax purposes, (ii) a US domestic corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, including the District of Columbia, or (iii) certain estates or trusts that are subject to US tax jurisdiction. A non-US holder is a person other than a US holder. If a partnership holds Securities, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If a US holder is an estate or trust or partner in a partnership that holds Securities, the holder is urged to consult its own tax adviser regarding the specific tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Securities. This discussion is intended only as a general summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Securities to any particular investor, and does not discuss tax considerations that arise from rules of general application or that are generally assumed to be known by investors. The discussion applies only to investors that hold our Securities as capital assets that have the US dollar as their functional currency, that are entitled to Treaty benefits under the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision contained in the Treaty, and whose ownership of the Securities is not effectively connected to a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Certain holders (including, but notPART I ITEM 10. Additional information 158 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022limited to, US expatriates, partnerships or other entities classified as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, banks, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons who acquired the Securities pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation, persons that own (directly, indirectly or by attribution) 5% or more of our voting stock or 5% or more of our outstanding share capital, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that elect to mark their securities to market for US federal income tax purposes, persons that acquire ADSs in \"pre-release\" transactions (i.e. prior to deposit of the relevant ordinary shares, although our depositary has indicated that such transactions have been halted) and persons holding Securities as a position in a synthetic security, straddle or conversion transaction) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. Holders of Securities are advised to consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of French tax law and US federal tax law to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or other foreign jurisdiction. French taxes Estate and gift taxes and transfer taxes In general, a transfer of Securities by gift or by reason of death of a US holder that would otherwise be subject to French gift or inheritance tax, respectively, will not be subject to such French tax by reason of the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Estates, Inheritances and Gifts, dated November 24, 1978, unless the donor or the transferor is domiciled in France at the time of making the gift or at the time of his or her death, or the Securities were used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a business through a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France. Pursuant to Article 235 ter ZD of the French General Tax Code, purchases of Securities are subject to a 0.3% French tax on financial transactions (the \"FTFF\") provided that Sanofi's market capitalization exceeds \u20ac1 billion as of December 1 of the year preceding the taxation year. A list of companies whose market capitalization exceeds \u20ac1 billion as of December 1 of the year preceding the taxation year used to be published annually by the French Ministry of Economy. It is now published by the French tax authorities, and could be amended at any time. Pursuant to Regulations BOI-ANNX-000467-21/12/2022 issued on December 21, 2022, purchases of Sanofi's Securities in 2022 should be subject to the FTFF as the market capitalization of Sanofi exceeded \u20ac1 billion as of December 1, 2022. In accordance with Article 726-II-d of the French General Tax Code, purchases which are subject to the FTFF should however not be subject to transfer taxes (droits d'enregistrement) in France. Wealth tax The French wealth tax (imp\u00f4t de solidarit\u00e9 sur la fortune) has been replaced with a French real estate wealth tax (imp\u00f4t sur la fortune immobili\u00e8re) with effect from January 1, 2018. French real estate wealth tax applies only to individuals and does not generally apply to the Securities if the holder is a US resident, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, provided that the individual does not own directly or indirectly a shareholding exceeding 10% of the financial rights and voting rights. US taxes Ownership of the securities Deposits and withdrawals by a US holder of ordinary shares in exchange for ADSs, will not be taxable events for US federal income tax purposes. For US tax purposes, holders of ADSs will be treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by such ADSs. Accordingly, the discussion that follows regarding the US federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of ordinary shares is equally applicable to ADSs. Information reporting and backup withholding tax Distributions made to holders and proceeds paid from the sale, exchange, redemption or disposal of Securities may be subject to information reporting to the Internal Revenue Service. Such payments may be subject to backup withholding taxes unless the holder (i) is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provides a taxpayer identification number and certifies that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. Holders that are not US persons generally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, such a holder may be required to provide a certification of its non-US status in connection with payments received within the United States or through a US-related financial intermediary to establish that it is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder's US federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required information. Foreign asset reporting In addition, a US holder that is an individual (and, to the extent provided in future regulations, an entity), may be subject to recently-enacted reporting obligations with respect to ordinary shares and ADSs if the aggregate value of these and certain other \"specified foreign financial assets\" exceeds $50,000. If required, this disclosure is made by filing Form 8938 with the US Internal Revenue Service. Significant penalties can apply if holders are required to make this disclosure and fail to do so. In addition, a US holder should consider the possible obligation to file online a FinCEN Form 114 - Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report as a result of holding ordinary shares or ADSs. Holders are encouraged to consult their US tax advisors with respect to these and other reporting requirements that may apply to their acquisition of ordinary shares and ADSs.PART I ITEM 10. Additional information 159 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022State and local taxes In addition to US federal income tax, US holders of Securities may be subject to US state and local taxes with respect to such Securities. Holders of Securities are advised to consult their own tax advisers with regard to the application of US state and local income tax law to their particular situation. ADSs-Ordinary Shares French taxes Taxation of dividends Under French law, dividends paid by a French corporation, such as Sanofi, to non-residents of France are generally subject to French withholding tax at a rate of (i) 25% for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents (and 15% for distributions made to not-for-profit organizations with a head office in a Member State of the European Economic Area which would be subject to the tax regime set forth under article 206 paragraph 2 of the French General Tax Code if its head office were located in France and which meet the criteria set forth in the Regulations BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-30-10-70-24/12/2019, No. 130), and (ii) 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents. Dividends paid by a French corporation, such as Sanofi, towards non-cooperative States or territories, as defined in Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code, will generally be subject to French withholding tax at a rate of 75%, irrespective of the tax residence of the beneficiary of the dividends if the dividends are received in such States or territories; however, eligible US holders entitled to Treaty benefits under the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision contained in the Treaty who are US residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and who receive dividends in non-cooperative States or territories, will not be subject to this 75% withholding tax rate. Under the Treaty, the rate of French withholding tax on dividends paid to an eligible US holder who is a US resident as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty and whose ownership of the ordinary shares or ADSs is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base that such US holder has in France, is reduced to 15%, or to 5% if such US holder is a corporation and owns directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share capital of the issuing company; such US holder may claim a refund from the French tax authorities of the amount withheld in excess of the Treaty rates of 15% or 5%, if any. For US holders that are not individuals but are US residents, as defined pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, the requirements for eligibility for Treaty benefits, including the reduced 5% or 15% withholding tax rates contained in the \"Limitation on Benefits\" provision of the Treaty, are complicated, and certain technical changes were made to these requirements by the protocol of January 13, 2009. US holders are advised to consult their own tax advisers regarding their eligibility for Treaty benefits in light of their own particular circumstances. Dividends paid to an eligible US holder may immediately be subject to the reduced rates of 5% or 15% provided that such holder establishes before the date of payment that it is a US resident under the Treaty by completing and providing the depositary with a treaty form (Form 5000). Dividends paid to a US holder that has not filed the Form 5000 before the dividend payment date will be subject to French withholding tax at the rate of 25% and then reduced at a later date to 5% or 15%, provided that such holder duly completes and provides the French tax authorities with the treaty forms Form 5000 and Form 5001 before December 31 of the second calendar year following the year during which the dividend is paid. Pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are subject to the same general filing requirements as other US holders except that they may have to supply additional documentation evidencing their entitlement to these benefits. The depositary agrees to use reasonable efforts to follow the procedures established, or that may be established, by the French tax authorities (i) to enable eligible US holders to qualify for the reduced withholding tax rate provided by the Treaty, if available at the time the dividends are paid, or (ii) to recover any excess French withholding taxes initially withheld or deducted with respect to dividends and other distributions to which such US holders may be eligible from the French tax authorities and (iii) to recover any other available tax credits. In particular, associated forms (including Form 5000 and Form 5001, together with their instructions), will be made available by the depositary to all US holders registered with the depositary, and are also generally available from the US Internal Revenue Service. The withholding tax refund, if any, ordinarily is paid within 12 months of filing the applicable French Treasury Form, but not before January 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the related dividend is paid. Tax on sale or other disposition In general, under the Treaty, a US holder who is a US resident for purposes of the Treaty will not be subject to French tax on any capital gain from the redemption (other than redemption proceeds characterized as dividends under French domestic law), sale or exchange of ordinary shares or ADSs unless the ordinary shares or the ADSs form part of the business property of a permanent establishment or fixed base that the US holder has in France. Special rules apply to holders who are residents of more than one country.PART I ITEM 10. Additional information 160 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022US Taxes Taxation of dividends For US federal income tax purposes, the gross amount of any distribution paid to US holders (that is, the net distribution received plus any tax withheld therefrom) will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid or deemed paid out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of Sanofi (as determined under US federal income tax principles). Dividends paid by Sanofi will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to corporate US holders. Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the US dollar amount of dividends received by an individual US holder with respect to the ADSs or our ordinary shares is currently subject to taxation at a maximum rate of 20% if the dividends are \"qualified dividends\". Dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if (i) the issuer is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Internal Revenue Service has approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules and (ii) the issuer was not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (\"PFIC\"). The Treaty has been approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules. Based on our financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe Sanofi was not a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2021 taxable year. In addition, based on its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant market and shareholder data, we do not anticipate that Sanofi will become a PFIC for its 2022 taxable year. Holders of ordinary shares and ADSs should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances. If you are a US holder, dividend income received by you with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. Distributions out of earnings and profits with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares generally will be treated as \"passive category\" income (or, in the case of certain US holders, \"general category\" income). Subject to certain limitations, French income tax withheld in connection with any distribution with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares may be claimed as a credit against the US federal income tax liability of a US holder if such US holder elects for that year to credit all foreign income taxes. Alternatively, such French withholding tax may be taken as a deduction against taxable income. Foreign tax credits will not be allowed for withholding taxes imposed in respect of certain short-term or hedged positions in Securities and may not be allowed in respect of certain arrangements in which a US holder's expected economic profit is insubstantial. The US federal income tax rules governing the availability and computation of foreign tax credits are complex. US holders should consult their own tax advisers concerning the implications of these rules in light of their particular circumstances. To the extent that an amount received by a US holder exceeds the allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will be applied first to reduce such US holder's tax basis in its ordinary shares or ADSs and then, to the extent it exceeds the US holder's tax basis, it will constitute capital gain from a deemed sale or exchange of such ordinary shares or ADSs (see \"\u2014 Tax on Sale or Other Disposition\", below). The amount of any distribution paid in euros will be equal to the US dollar value of the euro amount distributed, calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is received by a US holder of ordinary shares (or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars on such date. US holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the treatment of foreign currency gain or loss, if any, on any euros received by a US holder that are converted into US dollars on a date subsequent to receipt. Distributions to holders of additional ordinary shares (or ADSs) with respect to their ordinary shares (or ADSs) that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all ordinary shareholders generally will not be subject to US federal income tax. However, if a US holder has the option to receive a distribution in shares (or ADSs) or to receive cash in lieu of such shares (or ADSs), the distribution of shares (or ADSs) will be taxable as if the holder had received an amount equal to the fair market value of the distributed shares (or ADSs), and such holder's tax basis in the distributed shares (or ADSs) will be equal to such amount. Tax on sale or other disposition In general, for US federal income tax purposes, a US holder that sells, exchanges or otherwise disposes of its ordinary shares or ADSs will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the US dollar value of the difference between the amount realized for the ordinary shares or ADSs and the US holder's adjusted tax basis (determined in US dollars and under US federal income tax rules) in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Such gain or loss generally will be US-source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder's holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year at the time of disposition. If the US holder is an individual, any capital gain generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates (currently a maximum of 20%) if specified minimum holding periods are met. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations. Medicare tax Certain US holders who are individuals, estates or trusts are required to pay a Medicare tax of 3.8% (in addition to taxes they would otherwise be subject to) on their \"net investment income\" which would include, among other things, dividends and capital gains from the ordinary shares and ADSs.PART I ITEM 10.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk(1) General policy Liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, as well as related counterparty risks, are managed centrally by our dedicated treasury team within the Group Finance Department. Where it is not possible to manage those risks centrally - in particular due to regulatory restrictions (such as foreign exchange controls) or local tax restrictions - credit facilities and/or currency lines, guaranteed whenever necessary by the parent company, are contracted by our subsidiaries locally with banks, under the supervision of the central treasury team. Our financing and investment strategies, and our interest rate and currency hedging strategies, are reviewed monthly by the Group Finance Department. Our policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. Counterparty risk Our financing and investing transactions, and our currency and interest rate hedges, are contracted with leading counterparties. We set limits for investment and derivative transactions with individual financial institutions, depending on the rating of each institution. Compliance with these limits, which are based on the notional amounts of the investments and the fair value of the hedging instruments, is monitored on a daily basis. The table below shows our total exposure as of December 31, 2022 by rating and in terms of our percentage exposure to the dominant counterparty.

Those instruments have low volatility, low sensitivity to interest rate risk, and a very low probability of loss of principal. The depositary banks of the mutual funds, and of Sanofi itself, have a long-term rating of at least A. Realization of counterparty risk could impact our liquidity in certain circumstances.PART I ITEM 11.

(b) The notional amounts are translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. (1)The disclosures in this section supplement those provided in Note B.8.7. to the consolidated financial statements as regards the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, and are covered by the independent registered public accounting firms' opinion on the consolidated financial statements.Foreign exchange risk A. Operating foreign exchange risk A substantial portion of our net sales is generated in countries where the euro, which is our reporting currency, is not the functional currency. In 2022, for example, 42.5% of our net sales were generated in the United States; 23.3% in Europe; and 34.2% in the Rest of the World region (see the definition in \"Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects \u2014 A/ Operating results), including countries that are, or may in the future become, subject to exchange controls, of which 7.3% was generated in China and 3.8% in Japan. Although we also incur expenses in those countries, the impact of those expenses is not enough wholly to offset the impact of exchange rates on our net sales. Consequently, our operating income may be materially affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other currencies. Sanofi operates a foreign exchange risk hedging policy to reduce the exposure of operating income to exchange rate movements. That policy involves regular assessments of Sanofi's worldwide foreign currency exposure, based on foreign currency transactions carried out by the parent company and its subsidiaries. Those transactions mainly comprise sales, purchases, research costs, co-marketing and co-promotion expenses, and royalties. To reduce the exposure of those transactions to exchange rate movements, Sanofi contracts hedges using liquid derivative instruments, mainly forward currency purchases and sales, and also foreign exchange swaps. The table below shows operating currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2022, with the notional amount translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting classification of those instruments as of December 31, 2022). Operating foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2022 The above positions mainly hedge future material foreign-currency cash flows arising after the end of the reporting period in relation to transactions carried out during the year ended December 31, 2022 and recognized in the balance sheet at that date. Gains and losses on hedging instruments (forward contracts) are calculated and recognized in parallel with the recognition of gains and losses on the hedged items. Due to this hedging relationship, the commercial foreign exchange profit or loss on these items (hedging instruments and hedged transactions) will be immaterial in 2022. B. Financial foreign exchange risk The cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone, and some of Sanofi's financing activities, expose certain Sanofi entities to financial foreign exchange risk (i.e. the risk of changes in the value of borrowings and loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrower or lender). That foreign exchange exposure is hedged using derivative instruments (foreign exchange swaps, forward contracts or currency swaps) that alter the currency split of Sanofi's net debt once those instruments are taken into account. The table below shows financial currency hedging instruments in place as of December 31, 2022, with the notional amounts translated into euros at the relevant closing exchange rate (see also Note D.20. to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting classification of these instruments as of December 31, 2022).PART I ITEM 11.

All such funds can be traded on a daily basis and the amount invested in each fund may not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount invested in such funds; amounts invested directly with banks and non-financial institutions in the form of instant access deposits, term deposits, and Negotiable European Commercial Paper with a maturity of no more than three months.These hedging instruments generate a net financial gain or loss arising from the interest rate differential between the hedged currency and the euro, given that the foreign exchange gain or loss on the foreign-currency borrowing and loans is offset by the change in the intrinsic value of the hedging instruments. The interest rate differential is recognized within cost of net debt (see Note D.29. to our consolidated financial statements). We may also hedge some future foreign-currency investment or divestment cash flows. C. Other foreign exchange risks A significant proportion of our net assets is denominated in US dollars (see Note D.35. to the consolidated financial statements). As a result, any fluctuation in the exchange rate of the US dollar against the euro automatically impacts the amount of our equity as expressed in euros. In addition, we use the euro as our reporting currency. Consequently, if one or more European Union Member States were to abandon the euro as a currency, the resulting economic upheavals - in particular, fluctuations in exchange rates - could have a significant impact on the terms under which we can obtain financing and on our financial results, the extent and consequences of which are not currently foreseeable. Liquidity risk We operate a centralized treasury platform whereby all surplus cash and financing needs of our subsidiaries are invested with or funded by the parent company (where permitted by local legislation). The central treasury department manages our current and projected financing, and ensures that Sanofi is able to meet its financial commitments by maintaining sufficient cash and confirmed credit facilities for the size of our operations and the maturity of our debt (see Notes D.17.1.c. and D.17.1.g. to the consolidated financial statements). We diversify our short-term investments with leading counterparties using money-market products with instant access or with a maturity of less than three months. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u20ac12,736 million, and short-term investments predominantly comprised: In addition, to optimize the liquidity/return profile of our short-term investments, we had \u20ac196 million invested in term deposits as of December 31, 2022, expiring in June 2023 and presented within \"Other current financial assets\" (see Note D.11.). As of December 31, 2022 we also had \u20ac8 billion of undrawn general corporate purpose confirmed credit facilities, half of which expires in December 2023 and half in December 2027.

In addition, our A-1+/P-1 short-term rating gives us access to commercial paper programs in the United States, and to Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. The average maturity of our total debt was 4.71 years as of December 31, 2022, compared with 5.5 years as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, we did not draw down on our Negotiable European Commercial Paper programs in France. Average drawdowns under the US commercial paper program during 2022 were \u20ac2.2 billion (with a maximum of \u20ac3.8 billion); the average maturity of those drawdowns was two months. As of December 31, 2022, neither of those programs was being utilized. In the event of a liquidity crisis, we could be exposed to difficulties in calling up our available cash, a scarcity of sources of funding including the above-mentioned programs, and/or a deterioration in their terms. This situation could damage our capacity to refinance our debt or to issue new debt on reasonable terms. Interest rate risk Sanofi issues debt in two currencies, the euro and the US dollar, and also invests its cash and cash equivalents in those currencies. Sanofi also operates cash pooling arrangements to manage the surplus cash and short-term liquidity needs of foreign subsidiaries located outside the euro zone. To optimize the cost of debt or reduce the volatility of debt and manage its exposure to financial foreign exchange risk, Sanofi uses derivative instruments (interest rate swaps, currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts) that alter the fixed/floating rate split and the currency split of its net debt. The projected full-year sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations of our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents for 2023 is as follows: Stock market risk It is our policy not to trade on the stock market for speculative purposes.PART I ITEM 11.

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in \"Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework\" (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, and can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit (PCAOB ID 1347) and Ernst & Young et Autres (PCAOB ID 1704) independent registered public accounting firms, as stated in their report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which is included herein.

Audit Committee Financial Expert The Audit Committee is composed of Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Christophe Babule, Carole Ferrand and Diane Souza. Our Board of Directors has determined that all directors are independent financial experts within the meaning of Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Board of Directors deemed Fabienne Lecorvaisier to be a financial expert based on her education and experience in corporate finance in various international banks and as Chief Financial Officer of Essilor and Air Liquide. She is now Executive Vice President, in charge of Sustainable Development, Public and International Affairs as well as the supervision of the Social Programs and the General Secretariat of Air Liquide Group. The Board of Directors deemed Christophe Babule to be a financial expert based on his education and experience in audit and corporate finance in major corporations and as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of L'Or\u00e9al. He has also served as a director of L'Or\u00e9al US Inc. The Board of Directors deemed Carole Ferrand to be a financial expert based on her education and experience in audit at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and as Chief Financial Officer of Sony France, EuropaCorp and Groupe Art\u00e9mis. She is now Chief Financial Officer of Capgemini. The Board of Directors deemed Diane Souza to be a financial expert based on her education (she is a certified public accountant) and experience in audit and tax in major international corporations, as Chief Financial Officer of Aetna's Guaranteed Products business, and as Chief Executive Officer of the UnitedHealthcare Specialty Benefits. The Board of Directors has determined that all four directors meet the independence criteria of US Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10A-3, although only Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Carole Ferrand and Diane Souza meet the French AFEP-MEDEF Code criteria of independence applied by the Board of Directors for general corporate governance purposes (see Item 16G., below).

Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant The terms of office of Ernst & Young et Autres, joint statutory auditor of the Company since 1986, will expire expire at the end of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting called in 2024. Ernst & Young et Autres' terms of office could not be legally extended as they had reached the maximum legal duration. The selection procedure of the auditors to be appointed by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2024 was overseen by the Audit Committee, following which a recommendation to the Board of Directors was issued. The Board of Directors, at its meeting of October 27, 2022 approved the Audit Committee's recommendation and decided to propose the appointment of Mazars as statutory auditor. Consequently, the Board of Directors will propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2024 to appoint Mazars as new joint statutory auditor for a 6-year term, i.e. until the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2030, which will approve the financial statements for the year 2029. The report of Ernst & Young et Autres on the consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: A copy of Ernst & Young et Autres' letter, dated February 24, 2023, is filed as Exhibit 23.1 to this Annual Report on Form 20-F. Item 16G. Corporate Governance Sanofi is incorporated under the laws of France, with securities listed on regulated public markets in the United States (Nasdaq Global Select Market - NASDAQ) and France (Euronext Paris). Consequently, as described further in this Annual Report on Form 20-F, our corporate governance framework reflects the mandatory provisions of French corporate law, the securities laws and regulations of France and the United States and the rules of the aforementioned public markets. As a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in the rules promulgated under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the \"Exchange Act\"), Sanofi is permitted, pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615(a)(3), to follow its home country practice in lieu of certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements applicable to US corporations listed on the NASDAQ. Sanofi has informed NASDAQ that it intends to follow corporate governance standards under French law to the extent permitted by the NASDAQ listing rules and US securities laws, as further discussed below. We generally follow the \"AFEP-MEDEF\" corporate governance recommendations for French listed issuers (hereafter referred to as the \"AFEP-MEDEF Code\"). As a result, our corporate governance framework is similar in many respects to, and provides investor protections that are comparable to - or in some cases, more stringent than - the corresponding rules of the NASDAQ. Nevertheless, there are certain important differences. In line with NASDAQ listing rules applicable to domestic issuers, a majority of Sanofi's Board of Directors is comprised of independent directors. Sanofi evaluates the independence of members of our Board of Directors using the standards of thePART II ITEM 16E.

(b) Millions of euros.French AFEP-MEDEF Code as the principal reference. We believe that AFEP-MEDEF's overarching criteria for independence - that Board members have no relationship of any kind whatsoever with the Company, its group or the management of either such as to color a Board member's judgment - is on the whole consistent with the goals of the NASDAQ's listing rules; however, the specific tests proposed under the two standards may vary on some points. Our Audit Committee complies with the independence and other requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our Audit Committee includes one member, Christophe Babule, who is considered non-independent under the AFEP-MEDEF Code, and which is permitted under the AFEP-MEDEF Code, although this would not be permitted under the listing rules of the NASDAQ for domestic issuers. Three out of the four members of our Compensation Committee meet the independence standards of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (the Director representing employees is not considered as independent) and the independence requirements of NASDAQ's listing rules. Sanofi follows the recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code that at least one meeting of the Board of Directors not attended by the company's executive officers be organized each year. Accordingly, Sanofi's Board Charter provides that the Board of Directors shall organize at least two meetings a year without its executive officers, thereby providing the Chairman with the option of whether to include directors representing employees or any other Group employee, as the case may require, depending on the agenda of the meeting. Sanofi's practice in that respect departs from NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(b)(2), which provides that independent directors must have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Under French law, the committees of our Board of Directors are advisory only, and where the NASDAQ Listing Rule 5600 series would vest certain decision-making powers with specific committees by delegation (e.g. the appointment of Sanofi's auditors by the Audit Committee), under French law, our Board of Directors remains the only competent body to take such decisions, albeit taking into account the recommendation of the relevant committees. Additionally, under French corporate law, it is the shareholders of Sanofi voting at the Shareholders' General Meeting that have the authority to appoint our auditors upon consideration of the proposal of our Board of Directors, although our Board Charter provides that the Board of Directors will make its proposal on the basis of the recommendation of our Audit Committee. We believe that this requirement of French law, together with the additional legal requirement that two sets of statutory auditors be appointed, is in line with the NASDAQ's underlying goal of ensuring that the audit of our accounts be conducted by auditors independent from company management. In addition to the oversight role of our Compensation Committee for questions of management compensation including by way of equity, under French law any option or restricted share plans or other share capital increases, whether for the benefit of senior management or employees, may only be adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to and within the limits of a shareholder resolution approving the related capital increase and delegating to the Board the authority to implement such operations. While NASDAQ rules require shareholder approval when a plan or other equity compensation arrangement is established or materially amended, under French law our shareholders must decide any issuance of equity, as a general matter. We intend to follow our French home country practice and ask our shareholders to delegate their authority to issue incentive equity and define the final terms of any equity compensation plan or arrangements to our Board of Directors. We may, from time to time, ask for our shareholders' subsequent approval on an equity compensation arrangement in order to obtain advantageous tax treatment or otherwise. In addition, under French law, our Board of Directors must obtain the prior approval of our shareholders before establishing or amending a plan or arrangement that would exceed the limits of the granted delegation. As described above, a number of issues, which could be resolved directly by a board or its committees in the United States, require the additional protection of direct shareholder consultation in France. Because we are a \"foreign private issuer\" as described above, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer issue the certifications required by Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 on an annual basis (with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 20-F) rather than on a quarterly basis as would be the case of a US corporation filing quarterly reports on Form 10- Q. French corporate law provides that the Board of Directors must vote to approve a broadly defined range of transactions that could potentially create conflicts of interest between Sanofi on the one hand and its directors and Chief Executive Officer on the other hand, which are then presented to shareholders for approval at the next annual meeting. This legal safeguard operates in place of certain provisions of the NASDAQ listing rules. Sanofi is governed by the French Commercial Code, which provides that an ordinary general meeting of the shareholders may validly deliberate when first convened if the shareholders present or represented hold at least one-fifth of the voting shares. If it is reconvened, no quorum is required. The French Commercial Code further provides that the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting may validly deliberate when first convened only if the shareholders present or represented hold at least one- quarter of the voting shares and, if reconvened, one-fifth of the voting shares. Therefore, Sanofi will not follow NASDAQ's Listing Rule 5620(c), which provides that the minimum quorum requirement for a meeting of shareholders is 3313% of the outstanding common voting shares of the company. In accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code, the required majority for the adoption of a decision is a simple majority (for an ordinary general meeting of the shareholders) or a two-thirds majority (for an extraordinary general meeting) of the votes cast by the shareholders present or represented. The Company intends, in accordance with Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act, to introduce a recovery policy for compensation erroneously paid to \"executive officers\" (as defined in Section 10D-1(d) of the Exchange Act) based in whole or in part on any financial reporting measures, at such time as required by the applicable NASDAQ listing rules, Section 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and applicable interpretive guidance.PART II ITEM 16G.

Financial Statements 174 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sanofi, Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanofi and its subsidiaries (together the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as endorsed by the European Union. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are public accounting firms registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.2022 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms 175 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Recoverable amount of other intangible assets Description of the MatterOther intangible assets amounted to \u20ac21,640 million at December 31, 2022. Management recognized a net gain of \u20ac454 million relating to impairment charges and reversals for the year ended December 31, 2022. As described in Notes B.6.1., D.4. and D.5. to the consolidated financial statements, other intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment might exist. Other intangible assets that generate separate cash flows and assets included in cash-generating units (CGUs) are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset or CGU may be impaired. Management estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. Value in use is determined by management using estimated future cash flows generated by the asset or CGU which are discounted and prepared using the same methods as those used in the initial measurement of the assets and on the basis of medium-term strategic plans. Management cash flow projections include significant assumptions related to mid and long-term sales forecasts; perpetual growth or attrition rate, where applicable; discount rate; and probability of success of current research and development projects. Valuation of the provisions for rebates relating to Sanofi's business in the United States - Medicaid, Medicare and Managed Care Description of the MatterAs described in Notes B.13.1. and D.23. to the consolidated financial statements, products sold in the United States are covered by various Government and State programs (of which Medicaid and Medicare are the most significant) and are subject to commercial agreements with healthcare authorities and certain customers and distributors. Estimates of discounts and rebates incentives (hereinafter the \"Rebates\") to be provided to customers under those arrangements are recognized as a reduction of gross sales in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized. Provisions for the Medicaid, Medicare and Managed Care Rebates amounted to \u20ac1,307 million, \u20ac775 million and \u20ac934 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The Rebates estimated by management are based on the nature and patient profile of the underlying product; the applicable regulations or the specific terms and conditions of contracts with governmental authorities, wholesalers and other customers; historical data relating to similar contracts; past experience and sales growth trends for the same or similar products; actual inventory levels in distribution channels, monitored by Sanofi using internal sales data and externally provided data; market trends including competition, pricing and demand.2022 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms 176 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The principal considerations for our determination that auditing the recoverable amount of other intangible assets is especially challenging, subjective, and required complex auditor judgment related to the significant judgments made by management when developing the significant assumptions utilized in the future cash flow projections as described above. How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management's other intangible assets impairment assessment, including controls over the significant assumptions used in the impairment testing of the other intangible assets. These audit procedures also included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management as described above. Evaluating management's assumptions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable by considering the current and past performance of other intangible assets in comparison to management's previous forecasts and current trends, the consistency of certain assumptions with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit such as internal company communications and presentations and external communications. We involved our professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist us notably in the assessment of the discount rate used by management. The principal considerations for our determination that auditing the provisions for Rebates relating to the Company's business in the United States is especially challenging and required complex auditor judgment related to the significant judgment by management due to significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these provisions. These provisions are estimated based on multiple factors as described above. How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management's estimates of the provisions for Rebates relating to the Company's business in the United States, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these Rebates. These procedures also included, among others, developing an independent estimate of the provisions for Rebates by utilizing third party data on inventory levels in distribution channels, volume, changes to price, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid. The independent estimate was compared to the provisions recorded by the Company. Additionally, these procedures included testing actual rebate claims paid and evaluating the contractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements. Provisions for product liability risks, litigation and other and contingent liabilities Description of the MatterProvisions for product liability risks, litigation and other risks were recorded in an amount of \u20ac1,652 million at December 31, 2022. As described in Notes B.12., D.19.3. and D.22. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records such provisions when an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the outflow can be reliably estimated. The Company also discloses the contingent liabilities in circumstances where management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash outflow is not probable. Th e pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated, which increases the inherent risk of litigation and arbitration. The Company is involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings are typically related to litigation concerning product liability claims, intellectual property rights, competition law and trade practices, as well as claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestments. The issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject to substantial uncertainties; therefore, the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. Uncertain tax positions Description of the MatterAs described in Notes B.22. and D.19.4. to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions of \u20ac1,520 million at December 31, 2022. The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions, carrying out potentially complex transactions that require management to make judgments and estimates as to the tax impact of those transactions. The positions adopted by the Company in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Some of those positions may be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, the Company assesses the amount of the tax liability on the basis of the following assumptions: that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities on the basis of all relevant information; that a technical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, and established practice; and that each position is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions. Those assumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reporting period. When an uncertain tax liability is regarded as probable, it is measured on the basis of the Company's best estimate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit /s/ Ernst & Young et Autres Ernst & Young et Autres and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit have served as the Company's auditors since 1986 and 1999, respectively. Neuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, France, February 24, 20232022 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms 177 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The principal considerations for our determination that auditing the provision for product liability risks, litigation and other, and auditing the contingent liabilities is especially challenging, subjective and required complex auditor judgment resulted from the determination that the measurement of the provisions can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions by management. There is inherent uncertainty related to these cases and in estimating the likelihood and outcome of the cases. How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of the provisions for product liability risks, litigation and other, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as the need for and the level of financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsels, evaluating management's assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable through the evaluation of the legal letters and summaries of the proceedings and lawsuit correspondence. We also evaluated the Company's disclosures for contingent liabilities. The principal considerations for our determination that auditing uncertain tax positions is especially challenging, subjective and required complex auditor judgment related to the significant judgment by management when determining the liability for uncertain tax positions, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty of certain assumptions and interpretations of the tax laws and regulations underlying the positions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the process and assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of the liability for uncertain tax positions, management's assessment and interpretation of tax laws and its evaluation of which tax positions may not be sustained upon audit and controls over measurement of the liability. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions and evaluating the assumptions used by management when determining its tax positions, the status of tax audits and investigations, and the potential impact of past claims. Our tax professionals assisted in evaluating management's assessments by comparing the positions taken by management with tax regulations and past decisions from tax authorities and where applicable, evaluating opinions from the Company's external tax advisors. We also evaluated the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements concerning uncertain tax positions.Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sanofi, Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Sanofi and its subsidiaries' (together the \"Company\") internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \"COSO criteria\"). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). Our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are public accounting firms registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit /s/ Ern st & Young et Autres Neuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, France, February 24, 20232022 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms 178 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of thecompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) providereasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company'sassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.A/Basis of preparation F-10 B/Summary of significant accounting policies F-13 C/Principal alliances F D/Presentation of the financial E/Principal accou ntants' fees and services F-98 F/List of included in the consolidation during 2022 F-99 G/Events subsequ ent to December 31, 2022 F-1022022 Consolidated financial statements The financial statements are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Sanofi is listed in Paris (Euronext: SAN) and New York (Nasdaq: SNY). The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the notes thereto, were signed off by the Sanofi Board of Directors on February 23, 2023. A/ Basis of preparation A.1. International financial reporting standards (IFRS) The consolidated financial statements cover the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. In accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and Council of July 19, 2002 on the application of international accounting standards, Sanofi has presented its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS since January 1, 2005. The term \"IFRS\" refers collectively to international accounting and financial reporting standards (IASs and IFRSs) and to interpretations of the interpretations committees (SIC and IFRIC) with mandatory application as of December 31, 2022. The consolidated financial statements of Sanofi as of December 31, 2022 have been prepared in compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with IFRS as endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2022. IFRS as endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2022 are available under the heading \"IFRS Financial Statements\" via the following web link: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS general principles of fair presentation, going concern, accrual basis of accounting, consistency of presentation, materiality, and aggregation. A.2. New standards, amendments and interpretations A.2.1. New standards applicable from January 1, 2022 The following amendments are applicable from January 1, 2022, and have had no material impact: \"Reference to the Conceptual Framework\" (amendment to IFRS before Intended Use\" (amendment to IAS 16); \"Onerous Contracts \u2014 Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\" (amendment to IAS 37); and \"Annual Improvements to IFRS standards 2018-2020\". As a reminder, Sanofi adopted in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 the IFRS IC final agenda decision (published in the March 2021 IFRS IC update) clarifying how to account for costs of configuring or customising a supplier's application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement, which requires such costs to be recognized as an expense. A.2.2. New pronouncements issued by the IASB and applicable from 2023 or later This note describes standards, amendments and interpretations issued by the IASB that will have mandatory application in 2023 or subsequent years, and Sanofi's position regarding future application. On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued \"Disclosure of Accounting Policies\", an amendment to IAS 1, and \"Definition of Accounting Estimates\", an amendment to IAS 8. On May 7, 2021, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 12, relating to deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction. Sanofi does not expect a material impact from those amendments, which are applicable at the earliest from January 1, 2023, and will not early adopt them. On September 22, 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 (Leases), relating to lease liabilities in a sale-and-leaseback arrangement, which is applicable at the earliest from January 1, 2024 (subject to endorsement by the European Union); it will not have a material impact on the Sanofi financial statements, and Sanofi will not early adopt it. On January 23, 2020, the IASB issued \"Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\", an amendment to IAS 1, and then on October 31, 2022 issued \"Non-current Liabilities with Covenants\", a further amendment to IAS 1. The amendments are applicable at the earliest from January 1, 2024 (subject to endorsement by the European Union); they will not have a material impact on the Sanofi financial statements, and Sanofi will not early adopt them.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-10 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022https://www.efrag.org/Endorsement.amounts deducted from sales for projected sales returns, chargeback incentives, rebates and price reductions (see Notes B.13. and D.23.); impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (see Notes B.6. and D.5.); the valuation of goodwill and the valuation and estimated useful life of acquired intangible assets (see Notes B.3.2., B.4., D.4. and D.5.); the measurement of contingent consideration receivable in connection with asset divestments (see Notes B.8.5. and D.12.) and of contingent consideration payable (see Notes B.3. and D.18.); the measurement of financial assets at amortized cost (see Note B.8.5.); the amount of post-employment benefit obligations (see Notes B.23. and D.19.1.); the amount of liabilities or provisions for restructuring, litigation, tax risks relating to corporate income taxes, and environmental risks (see Notes B.12., B.19., B.20., D.19. and D.22.); and the amount of deferred tax assets resulting from tax losses available for carry-forward and deductible temporary differences (see Notes B.22. and D.14.).IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts), issued on May 18, 2017 and applicable on or after January 1, 2023, will not apply to the Sanofi consolidated financial statements because the insurance activities carried on by Sanofi's captive insurance companies are internal within the Sanofi group (the sole policyholders being subsidiaries of Sanofi), and hence are eliminated on consolidation. A.3. Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements requires management to make reasonable estimates and assumptions based on information available at the date of the finalization of the financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements, and disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities as of the date of the review of the financial statements. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: Actual results could differ from these estimates. A.4. Hyperinflation In 2022, Sanofi continued to account for subsidiaries based in Venezuela using the full consolidation method, on the basis that the criteria for control as specified in IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements) are still met. In 2018, following changes to the Venezuelan foreign exchange system, the \"DICOM\" rate was replaced by the \"PETRO\" rate (with a floating US dollar/bolivar parity) and the strong bolivar (\"VEF\") was replaced by the sovereign bolivar (\"VES\"), reflecting a 1-for-100,000 devaluation. Finally, in October 2021 a new currency called the \"Digital Bolivar\" (VED) was introduced at a rate of 1 VED to 1,000,000 sovereign bolivars. Consequently, the contribution of the Venezuelan subsidiaries to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial. In Argentina, the cumulative rate of inflation over the last three years is in excess of 100%, based on a combination of indices used to measure inflation in that country. Consequently, Sanofi has since July 1, 2018 treated Argentina as a hyperinflationary economy and has applied IAS 29. The impact of the resulting restatements is immaterial at Sanofi group level. Since the beginning of 2022, inflation in Turkey has increased significantly and the cumulative inflation rate over the past three years has been above 100% since the end of February 2022. Qualitative indicators following the deterioration of the economic situation and exchange controls also support the consensus conclusion that Turkey is a hyperinflationary country from 2022. Consequently, Sanofi has since January 1, 2022 treated Turkey as a hyperinflationary economy and has applied IAS 29. The impact of the resulting restatements is immaterial at Sanofi group level. A.5. Agreements relating to the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi in collaboration with GSK On February 18, 2020, Sanofi and the US Department of Health and Human Services extended their research and development partnership to leverage Sanofi's previous development work on a SARS vaccine to attempt to unlock a fast path forward for developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Under the terms of the collaboration, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within the US Department of Health and Human Services, is helping to fund the research and development undertaken by Sanofi. On April 14, 2020, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) entered into a collaboration agreement to develop a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate, with Sanofi contributing its S- protein COVID-19 antigen (based on recombinant DNA technology) and GSK contributing its pandemic adjuvant technology. Sanofi is leading clinical development and the registration process for the vaccine. On July 31, 2020, the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Sanofi in collaboration with GSK was selected by the US government's Operation Warp Speed (OWS) program. Under the OWS, the US government is providing funds to support further development of the vaccine, including clinical trials and scaling-up of manufacturing capacity. Initially, the agreement also provided for the supply of 100 million doses of the vaccine, with payment due at the time vaccine doses are provided. Sanofi has recognized the funding received from the US government as a deduction from the development expenses incurred, in accordance with IAS 20 (Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance).NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-11 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The amount of government aid received from the US federal government and BARDA and recognized as a deduction from development expenses and other operating expenses was \u20ac265 million in 2022, compared with \u20ac147 million in 2021 and an immaterial amount in 2020. In September 2020, Sanofi and GSK signed pre-order contracts with the Canadian and UK governments and with the European Union for doses of the vaccine candidate. During 2021, Sanofi and GSK contractualized with the Canadian and UK governments and with the European Union on the number of doses ordered. On December 15, 2021, Sanofi and GSK announced positive preliminary data on their COVID-19 booster vaccine candidate and indicated that their Phase III trial was to continue, based on recommendations from an independent monitoring board. On November 10, 2022, in line with the positive opinion issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency, the European Commission approved VidPrevtyn \u00ae Beta vaccine as booster for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 years and older. Designed to provide broad protection against multiple variants, this protein-based COVID-19 booster vaccine is based on the Beta variant antigen and includes GSK's pandemic adjuvant. VidPrevtyn \u00ae Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunization against SARS-CoV-2 in adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine. On December 21, 2022, following the European Commission approval, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved VidPrevtyn \u00ae Beta vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults aged 18 and over within the UK. As of December 31, 2022, there had been no material change in the commitments entered into by the United States in 2020, or in the pre-order arrangements with Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In accordance with IFRS 15 (see Note B.13.1.), Sanofi recognizes revenue when control over the product is transferred to the customer (for vaccines, transfer of control is determined by reference to the terms of release and acceptance of batches of vaccine). Payments received subsequent to signature of vaccine pre-order contracts relating to doses not yet delivered are customer contract liabilities (i.e. an obligation for the entity to supply goods to a customer, for which consideration has been received from the customer). They are presented within \"Customer contract liabilities\" in the balance sheet (see Note D.19.5.), and within \"Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities\" in the statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, customer contract liabilities amounted to \u20ac264 million, compared with \u20ac319 million as of December 31, 2021 (see Note D.19.5., \" Current provisions and other current liabilities\" ). The portion of the December 31, 2021 balance recognized in profit or loss during 2022 was \u20ac85 million (no amounts were recognized in profit or loss during 2021). A.6. Effects of climate change Risks associated with climate change as assessed to date, and the commitments made by Sanofi on carbon neutrality and cutting greenhouse gas emissions, do not have a material impact on the financial statements. Risks associated with trends in carbon costs, raw material shortages, supply chain disruption, etc. have been taken into account in the measurement of assets and liabilities. A.7. War in Ukraine The conflict triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 led to the imposition of sanctions by the European Union and other countries. While complying with those sanctions inherent to its operations, Sanofi continues to carry on commercial and industrial activities in Russia under its direct control so as to meet patient needs. In 2022, Sanofi generated net sales of \u20ac674 million in Russia (compared with \u20ac575 million in 2021 and \u20ac641 million in 2020), representing 1.6% of consolidated net sales. The conflict had no material direct or indirect impact on the financial statements ended December 31, 2022. Sanofi will continue to monitor the situation, and will update its estimates and assumptions accordingly.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-12 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022B/ Summary of significant accounting policies B.1. Basis of consolidation In accordance with IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements), the consolidated financial statements of Sanofi include the financial statements of entities that Sanofi controls directly or indirectly, regardless of the level of the equity interest in those entities. An entity is controlled when Sanofi has power over the entity, exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In determining whether control exists, potential voting rights must be taken into account if those rights are substantive, in other words they can be exercised on a timely basis when decisions about the relevant activities of the entity are to be taken. Entities consolidated by Sanofi are referred to as \"subsidiaries\". Entities that Sanofi controls by means other than voting rights are referred to as \"consolidated structured entities\". In accordance with IFRS 11 (Joint Arrangements), Sanofi classifies its joint arrangements (i.e. arrangements in which Sanofi exercises joint control with one or more other parties) either as a joint operation (in which case, Sanofi recognizes the assets and liabilities of the operation in proportion to its rights and obligations relating to those assets and liabilities) or as a joint venture. Sanofi exercises joint control over a joint arrangement when decisions relating to the relevant activities of the arrangement require the unanimous consent of Sanofi and the other parties with whom control is shared. Sanofi exercises significant influence over an entity when it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of that entity, but does not have the power to exercise control or joint control over those policies. In accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), the equity method is used to account for joint ventures (i.e. entities over which Sanofi exercises joint control) and for associates (i.e. entities over which Sanofi exercises significant influence). Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost, and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the net assets of the associate or joint venture. IAS 28 does not specify the treatment to be adopted on first-time application of the equity method to an investee following a step acquisition. Consequently, by reference to paragraph 10 of IAS 28, Sanofi has opted to apply the cost method, whereby the carrying amount of the investment represents the sum of the historical cost amounts for each step in the acquisition. As of the date on which the equity method is first applied, goodwill (which is included in the carrying amount of the investment) is determined for each acquisition step. The same applies to subsequent increases in the percentage interest in the equity-accounted investment. When the criteria of IFRS 5 are met, Sanofi recognizes the equity interest within the balance sheet line item Assets held for sale or exchange . The equity method is not applied to equity interests that are classified as held-for-sale assets. Transactions between consolidated companies are eliminated, as are intragroup profits.A list of the principal companies included in the consolidation in 2022 is presented in Note F. B.2. Foreign currency translation B.2.1. Accounting for foreign currency transactions in the financial statements of consolidated entities Non-current assets (other than receivables) and inventories acquired in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the acquisition date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. The gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in the income statement. However, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of advances between consolidated subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future are recognized in equity, in the line item Change in currency translation differences. B.2.2. Foreign currency translation of the financial statements of foreign entities Sanofi presents its consolidated financial statements in euros (\u20ac). In accordance with IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates), each subsidiary accounts for its transactions in the currency that is most representative of its economic environment (the functional currency). All assets and liabilities are translated into euros using the exchange rate of the subsidiary's functional currency prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income statements are translated using a weighted average exchange rate for the period, except in the case of foreign subsidiaries in a hyperinflationary economy. The resulting currency translation difference is recognized as a separate component of equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and is recognized in the income statement only when the subsidiary is sold or is wholly or partially liquidated.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-13 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022acquisition-related costs are recognized as an expense, as a component of Operating income ; contingent consideration is recognized in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery of a fixed number of the acquirer's equity instruments; otherwise, it is recognized in Liabilities related to business combinations . Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the probability of payment. If the contingent consideration was originally recognized as a financial liability, subsequent adjustments to the liability are recognized in profit or loss in the line item Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration , unless the adjustment is made within the twelve months following the acquisition date and relates to facts and circumstances existing as of that date; goodwill may be calculated on the basis of either (i) the entire fair value of the acquiree, or (ii) a share of the fair value of the acquiree proportionate to the interest acquired. This option is elected for each acquisition individually.B.3. Business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests B.3.1. Accounting for business combinations, transactions with non-controlling interests and loss of control Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) and IFRS 10 (Consolidated Financial Statements). Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition, except for (i) non-current assets classified as held for sale (which are measured at fair value less costs to sell) and (ii) assets and liabilities that fall within the scope of IAS 12 (Income Taxes) and IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Restructuring liabilities are recognized as a liability of the acquiree only if the acquiree has an obligation as of the acquisition date to carry out the restructuring. The principal accounting rules applicable to business combinations and transactions with non-controlling interests include: Purchase price allocations are performed under the responsibility of management, with assistance from an independent valuer in the case of major acquisitions. IFRS 3 does not specify an accounting treatment for contingent consideration arising from a business combination made by an entity prior to the acquisition of control in that entity and carried as a liability in the acquired entity's balance sheet. The accounting treatment applied by Sanofi to such a liability is to measure it at fair value as of the acquisition date and to report it in the line item Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests , with subsequent remeasurements recognized in profit or loss. This treatment is consistent with the accounting applied to contingent consideration in the books of the acquirer. Finally, management may where it deems fit elect to apply the optional test to identify concentration of fair value permitted under IFRS 3 in order to determine whether a transaction is a business combination within the meaning of IFRS 3, or merely the acquisition of an asset or of a group of similar assets. B.3.2. Goodwill The excess of the cost of an acquisition over Sanofi's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree is recognized as goodwill at the date of the business combination. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is shown in a separate balance sheet line item, whereas goodwill arising on the acquisition of investments accounted for using the equity method is recorded in Investments accounted for using the equity method. Goodwill arising on foreign operations is expressed in the functional currency of the country concerned and translated into euros using the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period. In accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment (see Note B.6.). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment might exist. Such events or circumstances include significant changes more likely than not to have an other-than-temporary impact on the substance of the original investment. B.4. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are initially measured at acquisition cost or production cost, including any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use, or (in the case of assets acquired in a business combination) at fair value as of the date of the business combination. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives. The useful lives of other intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The effect of any adjustment to useful lives is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Amortization of other intangible assets is recognized in the income statement within Amortization of intangible assets except for amortization charged against (i) acquired or internally-developed software and (ii) other rights of an industrial or operational nature, which is recognized in the relevant classification of expense by function.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-14 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Sanofi does not own any intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, other than goodwill. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment, if any, in accordance with IAS 36 (see Note B.6.). B.4.1. Research and development not acquired in a business combination Internally generated research and development Under IAS 38, research expenses are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. Internally generated development expenses are recognized as an intangible asset if, and only if, all the following six criteria can be demonstrated: Due to the risks and uncertainties relating to regulatory approval and to the research and development process, the six criteria for capitalization are usually considered not to have been met until the product has obtained marketing approval from the regulatory authorities. Consequently, internally generated development expenses arising before marketing approval has been obtained, mainly the cost of clinical trials, are generally expensed as incurred within Research and development expenses . Some industrial development expenses (such as those incurred in developing a second-generation synthesis process) are incurred after marketing approval has been obtained, in order to improve the industrial process for an active ingredient. To the extent that the six IAS 38 criteria are considered as having been met, such expenses are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet within Other intangible assets as incurred. Similarly, some clinical trials, for example those undertaken to obtain a geographical extension for a molecule that has already obtained marketing approval in a major market, may in certain circumstances meet the six capitalization criteria under IAS 38, in which case the related expenses are recognized as an asset in the balance sheet within Other intangible assets . Separately acquired research and development Payments for separately acquired research and development are capitalized within Other intangible assets provided that they meet the definition of an intangible asset: a resource that is (i) controlled by Sanofi, (ii) expected to provide future economic benefits for Sanofi, and (iii) identifiable (i.e. it is either separable or arises from contractual or legal rights). Under paragraph 25 of IAS 38, the first condition for capitalization (the probability that the expected future economic benefits from the asset will flow to the entity) is considered to be satisfied for separately acquired research and development. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties related to pharmaceutical products for which marketing approval has not yet been obtained are recognized as intangible assets, and amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives beginning when marketing approval is obtained. Payments under research and development arrangements relating to access to technology or to databases, and payments made to purchase generics dossiers, are also capitalized, and amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset. Subcontracting arrangements, payments for research and development services, and continuous payments under research and development collaborations which are unrelated to the outcome of that collaboration, are expensed over the service term. B.4.2. Other intangible assets not acquired in a business combination Licenses other than those related to pharmaceutical products and research projects, in particular software licenses, are capitalized at acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the software for its intended use. Software licenses are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives for Sanofi (three to five years). Internally generated costs incurred to develop or upgrade software are capitalized if the IAS 38 recognition criteria are satisfied, and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software from the date on which the software is ready for use. B.4.3. Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination (in-process research and development, technology platforms, and currently marketed products) that are reliably measurable are identified separately from goodwill, measured at fair value, and capitalized within Other intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) and IAS 38 (Intangible Assets). The related deferred tax liability is also recognized if a deductible or taxable temporary difference exists. In-process research and development acquired in a business combination is amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life from the date of receipt of marketing approval. Rights to technology platforms and to products currently marketed by Sanofi are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives, determined (in particular for marketed products) on the basis of cash flow forecasts which take into account the patent protection period of the marketed product.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-15 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022 (a) the technical feasibility of completing the development project; (b) Sanofi's intention to complete the project; (c) Sanofi's ability to use the project; (d) the probability that the project will generate future economic benefits; (e) the availabilityof adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the project; and (f) the ability to measure the developmentexpenditure reliably.B.5. Property, plant and equipment owned and leased B.5.1. Property, plant and equipment owned Property, plant and equipment is initially measured and recognized at acquisition cost, including any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use, or (in the case of assets acquired in a business combination) at fair value as of the date of the business combination. The component-based approach to accounting for property, plant and equipment is applied. Under this approach, each component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost which is significant in relation to the total cost of the item and which has a different useful life from the other components must be depreciated separately. After initial measurement, property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, except for land which is carried at cost less impairment. Subsequent costs are not recognized as assets unless (i) it is probable that future economic benefits associated with those costs will flow to Sanofi and (ii) the costs can be measured reliably. Borrowing costs attributable to the financing of items of property, plant and equipment, and incurred during the construction period, are capitalized as part of the acquisition cost of the item. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset to which they relate. The depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment, net of any residual value, is depreciated on a straight line basis over the useful life of the asset. The useful life of an asset is usually equivalent to its economic life. The customary useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Buildings 15 to 40 years Fixtures 10 to 20 years Machinery and equipment 5 to 15 years Other 3 to 15 years Useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually. The effect of any adjustment to useful lives or residual values is recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an expense in the income statement, in the relevant classification of expense by function. B.5.2. Property, plant and equipment leased Effective from January 1, 2019 leases contracted by Sanofi have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 (Leases). Sanofi recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all of its lease contracts, except for (i) leases relating to low-value assets and (ii) short-term leases (12 months or less). Payments made in respect of leases not recognized on the balance sheet are recognized as an operating expense on a straight line basis over the lease term. On commencement of a lease, the liability for future lease payments is discounted at the incremental borrowing rate, which is a risk-free rate adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of each Sanofi entity. Because lease payments are spread over the lease term, Sanofi applies a discount rate based on the duration of those payments. The payments used to determine the liability for future lease payments exclude non-lease components, but include fixed payments that Sanofi expects to make to the lessor over the estimated lease term. After commencement of the lease, the liability for future lease payments is reduced by the amount of the lease payments made, and increased to reflect interest on the liability. In the event of a reassessment or modification of future lease payments, the lease liability is remeasured. The right-of-use asset - which is initially measured at cost including direct costs of the lessee, prepayments made at or prior to the commencement date, less lease incentives received and restoration costs - is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term, and tested for impairment as required. Sanofi recognizes deferred taxes in respect of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their economic life, which is capped at the lease term as determined under IFRS 16. B.6. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments accounted for using the equity method B.6.1. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets In accordance with IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets), assets that generate separate cash flows and assets included in cash-generating units (CGUs) are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset or CGU may be impaired. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-16 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022the appropriate level of management must be committed to a plan to sell; an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated; the asset must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value;Under IAS 36, each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must (i) represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and (ii) not be larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), before application of the IFRS 8 aggregation criteria (see Note B.26.). Quantitative and qualitative indications of impairment (primarily relating to the status of the research and development portfolio, pharmacovigilance, patent litigation, and the launch of competing products) are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. If there is any internal or external indication of impairment, Sanofi estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU. Other intangible assets not yet available for use (such as capitalized in-process research and development), and CGUs or groups of CGUs that include goodwill, are tested for impairment annually whether or not there is any indication of impairment, and more frequently if any event or circumstance indicates that they might be impaired. Such assets are not amortized. When there is an internal or external indication of impairment, Sanofi estimates the recoverable amount of the asset and recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. To determine value in use, Sanofi uses estimates of future cash flows generated by the asset or CGU, prepared using the same methods as those used in the initial measurement of the asset or CGU on the basis of medium-term strategic plans. In the case of goodwill, estimates of future cash flows are based on a six-year strategic plan and a terminal value. In the case of other intrangible assets, the period used is based on the economic life of the asset. Estimated cash flows are discounted at long-term market interest rates that reflect the best estimate by Sanofi of the time value of money, the risks specific to the asset or CGU, and economic conditions in the geographical regions in which the business activity associated with the asset or CGU is located. Certain assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to a specific CGU are allocated between CGUs on a basis that is reasonable, and consistent with the allocation of the corresponding goodwill. Impairment losses arising on property, plant and equipment, on software and on certain rights are recognized in the relevant classification of expense by function. Impairment losses arising on other intangible assets are recognized within Impairment of intangible assets in the income statement. B.6.2. Impairment of investments accounted for using the equity method In accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), Sanofi determines whether investments accounted for using the equity method may be impaired based on indicators such as default in contractual payments, significant financial difficulties, probability of bankruptcy, or a prolonged or significant decline in quoted market price. If an investment is impaired, the amount of the impairment loss is determined by applying IAS 36 (see Note B.6.1.) and recognized in Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method . B.6.3. Reversals of impairment losses charged against property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and investments accounted for using the equity method At the end of each reporting period, Sanofi assesses whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss recognized in a prior period in respect of an asset (other than goodwill) or an investment accounted for using the equity method can be reversed. If this is the case, and the recoverable amount as determined based on the revised estimates exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, Sanofi reverses the impairment loss only to the extent of the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset. Reversals of impairment losses in respect of other intangible assets are recognized within the income statement line item Impairment of intangible assets , while reversals of impairment losses in respect of investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized within the income statement line item Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method . Impairment losses taken against goodwill are never reversed, unless the goodwill is part of the carrying amount of an investment accounted for using the equity method. B.7. Assets held for sale or exchange and liabilities related to assets held for sale or exchange In accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), non-current assets and groups of assets are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Within the meaning of IFRS 5, the term \"sale\" also includes exchanges for other assets. Non-current assets or asset groups held for sale must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and a sale must be highly probable. Criteria used to determine whether a sale is highly probable include:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-17 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022completion of the sale should be foreseeable within the twelve months following the date of reclassification to Assets held for sale or exchange ; and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. the assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale are reclassified to the appropriate balance sheet line items, with no restatement of comparative periods; each asset is measured at the lower of (a) its carrying amount before the asset was reclassified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortization or revaluation that would have been recognized if the asset had not been reclassified as held for sale, or (b) its recoverable amount at the date of reclassification; the backlog of depreciation, amortization and impairment not recognized while non-current assets were classified as held for sale must be reported in the same income statement line item that was used to report impairment losses arising on initial reclassification of assets as held for sale and gains or losses arising on the sale of such assets. In the consolidated income statement, those impacts are reported within the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation ; the net income of a business previously classified as discontinued or as held for sale or exchange and reported on a separate line in the income statement must be reclassified and included in net income from continuing operations, for all periods presented; in addition, segment information relating to the income statement and the statement of cash flows (acquisitions of non-current assets) must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), and must also be restated for all prior periods presented. quoted and unquoted equity investments that Sanofi does not hold for trading purposes and that management has designated at \"fair value through other comprehensive income\" on initial recognition. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in equity within the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. When such instruments are derecognized, the previously-recognized changes in fair value remain within Other comprehensive income , as does the gain or loss on divestment. Dividends received are recognized in profit or loss for the period, within the line item Financial income ; and debt instruments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest or repayments of principal, and which are managed with a view to collecting cash flows and selling the asset. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in equity within the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. When such assets are derecognized, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss for the period within the line items Financial income or Financial expenses .Before initial reclassification of the non-current asset (or asset group) to Assets held for sale or exchange , the carrying amounts of the asset (or of all the assets and liabilities in the asset group) must be measured in accordance with the applicable standards. Subsequent to reclassification to Assets held for sale or exchange , the non-current asset (or asset group) is measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, with any write-down recognized by means of an impairment loss. Once a non-current asset has been reclassified as held for sale or exchange, it is no longer depreciated or amortized. In a disposal of an equity interest leading to loss of control, all the assets and liabilities of the entity involved are classified as held- for-sale assets or liabilities within the balance sheet line items Assets held for sale or exchange or Liabilities related to assets held for sale or exchange , provided that the disposal satisfies the IFRS 5 classification criteria. The profit or loss generated by a held-for-sale asset group is reported in a separate line item in the income statement for the current period and for the comparative periods presented, provided that the asset group: In accordance with IFRS 10, transactions between companies that are held for sale or treated as discontinued operations and other consolidated companies are eliminated. Events or circumstances beyond Sanofi's control may extend the period to complete the sale or exchange beyond one year without precluding classification of the asset (or disposal group) in Assets held for sale or exchange provided that there is sufficient evidence that Sanofi remains committed to the planned sale or exchange. Finally, in the event of changes to a plan of sale that requires an asset no longer to be classified as held for sale, IFRS 5 specifies the following treatment: B.8. Financial instruments B.8.1. Non-derivative financial assets In accordance with IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IAS 32 (Financial Instruments: Presentation), Sanofi has adopted the classification of non-derivative financial assets described below. The classification used depends on (i) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows (i.e. whether they represent interest or principal) and (ii) the business model for managing the asset applied at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income These mainly comprise:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-18 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022contingent consideration already carried in the books of an acquired entity or granted in connection with a business combination; instruments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest and repayments of principal, which are managed with a view to selling the asset; instruments that management has designated at \"fair value through profit or loss\" on initial recognition; and quoted and unquoted equity investments: equity instruments that are not held for trading and which management did not designate at \"fair value through other comprehensive income\" on initial recognition, and instruments that do not meet the IFRS definition of \"equity instruments\".Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss These mainly comprise: Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss within the line items Financial income or Financial expenses . Dividends received are recognized in profit or loss for the period, within the line item Financial income . Fair value of equity investments in unquoted entities On initial recognition of an equity investment in an entity not quoted in an active market, the fair value of the investment is the acquisition cost. Cost ceases to be a representative measure of the fair value of an unquoted equity investment when Sanofi identifies significant changes in the investee, or in the environment in which it operates. In such cases, an internal valuation is carried out, based mainly on growth forecasts or by reference to similar transactions contracted with third parties. Financial assets measured at amortized cost Financial assets at amortized cost comprise instruments whose contractual cash flows represent payments of interest and repayments of principal and which are managed with a view to collecting cash flows. The main assets in this category are loans and receivables. They are presented within the line items Other non-current assets , Other current assets , Accounts receivable and Cash and cash equivalents . Loans with a maturity of more than 12 months are presented in \"Long-term loans and advances\" within Other non-current assets . These financial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost The main assets involved are accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are initially recognized at the amount invoiced to the customer. Impairment losses on trade accounts receivable are estimated using the expected loss method, in order to take account of the risk of payment default throughout the lifetime of the receivables. The expected credit loss is estimated collectively for all accounts receivable at each reporting date using an average expected loss rate, determined primarily on the basis of historical credit loss rates. However, that average expected loss rate may be adjusted if there are indications of a likely significant increase in credit risk. If a receivable is subject to a known credit risk, a specific impairment loss is recognized for that receivable. The amount of expected losses is recognized in the balance sheet as a reduction in the gross amount of accounts receivable. Impairment losses on accounts receivable are recognized within Selling and general expenses in the income statement. B.8.2. Derivative instruments Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are initially and subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement in Other operating income or in Financial income or Financial expenses , depending on the nature of the underlying economic item which is hedged. Derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are measured using the policies described in Note B.8.3. below. IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) requires counterparty credit risk to be taken into account when measuring the fair value of financial instruments. That risk is estimated on the basis of observable, publicly-available statistical data. Policy on offsetting In order for a financial asset and a financial liability to be presented as a net amount in the balance sheet under IAS 32, there must be:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-19 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(a) a legally enforceable right to offset; and (b) the intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.if the option includes a component that is not aligned on the critical features of the hedged item, the corresponding change in the time value is taken to profit or loss; otherwise, the change in the time value is taken to equity within the statement of comprehensive income, and then: -if the hedged item is linked to a transaction that results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the change in the time value is reclassified to profit or loss symmetrically with the hedged item, or -if the hedged item is linked to a transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the change in the time value is incorporated in the initial carrying amount of that asset or liability, or -if the hedged item is linked to a period of time, the change in time value is reclassified to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the life of the hedging relationship.B.8.3. Hedging As part of its overall market risk management policy, Sanofi enters into various hedging transactions involving derivative or non- derivative instruments; these may include forward contracts, currency swaps or options, interest rate swaps or options, cross-currency swaps, and debt placings or issues. Such financial instruments are designated as hedging instruments and recognized using the hedge accounting principles of IFRS 9 when (a) there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, of how the effectiveness of the hedging relationship will be assessed, and of the underlying market risk management objective and strategy; (b) the hedged item and the hedging instrument are eligible for hedge accounting; and (c) there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, defined on the basis of a hedge ratio that is consistent with the underlying market risk management strategy, and the residual credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship. Fair value hedge A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset, liability or firm commitment that is attributable to one or more risk components and could affect profit or loss. Changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk components are generally recognized in the income statement, within Other operating income for hedges related to operating activities, or within Financial income or Financial expenses for hedges related to investing or financing activities. Cash flow hedge A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from an asset, liability or highly probable forecast transaction that is attributable to one or more risk components and could affect profit or loss. Changes in fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized directly in equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Changes in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognized in the income statement within Other operating income for hedges related to operating activities, and within Financial income or Financial expenses for hedges related to investing or financing activities. Cumulative changes in fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. Those reclassified gains and losses are recognized within Other operating income for hedges related to operating activities, and within Financial income or Financial expenses for hedges related to investing or financing activities. When a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are incorporated in the initial carrying amount of that asset or liability. When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity remains separately recognized in equity and is not reclassified to the income statement, or recognized as an adjustment to the initial cost of the related non-financial asset or liability, until the forecast transaction occurs. However, if Sanofi no longer expects the forecast transaction to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized directly in equity in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Changes in fair value attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognized in the income statement within Financial income or Financial expenses . When the investment in the foreign operation is sold, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognized in equity are reclassified to the income statement within Financial income or Financial expenses . Cost of hedging As part of its market risk management policy, Sanofi may designate currency options or interest rate options as hedging instruments, the effectiveness of which is measured on the basis of changes in intrinsic value. In such cases, the time value of the option is treated as a hedging cost and accounted for as follows:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-20 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022a.level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (without modification or repackaging); b.level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or valuation techniques in which all important inputs are derived from observable market data; and c.level 3: valuation techniques in which not all important inputs are derived from observable market data.In the case of forward contracts and foreign exchange swaps, and of cross-currency swaps that qualify for hedge accounting on the basis of changes in spot rates, Sanofi may elect for each transaction to use the option whereby the premium/discount or foreign currency basis spread are treated in the same way as the time value of an option. Discontinuation of hedge accounting Hedge accounting is discontinued when the eligibility criteria are no longer met (in particular, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised), or if there is a change in the market risk management objective of the hedging relationship. B.8.4. Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings and debt Bank borrowings and debt instruments are initially measured at fair value of the consideration received, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. All costs related to the issuance of borrowings or debt instruments, and all differences between the issue proceeds net of transaction costs and the value on redemption, are recognized within Financial expenses in the income statement over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. Liabilities related to business combinations and to non-controlling interests These line items record the fair value of (i) contingent consideration payable in connection with business combinations and (ii) commitments to buy out equity holders of subsidiaries, including put options granted to non-controlling interests. Adjustments to the fair value of commitments to buy out equity holders of subsidiaries, including put options granted to non- controlling interests, are recognized in equity. Other non-derivative financial liabilities Other non-derivative financial liabilities include trade accounts payable, which are measured at fair value (which in most cases equates to face value) on initial recognition, and subsequently at amortized cost. B.8.5. Fair value of financial instruments Under IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) and IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments: Disclosures), fair value measurements must be classified using a hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure the fair value of the instrument. This hierarchy has three levels:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-21 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The table below shows the disclosures required under IFRS 7 relating to the measurement principles applied to financial instruments.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-22 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Method used to determine fair value Market data Note Type of financial instrumentMeasurement principleLevel in fair value hierarchyValuation techniqueValuationmodelExchange rateInterest rate D.7.Financial assets measured at fair value (quoted equity instruments)Fair value 1 Market valueQuoted marke t priceN/A D.7.Financial assets measured at fair instruments)Fair value 1priceMarket valueQuoted ma rket N/A D.7.Financial fair (unquoted equity instruments)Fair value 3Cost/ Approach based on comparablesIf cost ceases to be a representative measure of fair value, an internal valuation is carried out, based mainly on comparables.

The fair value of such liabilities is determined by adjusting the contingent consideration at the end of the reporting period using the method described in Note B.8.4. (a) In the case of debt designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedging relationship, the carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet includes changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk(s).B.8.6. Derecognition of financial instruments Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have ended or have been transferred and when Sanofi has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. If Sanofi has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, it is derecognized if Sanofi does not retain control of the asset. A financial liability is derecognized when Sanofi's contractual obligations in respect of the liability are discharged, cancelled or extinguished. B.8.7. Risks relating to financial instruments Market risks in respect of non-current financial assets, cash equivalents, derivative instruments and debt are described in the discussions of risk factors presented in Item 3.D. and Item 11. of Sanofi's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2022. Credit risk is the risk that customers may fail to pay their debts. For a description of credit risk, refer to \"We are subject to the risk of non-payment by our customers\" within Item 3.D. and Item 11. of Sanofi's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2022. B.9. Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method or the first-in, first-out method, depending on the nature of the inventory. The cost of finished goods inventories includes costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. During the launch phase of a new product, any inventories of that product are written down to zero pending regulatory approval, other than in specific circumstances which make it possible to estimate that there is a high probability at the end of the reporting period that the carrying amount of the inventories will be recoverable. The write-down is reversed once it becomes highly probable that marketing approval will be obtained. B.10. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents as shown in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows comprise cash, plus liquid short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value in the event of movements in interest rates. B.11. Treasury shares In accordance with IAS 32, Sanofi treasury shares are deducted from equity, irrespective of the purpose for which they are held. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, impairment or cancellation of treasury shares. B.12. Provisions for risks In accordance with IAS 37 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets), Sanofi records a provision when it has a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the outflow of resources. If the obligation is expected to be settled more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period, or has no definite settlement date, the provision is recorded within Non-current provisions and other non-current liabilities. Provisions relating to the insurance programs in which Sanofi's captive insurance company participates are based on risk exposure estimates calculated by management, with assistance from independent actuaries, using IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) techniques. Those techniques use past claims experience, within Sanofi and in the market, to estimate future trends in the cost of claims. Contingent liabilities are not recognized, but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is remote. Sanofi estimates provisions on the basis of events and circumstances related to present obligations at the end of the reporting period and of past experience, and to the best of management's knowledge at the date of preparation of the financial statements. Reimbursements offsetting the probable outflow of resources are recognized as assets only if it is virtually certain that they will be received. Contingent assets are not recognized. Restructuring provisions are recognized if Sanofi has a detailed, formal restructuring plan at the end of the reporting period and has announced its intention to implement this plan to those affected by it. No provisions are recorded for future operating losses.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-23 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022the amount of chargeback incentives is estimated on the basis of the relevant subsidiary's standard sales terms and conditions, and in certain cases on the basis of specific contractual arrangements with the customer; the amount of rebates based on attainment of sales targets is estimated and accrued as each of the underlying sales transactions is recognized; the amount of price reductions under Government and State programs, largely in the United States, is estimated on the basis of the specific terms of the relevant regulations or agreements, and accrued as each of the underlying sales transactions is recognized; the amount of sales returns is calculated on the basis of management's best estimate of the amount of product that will ultimately be returned by customers. In countries where product returns are possible, Sanofi operates a returns policy that allows the customer to return products within a certain period either side of the expiry date (usually 12 months after the expiry date). The amount recognized for returns is estimated on the basis of past experience of sales returns. Sanofi also takes into account factors such as levels of inventory in its various distribution channels, product expiry dates, information about potential discontinuation of products, the entry of competing generics into the market, and the launch of over-the-counter medicines. Most product return clauses relate solely to date-expired products, which cannot be resold and are destroyed. Sanofi does not recognize a right of return asset in the balance sheet for contracts that allow for the return of time-expired products, since those products have no value. the nature and patient profile of the underlying product; the applicable regulations or the specific terms and conditions of contracts with governmental authorities, wholesalers and other customers;Sanofi records non-current provisions for certain obligations, such as legal or constructive obligations, where an outflow of resources is probable and the amount of the outflow can be reliably estimated. In the case of environmental risks, including at sites where operations are ongoing, Sanofi recognizes a provision where there is a violation of integrity in respect of human health or the environment resulting from past contamination at a site that requires remediation. The amount of the provision is a best estimate of the future expenditures to be incurred on the remediation plan. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, those provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, calculated using a discount rate that reflects an estimate of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Increases in provisions to reflect the effects of the passage of time are recognized within Financial expenses . B.13. Revenue recognition B.13.1. Net sales Revenue arising from the sale of goods is presented in the income statement within Net sales . Net sales comprise revenue from sales of pharmaceutical products, consumer healthcare products, active ingredients and vaccines, net of sales returns, of customer incentives and discounts, and of certain sales-based payments paid or payable to the healthcare authorities. Analyses of net sales are provided in Note D.35.1. \"Segment Information\". In accordance with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), such revenue is recognized when Sanofi transfers control over the product to the customer; control of an asset refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that asset. For the vast majority of contracts, revenue is recognized when the product is physically transferred, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with the customer. For contracts entered into by Sanofi Pasteur, transfer of control is usually determined by reference to the terms of release (immediate or deferred) and acceptance of batches of vaccine. In the case of contracts with distributors, Sanofi does not recognize revenue when the product is physically transferred to the distributor if the products are sold on consignment, or if the distributor acts as agent. In such cases, revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the end customer, and the distributor's commission is presented within the line item Selling and general expenses in the income statement. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the various types of price reductions or rights of return offered by Sanofi to its customers on certain products. Such price reductions and rights of return qualify as variable consideration under IFRS 15. In particular, products sold in the United States are covered by various Government and State programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) under which products are sold at a discount. Rebates are granted to healthcare authorities, and under contractual arrangements with certain customers. Some wholesalers are entitled to chargeback incentives based on the selling price to the end customer, under specific contractual arrangements. Cash discounts may also be granted for prompt payment. Returns, discounts, incentives and rebates, as described above, are recognized in the period in which the underlying sales are recognized as a reduction of gross sales. These amounts are calculated as follows: The estimated amounts described above are recognized in the income statement within Net sales as a reduction of gross sales, and within Other current liabilities in the balance sheet. They are subject to regular review and adjustment as appropriate based on the most recent data available to management. Sanofi believes that it has the ability to measure each of the above amounts reliably, using the following factors in developing its estimates:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-24 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022historical data relating to similar contracts, in the case of qualitative and quantitative rebates and chargeback incentives; past experience and sales growth trends for the same or similar products; actual inventory levels in distribution channels, monitored by Sanofi using internal sales data and externally provided data; the shelf life of Sanofi products; and market trends including competition, pricing and demand. An analysis of provisions for discounts, rebates and sales returns is provided in Note D.23. B.13.2. Other revenues The line item Other revenues is used to recognize all revenue that falls within the scope of IFRS 15 but does not relate to sales of Sanofi products. It mainly comprises (i) royalties received from licensing intellectual property rights to third parties; (ii) VaxServe sales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers; and (iii) revenue received under agreements for Sanofi to provide manufacturing services to third parties. Royalties received under licensing arrangements are recognized over the period during which the underlying sales are recognized. VaxServe is a Vaccines segment entity whose operations include the distribution within the United States of vaccines and other products manufactured by third parties. VaxServe sales of products sourced from third-party manufacturers are presented within Other revenues . B.14. Cost of sales Cost of sales consists primarily of the industrial cost of goods sold, payments made under licensing agreements, and distribution costs. The industrial cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of software, personnel costs, and other expenses attributable to production. B.15. Research and development Note B.4.1. \"Research and development not acquired in a business combination\" and Note B.4.3. \"Other intangible assets acquired in a business combination\" describe the principles applied to the recognition of research and development costs. Contributions or reimbursements received from alliance partners are recorded as a reduction of Research and development expenses . B.16. Other operating income and expenses B.16.1. Other operating income Other operating income includes the share of profits that Sanofi is entitled to receive from alliance partners in respect of product marketing agreements. It also includes revenues generated under certain agreements, which may include partnership, co-promotion arrangements and licenses not included in Other revenues. This line item also includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on operating activities (see Note B.8.3.), and operating gains on disposals not regarded as major disposals (see Note B.20.). B.16.2. Other operating expenses Other operating expenses mainly comprise the share of profits that alliance partners are entitled to receive from Sanofi under product marketing agreements. B.17. Amortization and impairment of intangible assets B.17.1. Amortization of intangible assets The expenses recorded in this line item comprise amortization of product rights and other intangible assets (see Note D.4.), given that the benefit of those rights to Sanofi's commercial, industrial and development functions cannot be separately identified. Amortization of software, and of other rights of an industrial or operational nature, is recognized as an expense in the income statement, in the relevant line items of expense by function. B.17.2. Impairment of intangible assets This line item records impairment losses (other than those associated with restructuring) recognized against intangible assets (including goodwill, but excluding software and other rights of an industrial or operational nature), and any reversals of such impairment losses.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-25 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022gains and losses on major disposals of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of assets (or groups of assets and liabilities) held for sale, or of a business within the meaning of IFRS 3, other than those considered to be restructuring costs; impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses on assets (or groups of assets and liabilities) held for sale, other than those considered to be restructuring costs; gains on bargain purchases; costs relating to major litigation; and pre-tax separation costs associated with the process of disinvesting from operations in the event of a major divestment.B.18. Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that was (i) already carried in the books of an acquired entity, or (ii) granted in connection with a business combination and initially recognized as a liability in accordance with IFRS 3, are reported in profit or loss. Such adjustments are reported separately in the income statement, in the line item Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration . This line item also includes changes in the fair value of contingent consideration receivable in connection with a divestment and classified as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss. Finally, it includes the effect of the unwinding of discount, and of exchange rate movements where the asset or liability is expressed in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. B.19. Restructuring costs and similar items Restructuring costs are expenses incurred in connection with the transformation or reorganization of Sanofi's operations or support functions. Such costs include collective redundancy plans, compensation to third parties for early termination of contracts, and commitments made in connection with transformation or reorganization decisions. They also include accelerated depreciation charges arising from site closures (including closures of leased sites), and losses on asset disposals resulting from such decisions. In addition, this line item includes expenses incurred in connection with programs implemented as part of the transformation strategy announced in December 2019 (and previously in November 2015), and intended primarily to (i) deliver a global information systems solution, further supported by the implementation in 2021 of Sanofi's new digital strategy; (ii) create a standalone Consumer Healthcare entity; and (iii) as announced on February 24, 2020, create a European leader in the production and marketing to third parties of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). B.20. Other gains and losses, and litigation The line item Other gains and losses, and litigation includes the impact of material transactions of an unusual nature or amount which Sanofi believes it necessary to report separately in the income statement in order to improve the relevance of the financial statements, such as: B.21. Financial expenses and income B.21.1. Financial expenses Financial expenses mainly comprise interest charges on debt financing; negative changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments (where changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss); realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses on financing and investing activities; impairment losses on financial instruments; and any reversals of impairment losses on financial instruments. Financial expenses also include expenses arising from the unwinding of discount on long-term provisions, and the net interest cost related to employee benefits. This line item does not include commercial cash discounts, which are deducted from net sales. B.21.2. Financial income Financial income includes interest and dividend income; positive changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments (where changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss); realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains on financing and investing activities; and gains on disposals of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. B.22. Income tax expense Income tax expense includes all current and deferred taxes of consolidated companies. Sanofi accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes), using the methods described below: deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on taxable and deductible temporary differences, and on tax loss carry-forwards. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base;NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-26 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022French business taxes include a (Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajout\u00e9e des Entreprises) . Given that CVAE is (i) calculated as the amount by which certain revenues exceed certain expenses and (ii) borne primarily by companies that own intellectual property rights on income derived from those rights (royalties, and margin on sales to third parties and to Sanofi entities), it is regarded as meeting the definition of income taxes specified in IAS 12, paragraph 2 (\"taxes which are based on taxable profits\"); deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rate expected to apply in the period when the corresponding temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period; deferred tax assets are recognized in respect of deductible temporary differences, tax losses available for carry-forward and unused tax credits to the extent that future recovery is regarded as probable. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the profit forecasts contained in Sanofi's medium-term business plan; a deferred tax liability is recognized for temporary differences relating to interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except in cases where Sanofi is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. This applies in particular when Sanofi is able to control dividend policy and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; no deferred tax is recognized on eliminations of intragroup transfers of interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures; each tax entity calculates its own net deferred tax position. All net deferred tax asset and liability positions are then aggregated and shown in separate line items on the relevant side of the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if (i) Sanofi has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities, and (ii) the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority; deferred taxes are not discounted, except implicitly in the case of deferred taxes on assets and liabilities which are already impacted by discounting. In addition, Sanofi has elected not to discount current taxes payable or receivable where the amounts in question are payable or receivable in the long term; withholding taxes on intragroup royalties and dividends, and on royalties and dividends collected from third parties, are accounted for as current income taxes. In accounting for business combinations, Sanofi complies with IFRS 3 as regards the recognition of deferred tax assets after the initial accounting period. Consequently, any deferred tax assets recognized by the acquiree after the end of that period in respect of temporary differences or tax loss carry-forwards existing at the acquisition date are recognized in profit or loss. The positions adopted by Sanofi in tax matters are based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Some of those positions may be subject to uncertainty. In such cases, Sanofi assesses the amount of the tax liability on the basis of the following assumptions: that its position will be examined by one or more tax authorities on the basis of all relevant information; that a technical assessment is carried out with reference to legislation, case law, regulations, and established practice; and that each position is assessed individually (or collectively where appropriate), with no offset or aggregation between positions. Those assumptions are assessed on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at the end of the reporting period. When an uncertain tax liability is regarded as probable, it is measured on the basis of Sanofi's best estimate and recognized as a liability; uncertain tax assets are not recognized. The amount of the liability includes any penalties and late payment interest. The line item Income tax expense includes the effects of tax reassessments and tax disputes, and any penalties and late payment interest arising from such disputes that have the characteristics of income taxes within the meaning of paragraph 2 of IAS 12 (\"taxes which are based on taxable profits\"). Tax exposures relating to corporate income taxes are presented separately within Non-current income tax liabilities (see Note D.19.4.). No deferred taxation is recognized on temporary differences that are liable to be subject to US global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) provisions. The related tax expense is recognized in the year in which it is declared in the tax return to the extent that it arises from the existence of non-US profits that exceed the theoretical return on investment specified in the GILTI provisions and are taxed at a rate lower than the applicable US tax rate. In accordance with IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements), current income tax assets and liabilities are presented as separate line items in the consolidated balance sheet. B.23. Employee benefit obligations Sanofi offers retirement benefits to employees and retirees. Such benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (Employee Benefits). Benefits are provided in the form of either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the cost is recognized immediately in the period in which it is incurred, and equates to the amount of the contributions paid by Sanofi. For defined benefit plans, Sanofi generally recognizes its obligations to pay pensions and similar benefits to employees as a liability, based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in employees and retirees, using the projected unit credit method. Estimates are performed at least once a year, and rely on financial assumptions (such as discount rates) and demographic assumptions (such as life expectancy, retirement age, employee turnover, and the rate of salary increases). Obligations relating to other post-employment benefits (healthcare and life insurance) offered by Sanofi companies to employees are also recognized as a liability based on an actuarial estimate of the rights vested or currently vesting in employees and retirees at the end of the reporting period. Such liabilities are recognized net of the fair value of plan assets.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-27 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022In the case of multi-employer defined benefit plans where plan assets cannot be allocated to each participating employer with sufficient reliability, the plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan, in accordance with paragraph 34 of IAS 19. The benefit cost for the period consists primarily of current service cost, past service cost, net interest cost, gains or losses arising from plan settlements not specified in the terms of the plan, and actuarial gains or losses arising from plan curtailments. Net interest cost for the period is determined by applying the discount rate specified in IAS 19 to the net liability (i.e. the amount of the obligation, net of plan assets) recognized in respect of defined benefit plans. Past service cost is recognized immediately in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred, regardless of whether or not the rights have vested at the time of adoption (in the case of a new plan) or of amendment (in the case of an existing plan). Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans (pensions and other post-employment benefits), also referred to as \"Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset)\" , arise as a result of changes in financial and demographic assumptions, experience adjustments, and the difference between the actual return and interest cost on plan assets. The impacts of those remeasurements are recognized in Other comprehensive income , net of deferred taxes; they are not subsequently reclassifiable to profit or loss. B.24. Share-based payment Share-based payment expense is recognized as a component of operating income, in the relevant classification of expense by function. In measuring the expense, the level of attainment of any performance conditions is taken into account. B.24.1. Stock option plans Sanofi has granted a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans (stock option plans) to some of its employees. The terms of those plans may make the award contingent on the attainment of performance criteria for some of the grantees. In accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-Based Payment), services received from employees as consideration for stock options are recognized as an expense in the income statement, with the opposite entry recognized in equity. The expense corresponds to the fair value of the stock option plans, and is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the four-year vesting period of the plan. The fair value of stock option plans is measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, taking into account the expected life of the options. The resulting expense also takes into account the expected cancellation rate of the options. The expense is adjusted over the vesting period to reflect actual cancellation rates resulting from option-holders ceasing to be employed by Sanofi. B.24.2. Employee share ownership plans Sanofi may offer its employees the opportunity to subscribe to reserved share issues at a discount to the reference market price. Shares awarded to employees under such plans fall within the scope of IFRS 2. Consequently, an expense is recognized at the subscription date, based on the value of the discount offered to employees. B.24.3. Restricted share plans Sanofi may award restricted share plans to certain of its employees. The terms of those plans may make the award contingent on the attainment of performance criteria for some of the grantees. In accordance with IFRS 2, an expense equivalent to the fair value of such plans is recognized in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the plan, with the opposite entry recognized in equity. The vesting period is three years. The fair value of restricted share plans is based on the quoted market price of Sanofi shares at the date of grant, adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period; it also takes account of any vesting conditions contingent on stock market performance, measured using the Monte-Carlo valuation model. Other vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the number of shares awarded during the vesting period; that number is then definitively adjusted based on the actual number of shares awarded on the vesting date. B.25. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period, adjusted on a time-weighted basis from the acquisition date to reflect the number of own shares held by Sanofi. Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares, computed using the treasury stock method. This method assumes that (i) all outstanding dilutive options and warrants are exercised, and (ii) Sanofi acquires its own shares at the quoted market price for an amount equivalent to the cash received as consideration for the exercise of the options or warrants, plus the expense arising on unamortized stock options.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-28 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022B.26. Segment information In accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the segment information reported by Sanofi is prepared on the basis of internal management data provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. The performance of those segments is monitored individually using internal reports and common indicators. Disclosures about operating segments required under IFRS 8 are presented in Note D.35. \"Segment information\" to the consolidated financial statements. Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines, and Consumer Healthcare. The Pharmaceuticals segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations of the following global franchises: Specialty Care (Dupixent \u00ae, Neurology & Immunology, Rare Diseases, Oncology, and Rare Blood Disorders) and General Medicines (Core and Non-Core Assets), together with research, development and production activities dedicated to the Pharmaceuticals segment. This segment also includes associates whose activities are related to pharmaceuticals. Following the transaction of May 29, 2020, Regeneron is no longer an associate of Sanofi (see Note D.2.). Consequently, the Pharmaceuticals segment no longer includes Sanofi's equity-accounted share of Regeneron's profits for all the periods presented. The Vaccines segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations of Vaccines, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to vaccines. The Consumer Healthcare segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations for Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare products, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to those products. Inter-segment transactions are not material. The costs of Sanofi's global functions (Corporate Affairs, Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics & Business Integrity, Information Solutions & Technologies, Sanofi Business Services, etc.) are managed centrally at group-wide level, and are presented within the \"Other\" category. That category also includes other reconciling items such as retained commitments in respect of divested activities. the implementation of any stock option plan giving entitlement to purchase shares in the Sanofi parent company; the allotment or sale of shares to employees under statutory profit sharing schemes and employee savings plans; the consideration-free allotment of shares (i.e. restricted share plans); the cancellation of some or all of the repurchased shares; market-making in the secondary market by an investment services provider under a liquidity contract in compliance with the ethical code recognized by the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF); the delivery of shares on the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the capital by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means; the delivery of shares (in exchange, as payment, or otherwise) in connection with mergers and acquisitions; the execution by an investment services provider of purchases, sales or transfers by any means, in particular via off-market trading; or any other purpose that is or may in the future be authorized under the applicable laws and regulations.Information about operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in Note D.35., \"Segment information\". B.27. Management of capital In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Sanofi can adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase its own shares, issue new shares, or issue securities giving access to its capital. The following objectives are defined under the terms of Sanofi's share repurchase programs: Sanofi is not subject to any constraints on equity capital imposed by third parties. Total equity includes Equity attributable to equity holders of Sanofi and Equity attributable to non-controlling interests , as shown in the consolidated balance sheet. Sanofi defines \"Net debt\" as (i) the sum of short-term debt, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to hedge debt, minus (ii) the sum of cash and cash equivalents and interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives used to hedge cash and cash equivalents.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-29 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022C/ Principal alliances C.1. Alliance arrangements with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) Collaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies In November 2007, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements (amended in November 2009) relating to human therapeutic antibodies: Discovery and development Because Sanofi decided not to exercise its option to extend the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, that agreement expired on December 31, 2017. As a result of Sanofi's exercise of an option with respect to an antibody under the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, such antibody became a \"Licensed Product\" under the License and Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which Sanofi and Regeneron co-develop the antibody with Sanofi initially being wholly responsible for funding the development program. On receipt of the first positive Phase III trial results for any antibody being developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement, the subsequent development costs for that antibody are split 80% Sanofi, 20% Regeneron. Amounts received from Regeneron under the License and Collaboration Agreement are recognized by Sanofi as a reduction in the line item Research and development expenses . Co-development with Regeneron of the antibodies Dupixent \u00ae, Kevzara\u00ae and REGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) is ongoing under the License and Collaboration Agreement as of December 31, 2022. Once a product begins to be commercialized, and provided that the share of quarterly results under the agreement represents a profit, Sanofi is entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron's profit-share (capped at 20% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits since April 1, 2022, and at 10% until March 31, 2022) until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties in the collaboration (see Note D.21.1.). On the later of (i) 24 months before the scheduled launch date or (ii) the first positive Phase III trial results, Sanofi and Regeneron share the commercial expenses of the antibodies co-developed under the License and Collaboration Agreement. Commercialization Sanofi is the lead party with respect to the commercialization of all co-developed antibodies, and Regeneron has certain option rights to co-promote the antibodies. Regeneron has exercised its co-promotion rights in the United States and in certain other countries. Sanofi recognizes all sales of the antibodies. Profits and losses arising from commercial operations in the United States are split 50/50. Outside the United States, Sanofi is entitled to between 55% and 65% of profits depending on sales of the antibodies, and bears 55% of any losses. The share of profits and losses due to or from Regeneron under the agreement is recognized within the line items Other operating income or Other operating expenses , which are components of Operating income . In addition, Regeneron is entitled to receive payments contingent on the attainment of specified levels of aggregate sales on all antibodies outside the United States, on a rolling twelve-month basis. A liability for those payments is recognized on the balance sheet when it is probable that the specified level of aggregate sales will be met. The opposite entry for that liability is capitalized within Other intangible assets on the balance sheet. Two payments of $50 million each were made in 2022, following attainment first of $2.0 billion and then of $2.5 billion in sales of all antibodies outside the United States on a rolling twelve-month basis. In the event that $3.0 billion in sales on a rolling twelve-month basis is attained, Regeneron is entitled to a final milestone payment of $50 million. Amendments to the collaboration agreements In January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a set of amendments to their collaboration agreements, including an amendment that allowed for the funding of additional programs on Dupixent \u00ae and REGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) with an intended focus on extending the current range of indications, finding new indications, and improving co-morbidity between multiple pathologies. Effective April 1, 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron signed a Cross License and Commercialization Agreement for Praluent \u00ae, whereby Sanofi obtained sole ex-US rights to Praluent\u00ae, and Regeneron obtained sole US rights to Praluent\u00ae along with a right to 5% royalties on Sanofi's sales of Praluent\u00ae outside the United States. Each party is solely responsible for funding the development, manufacturing and commercialization of Praluent\u00ae in their respective territories. Although each party has responsibility for supplying Praluent\u00ae in its respective territory, Sanofi and Regeneron have entered into agreements to support manufacturing needs for each other. Effective September 30, 2021, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to specify allocations of responsibilities and associated resources between the two parties in connection with the co-promotion of Dupixent \u00ae in certain countries. The terms of the collaboration relating to REGN3500 (SAR440340 - itepekimab) are unchanged.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-30 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(i) the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement, and (ii) the License and Collaboration Agreement, relating to clinical development and commercialization. Under the License and Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi had an option to developand commercialize antibodies discovered by Regeneron under the Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement.Effective July 1, 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron signed an amendment to their collaboration agreement in order to increase the additional portion of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits attributable to Sanofi from 10% to 20% with retroactive impact as of April 1, 2022. Immuno-oncology (IO) collaboration agreements On July 1, 2015, Sanofi and Regeneron signed two agreements - the IO Discovery and Development Agreement and the IO License and Collaboration Agreement (IO LCA) - relating to new antibody cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology. The Amended IO Discovery Agreement, effective from December 31, 2018, was terminated through a Letter Amendment dated March 16, 2021 in which Sanofi formalized its opt-out from the BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 programs. Libtayo\u00ae (cemiplimab) Under the 2015 IO LCA as amended in January 2018, Sanofi and Regeneron committed funding of no more than $1,640 million, split on a 50/50 basis ($820 million per company), for the development of REGN2810 (cemiplimab, trademark Libtayo \u00ae), a PD-1 inhibitor antibody. The funding was raised to $1,840 million by way of amendment effective on September 30, 2021. Regeneron was responsible for the commercialization of Libtayo \u00ae in the United States, and Sanofi in all other territories. Sanofi has exercised its option to co-promote Libtayo\u00ae in the United States. In 2021, Regeneron exercised its option to co-promote Libtayo\u00ae in certain other countries. The IO LCA also provided for a one-time milestone payment of $375 million by Sanofi to Regeneron in the event that sales of a PD-1 product were to exceed, in the aggregate, $2 billion in any consecutive 12-month period. Under the IO LCA Sanofi and Regeneron shared equally in profits and losses generated by the commercialization of collaboration products, except that Sanofi was entitled to an additional portion of Regeneron's profit-share (capped at 10% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits) until Regeneron had paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties under the IO Discovery Agreement, as amended. Libtayo \u00ae is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of two types of locally advanced or metastatic skin cancer (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is also approved in Brazil and Canada as a second line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2022, it was approved in the United States in association with chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC, and in Europe and Japan as a second line treatment for recurring or metastatic cervical cancer. Libtayo \u00ae is currently approved in more than 30 countries. In June 2022, Sanofi and Regeneron restructured their IO LCA. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated IO LCA, Regeneron holds exclusive worldwide licensing rights to Libtayo\u00ae with effect from July 1, 2022. In July 2022, Sanofi received as consideration an upfront payment of $900 million (\u20ac856 million), which was recognized within Other operating income on the date of receipt. The same line item also includes a regulatory milestone payment of $100 million (\u20ac96 million) following the US FDA approval in November 2022 of Libtayo\u00ae in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for NSCLC. In addition, Sanofi is entitled to royalties of 11% and to milestone payments (\u20ac111 million in 2022) linked to global net sales of Libtayo \u00ae which are recognized within Other operating income in line with the pattern of sales . All of the cash inflows relating to the above items (\u20ac967 million for the year ended December 31, 2022) are presented within Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The amendment to the terms of the IO LCA resulted in Sanofi recognizing an accelerated amortization charge of \u20ac226 million; this was allocated to the Libtayo \u00ae product rights included within the residual carrying amount of the intangible asset recognized in July 2015 to reflect rights to an antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) under the Sanofi/Regeneron alliance. The transaction also includes a time-limited transitional services agreement with Regeneron which includes manufacturing, distribution (for which Sanofi acts as agent), and promotion. Investor agreement In 2014 and 2020, Sanofi and Regeneron amended the investor agreement entered into by the two companies in 2007. Under the terms of the amendments, Sanofi accepted various restrictions, including \"standstill\" provisions that contractually prohibit Sanofi from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of Regeneron or acquiring more than 30% of Regeneron's capital stock (consisting of the outstanding shares of common stock and the shares of Class A stock). This prohibition remains in place until the earlier of (i) the later of the fifth anniversaries of the expiration or earlier termination of the Zaltrap \u00ae collaboration agreement with Regeneron (related to the development and commercialization of Zaltrap\u00ae) or the collaboration agreement with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies (see \"Collaboration agreements on human therapeutic antibodies\" above), each as amended and (ii) other specified events. Starting in 2018 Sanofi began to sell shares of Regeneron stock and announced on May 29, 2020 the closing of its sale of 13 million shares of Regeneron common stock in a registered offering and a private sale to Regeneron (see Note D.2.). Pursuant to subsequent sales, as of December 31, 2022 Sanofi no longer holds any shares of Regeneron stock.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-31 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022C.2. Alliance arrangements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) Two of Sanofi's products were jointly developed with BMS: the On September 27, 2012, Sanofi and BMS signed an agreement relating to their alliance following the loss of exclusivity of Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae in many major markets. Under the terms of this agreement, effective January 1, 2013, BMS returned to Sanofi its rights to Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae in all markets worldwide with the exception of Plavix\u00ae in the United States and Puerto Rico (\"Territory B\"), giving Sanofi sole control and freedom to operate commercially in respect of those products. In exchange, BMS received royalty payments on Sanofi's sales of branded and unbranded Plavix\u00ae and Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae worldwide (except for Plavix\u00ae in Territory B) until 2018, and also received a payment of $200 million from Sanofi in December 2018, part of which is for buying out the non-controlling interests. Rights to Plavix \u00ae in Territory B remained unchanged and continued to be governed by the terms of the original agreement until February 28, 2020. In all of the territories managed by Sanofi (including the United States and Puerto Rico for Avapro\u00ae/Avalide\u00ae) as defined in the new agreement, Sanofi recognized in its consolidated financial statements the revenue and expenses generated by its own operations. Since January 2019 onwards, there has no longer been any share of profits reverting to BMS (previously presented within Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the income statement). In Territory B for Plavix \u00ae, which was managed by BMS, the Plavix\u00ae business was conducted through the Territory B partnerships, which were jointly owned by BMS and Sanofi. Sanofi recognized its share of profits and losses within the line item Share of profit/ (loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method . On February 28, 2020, Sanofi purchased all BMS's interests (50.1%) in each of the Territory B partnerships for a cumulative purchase price of $12 million. Following a transition period, Sanofi has been commercializing Plavix\u00ae under its own label since July 1, 2020. D/ Presentation of the financial statements D.1. Principal changes in the scope of consolidation in 2022 Acquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On February 8, 2022, Sanofi acquired the entire share capital of the immuno-oncology company Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Amunix), thereby gaining access to Amunix's innovative Pro-XTENTM technology and a promising pipeline of immunotherapies. The acquisition price of Amunix comprises a fixed cash payment of \u20ac970 million, plus contingent consideration in the form of milestone payments based on attainment of certain future development objectives of up to $225 million, the fair value of which as of the acquisition date was \u20ac156 million. In accordance with IFRS 3, this contingent purchase consideration was recognized in Liabilities related to business combinations and non-controlling interests (see Note D.18.). The final purchase price allocation led to the recognition of \u20ac609 million of goodwill, determined as follows: \"Other intangible assets\" comprise Pro-XTENTM, an innovative universal protease-releasable masking technology platform for the discovery and development of transformative cytokine therapies and T-cell engager (TCE) immunotherapies for patients with cancer. Goodwill mainly represents the value of Amunix's upstream research and development pipeline of immuno-oncology therapies based on next-generation conditionally activated biologics, especially when combined with Sanofi's existing oncology portfolio. The goodwill generated on this acquisition does not give rise to any deduction for income tax purposes. Amunix has no commercial operations, and has made a negative contribution of \u20ac56 million to Sanofi's consolidated net income since the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs were recognized in profit or loss during 2021, primarily within the line item Other operating expenses ; the amount involved was immaterial. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a cash outflow of \u20ac852 million.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-32 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(\u20ac million) Fair value at acquisition date Other intangible assets 493 Other current and non-current assets and liabilities (13) Cash and cash equivalents 118 Deferred taxes, net (81) Net assets of Amunix 517 Goodwill 609 Purchase price 1,126 the derecognition of the carrying amount of all the assets and liabilities of EUROAPI, representing a net amount of \u20ac1,227 million as of May 10, 2022. This includes goodwill of \u20ac164 million, determined in accordance with IAS 36 (\"Impairment of Assets\"), which was historically allocated to the Pharmaceuticals cash generating unit (CGU), and which for the purposes of the deconsolidation was allocated using an alternative method based on the relative values of goodwill as of the date of consolidation (the \"notional goodwill method\"). That method was considered more appropriate to the capital-intensive nature of EUROAPI operations than the method based on the relative values of EUROAPI operations and the retained portion of the CGU; a reduction in Equity attributable to equity holders of Sanofi reflecting the distribution in kind, measured at \u20ac793 million based on the weighted average price of \u20ac14.58 per share as of the date of delivery of the EUROAPI shares to Sanofi shareholders and corresponding to the fair value of the distribution in accordance with IFRIC 17 (Distribution of Non-Cash Assets to Owners); a cash inflow of \u20ac150 million from the divestment of 12% of the share capital of EUROAPI to EPIC Bpifrance as of the settlement date of the shares, i.e. June 17, 2022; the recognition in the statement of financial position, within the line item Investments accounted for using the equity method , of the retained 30.1% equity interest in EUROAPI at an amount of \u20ac413 million, determined on the basis of the weighted average price of \u20ac14.58 per share and representing the fair value of the equity interest in accordance with IFRS 10; the reclassification within the net gain/loss on deconsolidation of unrealized foreign exchange losses amounting to \u20ac35 million arising on EUROAPI subsidiaries, in accordance with IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates); the recognition of transaction-related costs and of the effects of undertakings made under agreements entered into with EUROAPI setting out the principles and terms of the legal reorganization carried out ahead of the date of deconsolidation. The principal undertakings made to EUROAPI relate to compensation for: -environmental remediation obligations on non-operational chemical sites in France transferred to EUROAPI, amounting to \u20ac14 million, and -regulatory compliance costs relating to certain state-of-the-art active pharmaceutical ingredients of EUROAPI, capped at \u20ac15 million.EUROAPI - Loss of control and accounting implications On March 17, 2022, the Sanofi Board of Directors approved a decision to put to a shareholder vote the proposed distribution in kind of approximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI, thereby confirming Sanofi's commitment (announced in February 2020) to discontinue its active pharmaceutical ingredient operations. As part of the same corporate action and on the same date, Sanofi entered into an investment agreement with EPIC Bpifrance, which undertook to acquire from Sanofi - via the French Tech Souverainet\u00e9 fund - a 12% equity interest in EUROAPI at a price not exceeding \u20ac150 million and to be determined on the basis of the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of EUROAPI shares on the Euronext Paris regulated market over the thirty-day period starting from the date of initial listing, i.e. May 6, 2022. On completion of those transactions, Sanofi holds an equity interest of 30.1% in EUROAPI, which it has undertaken to retain for at least two years from the date of the distribution, subject to the customary exceptions. With effect from that date, Sanofi exercises significant influence over EUROAPI as a result of (i) its equity interest, and (ii) having one representative on the EUROAPI Board of Directors. On May 3, 2022, the General Meeting of Sanofi shareholders approved the decision of the Board of Directors to distribute approximately 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI in the form of an exceptional dividend in kind. On May 10, 2022, the payment date of the dividend in kind in the days following the admission to listing of EUROAPI shares, those Sanofi shareholders who had retained their Sanofi shares received 1 EUROAPI share per 23 Sanofi shares, representing in total 57.88% of the share capital of EUROAPI. As of that date, Sanofi lost control over the EUROAPI entities, based on an assessment of the criteria specified in IFRS 10 (Consolidated financial statements). The assets and liabilities of EUROAPI, which since March 17, 2022 had been presented as assets and liabilities held for sale within the Sanofi statement of financial position in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-Current Assets Held for Sale), were deconsolidated. In addition, because EUROAPI operations do not constitute a discontinued operation under IFRS 5, the contribution from EUROAPI has not been presented within separate line items in the income statement and statement of cash flows or in information for prior comparative periods. The contribution of EUROAPI operations to the consolidated net sales of Sanofi in the year ended December 31, 2021 was \u20ac486 million. The principal consequences of the deconsolidation of EUROAPI are described below: These elements collectively resulted in a pre-tax loss on deconsolidation of \u20ac3 million, presented within the line item Other gains and losses, and litigation in the income statement. The tax effect of the deconsolidation was a net gain of \u20ac111 million, presented within the line item Income tax expense in the income statement. The cash impact of the deconsolidation of EUROAPI, presented within the line item Disposals of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the statement of cash flows, was a net cash inflow of \u20ac101 million. Sanofi has entered into an agreement with EUROAPI for the manufacture and supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediates and other substances, which took effect on October 1, 2021 and expires five years after the loss of control. Under the terms of the agreement, Sanofi committed to target annual net sales of approximately \u20ac300 million for a list of specified active ingredients until the agreement expires in 2026. As of December 31, 2022, that commitment amounted to \u20ac1.1 billion. With effect from the date of deconsolidation, the 30.1% equity interest in EUROAPI is accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 (Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures), and the share of EUROAPI profits or losses arising from application of the equity method is excluded from \"Business operating income\", the non-IFRS financial indicator used internally by Sanofi to measure the performance of its operating segments.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-33 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022D.2.

As of the end of the post-closing acceptance period on April 29, 2021, Sanofi held 97.39% of the share capital of Kiadis, and proceeded to buy out the remaining non-controlling shareholders. As of December 31, 2022, Sanofi held 100% of the share capital of Kiadis. Sanofi elected to apply the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition given that the principal asset (the K-NK technology platform) concentrates substantially all of the fair value of the acquired set of activities and assets. Of the total acquisition price paid, \u20ac339 million was allocated to Other intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38.

Acquisition of Translate Bio On August 3, 2021, Sanofi entered into a definitive agreement with Translate Bio, a clinical-stage mRNA therapeutics company, under which Sanofi was to acquire all outstanding shares of Translate Bio for $38 per share. The Sanofi and Translate Bio Boards of Directors unanimously approved the transaction. The acquisition of Translate Bio by Sanofi was completed on September 14, 2021, with Sanofi holding the entire share capital of Translate Bio upon expiration of the squeeze-out procedure.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-34 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The final purchase price allocation, as presented in the table below, led to the recognition of goodwill of \u20ac2,118 million: The other intangible assets mainly comprise a messenger RNA technological platform applied to the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents. Goodwill mainly represents the effects of expected future synergies and other benefits to be derived from the integration of Translate Bio into the Sanofi group, in particular by accelerating the delivery of development programs. The goodwill generated on this acquisition did not give rise to any deduction for income tax purposes.Translate Bio has no commercial operations. The impact of this acquisition as reflected within the line item Acquisitions of consolidated undertakings and investments accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated statement of cash flows is a net cash outflow of \u20ac2,333 million.

As of the date when Sanofi obtained control of Translate Bio, that interest was remeasured at the purchase price of $38 per share. The change in fair value was recognized within Other comprehensive income , in accordance with paragraph 42 of IFRS 3 (see Note D.7.). Acquisition of Kadmon On September 8, 2021, Sanofi entered into a definitive merger agreement with Kadmon, a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and markets transformative therapies for disease areas with significant unmet medical needs.

The Sanofi and Kadmon Boards of Directors unanimously approved the transaction. The acquisition of Kadmon by Sanofi was completed on November 9, 2021, with Sanofi holding the entire share capital of Kadmon upon expiration of the squeeze-out procedure. Sanofi elected to apply the optional test to identify concentration of fair value under paragraph B7A of IFRS 3.

As from that date, in accordance with the Investor Agreement as amended in early 2014, Sanofi had the right to designate a member of the Regeneron Board of Directors. On May 29, 2020, Sanofi closed the transaction announced on May 25, 2020 involving the sale of its equity investment in Regeneron (with the exception of 400,000 shares), through (i) a registered public offering in the United States and internationally and (ii) a share repurchase by Regeneron. Sanofi divested 13 million shares of Regeneron common stock (of which 10.6 million were sold by Sanofi) through the public offering at a price of $515 per share, raising a total amount of $6,703 million; and Regeneron repurchased 9.8 million of its own shares of common stock directly from Sanofi for $5,000 million, at the offer price less a subscription discount ($509.85 per share). The total sale proceeds (before transaction-related costs) amounted to \u20ac10,575 million. At the same time, Sanofi as a result of this transaction lost the right to designate a member of the Regeneron Board of Directors under the amended Investor Agreement. Finally, as of May 29, 2020 Sanofi retained ownership of 400,000 Regeneron shares in order to continue to partially fund its commitments to invest in the development programs for cemiplimab (REGN2810) and dupilumab, in line with the 2018 Letter Agreement under which Sanofi is permitted to sell up to 1.4 million shares through the end of 2020.

Sanofi's equity investment in Regeneron was accounted for by the equity method until May 29, 2020. As of that date, the carrying amount of the investment was \u20ac3,668 million; that amount was reversed out on closing of the transaction. Before tax effects, the gain on the divestment amounted to \u20ac7,382 million, including (i) a gain of \u20ac318 million arising on the currency translation reserve associated with Regeneron, which was taken to profit or loss in accordance with IAS 21; (ii) the deduction of transaction-related costs of \u20ac64 million; and (iii) a gain of \u20ac157 million on the remeasurement of the 400,000 retained shares at their quoted market price as of May 29, 2020 ($612.81). In accordance with IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), the retained shares were classified in the \"Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\" category on the transaction date, at a value of \u20ac221 million (see Note D.7.). The tax charge arising on the transaction was \u20ac502 million. Given the material impact of this transaction, and to facilitate users' understanding of the financial statements, the pre-tax gain on this transaction is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated income statement, \"Gain on Regeneron investment arising from the transaction of May 29, 2020\". The net cash inflow from the transaction was \u20ac10,370 million, which (for the reason cited above) is presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows, \"Net proceeds from sale of Regeneron shares on May 29, 2020\".

Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Goodwill In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) at a level corresponding to the Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines segments. When testing goodwill annually for impairment, the recoverable amount is determined for each segment on the basis of value in use, determined using discounted estimates of the future cash flows in accordance with the policies described in Note B.6.1. The allocation of goodwill as of December 31, 2022 is shown below: the perpetual growth rates applied to future cash flows were zero for the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines segments, and 1% for the Consumer Healthcare segment; Sanofi also applies assumptions on the probability of success of current research and development projects, and more generally on its ability to renew the product portfolio in the longer term. changes in the discount rate; changes in the perpetual growth rate; and fluctuations in operating margin. a discount rate up to 2.6 percentage points above the rates actually used; or a perpetual growth rate up to 4.3 percentage points below the rates actually used; or an operating margin up to 6.7 percentage points below the rates actually used.(\u20ac million) Pharmaceuticals Consumer Healthcare Vaccines Total Goodwill 39,421 6,690 3,781 49,892 The value in use of each segment was determined by applying an after-tax discount rate to estimated future after-tax cash flows. A separate discount rate is used for each segment to reflect the specific economic conditions of that segment.The rates used for impairment testing in 2022 were 7.25% for the Pharmaceuticals segment, 7.00% for the Consumer Healthcare segment and 7.25% for the Vaccines segment; an identical value in use for Sanofi as a whole would be obtained by applying a uniform 7.2% rate to all three segments. The pre-tax discount rates applied to estimated pre-tax cash flows are calculated by iteration from the previously-determined value in use. Those pre-tax discount rates were 9.9% for the Pharmaceuticals segment, 9.4% for the Consumer Healthcare segment and 9.9% for the Vaccines segment, and equate to a uniform rate of 9.8% for Sanofi as a whole. The assumptions used in testing goodwill for impairment are reviewed annually. Apart from the discount rate, the principal assumptions used in 2022 were as follows: Value in use (determined as described above) is compared with the carrying amount, and this comparison is then subjected to sensitivity analyses by reference to the principal parameters, including: No impairment of goodwill would need to be recognized in the event of a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used in 2022. A value in use calculation for each of the segments would not result in an impairment loss using: No impairment losses were recognized against goodwill in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. Other intangible assets When there is evidence that an asset may have become impaired, the asset's value in use is calculated by applying an after-tax discount rate to the estimated future after-tax cash flows from that asset. For the purposes of impairment testing, the tax cash flows relating to the asset are determined using a notional tax rate incorporating the notional tax benefit that would result from amortizing the asset if its value in use were regarded as its depreciable amount for tax purposes. Applying after-tax discount rates to after-tax cash flows gives the same values in use as would be obtained by applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows. mid-term and long-term forecasts; perpetual growth or attrition rates, when applicable; and probability of success of current research and development projects.The after-tax discount rates used in 2022 for impairment testing of other intangible assets in the Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Healthcare and Vaccines segments were obtained by adjusting Sanofi's weighted average cost of capital to reflect specific country and business risks, giving after-tax discount rates in a range from 7.25% to 8.25%. In most instances, there are no market data that would enable fair value less costs to sell to be determined other than by means of developing a similar estimate based on future cash flows. Consequently, recoverable amount is in substance equal to value in use. The estimates used to determine value in use are sensitive to assumptions specific to the nature of the asset and to Sanofi's activities. Apart from the discount rate, the principal assumptions used in 2022 were as follows: The assumptions used in testing intangible assets for impairment are reviewed at least annually.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-44 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022In 2022, 2021 and 2020, impairment testing of other intangible assets (excluding software) resulted in the recognition of net impairment losses as shown below: -the \u20ac600m reversal relating to the BIVV001 project (see above).

Net deferred tax position An analysis of the net deferred tax position is set forth below: The reserves of Sanofi subsidiaries that would be taxable if distributed but for which no distribution is planned, and for which no deferred tax liability has therefore been recognized, totaled \u20ac10.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared with \u20ac10.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac11.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Most of Sanofi's tax loss carry-forwards are available indefinitely. For a description of policies on the recognition of deferred tax assets, refer to Note B.22. For each tax consolidation, the recognition of deferred tax assets is determined on the basis of profit forecasts that are consistent with Sanofi's medium-term strategic plan, and taking into consideration the tax consequences of the strategic opportunities available to Sanofi within the period of availability of tax loss carry-forwards and the specific circumstances of each tax consolidation. Deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry-forwards as of December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac2,650 million, of which \u20ac1,144 million were not recognized (including \u20ac488 million in respect of capital losses). This compares with \u20ac2,391 million as of December 31, 2021 (of which \u20ac875 million were not recognized) and \u20ac1,658 million as of December 31, 2020 (of which \u20ac331 million were not recognized). The table below shows when tax losses available for carry-forward are due to expire: (\u20ac million) Tax losses available for carry-forward(a) 2023 \u2014 2024 3 2025 21 2026 28 2027 102 2028 and later 8,349 Total as of December 31, 2022 8,503 Total as of December 31, 2021 7,644 Total as of December 31, 2020 6,515 Use of tax loss carry-forwards is limited to the entity in which they arose. In jurisdictions where tax consolidations are in place, tax losses can be netted against taxable income generated by entities in the same tax consolidation. Deferred tax assets not recognized (primarily because their future recovery was not regarded as probable given the expected results of the entities in question) amounted to \u20ac995 million in 2022, \u20ac615 million in 2021 and \u20ac346 million in 2020.NOTES THE CONSOLIDATED F-51 FORM 20-F million) 2022 2021 adjustments (intragroup margin in inventory) 1,388 1,292 Provision for pensions and other employee benefits 850 1,117 Remeasurement of other acquired intangible assets (3,269) (a)(3,079) Recognition of acquired property, plant and equipment at fair value (24) (26) Equity interests in subsidiaries and investments in other entities(b)(617) (590) Tax losses available for carry-forward 1,506 1,516 Stock options and other share-based payments 92 88 Accrued expenses and provisions deductible at the time of payment(c)1,859 1,585 Other 1,755 asset/(lia bility ) 3,540 (a) As of December 31, 2022, includes remeasurements of the acquired intangible assets of (\u20ac118 million). (b) In some countries, Sanofi is liable for withholding taxes and other tax charges when dividends are distributed. Consequently, Sanofi recognizes a deferred tax liability on the reserves of French and foreign subsidiaries (approximately \u20ac59.1 billion) which it regards as likely to be distributed in the foreseeable future. In determining the amount of the deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2022, Sanofi took into account changes in the ownershipstructure of certain subsidiaries, and the effects of changes in the taxation of dividends in France, following the ruling of the Court of Justice of theEuropean Union in the Steria case and the resulting amendments to the 2015 Finance Act. (c) Includes deferred tax assets related to restructuring provisions, amounting to \u20ac256 million as of December 31, 2022, \u20ac307 million as of December 31, 2021, and \u20ac259 million as of December 31, 2020.

Such carry-forwards amounted to \u20ac5 million as of December 31, 2022, \u20ac5 million as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac6 million as of December 31, 2020.D.15. Consolidated shareholders' equity D.15.1. Share capital As of December 31, 2022, the share capital was \u20ac2,521,671,464, consisting of 1,260,835,732 shares with a par value of \u20ac2.

In 2022, all stock options were taken into account in computing diluted earnings per share because they all had a dilutive effect. In both 2021 and 2020, 0.6 million stock options were not taken into account in computing diluted earnings per share because they had no dilutive effect. D.16.

The maturity of one facility has been extended to December 3, 2023 following the exercise of an extension option in June 2022, and the maturity of the other has been extended to December 6, 2027 following the exercise of an extension option in September 2022. Sanofi does not have any further extension options available for either facility. In line with Sanofi's commitment to embed sustainable development in the \"Play to Win\" strategy, the two revolving credit facilities build in an adjustment mechanism that links the credit spread to the attainment of two sustainable development performance indicators: Sanofi's contribution to polio eradication, and the reduction in Sanofi's carbon footprint.

(d) The \"Other\" column mainly relates to the contingent consideration liability due to True North Therapeutics as a result of Sanofi's acquisition of Bioverativ which was settled in the first half of 2021.the MSD contingent consideration liability arising from the 2016 acquisition of the Sanofi Pasteur activities carried on within the former Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture, which amounted to \u20ac204 million as of December 31, 2022, \u20ac269 million as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac312 million as of December 31, 2020 (see Note D.12.). The fair value of this contingent consideration is determined by applying the royalty percentage stipulated in the contract to discounted sales projections. If the discount rate were to fall by one percentage point, the fair value of the MSD contingent consideration liability would increase by approximately 1%; a contingent consideration liability towards Shire Human Genetic Therapies Inc. (Shire) arising from Sanofi's acquisition of Translate Bio in September 2021. In a December 2016 business combination predating the acquisition of control by Sanofi, Translate Bio (then called Rana Therapeutics, Inc.) acquired from Shire the intellectual property rights relating to the latter's Messenger RNA Therapeutics (MRT) program. As of December 31, 2022, Shire was entitled to receive the following potential payments: -milestone payments contingent on the launch of products based on MRT technology, and on the attainment of a specified level of sales of those products, and -a percentage of sales of those products. The fair value of the Shire liability was measured at \u20ac380 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with \u20ac354 million as of December 31, 2021; it was determined by applying the contractual terms to development and sales projections which wereweighted to reflect the probability of success, and discounted. If the discount rate were to fall by one percentage point, thefair value of the Shire liability would increase by approximately 13%;The fair value of this liability was measured at \u20ac26 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with \u20ac59 million as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac104 million as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of the Bayer liability is determined by applying the contractual terms to sales projections which have been weighted to reflect the probability of success, and discounted. If the discount rate were to fall by one percentage point, the fair value of the Bayer liability would increase by approximately 1%; the contingent consideration liability arising from the 2022 acquisition of Amunix. The fair value of the liability is determined on the basis of the nominal value of payments due subject to the attainment of specified development milestones; these are weighted to reflect the probability of success, and discounted. The liability was measured at \u20ac165 million as of December 31, 2022. If the discount rate were to fall by one percentage point, the fair value of the liability would increase by approximately 1%. The table below sets forth the maximum amount of contingent consideration payable in respect of already-marketed products: The nominal amount of contingent consideration was \u20ac689 million as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac1,043 million as of December 31, 2020.

Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits Sanofi offers its employees pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. The specific features of the plans (benefit formulas, fund investment policy and fund assets held) vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations in each country where the employees work. These employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 (see Note B.23.). Sanofi's pension obligations in four major countries represented approximately 89% of the total value of the defined-benefit obligation and approximately 88% of the total value of plan assets as of December 31, 2022. The features of the principal defined-benefit plans in each of those four countries are described below. France Lump-sum retirement benefit plans All employees working for Sanofi in France are entitled on retirement to a lump-sum payment, the amount of which depends both on their length of service and on the rights guaranteed by collective and internal agreements. The employee's final salary is used in calculating the amount of these lump-sum retirement benefits. These plans represent approximately 35% of Sanofi's total obligation in France.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-66 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(a) In the case of \"Provisions pensions and other post-employment benefits\", the \"Increases in provisions\" line corresponds to rights vesting in employees during the period, and past service cost; the \"Provisions utilized\" line corresponds to contributions paid into pension funds and to beneficiaries; andthe \"Reversals of unutilized provisions\" line corresponds to plan curtailments, settlements and amendments. (b) Includes the impact of the April 2021 IFRIC agenda decision on the allocation of benefits to service periods, as described in Note A.2.1. to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.\"qualified\" plans within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which provide guaranteed benefits to eligible employees during retirement, and in the event of death or disability. Employees can elect to receive a reduced annuity, in exchange for an annuity to be paid in the event of their death to a person designated by them. An annuity is also granted under the plan if the employee dies before retirement age. Eligible employees do not pay any contributions. These plans are closed to new entrants, and the vesting of rights for future service periods is partially frozen. These plans represent approximately 60% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United States; \"non-qualified\" plans within the meaning of ERISA provide top-up retirement benefits to some eligible employees depending on the employee's level of responsibility and subject to a salary cap. These plans represent approximately 14% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United States.Defined-benefit pension plans These plans provide benefits from the date of retirement. Employees must fulfil a number of criteria to be eligible for these benefits. All of these plans are now closed. These plans represent approximately 65% of Sanofi's total obligation in France. Germany Top-up defined-benefit pension plan The benefits offered under this pension plan are wholly funded by the employer (there are no employee contributions) via a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA), under which benefits are estimated on the basis of a career average salary. Employees are entitled to receive an annuity under this plan if their salary exceeds the social security ceiling. The amount of the pension is calculated by reference to a range of vesting rates corresponding to salary bands. The plan also includes disability and death benefits. This plan represents approximately 62% of Sanofi's total obligation in Germany. Sanofi-Aventis plus (SAV plus) A top-up pension plan (SAV plus) replaced a previous top-up defined-benefit plan. New entrants joining the plan after April 1, 2015 contribute to a defined-contribution plan that is partially funded via the company's CTA. All employees whose salary exceeds the social security ceiling are automatically covered by the plan. The employer's contribution is 15% of the amount by which the employee's salary exceeds the social security ceiling. Multi-employer plan (Pensionskasse) This is a defined-benefit plan treated as a defined-contribution plan, in accordance with the accounting policies described in Note B.23. Currently, contributions cover the level of annuities. Only the portion relating to the future revaluation of the annuities is included in the defined-benefit pension obligation. The obligation relating to this revaluation amounted to \u20ac652 million as of December 31, 2022, versus \u20ac877 million as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac773 million as of December 31, 2020. This plan represents approximately 24% of Sanofi's total defined-benefit obligation in Germany. United States Defined-benefit pension plans In the United States, there are two types of defined-benefit plan: Healthcare cover and life insurance Sanofi companies provide some eligible employees with healthcare cover and life insurance during the retirement period (the company's contributions are capped at a specified level). These plans represent approximately 26% (or \u20ac409 million) of Sanofi's total obligation and 3% (or \u20ac28 million) of total plan assets in the United States. United Kingdom Defined-benefit pension plans Sanofi operates a number of pension plans in the United Kingdom that reflect past acquisitions. The most significant arrangements are defined-benefit plans that have been closed since October 1, 2015. With effect from that date, employees can no longer pay into these plans. Under these defined-benefit plans, an annuity is paid from the retirement date. This annuity is calculated on the basis of the employee's length of service as of September 30, 2015, and of the employee's final salary (or salary on the date he or she leaves Sanofi). The rates used for the vesting of rights vary from member to member. For most members, rights vest at the rate of 1.25% or 1.50% of final salary for each qualifying year of service giving entitlement. The notional retirement age varies according to the category to which the member belongs, but in most cases retirement is at age 65. Members may choose to retire before or after the notional retirement age (60 years), in which case the amount of the annual pension is adjusted to reflect the revised estimate of the length of the retirement phase. Pensions are usually indexed to the Retail Price Index (RPI). Members paid a fixed-percentage contribution into their pension plan (the percentage varied according to the employee category), and the employer topped up the contribution to the required amount. These plans represent approximately 100% of Sanofi's total obligation in the United Kingdom. For service periods subsequent to October 1, 2015, employees belong to a new defined-contribution plan.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-67 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Actuarial assumptions used to measure Sanofi's obligations Actuarial valuations of Sanofi's benefit obligations were computed by management with assistance from external actuaries as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

To this end, Sanofi uses an asset-liability management strategy, matching plan assets to its pension obligations. This policy aims to ensure the best fit between the assets held on the one hand, and the associated liabilities and expected future payments to plan members on the other. To meet this aim, Sanofi operates a risk monitoring and management strategy (mainly focused on interest rate risk and inflation risk), while investing a growing proportion of assets in high-quality bonds with comparable maturities to those of the underlying obligations and in contracts entered into with leading insurance companies to fund certain post-employment benefit obligations.NOTES TO THE

The two lead molecules are DNL747 in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and DNL758 in systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis;commit ments received amounting to \u20ac8.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac5.8 billion as of December 31, 2021), mainly comprising research, development and commercialization agreements with partners further to the acquisitions of Ablynx for \u20ac1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021) and of Kymab for \u20ac0.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac0.5 billion as of December 31, 2021), plus contingent consideration receivable based on attainment of regulatory and sales milestones for commercialized products under the terms of licenses or rights assignment agreements amounting to \u20ac7.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac4.2 billion as of December 31, 2021). The major agreements entered into by Sanofi in 2022 are described below: Th e amount of commitments as of December 31, 2022 also includes commitments under agreements entered into by Sanofi in prior years, the principal ones of which are described below:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-80 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022MedImmune (a division of AstraZeneca) (2017): agreement to develop and commercialize a monoclonal antibody (MEDI8897) for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) associated illness in newborns and infants; Innate Pharma (2016): collaboration and licensing agreement to apply Innate Pharma's new proprietary technology to the development of innovative bispecific antibody formats engaging natural killer (NK) cells to kill tumor cells through the activating receptor NKp46; Eli Lilly and Company (2014): agreement to pursue regulatory approval for non-prescription Cialis\u00ae (tadalafil). in October 2022, Sanofi and DiCE Molecules ended their global collaboration to discover potential new therapeutics for up to 12 targets that encompass all disease areas of strategic interest to Sanofi; and in December 2022, Sanofi and Revolution Medicines agreed, after a transitional phase, to end their partnership agreement in oncology signed in 2018.Sanofi and its alliance partners have decided to terminate the following agreements (the related commitments are no longer included in Sanofi's off balance sheet disclosures as of December 31, 2022): In addition, under the collaboration agreement with Regeneron on monoclonal antibodies (see Note C.1.), Sanofi is entitled to receive an additional share of quarterly profits (capped at 10% of Regeneron's share of quarterly profits until March 31, 2022, and thereafter at 20%), until Regeneron has paid 50% of the cumulative development costs incurred by the parties to the alliance. As of December 31, 2022 this represented total commitments received of \u20ac2.7 billion (versus \u20ac2.9 billion as of December 31, 2021), against cumulative development costs of \u20ac8.4 billion. Sanofi entered into an agreement with Royalty Pharma in December 2014 relating to development programs under which Royalty Pharma bears a portion of the remaining development costs of the project on a quarterly basis in return for royalties on future sales. This transaction is a co-investment, whereby the partner acquires an interest in the jointly-developed product by providing funding towards the development program. Consequently, the amounts received by Sanofi are recorded as a reduction in development costs, to the extent that the development costs incurred by Sanofi are recognized in profit or loss in accordance with the policies described in Note B.4.1. The products in development under the December 2014 agreement with Royalty Pharma have been launched in the United States and Europe, marking the end of the joint development programs. On February 27, 2017, Sanofi and Lonza announced a strategic partnership in the form of a joint venture (BioAtrium AG) to build and operate a large-scale mammalian cell culture facility for monoclonal antibody production in Visp, Switzerland. An initial investment of approximately \u20ac0.3 billion to finance construction of the facility, split 50/50 between the two partners, has now been made in full. In addition, Sanofi could pay BioAtrium AG in the region of \u20ac0.6 billion over the next fifteen years as its share of operating expenses and the cost of producing future batches. In February 2014, pursuant to the \"Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework for the sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits\" (still effective as of December 31, 2022), Sanofi Pasteur and the World Health Organization (WHO) signed a bilateral \"Standard Material Transfer Agreement\" (SMTA 2). This agreement stipulates that Sanofi Pasteur will, during declared pandemic periods, (i) donate 7.5% of its real-time production of pandemic vaccines against any strain with potential to cause a pandemic, and (ii) reserve a further 7.5% of such production on affordable terms. The agreement cancels and replaces all preceding commitments to donate pandemic vaccines to the WHO. D.21.2. Off balance sheet commitments relating to financing activities Credit facilities Undrawn credit facilities are as follows: As of December 31, 2022, total credit facilities amounted to \u20ac8,000 million (versus \u20ac8,000 million as of December 31, 2021 and \u20ac8,000 million as of December 31, 2020). Guarantees The table below shows the amount of guarantees given and received:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-81 SANOFI FORM 20-F 31, 2022 1 year1 to 3 years3 to 5 yearsMore than 5 years General-purpose credit facilities 8,000 4,000 \u2014 4,000 \u2014 (\u20ac million) 2022 2021 2020 Guarantees given: 3,815 3,794 3,291 Guarantees provided banks in connection with credit facilities 1,007 1,042 695 Other guarantees (1,229) (1,149) (964) D.21.3. Off balance sheet commitments relating to asset acquisitions and divestments, and to changes in the scope of consolidation As of December 31, 2022, Sanofi had received commitments amounting in aggregate to \u20ac1.0 billion in respect of (i) divestments of assets relating to transactions not yet finalized as of that date and (ii) contingent consideration arising under past agreements. provisions for product liability risks, litigation and other amount to \u20ac1,652 million in 2022. These provisions are mainly related to product liabilities, government investigations, competition law, regulatory claims, warranties in connection with certain contingent liabilities arising from business divestitures other than environmental matters and other claims; provisions for environmental risks and remediation amount to \u20ac526 million in 2022, the majority of which are related to contingencies that have arisen from business divestitures.Off balance sheet commitments of a financing nature with associates and joint ventures are disclosed in Note D.6. The maximum amount of contingent consideration relating to business combinations is disclosed in Note D.18. D.22. Legal and arbitral proceedings Sanofi and its affiliates are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings. These proceedings typically are related to product liability claims, intellectual property rights (particularly claims against generic companies seeking to limit the patent protection of Sanofi products), competition law and trade practices, commercial claims, employment and wrongful discharge claims, tax assessment claims, waste disposal and pollution claims, and claims under warranties or indemnification arrangements relating to business divestitures. Provisions related to legal and arbitral proceedings are recorded in accordance with the principles described in Note B.12. Most of the issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject to substantial uncertainties; therefore, the probability of loss and an estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. Contingent liabilities are cases for which either we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceeding, or a cash outflow is not probable. In either case, a brief description of the nature of the contingent liability is disclosed and, where practicable, an estimate of its financial effect, an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount and timing of any outflow, and the possibility of any reimbursement are provided in application of paragraph 86 of IAS 37. In the cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and penalties have been assessed, we have indicated our losses or the amount of provision accrued that is the estimate of the probable loss. In a limited number of ongoing cases, while we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the expected loss or range of the possible loss and have accrued a provision for such loss, we believe that publication of this information on a case-by-case basis or by class would seriously prejudice the Company's position in the ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in those cases, we have disclosed information with respect to the nature of the contingency but have not disclosed our estimate of the range of potential loss, in accordance with paragraph 92 of IAS 37. These assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. We believe that the aggregate provisions recorded for the above matters are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent uncertainties related to these cases and involved in estimating contingent liabilities, we could in the future incur judgments that could have a material adverse effect on our net income in any particular period. Long term provisions are disclosed in Note D.19. They include: a) Products Sanofi Pasteur Hepatitis B Vaccine Product Litigation Since 1996, more than 180 lawsuits have been filed in various French civil courts against Sanofi Pasteur and/or Sanofi Pasteur MSD S.N.C., the former French subsidiary of Sanofi, and the latter a joint venture company with Merck & Co., Inc. now terminated, for which past ongoing litigation is now managed by the originating party. In such lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that they suffer from a variety of neurological disorders and autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome as a result of receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. In January 2018, the Appeal Court of Bordeaux found a causal link between hepatitis B vaccine and multiple sclerosis. In July 2019, the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) cancelled the judgment of the Appeal Court of Bordeaux and referred the case back to the Appeal Court of Toulouse. On March 30, 2022, the Appeal Court of Toulouse dismissed all the plaintiff's claims. As of December 31, 2022, there were 49 ongoing lawsuits related to Sanofi Pasteur hepatitis B vaccine.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-82 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Taxotere\u00ae Product Litigation in the US As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 8,300 plaintiffs in courts across the country, with approximately 700 of those plaintiffs being spouses who have filed loss of consortium claims. Lawsuits have been filed against affiliates of Sanofi under US state law for personal injuries allegedly sustained in connection with the use of Taxotere\u00ae. The actions are held in several jurisdictions, including the federal and/or state courts of Louisiana, New Jersey, California, and Delaware. To date, there have been two bellwether trials as part of a federal multi-district litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana both resulting in jury verdicts in Sanofi's favor. It is not possible, at this stage, to reliably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential financial impact on the Company. Taxotere\u00ae - Mississippi Attorney General Litigation in the US In October 2018, the Attorney General for the State of Mississippi filed a civil action in Hinds County, Mississippi, Chancery Court against various Sanofi Defendants related to Taxotere\u00ae. The State asserts one cause of action based on the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act (\"MCPA\") and seeks a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants' conduct and civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation. Sanofi filed a motion to dismiss the entire action in Hinds County, Mississippi, Chancery Court, which is currently pending. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of this lawsuit or the potential financial impact on the Company. Zantac\u00ae Litigation in the US In September 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") announced it was investigating the claims of an online pharmacy's Citizen Petition that the medication Zantac\u00ae (the brand name for ranitidine) used for stomach heartburn contains or can generate the chemical N-Nitrosodimethylamine (\"NDMA\"), an alleged human carcinogen. As a precautionary measure, Sanofi initiated a voluntary recall of branded over-the-counter Zantac \u00ae in October 2019. Concurrent with FDA's investigation, multiple personal injury lawsuits and class actions alleging that Zantac\u00ae causes various cancers and seeking damages for either alleged personal injuries or alleged economic injuries were filed. Most of those cases have been coordinated into a Multi-District Litigation (\"MDL\") in the Southern District of Florida. On June 30 and July 8, 2021, the Federal MDL Court entered orders granting in part and denying in part Defendants' motions to dismiss various aspects of Plaintiffs' amended complaints. The rulings narrowed the scope of plaintiffs' complaints and saw the dismissal of all retailers and generic manufacturers from the MDL, leaving branded manufacturers GSK, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Sanofi as the defendants. On December 6, 2022, the MDL Court granted Sanofi and the other defendants' Daubert and Summary Judgment motions. As a result, the Court will dismiss approximately 50,000 cases involving plaintiffs' five designated cancers. We expect those plaintiffs to appeal the MDL's Court's decision. Other cases are pending in various state courts. These state court cases still include numerous retail and generics manufacturing defendants in addition to branded manufacturers. In addition, in November 2019, Sanofi received a Civil Investigative Demand (\"CID\") related to this issue from the Arizona Attorney General. In June 2020, the New Mexico Attorney General filed a complaint against Sanofi, the previous marketing authorization holders for branded Zantac \u00ae, a dozen generic manufacturers, and several retailers. The complaint brings claims for alleged violations of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, violations of the New Mexico False Advertising Act, violations of the New Mexico Public Nuisance Statute, common law public nuisance, and negligence. In June 2020, Sanofi received a notice from the US Department of Justice Civil Division and US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of an investigation into allegations that pharmaceutical manufacturers violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729, in relation to the drug Zantac \u00ae and ranitidine hydrochloride through alleged failure to disclose to the federal government information about the potential presence of NDMA. The notice requests information and documents from Sanofi including applications and communications with FDA. In November 2020, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore filed a complaint against Sanofi, the previous marketing authorization holders for branded Zantac \u00ae, generic manufacturers, and several retailers. The complaint alleges violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection statute, public nuisance, and negligence. In January 2021, Sanofi was served with the Center for Environmental Health's Second Amended Complaint alleging Proposition 65 violations. The case, which also names generic manufacturers and retailers, is pending in California Superior Court in Alameda County. Overall between State and federal filings, there are currently 3,486 product liability \"complaints\" filed. These complaints encompass 68,355 individual product liability \"plaintiffs\" who have all filed against Sanofi. The vast majority of these plaintiffs participated in the MDL Court's census registry program, allege cancers that the plaintiffs' leadership decided not to designate and pursue in the MDL, and have since filed their complaints in state courts. Additional cases may be filed. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential financial impact on Sanofi.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-83 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022Zantac\u00ae Litigation in Canada Between 2019 and 2022, 7 proposed class actions naming notably Sanofi Consumer Health Inc., Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc., Chattem (Canada) Inc., Sanofi and Sanofi Pasteur Limited as Defendants, relating to ranitidine were filed in various Canadian States court on behalf of all Canadian provinces alleging they suffered personal injury, including cancer, from the ingestion of ranitidine and are seeking general special, statutory, punitive and aggravated damages in an unspecified amount as well as disgorgement of profits. Additionally, some plaintiffs seek restitution for unjust enrichment in an amount equivalent to the purchase price of Zantac \u00ae and subrogated damages on behalf of provincial health insurers for health care costs related to ranitidine use. These actions are pending before the courts of Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario. A Certification hearing was held in the British Columbia action in October 2022 and the certification decision is under review of the Court. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential financial impact on Sanofi. Depakine\u00ae Product Litigation in France Civil proceedings As of December 31, 2022, 78 families brought a civil claim involving 131 people exposed in utero to sodium valproate against a French affiliate of Sanofi seeking indemnification under French law for personal injuries allegedly suffered by children in connection with the use of sodium valproate by their mothers during pregnancy to treat their epilepsy (Depakine \u00ae). These actions are held in several jurisdictions in France. Twenty-nine lawsuits are proceedings on the merits, the most advanced was tried at the French Supreme Court level which issued in November 2019 a ruling sending the case before the Paris Appeal Court to rule on Sanofi's argument on the compliance of the product with mandatory regulations, as well as on the question of defectiveness of the product and the assessment of damages. In January 2023, the Paris Appeal Court ordered a stay in the proceedings until the second expert opinion report is handed down in the criminal investigation (see below). Seven first instance rulings on the merits were handed down in 2022 by the Judicial Tribunal of Nanterre. In three cases, the Court declared the judicial expert report null and void and the Court dismissed one claim in another case. Concerning three other cases relating to births that occurred between 2005 and 2009, the Court held, on the basis of a non- fault liability, that Sanofi was liable in light of the wording of the patient information leaflet. Provisional compensation amounts were set in the range of \u20ac0.1 million to \u20ac0.5 million. All the judgments have been appealed. In the class action lawsuit filed in May 2017 by the APESAC (Association des Parents d'Enfants souffrant du Syndrome de l'Anti- Convulsivant) against the French affiliate, the Judicial Tribunal of Paris ruled on January 5, 2022 that a class is admissible, retaining Sanofi's liability between 1984 and January 2006 for malformations and between 2001 and January 2006 for neuro- developmental disorders (NDD). This decision is based on the conclusions of a criminal expert report within the frame of ongoing criminal proceeding, for which the Chambre de l'Instruction of the Appeal Court of Paris had ordered a counter-expertise (see below). Sanofi and its insurers appealed the Judicial Tribunal of Paris' ruling related to the class action. On July 21, 2021, a Judicial Tribunal in France dismissed a claim for damages brought against Sanofi regarding a child born in 1995. The Judicial Tribunal considered that the risk of occurrence of NDD in children born to mother exposed to sodium valproate during pregnancy was not demonstrated by the state of scientific knowledge at the time of her pregnancy. This decision was appealed and the proceeding is now pending before the Appeal Court of Paris, which had ordered a stay in the proceeding until the end of the criminal investigation. In July 2020, a collective redress against the French affiliate was filed by 63 families, seeking indemnification for a prejudice of anxiety. There is no date set for the hearing on the merits in this case yet. Criminal investigation A criminal investigation was initiated in May 2015 before the Paris Civil Court. In January 2020, the French affiliate of Sanofi was indicted for aggravated deception and involuntary injuries and in July 2020 for involuntary manslaughter. In July 2020, a judicial supervision of the affiliate was ordered, together with the implementation of financial guarantees. In November 2020, the Health Authority (ANSM) was similarly indicted for involuntary injuries and involuntary manslaughters. On March 9, 2022, the Chambre de l'Instruction of the Appeal Court of Paris ruled that certain complaints for involuntary manslaughter and several others for aggravated deception and involuntary injuries were time-barred. The Public Prosecutor, as well as the civil parties, have brought the matter before the Chambre Criminelle of the Supreme Court. In September 2022, the investigating judges appointed 2 experts for a counter-expertise following the Chambre de l'Instruction's ruling handed down end of 2021 and in October 2022 ordered 6 individual medical assessments. Public compensation scheme In 2017, the French government set up a public compensation scheme to indemnify patients for damages suffered in connection with the prescription of sodium valproate and its derivatives. The scheme was further amended through the 2020 Finance Law, with notably the introduction of presumptions of default for lack of information of the mother since 1982 for malformations and since 1984 for NDD. The scheme was amended again through the 2021 Finance Law in order to increase the maximum premium applicable in case of refusal to make an offer (or insufficient offer) which would be deemed unjustified by a court ruling.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-84 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022The committee of the compensation scheme has issued several final opinions holding the French affiliate liable for damages either in full or in part along with the French State, and, in some cases, healthcare practitioners. The French affiliate disagreed with the committee's conclusions and has accordingly not offered indemnification to the claimants who have received compensation from the ONIAM (Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents M\u00e9dicaux) . The ONIAM is now seeking reimbursement from Sanofi who has filed legal actions to oppose ONIAM's payment orders. Sanofi has also been notified of 63 exposed persons who have filed a request for indemnification before the public compensation scheme and who are also claimants against Sanofi in individual judicial proceedings (summary proceedings or actions on the merits). Administrative Actions In July 2020, March and June 2021, the Montreuil Administrative Court had held the French State liable in 5 administrative proceedings initiated by families against the State. In March 2021, the Administrative Court did not retain any lack of information of the mother regarding the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for births in 1999 and in 2002, based on the state of scientific knowledge at the time. However, regarding the risk of malformations, liabilities were retained against the State, the healthcare professionals and Sanofi, notably for discrepancy between the SmPC (Summary of the Product Characteristics) and the patient leaflet. In other cases involving births in 2005-2008, the liability of the State was retained for both malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, and partially exonerated, taking into account the roles of healthcare practitioners and Sanofi. Given that the French affiliate was not a party to these administrative proceedings, its arguments (i.e. notably several requests from the French affiliate to the Health Authorities to reinforce warnings to healthcare professionals and patients in relation to Depakine \u00ae) were not considered. All rulings were appealed by the claimants. Sanofi has filed requests for voluntary intervention in these proceedings to present its arguments before the Administrative Court of Appeal. In one proceeding, the claimants decided to withdraw their claims. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of these cases or the potential financial impact on the Company. Depakine\u00ae Product Litigation in other EU countries and in the UK In Switzerland, 10 families have filed a civil claim for damages concerning 16 people exposed in utero. Some of them also involve the claimants' physicians. In November 2022, one action was declared time-barred by the judge. The claimant appealed this court decision on the merit. The appeal is on-going. In Spain, there are 4 trials ongoing relating to 10 children. In March 2022, in one of the trials, the Court condemned Sanofi to indemnify 4 patients. Sanofi appealed this decision. In January 2023, in another trial filed by one patient, the Appeal Court confirmed the first instance's decision and dismissed the claim. The other actions are still at a preliminary stage. In Belgium, there are 2 civil proceedings (currently on hold) and a criminal complaint against X and against Sanofi.In Germany, there is one civil lawsuit before the Berlin Regional Court, relating to one child exposed in utero to valproate taken by the mother during pregnancy for bipolar disorder.In Ireland, there are 2 Pre-Action Protocol cases and 2 civil claims on-going.In the United Kingdom, there are 3 Pre-Action Protocol cases in Great Britain and 1 Pre-Action Protocol case in Northern Ireland on-going. It is not possible, at this stage, to assess reliably the outcome of these cases or the potential financial impact on the Company. Dengvaxia\u00ae (Philippines) Since early 2018 up to present date, several claims were filed in the Philippines by parents of deceased children whose deaths were allegedly due to vaccination with Dengvaxia\u00ae. Early March 2019, 2020 and 2022, the Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecution panel announced it had found probable cause to indict several Sanofi employees/former employees and former Government officials for \"reckless imprudence\" resulting in homicides. Since then, several criminal actions have been filed in court as a result of this finding. Petitions for Review to the DOJ Secretary have been filed and the said petitions remain pending. Meanwhile, the majority of the respondents have challenged the jurisdiction of the lower court where the first 8 cases had been assigned and this issue is now filed with the Supreme Court. There are several claims that have not yet been filed in any court despite resolutions by the DOJ that there is probable cause. b) Patents Ramipril Canada Patent Litigation Sanofi was involved in a number of legal proceedings involving companies which market generic Altace\u00ae (ramipril) in Canada. In 2004, Sanofi unsuccessfully brought Notice of Compliance proceedings (NOC proceedings) at the end of which eight manufacturers obtained marketing authorizations from the Canadian Minister of Health for generic versions of ramipril in Canada. Sanofi filed unsuccessful patent infringement actions against all those companies and ultimately Sanofi was liable for damages under Section 8. Sanofi made payment in complete satisfaction of those awards. In June 2011, Apotex commenced an action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice asserting damages under the Ontario Statute of Monopolies, the UK Statute of Monopolies, and the Trade-marks Act (the \"Ontario Action\").NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-85 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022At the request of the parties, in June 2021, the Court ordered that the action be stayed in view of the lower court's decision in March in the Apotex vs. Lilly case. In the Lilly case, the Court dismissed Apotex's Statute of Monopolies claim by way of summary judgment. If upheld on appeal, this decision may end Apotex's claim against Sanofi, also based on the Statute of Monopolies. In November 2022, Apotex filed an application for leave to appeal the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in the Lilly case with the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court will decide whether to grant the leave application in late Q1 2023. Praluent\u00ae (alirocumab)-related Amgen Patent Litigation in the US In 2014, Amgen filed four separate complaints against Sanofi and Regeneron in the US District Court for the District of Delaware (\"District Court\") asserting patent infringement relating to Sanofi and Regeneron's Praluent \u00ae product. Together these complaints alleged that Praluent\u00ae infringed seven patents for antibodies targeting PCSK9 and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In February 2021, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling invalidating the Amgen asserted patent claims. In November 2021, Amgen filed a petition with the US Supreme Court, asking it to overturn the Federal Circuit decision. On November 4, 2022, the US Supreme Court granted Amgen's petition for review. Proceedings before the US Supreme Court are now underway. Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab)-related Amgen Patent Opposition and Revocation in Europe Immunex Corporation, an Amgen affiliate, is the registered proprietor of European Patent EP2292665. The claims of this patent relate to, among other things, human monoclonal antibodies that are capable of inhibiting IL-4 induced biological activity and which compete with one of four reference antibodies for binding to a cell that expresses human IL-4R. In April 2016, Sanofi and Regeneron each filed an opposition in the European Patent Office (EPO) against EP2292665, seeking its revocation. The EPO rendered its decision in November 2017 and revoked the patent in its entirety. In September 2017, Sanofi and Regeneron filed oppositions in the EPO against Amgen's European Patent EP2990420, which is a divisional of the EP2292665 Patent discussed above. In March 2022, the European Patent Office Technical Board of Appeals (\"TBA\") ruled in Sanofi and Regeneron's favor and affirmed the invalidation of Amgen/Immunex's EP2990420 patent. In December 2022, the TBA issued its written decision in favor of Sanofi and Regeneron. Amgen/Immunex may seek review of this decision by the Enlarged Board of Appeals. In March 2022, Amgen/Immunex withdrew its appeal to the TBA for its EP2292665 patent. Jevtana\u00ae (cabazitaxel)-related patent litigation in the US Jevtana\u00ae is currently covered by four Orange Book listed patents US 7,241,907, US 8,927,592, US 10,583,110 and US 10,716,777. In May to July 2020, Sanofi filed patent infringement suits under Hatch-Waxman against 12 generic filers asserting the '110 patent and the '777 patent in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. The '592 patent was added to the suits after its amended claims issued in August 2021. In January 2021 and August 2022, the District Court issued two claim construction decisions in favor of the defendants. In September 2022, the district court issued a decision that granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part related to the '592 patent but denied the motion to dismiss in part related to the '777 and '110 patents. Sanofi has reached settlement agreements with most of the defendants and the suit against the remaining defendant Sandoz is ongoing. Sanofi has voluntarily withdrawn the '110 patent from the suit and a 3-day trial on the '777 patent was held in January 2023. Sandoz has agreed not to launch any generic cabazitaxel product until the earlier of a district court decision in favor of the defendants or 120 days after the completion of the post-trial briefing. Plavix\u00ae Litigation (Commonwealth) in Australia In August 2007, GenRX (a subsidiary of Apotex) obtained registration of a generic clopidogrel bisulfate product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. At the same time, GenRX filed a patent invalidation action with the Federal Court of Australia, seeking revocation of Sanofi's Australian enantiomer patent claiming clopidogrel salts (a \"nullity action\"). In September 2007, Sanofi obtained a preliminary injunction from the Federal Court preventing commercial launch of this generic clopidogrel bisulfate product until judgment on the substantive issues of patent validity and infringement. In August 2008, the Australian Federal Court confirmed that the claim in Sanofi's Australian enantiomer patent directed to clopidogrel bisulfate (the salt form in Plavix \u00ae) was valid and the patent infringed. On appeal, the Full Federal Court of Australia held in September 2009 that all claims in the patent are invalid. Sanofi's appeal to the Australia High Court was denied in March 2010. In April 2013, the Australian Department of Health and Ageing (\"Commonwealth\") filed an application before the Federal Court of Australia seeking payment of damages from Sanofi related to the Apotex preliminary injunction of up to AUD449 million (\u20ac286 million as of December 31, 2022), plus interest. Sanofi and BMS settled the patent litigation with Apotex in November 2014. In April 2020, the Commonwealth's claim was dismissed. In May 2020, the Commonwealth filed a Notice of Appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court. On appeal, the Commonwealth reduced its claim to a range of AUD223.3 million (\u20ac142.1 million) to AUD280.2 million (\u20ac178.4 million) which, inclusive of interest to December 31, 2022, ranges from AUD343.4 million (\u20ac218.6 million) to AUD463.6 million (\u20ac295.1 million) depending on whether interest accrues from the date the Commonwealth claims the Apotex products would have been listed on the Government reimbursement scheme in the absence of the injunction (i.e. April 1, 2008) or the date the Commonwealth filed its claim (i.e. April 1, 2013). Appeal hearing took place in February 2021 before the Full Court of the Federal Court. The ruling is expected in 2023.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-86 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022c) Other litigation Aubagio\u00ae (teriflunomide)-related litigation in Europe In October 2020, Mylan Ireland Ltd (\"Mylan\") brought an action before the General Court of the European Union requesting the annulment of the August 18, 2020 decision of the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\") refusing to validate Mylan's marketing authorization application for a generic version of Aubagio \u00ae (teriflunomide). Sanofi has intervened in this court case between Mylan and the EMA in order to defend Aubagio\u00ae's regulatory exclusivity. Mylan submitted a request for discontinuance of the proceedings in December 2022. The case is over. Plavix\u00ae (clopidogrel) - Attorney General Action in Hawaii In March 2014, the Hawaii Attorney General (AG) filed a complaint that sets forth allegations related to the sale and marketing of and variability of response to Plavix \u00ae. The Hawaii AG specifically alleged that Plavix\u00ae had a diminished effect in patients of certain genetic backgrounds and that Sanofi and BMS had failed to make an earlier disclosure of this information. In February 2021, the Court issued its decision, imposing penalties in the total amount of $834,012,000 against both Sanofi and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), with $417,006,000 being apportioned to each company. In June 2021, Sanofi and BMS appealed this judgment. To the extent this judgment or possibly a reduced judgment remains after the appeal, the judgment would be split evenly with BMS. On May 3, 2022, the Hawaii Supreme Court granted a request to transfer the appeal directly to the Hawaii Supreme Court, thereby eliminating review by the Hawaii intermediate Court of Appeals. The Hawaii Supreme Court had oral argument in December 2022 and a decision is expected in or around March 2023. Plavix\u00ae (clopidogrel) - Attorney General Action in New Mexico In September 2016, the New Mexico Attorney General (AG) filed a complaint, claiming that Sanofi and Bristol Meyers Squibb (BMS) engaged in unfair and deceptive practices related to the marketing and labelling of Plavix \u00ae. The New Mexico AG specifically alleged that Plavix\u00ae had a diminished effect in patients of certain genetic backgrounds and that the Companies failed to make an earlier disclosure of this information. This matter has been concluded and dismissed by way of a settlement by all parties that was finalized in Q4 2022. Plavix\u00ae (clopidogrel)-related litigation in France In France, in the claim concerning allegations that Sanofi's communication and promotional practices inhibited the entry on the market of generics of clopidogrel (the active ingredient of Plavix \u00ae), the French Antitrust Authority issued its decision on May 14, 2013, imposing on Sanofi a fine of \u20ac40.6 million. In December 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals rejected Sanofi's appeal and confirmed in totality the decision. As a consequence of the May 2013 ruling, claims were filed by Sandoz and by Teva in 2014 before the Commercial Court of Paris for compensation of their alleged damages: loss of margin and other ancillary damages (legal fees to external counsel, image and reputation). In June and November 2016 respectively, settlement agreements were entered into with Sandoz and Teva. Consequently, they subsequently withdrew their civil claims, jointly and severally. On October 18, 2016, the Supreme Court confirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. Therefore, the Court of Appeals' decision became definitive. In September 2017, Sanofi and its French affiliate received a summons before the Paris Commercial Court from the French Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie - CNAM (French Social Security) claiming \u20ac115.8 million for their alleged damages. On October 1, 2019, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed the CNAM's action as time barred. On February 9, 2022, the Paris Court of Appeals overturned the Paris Commercial Court's ruling, finding the French Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie - CNAM (French Social Security)'s action as not time-barred and designated an expert to determine the amount of damages. The expertise is on-going. 340B Drug Pricing Program in the United States Sanofi is currently involved in several matters relating to the 340B program in the US (a federal program that requires drug manufacturers to supply certain products to certain \"covered entities\" at reduced prices). In 2021, Sanofi filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), the Health Resources and Services Administration (\"HRSA\"), and certain of their administrators in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey challenging (i) HHS's December 2020 Advisory Opinion (the \"AO\") stating that drug manufacturers are legally obligated to deliver discounts under the 340B program to an unlimited number of contract pharmacies; (ii) HHS's December 2020 Administrative Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\") Rule; and (iii) HRSA's May 2021 letter to Sanofi concluding that Sanofi's 340B integrity initiative (under which Sanofi collects limited, de-identified, claims data on 340B-priced drugs dispensed by contract pharmacies) violates section 340B and that Sanofi has therefore \"overcharged\" certain covered entities. The court issued its opinion in November 2021, upholding HRSA's conclusion in the May 2021 letter, but did not impose any fines, penalties or refund obligations against Sanofi for any \"overcharges\". The court also rejected Sanofi's challenge to the ADR Rule and dismissed its challenge to the AO as moot. Sanofi appealed the court's decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the government filed a cross-appeal. The Third Circuit issued its opinion on January 30, 2023. It held that Sanofi's restrictions on delivery to contract pharmacies do not violate Section 340B. It also enjoined HHS from enforcing against Sanofi its reading of Section 340B in the AO and the May 2021 violation letter. As to Sanofi's challenge to the ADR Rule, the Third Circuit held that HHS did not violate the Administrative Procedure Act's notice-and-comment requirement in promulgating the ADR Rule. In January 2021, the National Association of Community Health Centers (\"NACHC\") filed an ADR proceeding before HRSA on behalf of a number of covered entities, seeking to require Sanofi and AstraZeneca to supply contract pharmacies with 340B discounts without conditions. On August 10, 2022, the ADR panel granted the motions to dismiss filed both by Sanofi and AstraZeneca, holding that the Delaware district court's decision granting AstraZeneca's motion for summary judgment precluded NACHC's ADR claims against both AstraZeneca and Sanofi.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 20-F 2022In September 2021, HRSA referred Sanofi (as well as other manufacturers) to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in accordance with the 340B Program Ceiling Price and Civil Monetary Penalties Final Rule. In February 2021, the Vermont Attorney General issued a Civil Investigative Subpoena seeking certain information about Sanofi's participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Sanofi continues to cooperate with this investigation. In addition, in July 2021, Mosaic Health Inc. and Central Virginia Health Services (covered entities) filed a nationwide antitrust class action complaint against Sanofi and three other manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. Plaintiffs allege that Sanofi and the other defendants conspired to eliminate favorable 340B pricing, particularly with respect to diabetes therapies. On September 2, 2022, the court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 3, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. A motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is fully briefed and pending before the court. d) Contingencies arising from certain mergers & acquisitions transactions As a result of divestitures, the Company is subject to a number of ongoing contractual and legal obligations regarding the state of the sold businesses, their assets, and their liabilities, some of which may be subject to dispute. Aventis CropScience Retained Liabilities The sale by Aventis Agriculture S.A. and Hoechst GmbH (both legacy companies of Sanofi) of their aggregate 76% participation in Aventis CropScience Holding (ACS) to Bayer and Bayer CropScience AG (BCS), the wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer which holds the ACS shares, was effective on June 3, 2002. The Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) dated October 2, 2001, contained customary representations and warranties with respect to the sold business, as well as a number of indemnifications subject to limitation periods and caps, in particular with respect to environmental liabilities for which some outstanding claims from Bayer remain unresolved. Infraserv Hoechst Retained Liabilities By the Asset Contribution Agreement dated December 19/20, 1996, as amended in 1997, Hoechst contributed all lands, buildings, and related assets of the Hoechst site at Frankfurt Hoechst to Infraserv GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG. Infraserv Hoechst undertook to indemnify Hoechst against environmental liabilities at the Hoechst site and with respect to certain landfills. As consideration for the indemnification undertaking, Hoechst transferred to Infraserv Hoechst approximately \u20ac57 million to fund reserves. In 1997, Hoechst also agreed it would reimburse current and future Infraserv Hoechst environmental expenses up to \u20ac143 million. As a former operator of the land and as a former user of the landfills, Hoechst may ultimately be liable for costs of remedial action in excess of this amount. Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) Consumer Healthcare Liabilities Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) are involved in an ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) arbitration regarding their respective indemnification obligations for liabilities connected to ongoing US court proceedings regarding Zantac \u00ae manufactured by BI (see above - Zantac\u00ae Litigation in the US). The dispute arises from indemnification obligations agreed between Sanofi and BI as part of the swap of Sanofi's Animal Health (AH) business for BI's Consumer Health Care (CHC) business in January 2017 and under a Global Settlement Agreement concluded in September 2019 regarding notably the offset of respective AH and CHC claims notified under the SPAs. In February 2020, BI initiated an arbitration against Sanofi seeking indemnification for losses it could incur as a result of the Zantac \u00ae litigation in the US. Sanofi is disputing BI's claim for indemnification and has asserted several counterclaims under relevant agreements, including a counterclaim for indemnification of losses Sanofi and its affiliates have incurred and may incur in connection with the same US court proceedings involving Zantac \u00ae. The arbitration is expected to conclude at the earliest in March 2023.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-88 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022D.23.

The table below shows the allocation of income tax expense between current and deferred taxes: The difference between the effective tax rate and the standard corporate income tax rate applicable in France is explained as follows: For the periods presented, the amount of deferred tax assets recognized in profit or loss that were initially subject to impairment losses at the time of a business combination is immaterial.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-91 SANOFI FORM 20-F million) (313) Interest income(c)241 54 2020(a) (328) 103 Cost of net debt (124) (259) (225) Non-operat in g foreign exchange gains/(losses) (4) 2 (6) Unwinding of discounting of provisions(d)(20) (11) (11) Net interest cost related to employee benefits (47) (44) (57) Gains/(losses) on disposals of financial assets 1 3 6 Net interest expense on lease liabilities (40) (35) (38) Other \u2014 16 (4) Net financial income/(expenses) (234) (328) (335) comprising: Financial expenses (440) (368) (388) Financial income 206 40 53 (\u20ac million) 2022 2021 Current taxes (2,774) (1,908) Deferred taxes 350 2020(a) (1,913) 106 Total (2,006) (1, 558) (1,807) Income before tax and investments accounted for using the equity method 10,422 7,798 13,778 (as a percentage) 2022 2021 2020 Standard tax rate applicable in France 25.8 28.4 32.0 Difference between the standard French tax rate and the rates applicable to Sanofi(a) (6.5) (9.5) (18.2) Revisions to tax exposures and settlements of tax disputes (0.8) 1.0 0.5 Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration (0.2) \u2014 \u2014 Other items(b) 0.9 0.1 (1.2) Effective tax rate 19.2 20.0 13.1 (a) Includes the impact of the April 2021 IFRIC agenda decision on the allocation of benefits to service periods, as described in Note A.2.1. to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

(a) The difference between the French tax rate and tax rates applicable to foreign subsidiaries reflects the fact that Sanofi has operations in many countries, most of which have lower tax rates than France. For 2020, this line includes the difference between the standard French tax rate and the taxrate applicable to the gain on divestment of Regeneron shares. (b) In determining the amount of the deferred tax liability for 2022, 2021 and 2020, Sanofi took into account changes in the ownership structure of certain subsidiaries.D.31. Share of profit/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method The line item Share of profit/(loss) from investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to \u20ac68 million for 2022, compared with \u20ac39 million for 2021 and \u20ac359 million for 2020 (including \u20ac343 million for the share of Regeneron profits up to and including May 29, 2020, the date on which Sanofi ceased to exercise significant influence over Regeneron: see Note D.2.). D.32. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests The table below shows Net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the reporting periods presented: D.33. Related party transactions The principal related parties are companies over which Sanofi has control or significant influence, joint ventures, key management personnel, and principal shareholders. Sanofi has not entered into any material transactions with any key management personnel. Financial relations with Sanofi's principal shareholders fall within the ordinary course of business and were immaterial in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Note F.1. lists the principal companies controlled by Sanofi; those companies are fully consolidated, as described in Note B.1. Transactions between those companies, and between the parent company and its subsidiaries, are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements. Transactions with companies over which Sanofi has significant influence, and with joint ventures, are presented in Note D.6. Key management personnel include corporate officers and the members of the Executive Committee (an average of 11 members in 2022, in 2021 and in 2020). The table below shows, by type, the compensation paid to key management personnel: The table below shows the aggregate obligation as of December 31 for each period presented for individuals who hold or have held executive positions within Sanofi during that period. D.34. Disclosures about major customers and credit risk Credit risk is the risk that customers (wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics or government agencies) may fail to pay their debts; for Sanofi, that risk is mainly concentrated on amounts receivable from wholesalers in the United States. Sanofi manages credit risk by vetting customers in order to set credit limits and risk levels, and asking for guarantees or insurance where necessary; performing controls; and monitoring qualitative and quantitative indicators of accounts receivable balances, such as the period of credit taken and overdue payments. Sales generated by Sanofi with its biggest customers, in particular certain wholesalers in the United States, represented 27% of net sales in 2022. The three largest customers respectively accounted for approximately 12%, 8% and 7% of Sanofi's SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022(\u20ac million) 2022 2021 2020 Share of net income attributable to other non-controlling interests 113 56 36 Total 113 56 36 (\u20ac million) 2022 2021 Short-term benefits(b)31 33 Post-employment benefits 2 2 Share-based payment 19 20 2020(a) 36 3 18 Total recognized in profit or loss 52 55 57 (\u20ac million ) 2022 2021 Aggregate top-up pension obligation in favor of certain corporate officers and of Executive Committee members 10 28 Aggregate termination benefits and lump-sum retirement benefits in favor of key management personnel 5 7 2020(a) 32 5 (a) Includes t he impact of the April 2021 IFRIC agenda decision on the allocation of benefits to service periods (see Note A.2.1. to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021). (b) Compensation, employer's social security contributions, directors' attendance fees, and any termination benefits (net of reversals of termination benefit obligations). (a) Includes the impact of the April 2021 IFRIC agenda decision on the allocation of benefits to service periods (see Note A.2.1. to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021).D.35. Segment information As indicated in Note B.26., Sanofi has three operating segments: Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines, and Consumer Healthcare. The Pharmaceuticals segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations of the following global franchises: Specialty Care (Dupixent\u00ae, Neurology & Immunology, Rare Diseases, Oncology, and Rare Blood Disorders) and General Medicines (Core and Non-Core Assets), together with research, development and production activities dedicated to the Pharmaceuticals segment. This segment also includes associates whose activities are related to pharmaceuticals. Following the transaction of May 29, 2020, Regeneron is no longer an associate of Sanofi (see Note D.2.). Consequently, the Pharmaceuticals segment no longer includes Sanofi's equity-accounted share of Regeneron's profits for the periods presented. The Vaccines segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations of Vaccines, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to vaccines. The Consumer Healthcare segment comprises, for all geographical territories, the commercial operations for Sanofi's Consumer Healthcare products, together with research, development and production activities dedicated to those products. Inter-segment transactions are not material. The costs of Sanofi's global support functions (Corporate Affairs, Finance, People & Culture, Legal, Ethics & Business Integrity, Information Solutions & Technologies, Sanofi Business Services, etc.) are primarily managed centrally at the group-wide level. The costs of those functions are presented within the \"Other\" category. That category also includes other reconciling items such as retained commitments in respect of divested activities. Following the Capital Markets Day in February 2021, Sanofi changed the presentation of the net sales of the General Medicines and Consumer Healthcare GBUs, and also reallocated certain expenses. In particular, IT costs relating to Sanofi's new digital organization - previously allocated to the Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines, and Consumer Healthcare segments - are now included within the \"Other\" segment. The 2020 segment results presented below have been amended for comparative purposes in order to reflect those adjustments. In accordance with IAS 8, Sanofi treated the first-time application of the IFRIC agenda decisions on (i) the calculation of provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits under IAS 19 and (ii) accounting for costs of configuring or customizing a supplier's application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement as retrospective changes in accounting policy. The impacts are described in Note A.2.1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS F-93 SANOFI FORM 20-F 2022D.35.1.

Business operating income Sanofi reports segment results on the basis of \"Business operating income\". This indicator is used internally by Sanofi's chief operating decision maker to measure the performance of each operating segment and to allocate resources. \"Business operating income\" is derived from Operating income , adjusted as follows:NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 194 274 707 244 173 266 683 249 177 264 690 Fabrazyme\u00ae228 471 239 938 223 395 226 844 200 406 211 817 Myozyme\u00ae/ Lumizyme\u00ae408 318 232 958 410 373 220 1,003 389 359 200 948 Oncology 239 515 198 952 327 410 175 912 299 368 131 798 of which Jevtana\u00ae33 275 83 391 112 253 90 455 187 246 103 536 Rare Blood Disorders 94 983 240 1,317 81 842 218 1,141 41 837 339 1,217 of which Alprolix\u00ae\u2014 406 98 504 \u2014 332 82 414 \u2014 320 146 466 Eloctate\u00ae\u2014 450 130 580 \u2014 429 134 563 \u2014 445 193 638 1,486 656 30 665 1,351 Toujeo\u00ae421 283 413 1,117 394 259 316 969 374 267 292 933 Plavix\u00ae101 9 873 983 115 9 805 929 126 10 777 913 5,111 sales 587 17 16 620 723 41 44 808 658 67 88 8 240 734 49 371 192 612 51 361 205 617 Pain Care 555 212 446 1,213 515 196 382 1,093 481 181 389 1,051 742 1,318 389 124 618 1,131 371 85 532 the Consumer Healthcare GBU, Sanofi has since 2021 adopted a more granular presentation by introducing new sub-categories that reflect consumer trends and the strengths and opportunities of the portfolio.acquisition-related effects and restructuring costs relating to investments accounted for using the equity method (joint ventures and associates with which Sanofi has a strategic alliance) are eliminated; net income attributable to non-controlling interests is deducted; and for 2020, the gain on the divestment of Regeneron shares on May 29, 2020 is eliminated. This elimination does not include the gain on the remeasurement of the 400,000 retained shares at market value as of that date.
