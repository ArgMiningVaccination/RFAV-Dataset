The scope of this guideline is specifically limited to acute distal radius fractur es. This summary does not contain rationales that explain how and why these recommendations were developed nor does it contain the evidence supporting these recommendations. All readers of this summary are strongly urged to consult the full guideline and e vidence report for this information. We are confident that those who read the full guideline and evidence report will see that the recommendations were developed using systematic evidence -based processes designed to combat bias, enhance transparency, and p romote reproducibility. This summary of recommendations is not intended to stand alone . Treatment decisions should be made in light of all circumstances presented by the patient. Treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient rely on mutu al communication between patient , physician , and other healthcare p ractitioner s. Please refer to the sections titled Judging the Quality of Evidence and Defining the Strength of the Recommendations for a detailed description of the link between the evidence support ing the strength of a r ecommendation and the language used in the guideline. 1. We are unable to recommend for or against performing nerve decompression when nerve dysfunction persists after reducti on. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgmen t and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 iv 2. We are unable to recommend for or against casting as definitive treatment for unstable fractures that are initially adequately reduced. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or agains t the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whethe r to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 3. We suggest operative fixation for fractures with post -reduction radial shortening >3mm, dorsal tilt >10 degrees, or intra-articular displacement or step -off >2mm as opposed to cast fixation. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Descr iption: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. 4. We are unable to recommend for or against any one specific operative method for fixation of distal radius fractures. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence fr om a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention.

Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 6. We are unable to recommend for or against locking plates in patients over the age of 55 who are treated operatively. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence that has resulted in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusi ve and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 7. We suggest rigid immobilization in preference to removable splints when using non-operative treatment for the management of displaced distal radius fractures. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a nega tive recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 vi 8.

Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 15. In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that distal radius fractures that are treated non -operatively be followed by ongoing radiographic evaluation for 3 weeks and a t cessation of immobilization. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus Description: The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits assoc iated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. Implications : Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may set boundaries on alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. 16. We are unable to recommend whethe r two or three Kirschner wires should be used for distal radius fracture fixation. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention.

INTRODUCTION OVERVIEW This clinical practice guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on the treatment of distal radius fracture s in adults. This g uideline scope is limited to the treatment of acute distal radius fractures. In addition to providing practice recommendations, this guideline also highlight s gaps in the literature and areas that require future research. This guideline is intended to be u sed by all appropriately trained surgeons and all qualified physicians managing the treatment of distal radius fractures . It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guideline s and recommendations. GOALS AND RATIONALE The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to help improve treatment based on the current best evidence. Current evidence -based medicine (EBM) standards demand that physicians use the best available evide nce in their clinical decision making. To assist in this, this clinical practice guideline consists of a systematic review of the available literature regarding the treatment of distal radius fracture s. The systematic review detailed herein was conducted b etween July 2008 and June 2009 and demonstrates where there is good evidence, where evidence is lacking, and what topics future research must target in order to improve the treatment of patients with acute distal radius fracture s. AAOS staff and the physic ian work group systematically rev iewed the available literature and subsequently wrote the following recommendations based on a rigorous , standardized process. Musculoskeletal care is provided in many different settings by many different providers. We cre ated this guideline as an educational tool to guide qualified physicians through a series of treatment decisions in an effort to improve the quality and efficiency of care. This guideline is not to be construed as including all proper methods of care or ex cluding methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding any specific procedure or treatment includes consideration of all circumstances presented by the patient and the needs and resources particular to th e locality or institution. INTENDED USERS This guideline is intended to be used by orthopaedic surgeons and all qualified physicians managing patients with acute fracture of the distal radius . Typically, o rthopaedic surgeons will have completed medical tra ining, a qualified residency in orthopaedic surgery , and some may have completed additional sub -specialty training. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. Treatment for acute fracture of the distal radius is based on the assumption that decisions are predicated on patient and physician mutual communication with discussion of available treatment s and procedures applicable to the individual patient. Once the patient AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 2 has been informed of available therapies and has discussed these options with his/her physician, an informed decision can be made. Clinician input based on experience with both conservative management and surgical skills increase s the probability of identifying patients who will benefit from specific treatment options. PATIENT POPULATION This document addresses the treatment of acute distal radius fracture in adults (defined as patients 19 years of age and older). ETIOLOGY Fractu re of the distal radius is the result of trauma. There is a bimodal distribution of distal radius fractures where high -energy fractures occur in younger persons (predominately male) and high and low -energy fractures occur in older persons (predominately fe male) .1, 2 INCIDENCE Distal radius fracture is on of the most common fractures seen by orthopaedic surgeons with an incidence of 195.2/100 ,000 persons per ye ar.2 BURDEN OF DISEASE As one of the most common fractures seen by ortho paedic surgeons, distal radius fractures result in significant financial burden. Costs related to di stal radius fracture are mostly service related and at least $164,000,000 was spent on h ospitalization s related to distal radius fracture in 2007 . 3, 4 EMOTIONAL AND PHYSIC AL IMPACT Acute distal radius fracture results in pain, tenderness, swelling and potential deformity. Patients may be faced with substantial morbidity if fracture healing is delayed or results in clinically significant deformity . Additionally, there are known complications in the treatment of distal radius fracture. The recovery period for distal radius fracture can be substantial and the impact of the method of fixation on activities and daily l iving can be significant. POTENTIAL BENEFITS, HARMS , AND CONTRAINDICATION S The aim of treatment is pain relief and maintenance of the patient's functional status. Most treatments are associated with some known risks, especially invasive and operative treatments. In addition, contraindications vary widely based on the treatment administered. Therefore, discussion of available treatments and procedures applicable to the individual patient rely on mutual communication between the patient and physician , weighi ng the potential risks and benefits for that patient. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 3 II. METHODS This clinical practice guideline and the systematic review upon which it is based evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for acute distal radius fracture s. This section describes the methods used to prepare this guideline and systematic review, including search strategies used to identify literature, cri teria for selecting eligible articles, determining the strength of the evidence, data extraction, methods o f statistical analysis, and the re view and approval of the guideline. The methods used to perform this systematic review were employed to minimize bias in the selection , appraisal, and analysis of the available evidence .5, 6 These p rocess es are vital to the development of reliable , transparent, and accurate clinical recommendations for treating acute distal radius fracture s. This guideline and syste matic review were prepared by the AAOS Treatment of Acute Distal Radius Fractures guideline work group with the assistance of the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit in the Department of Research and Scientific Affairs at the AAOS (Appendix I ). To develop this guideline, the work group held an introductory meeti ng to develop the scope of the guideline on July 17 and 18, 2008. Upon completion of the systematic review, the work group met again on July 18 and 19, 2009 to write and vote on the final recommendations and rationales for each recommendation. The resultin g draft guidelines were then peer -reviewed, subsequently sent for public commentary , and then sequentially approved by the AAOS Evidence Based Practice Committee, AAOS Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, AAOS Council on Research, Quality Assessm ent, and Technology, and the AAOS Board of Directors (see Appendix II for a description of the AAOS bodies involved in the approval process) FORMULATING PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS The work group began work on this guideline by constructing a set of preliminary recommendations. These recommendations specify [what] will be done in [whom], [when], [where] , and [how often or how long]. They function as questions for the systematic review, not as final recommendations o r conclusions . Preliminary recommendations are almost always modified on the basis of the results of the systematic review. Once established, these a priori preliminary recommendations cannot be modified until the final work group meeting, they must be add ressed by the systematic review, and the relevant review results must be presented in the final guideline. STUDY SELECTION CRIT ERIA We developed a priori article inclusion criteria for our review. These criteria are our \"rules of evidence\" and articles tha t do not meet them are, for the purposes of this guideline, not evidence. To be included in our systematic reviews (and hence, in this guideline) an article had to be a report of a study that : Evaluat ed a treatment for acute distal radius fracture; studi es of n on unions, malunions, delayed unions, or osteotomies are excluded AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 4 Was a full report of a clinical study and was published in the peer reviewed literature Was an English language article published after 1965 Was not a c adaveric, animal , in vitro , or biomechanical Was not a retrospective case series, medical records review, meeting abstract, unpublished study report, case report, historical article, editorial, letter, or commentary Was the most recent report of a study or the report with the largest n umber of enrolled patients in a study with multiple publications Enrolled 10 patients in each of its study groups For adverse events or complications, the studies must have groups with 25 or more patien ts Enrolled a patient population comprised of at least 80% of patients 1 9 years of age or older Reports quantified re sults When examining primary studies, we analyzed the best available evidence regardless of study design. We first considered the randomized controlled trials identified by the search strategy. In the absence of two or more RCTs, we sequentially searched f or prospective controlled trials, prospective comparative studies, retrospective comparative studies, and prospective case -series studies. Only studies of the highest level of available evidence were included, assuming that there were 2 or more studies of that higher level. For example, if there were two Level II studies that addressed the recommendation, Level III and IV studies were not included. OUTCOMES CONSIDERED Clinical studies often report many different outcomes. For this guideline, o nly patient - oriented outcomes are included , and surrogate/intermediate outcome s are not considered . Surrogate outcome measures are laboratory measurements or another physical sign used as substitutes for a clinically meaningful end point that measures directly how a pat ient feels, functions, or survives.7 Radiographic results are an example of a surrogate outcome. For outcome s measured using \"paper and pencil\" instrument s (e.g. the visual analogue scale, the Disabilities of the Ar m, Shoulder, a nd Hand, Patient -Rated Wrist Evaluation ), the results using validated instrument s are considered the best available evidence . In the absence of results using validated instruments , results using non-validated instruments (e.g. Gartland and Werley score) ar e considered as the best available evidence and the strength of the recommendation is lowered . AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 5 MINIMAL CLINICALLY I MPORTANT IMPROVEMENT Wherever possible, we considered the effects of treatments in terms of the minimal clinically important improvement ( MCII) in addition to whether their effects were statistical ly significan t. The MCII is the smallest clinical change that is important to patients, and recognizes the fact that there are some treatment -induced statistically significant improvements that are too small to matter to patients. The va lues we used for MCIIs are derived from a published study investigating the Disabilities of the Ar m Shoulder and Hand (DASH); Patient -Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), and the Medical Outcomes Study 12 -Item Short -Form H ealth Survey, Physical Component Scale (SF -12 PCS).8 To calculate the standardized MCII , we divided the reported minimal clinically important difference (MCID) between baseline and follow -up scores by the standa rd deviation of the mean baseline score . Table 1 MCII of outcomes Outcome Measure MCI I (points) MCII (standardized ) DASH 17.1 0.99 PRWE 24.0 1.40 SF-12 PCS 7.3 0.94 When possible we describe the results of s tudies using terminology based on that of Armitage , et al.9 The associated descriptive term s in this guideline and the conditions for using each of these terms , are outlined in the following table : Table 2 Descriptive terms for r esults with MCII Descriptive Term Condition for Use Clinica lly Important Statistically significant and lower confidence limit > MCII Possibly Clinically Important Statistically significant and confidence intervals contain the MCII Not Clinically Important Statistically significant and upper confidence limit < MC II Negative Not statistically significant and upper confidence limit < MCII Inconclusive Not statistically significant but confidence intervals contain the MCII AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 6 LITERATURE SEARCH ES We attempted to make our searches for articles comprehensive. Using com prehensive literature searches ensures that the evidence we considered for this guideline is not biased for (or against) any particular point of view. We searched for articles published from January 1966 to June 1, 2009 . Strategies for searching electronic databases were constructed by a Medical Librarian using previously published search strategies 10, 11 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT s). In the absence of relevant RCTs, the Medical Libra rian modified the search strategy to identify studies of other designs. We searched four electronic databases; PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials . We supplemented searches of electronic databases with manual screening of the bibliographies of all retrieved publications . We also searched the bibliographies of recent systematic reviews and other review articles for potentially relevant citations. Finally, work group members provided a list of potentially relevant s tudies that were not identified by our search es. All articles identified were subject to the study selection criteria listed above. The study attrition diagram in Appendix III provide s details about the inclusion and exclusion of the studies considered for this guideline. T he search strategies used to identify these studies are provided in Appendix IV . DATA EXTRACTION Data elements extracted from studies were defined in consultation with the physician work group . A research analyst completed data extraction independently for all studies. The elements extracted are shown in Appendix V . Evidence tables were cons tructed to summarize the best evidence pertaining to each preliminary recommendation. Disagreements about the accuracy of extracted data were resolved by consensus and consulting the work group . Disagreements were resolved by consensus and by consult ing the physician work group . Evidence tables are available as a supplemental document available on the AAOS website http://www.aaos.org/research/guidelines/guide.asp . These evidence tables include complete lists of included and excluded articles, qual ity and design parameters of the included studies, and raw data extracted from the included studies. JUDGING THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE Determining the quality of the included evidence is vitally important when preparing any evidence -based work product. Doing so conveys the amount of confidence one can have in any study's results. One has more confidence in high quality evidence than in low quality evidence. Assigning a level of evidence on the basis of study design plus other quality characteristics ties the levels of evidence we report more closely to quality than levels of evidence based only on study design. Because we tie quality to levels of evidence, we are able to characterize the confidence one can have in their results. Accordingly, we AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 7 characterize t he confidence one can have in Level I evidence as high, the confidence one can have in Level II and III evidence as moderate, and the confidence one can have in Level IV and V evidence as low. TREATMENT STUDIES In studies investigating the result of treatm ent, w e assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome at each time point reported in a study. We did not simply assess the overall quality of a study. Our approach follows the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Developme nt, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group12 as well as others.13 We evaluated quality on a per outcome basis rather than a per study basis because quality is not necessarily the same for all outcomes and all follow -up times reported in a study. For example, a study might report results immediately after patie nts received a given treatment and after some period of time has passed. Often, nearly all enrolled patients contribute data at early follow -up times but, at much later follow -up times, only a few patients may contribute data. One has more confidence in th e earlier data than in the later data. The fact that we would assign a higher quality score to the earlier results reflects this difference in confidence. We assessed the quality of treatment studies using a two step process. First, we assigned a level of evidence to all results reported in a study based solely on that study's design. Accordingly, all data presented in randomized controlled trials were initially categorized as Level I evidence, all results presented in non-randomized controlled trials and o ther prospective comparative studies were initially categorized as Level II . We next assessed each outcome at each reported time point using a quality questionnaire and, when quality standard s were not met, downgraded the l evel of evidence (for this outc ome at this time point) by one l evel (see Appendix VI). DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES In studies investigating a diagnostic test, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) instrument to identify potential bias and assess variability and the quality of reporting in studies reporting the effectiveness of diagnostic techniques.14 We utilized a two step process to assess the quality of diagnostic studies. All studies enrolling a prospective cohort of patients are initially categorized as Level I studies. Any study that did not enroll the appropriate spectrum of patients (e.g. case - control studi es) was initially categorized as a Level IV study . A study that we determined contained methodological flaws (i.e. QUADAS question answered 'no') that introduce bias were downgraded in a cumulative manner for each known bias (Appendix VI). For example, a study that is determined by the QUADAS instrument to have two biases is downgraded to Level III and a study that is determined to have four or more biases is downgraded to a Level V study. Those studies that do not sufficiently rep ort their methods for a potential bias are downgraded to Level II since we a re unable to determine if the bias did or did not bias the results of the study. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 8 PROGNOSTIC STUDIES In studies investigating the effect of a characteristic on the outcome of diseas e, we assessed quality using a two -step process. Any study that investigated a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients and utilized regression analysis was initially categorized as a Level I study. A study that used regression analysis in a retrospective ly enrolled cohort of patients was categorized as a Level II study. We next assessed the outcome ( dependent variable) for each prognostic factor ( independent variable) using a quality questionnaire and, when quality standards were not met, we downgraded th e level of evidence by one level (Appendix VI). DEFINING THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS Judging the quality of evidence is only a stepping stone towards arriving at the strength of a guideline recommendation. Unlike Levels o f Evidence (which apply only to a given result at a given follow -up time in a given study) strength of recommendation take s into account the quality, quantity, and applicability of the available evidence. Strength also takes into account the trade -off betw een the benefits and harms of a treatment or diagnostic procedure, and the magnitude of a treatment's effect. Strength of recommendation express es the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation. As such, the strength expresses how possible it i s that a recommendation will be overturned by future evidence. It is very difficult for future evidence to overturn a recommendation that is based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect. It is much more likely that futur e evidence will overturn recommendations derived from a few small case series. Consequently, recommendations based on the former kind of evidence are given a high strength of recommendation and recommendations based on the latter kind o f evidence are given a low strength . To develop the strength of a recommendation, AAOS staff first assigned a preliminary strength for each recommendation that took only the quality and quantity of the available evidence into account (see Table 3). Work group members then modified the preliminary strength using the 'Form for Assigning Strength of Recommendation (Interventions)' shown in Appendix VII. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 9 Table 3 Strength of recommend ation descriptions 1 The AAOS will issue a consensus -based recommendation only when the service in question has virtually no associated harm and is of low cost (e.g. a history and physical) or when not establishing a recommendation could have catastrophic consequences. Statement Rating Description of Evidence Strength Implication for Practice Strong Evidence is based on two or more \"High\" strength studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. A Strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed t he potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a strong negative recommendation), and that the strength of the supporting evidence is high. Practitioners should follow a Strong recommendation unless a clear and co mpelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Moderate Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Modera te recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Practitioners should gener ally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Limited Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single Moderate quality study recomme nding for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well - conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Practitioner s should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Inconclusive Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Consensus1 The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria. Practitioners sh ould be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may set boundaries on alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 10 Each recommendation was written using language that accounts for the final strength of the recommendation. This language, and the corresponding strength , is shown in Table 4. Table 4 AAOS guideline language Guideline Language Strength of Recommendation We recommend Strong We suggest Moderate option Limited We are unable to recommend for or against Inconclusive In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of this work group Consensus * *see Appendix VIII for development of opinion -based recommendations CONSENSUS DEVELOPMEN T The recommendations and their strength were voted on using a structured voting techniqu e known as the nominal gr oup technique.15 We present details of this technique in Appendix VIII . Voting on guideline recommendations was conducted using a secret ballot and work group members were blinded to the responses of other members. If disagreement between work group members was significa nt, there was further discussion to see whether the disagreement(s) could be resolved. Up to three rounds of voting were held to attempt to resolve disagreements. If disagreements were not resolved following three voting rounds, no recommendation was adopt ed. Lack of agreement is a reason that the strength for some recommendations is labeled \"Inconclusive.\" STATISTICAL METHODS When possible the results of statistical analysis conducted by the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit using STATA 10.0 (StataCo rp LP, College Station, Texas) are reported . The program was used to determine the magnitude of the treatment effect. For data reported as means (and associated measures of dispersion) the standardized mean difference was calculated by the method of Hedge s and Olkin.16 For proportions, the odds ratio was calculated as a measure of treatment effect. When no ev ents occur (\"zero event\") in a proportion, the variance of the arcsine difference was used to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05).17 When published studies rep ort measures of dispersion other than the standard deviation the value was estimated to facilitate calculation of the treatment effect . In studies that report standard errors or confidence intervals the standard deviation was back -calculated. In studies that only report the median, range , and size of the trial, we estimated the means and variances according to a published method.18 Studies that report results in graphical form were analyzed with TechDig 2.0 (Ronald B. Jones, Mundelein, Illinois) to estimate the mean and variance. In some circumstances statistical t esting was conducted by the authors and measures of dispersion were not reported. In the absence of measures of dispersion, t he results of the AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 11 statistical analyses conducted by the authors are included in the analysis and are identified as those of the study authors . To determine if a study was sufficiently powered to detect the MCII , G*Power 3 (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany) was used. For these calculations, 80% power, 95% confidence intervals, and the number of patients per group were used. This permits calculation of the minimal detectable effect size which was compared to the MCII effect size, reported above, to determine if the study was sufficiently power ed to detect the MCII. Likelihood ratios, sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence inte rvals were used to determine the accuracy of diagnostic modalities based on two by two diagnostic contingency tables extracted from the included studies . When possible , prognostic factors were analyzed according to sensitivity and specificity as well.19 Likelihood ratios are interpreted according to pre viously published values.20 Likelihood ratios, sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals were calculated in STATA 10.0 using the \"midas\" command. For di agnostic meta -analysis the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve was used.21, 22 This was implemented using the \"meta ndi\" command in STATA. Prediction regions are reported to asses s heterogeneity. PEER REVIEW The draft of the guideline and evidence report was peer reviewed an expert , outside advisory panel that was nominated by the physician work group prior to the development of the guideline . Peer review was accomplished using a structured peer review form (see Appendix IX). In addition, the physician members of the AAOS Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee, the Evidence Based Practice Committee and the Chairpersons of the AAOS Occupational Hea lth and Workers' Compensation Committee and the Medical Liability Committee were given the opportunity to provide peer review of the draft document. We forwarded the draft guideline to a total of 28 peer reviewers and 13 returned reviews The disposition of all non -editorial peer review comments was documented and the guideline was modified in response to peer review. The peer reviews and the responses to them accompanied this guideline through the process of public commentary and the subsequent approval pro cess. Peer reviewing organizations and peer reviewing individuals are listed in this document if they explicitly agree to allow us to publish this information (see Appendix X). Peer review of an AAOS guideline does not imply endor sement. This is clearly stated on the structured review form ( Appendix IX) sent to all peer reviewers and is also posted within the guideline ( Appendix X). Endorsement cannot be solicited during the peer review process because the documents can still undergo substantial change as a result of both the peer review and public commentary processes. In addition, no guideline can be endorsed by specialty societies outside of the Academy until the AAOS Board of Directors has approved it. Organizations that provide peer review of a draft guideline AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 12 will be solicited for endorsement once the document has completed the full review and approval processes. PUBLIC COMMENTARY After modifying the draft in response to peer review, the guideline was subjected to a thirty day period of \"Public Commentary .\" Commentators consist of members of the AAOS Board of Directors (BOD), members of the Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology (CORQAT), members of the Board of Councilors (BOC) *, and members of the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS) *. Based on these bodies, up to 185 commentators * had the opportunity to provide input into this guideline development process. Of these, XX returned public comments (see Appendix X). *For this guideline, outside specialty societies could post the confidential draft of the guideline to their \"member only\" website . The responses garnered from this posting were compiled by the specialty society and submitted a s one succinct public comment. In addition, members of the Board of Specialties (BOS) and Board of Councilors (BOC) were encouraged to provide input; including encouragement to seek input from colleagues not necessarily members of the BOS or BOC. As a resu lt, the actual number of members who were given the opportunity to comment on this guideline exceeds the number of public commentators for previous guidelines. THE AAOS GUIDELINE A PPROVAL PROCESS Following p ublic commentary , the draft was again modified by the AAOS Clinical Practice Guidelines Unit and work group members. This final guideline draft was approved by the AAOS Guidelines Oversight Committee , the AAOS Evidence Based Practice Committee, the AAOS Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Techno logy, and the AAOS Board of Directors. Descriptions of these bodies are provided in Appendix II. REVISION PLANS This guideline represents a cross -sectional view of current treatment and/or diagnosis and may become outdated as new evidence becomes available. This guideline will be revised in accordance with new evidence, changing practice, rapidly emerging treatment options, new technology. This guideline will be updated or withdrawn in five years in accordance with the standards of the National Guideline Clearinghouse. GUIDELINE DISSEMINAT ION PLANS The primary purpose of the present document is to provide interested readers with full documentation about not only our recommendations, but also about how we arrived at those recommendations. This document is also posted on the AAOS website at http://www.aaos.org/research/guidelines/guide.asp . Shorter versions of the guideline are available in other venues. Publication of most guidelines is announced by an Academy press release, articles authored by the work group and published in the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and articles published in AAOS Now. Most guidelines are also distrib uted at the AAOS AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 13 Annual Meeting in various venues such as on Academy Row and at Committee Scientific Exhibits. Selected guidelines are disseminated by webinar, an Online Module for the Orthopeadic Knowledge Online website, Radio Media Tours, Media Briefing s, and by distributing them at relevant Continuing Medical Education (CME) courses and at the AAOS Resource Center. Other dissemination efforts outside of the A AOS will include submitting the guideline to the National Guideline Clea ringhouse and distribut ing the guideline at other medical specialty societies' meetings.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND S UPPORTING DATA AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 15 RECOMMENDATION 1 We are unable to recommend for or against performing nerve decompression when nerve dysfunction persists after reduction. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publi cations that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: There were no qualified studies identified that addressed this recommendation. Supp orting Evidence: Evidence Tables 1 - 3 in supplemental evidence table document . We identified only o ne study that enrolled patients with persistent nerve dysfunction after reduction (and before surgery) of a distal radius fracture and met our inclusion critera.23 This study used subjective (symptoms) and objective (clinical test) measures to determin e the persistence of nerve dysfunction after reduction. Patients with symptoms and a positive clinical te st underwent nerve exploration (i.e. carpal tunnel release) and all other patients did not undergo nerve exploration. Patients receiving carpal tunnel release may have had spontaneous resolution of symptoms or may have benefited from carpal tunnel release . The spontaneous resolution of symptoms in patients not receiving carpal tunnel release may support this . AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 16 RECOMMENDATION 2 We are unable to recommend for or against casting as definitive treatment for unstable fractures that are initially adequately reduced. Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommen dation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deci ding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a subs tantial influencing role. Rationale: There were no qualified studies identified that addressed this recommendation. Supporting Evidence: Evidence Table 4 in supplemental evidence table document . There were no studies investigating the role of conservative treatment in adequately reduced and maintained unstable fractures that met our inclusion criteria. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 17 RECOMMEN DATION 3 We suggest operative fixation for fractures with post -reduction radial shortening >3mm, dorsal tilt >10 degrees, or intra -articular displa cement or step -off >2mm as opposed to cast fixation. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or ag ainst the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Rationale: Five randomized clinical trials met our inclusion criteria and compared fi xation to cast immobilization.24-28 All had at least one methodological flaw and were downgraded to Level II. All mixed articular fractures and extra -articular fracture in a manner which did not allow for separate anal ysis. There were no age criteria and the average patient age in these trials was similar to those that address treatment in older -aged patients (see Recommendation 5 ). There were differences in pain at 24 and 5 2 weeks , but not 8 a nd 12 weeks in one study, differences in motion at 52 weeks in one study, and differences in complications , overall , in 4 studies . The difference s were all in favor of operative treatment. Complications included carpal tunnel syndrome, t humb pain , ulnar ne rve symptoms, and malunion. The moderate strength of the data is therefore based primarily on differences in complications, which can be somewhat variably defined. Fracture instability is difficult to define, but was consistently defined within these studi es as loss of radiographic alignment after initial closed reduction and splinting in each of these trials.

The amount of pain in patients treated with external fixation was not significantly different from the pain in patients treated with casting at 8 or 12 weeks post -operatively but was significantly lower 24 weeks post-operatively and remained significant up to 1 year ( Table 6). However, t he number of patients pain free after 7 years was not significantly different between external fixation and casting ( Table 7). Additionally, function was significantly better after 1 year in patients treated by external fixation but not significantly different at 8, 12, or 24 weeks (Table 6). There are several complications repor ted in the included studies ( Figure 1 and Table 8). Seven of the eleven reported complications did not occur significantly more or less in patients treated with cast or external fixation. Statistically si gnificant differences between patients treated with operative fix ation and casting favor ed patients treated with external fixation ( fewer occurrences of malunion, CTS, ulnar nerve symptoms, and t humb pain ). However, there are complications unique to extern al fixation that patients treated with casting are not exposed to ( Table 9).

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the interve ntion. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommen dation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Ration ale: Fourteen clinical trials met the inclusion criteria: 8 combined intra - and extra - articular fractures,29-36 5 studie d only intra -articular fractures,37-41 and on e studied only extra - articular fractures.42 No studies evaluated shearing/articular rim fractures, or radiocarpal fracture -dislocations. Inclusion was based on inadequate radiographic alignment after initial ade quate closed reduction and splint immobilization . Thus, the included studies did not allow for stratification by fracture type. Only two comparisons were made by more than one study making meta -analysis impossible (Figure 2). All had at least one methodological flaw and were downgraded to Level II. The included studies in this recommendation do not address many important aspects of the operative treatment of distal radius fractures, including different operative treatments for di fferent fracture types. Therefore, it is not possible to come to an evidence based conclusion for the optimal operative treatment of distal radius fractures. Only three of 14 studies had statistically significant findings. In one study, there was only a statistically significant difference in complications. In another study , there was a possibly clinically important difference in DASH at 1 year but not at 3 or 6 months. In the third study, there was statistically significant better function at 2 years for percutaneous fixation over ORIF . All other outcomes evaluated by the included studies were not statistically significant ( Table 10). Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 8 - 10 in supplemental evidence table document .

This result is a true negative, suggesting that patients treated with non - bridging external fixation or bridging external fixation ha d similar outcomes 1 year after surgery. Pain measured by visual analog scale ( VAS ) up to 1 year was not significantly different in patients treated with non -bridging or bridging external fixation (Table 13 and Table 14) Pain at different anatomic locations on or around the distal radius was not significantly different in patients treated with non -bridging or bridging external fixation (Figure 5). Statistically significant complications occurred in favor of non-bridging external fixation and in favor of bridging exter nal fixation ( Figure 6 and Table 15).

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation me ans that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and shoul d exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: We were interested in determining t he role of operative treatment compared to non - operative treatment of patients defined by the published literature as \"elderly\" and that distinguished patients based on infirmity, functional demands, bone quality, or energy of injury. Three clinical trials met the inclusion criteria.43-45 Two trials compared external fixation to cast immobilization and one trial compared percutaneous pinning to cast immobilization. All had at least one methodological flaw and wer e downgraded to Level II. One addressed extra -articular fractures, one articular fractures, and one both. Age criteria included age over 55 in 2 studies and over age 60 in one study. We selected the age of 55 because these included studies enrolled patient s no younger than 55 years. We were unable to i dentify studies that distinguished patients based on infirmity, functional demands, bone quality, or energy of injury. The average patient age in these trials was comparable to those considered in Recommen dation 3. Inclusion was based on redisplacement in one study, initial radiographic alignment in one study, and instability not otherwise defined in one study. There were no differences in pain, function, complications or SF -36 at an y time point.

The amount of pain experie nced after 1 year was not significantly different in patients treated with percutaneous pinning or with a cast ( Figure 21). There was also no significant difference in overall mental or physical health as determined by the SF -36 score ( Figure 22) and no significant difference in the occurrence of complications in patients treated with percutaneous pinning or cast ( Table 27). However, percutaneous pinning does have complications th at those patients treated with casts are not subject to (Table 28). Both randomized controlled trials that compared patients treated with external fixation to those treated with cast and over the age of 55, found no statistically significant differences for pain experienced at different anatomic locations on or around the distal radius or with different amounts of activity after 1 year ( Table 29 - Table 32).

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should ex ercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: We were interested in determining the r ole of locking plates compared to other operative techniques in the potentially osteoporotic population. A single level II prospective non - randomized comparative cohort study addressed this recommendation by comparing volar locked plating with intrafocal p inning.46 The inclusion criteria specified age over 60, but for consistency with other recommendations, this recommendation specifies patients aged 55 and older. No differences in complications were noted. Supporting evidence: Evidence Tables 1 4 - 15 in supplemental evidence table document . Patients over the age of 60 and treated with volar locking plates or intrafocal pinning did not experience tendon rupture, osteomyelitis , cellulitis, or CRPS significantly more often compared to the other treatment ( Table 37 and Table 38). However, patients treated with intrafocal pinning were subject to potential pin tract infections that patients treated with volar lockin g plates were not (Table 39).

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm c learly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications : Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Rationale: For the purposes of this recommendation we considered rigid immobilization to be any form of immobilization that was firm (e.g. plaster, fiberglass) and not intended for self - removal, and less -rigid immobilizat ion was any type of wrap or brace that either incompletely immobilized the wrist or was intended to be removed by the patient. Five Level II randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria .47-51 There were significant differences in pain at 5 -6, 8 and 24 weeks in favor of casting. All other durations of follow -up did not have significant difference s between patients treated with rigid immobilization or less-rigid immobilization . Radial nerve symptoms occurred more often in patients treated with less-rigid immobilization and no other complications were significantly different.

Patients treated with cast ing had less pain than those treated with braces at three different durations of follow -up (Table 41 and Table 42). There was only one signif icant difference in the occurrence of a complication in patients treated with cast and patients treated with braces.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"Moderate \" quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Implications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substa ntial influencing role. Rationale: For the purposes of this recommendation minimal displacement was defined as acceptable alignment after the initial injury and prior to any reduction. Rigid immobilization was any form of immobilization that was firm (e.g . plaster, fiberglass) and not intended for self -removal, and less -rigid immobilization was any type of wrap or brace that either incompletely immobilized the wrist or was intended to be removed by the patient. Four clinical trials that compared cast to splint treatment met the inclusion criteria. 47, 52-54 All had at least one methodological flaw and were downgraded to Level II. There were no age criteria . Pain at 2 weeks was significantly lower in casted p atients in one of 4 trials. Pain at six or eight weeks was significantly lower in splinted patients in 2 of 4 trials. This resulted in the downgrading of the recommendation to \" Limited .\" All other durations of follow -up did not have significant difference s between patients treated with less -rigid immobilization or rigid immobilization.

Pain experienced by patients treated with cast was significantly less at 2 weeks when compared to those treated with a brace ( Figure 24). At mid -term durations of follow -up (6-8 weeks), significantly less pain was experienced by patients treated with a brace (Figure 24 and Table 45). At long -term durati ons of follow -up there was no significant difference in the amount of pain experienced by patients treated with either cast or brace (Table 45 and Table 46). Function in these patients was similar for all tasks except fork/knife use ( Table 47).

An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recomm endation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: For the purposes of this recommendation we considered immobilization of the elbow as immobilization of forearm rotatio n (pronation and supination). One randomized controlled trial compared above elbow to below elbow splinting for maintenance of re duction for 2 weeks after manipulative reduction of unstable fracture and found no differences.55 No other outcomes were assessed.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"Moderate\" quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear adva ntage to one approach versus another. Implications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient pre ference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: There were two studies that met the inclusion criteria56, 57 but only one was sufficiently powered to detect the minimal clinically important diffe rence.56 In this study, arthroscopy assisted reduction of the articular surface. In the arthroscopy group the DASH scores were clinically improved at the three month interval. Regardless of arthroscopy, the difference in function as determined by DASH scores was inconclusive at 1 and 2 years postoperatively.

Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"Moderate\" quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Implications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercis e judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: There was one Level II trial that compared the arthroscopic reduction and fixation of distal radius fracture combined with arthroscopic treatment of associated intra carpal ligament and TFCC injuries to fluoroscopic reduction and fixation of the radius alone.55 The authors demonstrated that arthroscopy is a valuable adjunctive method for evaluating and treating these lesions which are not detec table on standard radiographs. One limitation of the study is the possibility of preexisting carpal lesions. An additional limitation is that the true incidence of carpal ligament lesions in the fluoroscopy group was unknown. These limitations resulted in a downgrading of the r ecommendation to \"Limited .\" In the arthroscopy group , the DASH scores were clinically important at the three month interval. Regardless of arthroscopy, the difference in function as determined by DASH sc ores was inconclusive at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 28 - 30 in supplemental evidence table document . The RCT investigating the comparison between patients treated with fluoroscopic assisted reduction and fixation an d arthroscopic assisted reduction and fixation in Recommendation 10 is applicable to this recommendation. Patients treated with arthroscopic assisted reduction and fixation received treatment for their associated ligament injuries . Patients treated with fl uoroscopic assisted reduction and fixation did not. However, the prevalence of ligament injuries in the patients treated with arthroscopic assisted reduction and fixation is 75% and the existence of ligament injuries in the fluoroscopic assisted reduction and fixation patients was not reported .

Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"Moderate\" quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Implications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommenda tion classified as Limited , and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: Arthroscopy can improve the evaluation of carpal ligament lesion s but the included studies did not demonstrate the effect of this on patient outcome.58, 59 The single study on the use of CT scanning demonstrated better fracture characterization but did not associate these f indings with improved outcome.60 Based on the lack of patient treatment outcome and concerns regarding the additional costs, the recommendation was downgraded to \"Limited .\" Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 31 - 33 in supplemental evidence table document . Direct visualizatio n of additional fracture lines and ligament injuries is the gold standard in distal radius fractures. We identified o ne study that investigate d the diagnostic accuracy of CT with direct visualization as the gold standard that met our inclusion criteria. Th e effectiveness of CT as determined by the likelihood ratios suggest that CT provides small but sometimes important changes in the probability of detecting distal radius fracture characteristics ( Table 50). The use of arthroscopy to assess additional fracture lines or ligament injuries in distal radius fractures was investigated in two prospective cohort studies. A rthroscopy was effective in detecting ligament injuries and additional fracture lines not seen with plain radiography (Table 51 - Table 55). There were no studies identified that investigated the effectiveness of MRI compared to the gold standard of direct visualization that met our inclusion criteria .

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting finding s that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: There were no qualified studies identified that addressed this recommendation.

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendati on for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substant ial influencing role. Rationale: We were interested in determining the role of bone void fillers in addition to operative fracture fixation. Only one study compared the use of allograft versus autograft after dorsal plating.61 No difference in pain or function was observed. They did however report complications related to autograft harvestation. Several studies suggest some benefit related to pain reduction when calcium phosphate is used to support fixation.62-67 These studies did not compare the outcome of fixation with and without the material and hence are not applicable to this recommendation. We cannot support or discredit the use of bone substitutes as an adjunct to operative fixation. Suppo rting Evidence: Evidence Tables 35 - 38 in supplemental evidence table document . There was no significant difference in the number of patients that experienc ed pain or restricted activities of daily living when treated with adjunct autograft or allograft f or dorsal plating (Table 56). There were however, several unique complications related to the autograft donor site ( Table 57).

Strength of Recommendation: Consensus Description: The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering th e known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guid eline's systematic review. Implications: Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may set boundaries on alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing ro le. Rationale: Redisplacement during non -operative treatment of distal radius fractures may result in symptomatic malunions in any patient. The work group deemed that it is warranted to issue a recommendation on this topic despite a lack of evidence deter mining maintenance of adequate fracture reduction during non -operative treatment. Patients and surgeons may agree to alter treatment if the fracture is noted to lose reduction during this period. This recommendation will involve patient visits and radiogra phic assessment which is part of orthopedic care of these injuries. We believe that such monitoring of fracture position during non -operative treatment is consistent with the current practice of most orthopedic surgeons.

Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determin ing balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: Our intent was to investigate if there is an association between distal radius fractures and future fragility fractures. Based upon ou r evaluation of the likelihood ratio data, the evidence for this association was inconclusive. Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 41 - 43 in supplemental evidence table document . We identified s ix prospective cohort studies reporting the occurrence of f ragility fractures after distal radius fracture that met our inclusion criteria.68-73 The likelihood ratios for the included studies have conflicting results. 1 of the 6 studies suggests that a distal radius fracture generates small but sometimes important changes in the probability of a future fragility fracture. The other five studies suggest that distal radius fracture alters the probability of a future fragility fracture to a small and rarely important degree (Table 58). Additionally, a diagnostic meta -analysis of the ability of distal radius to predict a future hip fracture shows low sensitivity and high specificity for distal radius fracture in predicting future fragility fracture ( Figure 30).

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: We were interested in determining whether early surgical tr eatment of DRUJ instability performed at the same time as operative treatment of acute distal radius fractures provides improved patient outcomes . Two studies were found that investigated the functional outcome of DRUJ injuries. 74, 75 The instabilities were identified at the conclusion of treatment. Therefore no instabilities were treated at the time of surgery. Although the patients with instability had poorer outcomes, neither study addressed the question o f whether early operative intervention is indicated.

We identified o ne prospective non -random ized study compared patients with unstable DRUJ after distal radius fixation to patients with a stable DRUJ after distal radius fixation that met our inclusion criteria . Patients with unstable DRUJ had significantly more pain at rest and on loading than th ose patients with a stable DRUJ ( Figure 31). AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 80 We also identified a n additional prospective non -randomized study compar ing patients with a distal radius fracture involving the DRUJ to those with a fracture not involving the DRUJ that met our inclusion criteria. Significantly more patients without involvement of the DRUJ were pain free 6 weeks after treatment of their distal radius fracture ( Figure 32). The authors report that this significant difference rem ained at 6 months and 1 year (chi-square, p < 0.05) .

Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the b enefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Rationale: It is common knowledge that in the presence of a DRUJ injury or distal radius fracture the injury itself can preclude identifying DRUJ dislocation. In order to not miss this treatable injury which often occurs in association with distal radius fractures, we were interested in determining whether true lateral x -rays can identify DRUJ dislocation . Two studies addressed this question.76, 77 One study described the piso -scaphoid distance an d the other studied scaphoid/lunate/triquetrum overlap. Because both of these studies are based on level II evidence and showed that accurately performed lateral x -rays can reliably identify DRUJ dislocation when associated with DRF, we made the recommenda tion that true lateral x -rays be obtained in patients with distal radius fractures .

Strength of Recommendation: Consensus Description: The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert opinion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. Implicat ions: Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Consensus, although they may set boundaries on alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: The pain associated with a distal radius fracture will typically diminish after standard treatment protocols. Patient's reports of unremitting pain during the early treatment period may signal a concomitant associated condition which requires investigation. The work group d eemed that it is warranted to issue a recommendation on this topic despite the lack of evidence to support or refute the investigation into the source of unremitting pain following treatment of distal radius fracture. Each patient in the treatment of dista l radius fracture should report their progress in recovery. When pain levels do not decrease as expected, it is appropriate to evaluate the patient for causes of pain. This recommendation may result in costs associated with assessment and management. We believe these actions are consistent with the current practice of most orthopedic surgeons AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 84 RECOMMENDATION 21 A home exercise program is an option for patients prescribed therapy after distal radius fracture. Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"Moderate\" quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Implications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercis e judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: We were interested in determining the role of formal therapy compared to non -formal therapy after distal radiu s fracture. Five randomized controlled trials compared a directed home exercise program against various forms of supervised therapy.78-82 All had at least one methodological flaw and were considered level II evi dence. In 4 of the 5 studies, patients were treated with casting (with or without addition of pin s) and therapy was started after removal of fixation (cast or external fixator). In one study, all patients were treated by volar plating and therapy was comm enced 1 week postoperatively. In studies comparing directed home exercise program to supervised therapy started after removal of fixation there was no difference in pain or function. We questioned the applicability of these studies because of the timing o f therapy. In the remaining study where patients were mobilized 1 week after plating, the home exercise group had significantly better functional (PRWE) scores than the group that received formal therapy. The strength of recommendation was graded as \" limit ed\" based on the possibly clinically important effects identified by this study. The above studies excluded , by design , patients with complications (finger stiffness, CRPS) and the data above reflect the effect of therapy in radius fractures that were healing without any adverse events.

At 6 weeks patients that d id not receive any formal treatment from a hand therapist ha d significantly more pain and the difference in function did not remain statistically significant (Error!

Strength of Recommendation: Consensus Description: The supporting evidence is lacking and requires the work group to make a recommendation based on expert opinion by considering the known potential harm and benefits associated with the treatment. A Consensus recommendation means that expert op inion supports the guideline recommendation even though there is no available empirical evidence that meets the inclusion criteria of the guideline's systematic review. Implications: Practitioners should be flexible in deciding whether to follow a recomme ndation classified as Consensus, although they may set boundaries on alternatives. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: Hand stiffness is one of the most functionally disabling adverse effects after distal radius fractures. Stiffness of the fingers can result from a combination of factors including pain, swelling, obstruction by splints or casts , and apprehension or lack of understanding by the patient. Finger stiffness can be very difficult to treat after fracture heal ing requiring multiple therapy visits and possibly additional surgical intervention. Instructing the patient at the first encounter to move their fingers regularly and through a complete range of motion may help to minimize the risk of this complication. F inger motion does not have any adverse effects on an adequately stabilized distal radius fracture with regard to reduction or healing. This is an extremely cost -effective intervention as it does not require any pharmaceutical intervention or additional vis its while making a significant impact on patient outcome. Although finger stiffness is a critical adverse effect of distal radius fractures and directly impacts patient outcome, the effects of early finger motion cannot be ethically evaluated in a level I prospective study. The members of the work group feel it is important to make a recommendation by consensus opinion. It is current clinical practice for the treating physician to instruct every patient to move their fingers after distal radius fracture re gardless of the type of treatment or immobilization selected. This recommendation is consistent with current practice. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 89 RECOMMENDATION 23 We suggest that patients do not need to begin early wrist motion routinely following stable fracture fixation. Streng th of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means tha t the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Rationale: Three studies were included in this recommendation.25, 83, 84 Each study in vestigated different operative treatment methods: volar plate, trans -styloid fixation or external fixation. Mobilization was commenced at different times, in the two internal fixation studies, therapy was started approximately at 1 week and in the external fixation study, mobilization was commenced at 3 weeks. In 2 studies, the control group was either casted or immobilized with a fixator. In the volar plating study, the control group was immobilized by a thermoplastic splint that they were instructed to remove for showering and therefore are not a reliable control group. The outcome measures us ed were pain and function ( DASH) and/or complications. None of the outcomes were significantly different between early motion and late motion. These data support the recommendation that patients do not need to begin early wrist motion after stable fracture fixation.

There is no difference (true negative) in function determined by the DASH score up to 6 months, between pat ients with early wrist motion and those with late wrist motion (Figure 36). There is also no significant difference between the amount of pain experienced by patients with early wrist motion compared to those with late wrist motio n (Figure 37 and Figure 38). No significant differences in the occurrence of complications between patients with early wrist motion or late wrist motion were seen in any of the trials ( Figure 39 and Table 64).

Strength of Recommendation: Limited Description: Evidence from two or more \"Low\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"Moderate\" quality study recommending for or against the intervention or diagnostic. A Limited recommendation means the quality of the supporting evidence that exists is unconvincing, or that well -conducted studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another. Impl ications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influenci ng role. Rationale: Three prospective studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies, collectively, do not agree upon a length of immobilization and we chose not to define a specific duration. The first study demonstrated no significant difference in g roups treated with external fixation for 5 weeks as compared to 3 weeks of external fixation and 2 weeks of additional casting.85 The results were reported using a non -validated patient outcome score , hence no clear effect could be demonstrated by the early discontinuation of the external fixation. Two addition al studies using a non -validated patient outcome score showed a statistical ly significant association between outcomes a nd prolonged external fixation.86, 87 Based on limitations of the outcome instruments , the strength of recommendation was graded as \" Limited .\" Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 59 - 62 in supplemental evidence table document .

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgme nt and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: Two level II studies met the inclusion criteria. 86, 87 There was no statistically significant association between the amount of distraction and patient outcome using a non -validated instrument . However, the work group agreed that the important potential adverse effect of finger stiffness was not evaluated in these studies. It would not be ethical to conduct a prospective study to examine the effect of over -distraction. The work group hence have downgraded the recommendation to \"inconclusive\". Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 63 and 64 in supplemental evidence table document . AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 96 RECOMMENDATION 26 We suggest adjuvant treatment of distal radius fractures with Vitamin C for the prevention of disproportionate pain. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate Description: Evidence from two or more \"Moderate\" strength studies with consistent findings, or evidence from a single \"High\" quality study for recommending for or against the intervention. A Moderate recommendation means that the benefits exceed the potential harm (or that the potential harm clearly exceeds the benefits in the case of a negative recommendation), but the strength of the supporting evidence is not as strong. Implications: Practitioners should generally follow a Moderate recommendation but remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences. Rationale: We were interested in determining the potential benefit of nutritional supplements in recovery of function after treatment of distal radius fractures. Two studies that met our inclusio n criteria examined the use of Vitamin C.88, 89 Specifically, the studies found a significant reduction in the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome after treatment of distal radius fracture when the patie nts were given supplemental Vitamin C. These studies have a serious limitation. The final outcome measure of CRPS is ordinarily difficult to define objectively. The authors used subjective criteria to define pain syndrome in these studies and hence the rel iability of the data is limited. We have hence downgraded the recommendation to \"Moderate.\" Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 65 - 67 in supplemental evidence table document . One study compared placebo to vitamin C dosages of 200, 500, or 1500 mg daily and the other study compared placebo to vitamin C dosage of 500 mg daily. The number of patients that developed complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) (otherwise known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) or algodystrophy) suggests statistically significa nt association between vitamin C dosages above 500 mg daily with reduced occurrence of CRPS (Figure 41). The earlier study enrolled only patients treated conservatively for their distal radius fracture s while the recent trial enro lled some patients that received operative treatment of their distal radius fracture s (11% of patients were treated operatively) . There were no studies investigat ing other medic ations , vitamin s, or mineral adjuvant treatments (e.g. vitamin B, Vitamin D, c alcium, phosphates) that met our inclusion criteria.

Implications: Practitioners should be cautious in deciding whether to follow a recommendation classified as Limited , and should exercise judgment and be alert to emerging publications that report evidence. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: We included two studies that used non -validated patie nt outcome measures. The study examining the effect of low -intensity ultrasound reported statistically significant improvement in number of patients with no pain and radiographic union; however no long term or permanent benefit related to a validated outco me measure was demonstrated with the use of low -intensity ultrasound.90 The second study demonstrated the value of ice at 3 and 5 days but no benefit for pulsed electromagnetic field therapy ( PEMF ).91 The additional cost of ultrasound along with the less reliable evidence resulted in the downgrading of this recommendation to \" Limited .\" Table 66 Summary table for Recommendation 27 Study n Level of Evidence Outcome Domain Duration of follow -up Favored adjuvant Kristiansen 61 II Time to healing n/a ultrasound Kristiansen 61 II Healing 6 weeks ultrasound Kristiansen 61 II 8 weeks ultrasound Kristiansen 61 II 10 weeks ultrasound Kristiansen 61 II 12 weeks ultrasound Cheing 38 II Pain 3 days ice Cheing 38 II 5 days ice Supporting Evidence: Evidence Tables 68 - 70 in supplemental evidence table document .

The outcomes investigated in this study suggest an increased rate of healing (as determined by absence of pain and radiographic union) . The trial investigating ice and PEMF compar ed patients receiving ice therapy, PEMF therapy, PEMF plus ice therapy, or sham PEMF without ice therapy (control group ). The results of the com parisons between the groups receiving adjuvant treatments (i.e. ice therapy, PEMF therapy, or ice and PEMF therapy) and the sham treatment were statistically significant for ice therapy in reducing pain up to 5 days . The effect of PEMF therapy and PEMF plus ice therapy on pain was not statistically significant compared to the sham control patients (Figure 44).

An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whether to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that cla rify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Rationale: Ulnar styloid fractures are relatively common in association with distal radius fractures. We were interested in the effect of concomitant fixation of the styloid on patient outcome. One study found no difference between treatment (fixation) and no treatment.92 The other study identified ulna styloid fractures after treatment was completed and the study found that there were clinically important differences between patients with and without styloid f ractures.93 Therefore no ulna styloid fractures were treated at the time of surgery. Although the patients with ulna styloid fractures had poorer outcomes, the study did not address the question of whether early operative intervention is indicated. Therefore, w e found no conclusive evidence to recommend operative or non operative treatment for the ulna styloid fracture.

We identified o ne randomized controlled trial comparing patients treated operative ly for a concomitant ulna fracture to patients treated conservative ly for a concomitant ulnar fracture that met our inclusion criteria . There was no significant difference between the numbe rs of patients that were pain free , 2 years after treatment (Figure 45). Additionally, we identified a single prospective non -randomized study which compared patients without a concomitant ulna fracture to patients with a concomi tant fracture of the base or tip of the ulna that met our inclusion criteria . The patients with concomitant ulnar fractures did not receive any treatment for their ulnar fracture. Therefore, the comparison between the groups in this study determines the ef fect of an untreated concomitant ulnar fracture on the outcome. Patients without concomitant ulna fracture ha d clinically important differences in function as determined by the DASH instrument compared to those with a concomitant ulna fracture (Figure 46 and Figure 47). Additionally, there was no significant difference between patients with and without concomitant ulna fracture in the occurrence of ulnar wrist pain at final follow -up (Figure 48 and Figure 49).

Strength of Recommendation: Inconclusive Description: Evidence from a single low quality study or conflicting findings that do not allow a recommendation for or against the intervention. An Inconclusive recommendation means that there is a lack of compelling evidence resulting in an unclear balance between benefits and potential harm. Implications: Practitioners should feel little constraint in deciding whethe r to follow a recommendation labeled as Inconclusive and should exercise judgment and be alert to future publications that clarify existing evidence for determining balance of benefits versus potential harm. Patient preference should have a substantial inf luencing role. Rationale: There were no qualified studies identified that addressed this recommendation. Supporting Evidence: Evidence Table 76 in supplemental evidence table document . There were no studies investigating concurrent methods of fixation in addition to external fixation for depressed lunate fossa or 4 -part fracture of the distal radius that met our inclusion criteria. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 106 FUTURE RESEARCH The overall literature base for the treatment of distal radius fractures is large compared to other orthopaed ic topics but still lacks highly reliable evidence. To achieve a highly reliable literature base, academic authors and scientists should invest their time and effort in studies designed to avoid bias. Techniques to limit bias include proper randomization and adequate, verified blinding of investigators, patients, and/or evaluators, wherever possible. Future studies should also include a priori power analyses to ensure clinically important improvements (improvement that matters to the patient). These studie s should utilize patient oriented outcome measures that are anatomical region -specific (DASH), disease specific (PRWE) and (if possible) general health specific (SF -36) whose key psychometric characteristics have been evaluated and validated. The use of va lidated patient -oriented outcome measures will ensure that the measure of success of future studies is determined by minimal clinically important improvements. Primary study questions should be based on differences on validated upper -extremity specific dis ability measures and secondary study questions on measures of objective impairment and radiographic measurements. There are reasons, of course, that reliable evidence for surgical treatment is generally lacking. The logistical difficulties and ethical con cerns in conducting placebo -controlled studies of operative interventions compromise the reliability of these studies. To improve the reliability of future studies of operative treatments, the use of active, non -placebo control groups should be considered. Investigators should develop rigorous patient inclusion criteria to ensure that patients that typically receive the surgical intervention in clinical practice are adequately represented in the study population. Of the twenty -nine recommendations in this g uideline, ten were supported by evidence but were still assigned an inconclusive strength of recommendation. For these recommendations, the supporting evidence found no significant or clinically important differences in the comparisons addressed or the sup porting evidence was conflicting. In addition, six recommendations are supported only by limited evidence. Many of these study comparisons should be readdressed in future research to allow for meta -analytical techniques which may resolve controversy and cl arify optimal treatment for distal radius fractures. Another critical issue with reference to distal radius fractures is the bimodal incidence with high energy injuries seen largely in the younger active population and less complex injuries in the low dema nd generally older population. Clearly the injury severity and patient expectations (and hence outcomes) are different for both groups. Future studies should address these groups of patients individually. While previous studies have made the distinction o n basis of chronologic age, this clearly is not as reliable as activity level. An initial study attempting to better define a \"low -demand\" individual on basis of activity level is urgently needed. High quality trials that we would like to see addressed i n the future include: AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 107 Studies to better define the minimally clinically important improvement (MCII) in an upper extremity specific disability measure for patients recovering from a fracture of the distal radius. This MCII will be the basis for power calcu lations for clinical trials addressing methods of treatment for fractures of the distal radius. Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing operative treatment with non -operative treatment, separating articular and non -articular fractures, and separa ting older, infirm, low demand patients from younger, active patients. Consideration should be given to whether withholding operative treatment in younger, active patients in whom comparative effectiveness trials might be more appropriate, is ethical. Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing casting to operative fixation to determine the preferable treatment for patients with displaced DRF that has been reduced manually and is currently in good alignment. Prospective randomized controlled trials co mparing operative treatment with non - operative treatment to determine the preferable treatment of elderly and sedentary patients with displaced fractures. Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various forms of operative tr eatment, separating articular and non -articular fractures, and separating older, infirm, low demand patients, with lower energy injuries from younger, healthier, more active patients with higher -energy injuries. Criteria other than chronological age will a lso need to be addressed. Previously studied comparisons should continue to be studied to allow for future meta -analysis. Multiple treatment studies investigating 3 or more forms of operative treatment will also be useful in clarifying the optimal operativ e technique. Prospective randomized clinical trials that evaluate, with validated patient outcomes, the effect of non -operative adjuvant modalities such as: Vitamins and minerals (e.g. vitamin C, calcium) Physical therapy (e.g. early formal physical therap y, self supervised home programs) Mechanical adjuvants (e.g. PEMF, ultrasound, electrical stimulation) Prospective randomized clinical trials comparing surgical or expectant treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome in association with acute DRF. Prospective r andomized clinical trials that evaluate the effect of adjuvant bone grafts or substitutes with concurrent operative fixation for specific patterns of DRF. Prospective randomized clinical trials that evaluate the effect of bone graft in association with loc king plates for elderly and sedentary patients. Prospective studies that evaluate the predictive value of low -energy DRF in relation to osteoporosis outcomes using appropriate statistical techniques and studies that AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 108 investigate, with validated patient outc omes, the role of the orthopaedic surgeon in the pathway for the evaluation of potential osteoporosis in patients experiencing a low - energy DRF. Prospective randomized clinical trials to evaluate whether immobilization of the elbow is preferable to a shor t arm cast in patients treated with cast immobilization. Prospective randomized clinical trials to evaluate whether concomitant arthroscopic or open evaluation and treatment (vs. no treatment or delayed treatment) of associated wrist bone and ligament inju ries, improves patient outcomes in the treatment of acute DRF. A clinical or radiographic measure of DRUJ instability that can reliably be applied intraoperatively after radius fixation remains to be developed. In addition, prospective randomized clinical trials to evaluate whether the early identification and treatment of DRUJ instability or distal ulna fractures (e.g. styloid base or tip) improves patient outcomes are needed. In conclusion, while distal radius fractures are well studied, reliable evidenc e is lacking in many key areas that may improve patient care or increase efficient use of resources and thereby reduce healthcare costs. Healthcare is evolving and patients as well as third party payers are demanding proven treatment efficacy. Evidence -based medicine can help healthcare providers provide this proof but only if the current state of medical research quality improves. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 109 IV.

Was the spectrum of patient's r epresentative of the patients who will receive the test in practice? Were selection criteria clearly described? Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition? Is the time period between ref. standard and index test short eno ugh to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests? Did the whole sample or a random selection of the sample, receive verification using a reference standard of diagnosis? Did patients receive the same reference standa rd regardless of the index test result? Was the reference standard independent of the index test (i.e. the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? Was the execution of the index test described in sufficient detail to permit replication of the test? Was the execution of the reference standard described in sufficient detail to permit its replication? Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?

If coding of variables is used, is the coding scheme described or unambiguous? Collinearity has been tested or there is no obvious potential for collinearity? Was the fitting procedure explicitly stated? Were an y goodness -of-fit statistics reported? Was the model subjected to a test of validation? AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 121 APPENDIX VII FORM FOR ASSIGNING STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION (INTERVENTIONS) GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION___________________________________ PRELIMINARY STRENGTH OF RECOMM ENDATION: ________________ STEP 1: LIST BENEFITS AND HARMS Please list the benefits (as demonstrated by the systematic review) of the intervention . Please list the harms (as demonstrated by the systematic review) of the intervention . Please list the benef its for which the systematic review is not definitive . Please list the harms for which the systematic review is not definitive . STEP 2: IDENTIFY CRITICAL OUTCOMES Please circle the above outcomes that are critical for determining whether the intervention is beneficial and whether it is harmful . Are data about critical outcomes lacking to such a degree that you would lower the preliminary strength of the recommendation? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? STEP 3: EVALUATE APPLICABILITY OF THE EVIDENCE Is the applicability of the evidence for any of the critical outcomes so low that substantially worse results are likely to be obtained in actual clinical practice? Please list the critical outcomes backed by evi dence of doubtful applicability. Should the strength of recommendation be lowered because of low applicability? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? STEP 4: BALANCE BENEFITS AND HARMS Are there trade -offs between benefits and harms that alter the strength of recommendation obta ined in STEP 3? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 122 STEP 5 CONSIDER STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE Does the strength of the existing evidence alter the strength of recommendation obtained in STEP 4? What is the resulting strength of recommendation? NOTE: Because we are not performing a formal cost analyses, you should only consider costs if their impact is substantial. AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 123 APPENDIX VIII VOTING BY THE NOMINA L GROUP TECHNIQUE Voting on guideline recommendations will be conducted using a modification of th e nominal group technique (NGT), a method previously used in guideline development.15 Briefly each member of the guideline work group ranks his or her agreement with a guideline recommendation on a scale ranging from 1 to 9 (where 1 is \"extremely inappropriate\" and 9 is \"extremely appropriate\"). Consensus is obt ained if the number of individuals who do not rate a measure as 7, 8, or 9 is statistically non -significant (as determined using the binomial distribution). Because the number of work group members who are allowed to dissent with the recommendation depends on statistical significance, the number of permissible dissenters varies with the size of the work group . The number of permissible dissenters for several work group sizes is given in the table below: Work group Size Number of Permissible Dissenters 3 Not allowed, statistical significance cannot be obtained 4-5 0 6-8 1 9 1 or 2 The NGT is conducted by first having members vote on a given recommendation without discussion. If the number of dissenters is \"permissible\", the recommendation is adopted without further discussion. If the number of dissenters is not permissible, there is further discussion to see whether the disagreement(s) can be resolved. Three rounds of voting are held to attempt to resolve disagreements. If disagreements are not resolve d after three voting rounds, no recommendation is adopted. OPINION -BASED RECOMMENDATION S A guideline can contain recommendations that are backed by little or no data. Under such circumstances, work group s often issue opinion -based recommendations. Although doing so is sometimes acceptable in an evidence -based guideline (expert opinion is a form of evidence), it is also important to avoid constructing a guideline that liberally uses expert opinion; research shows that expert opinion is often incorrect. Opin ion-based recommendations are developed only if they address a vitally important aspect of patient care. For example, constructing an opinion -based recommendation in favor of taking a history and physical is warranted. Constructing an opinion -based recomme ndation in favor of a specific modification of a surgical technique is seldom warranted. To ensure that an opinion -based recommendation is absolutely necessary, the AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 124 AAOS has adopted rules to guide the content of the rationales that underpin such recommenda tions. These rules are based on those outlined by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).96 Specifically, rationales based on expert opinion must: Not contain references to or citations from articles not included in the systematic review that underpins the recommendation. Not contain the AAOS guideline language \"We Recommend\", \"We su ggest\" or \"treatment x is an option\". Contain an explanation of the potential preventable burden of disease. This involves considering both the incidence and/or prevalence of the disease, disorder, or condition and considering the associated burden of suf fering. To paraphrase the USPSTF, when evidence is insufficient, provision of a treatment (or diagnostic) for a serious condition might be viewed more favorably than provision of a treatment (or diagnostic) for a condition that does not cause as much suffe ring. The AAOS (like the USPSTF) understand that evaluating the \"burden of suffering\" is subjective and involves judgment. This evaluation should be informed by patient values and concerns. The considerations outlined in this bullet make it difficult to re commend new technologies. It is not appropriate for a guideline to recommend widespread use of a technology backed by little data and for which there is limited experience. Such technologies are addressed in the AAOS' Technology Overviews. Address potentia l harms. In general, \"When the evidence is insufficient, an intervention with a large potential for harm (such as major surgery) might be viewed less favorably than an intervention with a small potential for harm (such as advice to watch less television).\"96 Address apparent discrepancies in the logic of different recommendations. Accordingl y, if there are no relevant data for several recommendations and the work group chooses to issue an opinion -based recommendation in some cases but chooses not to make a recommendation in other cases, the rationales for the opinion -based recommendations mus t explain why this difference exists. Information garnered from the previous bullet points will be helpful in this regard. Consider current practice. The USPSTF specifically states that clinicians justifiably fear that not doing something that is done on a widespread basis will lead to litigation. The consequences of not providing a service that is neither widely available nor widely used are less serious than the consequences of not providing a treatment accepted by the medical profession and thus expected by patients.96 Discussions of available treatments and procedures rely on mutual commu nication between the patient's guardian and physician, and on weighing the potential risks and benefits for a given patient. The patient's \"expectation of treatment\" must be tempered by the treating AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 125 physician's guidance about the reasonable outcomes that t he patient can expect. Justify, why a more costly device, drug, or procedure is being recommended over a less costly one whenever such an opinion -based recommendation is made. Work group members write the rationales for opinion based recommendations on th e first day of the final work group meeting. When the work group re-convenes on the second day of its meeting, it will vote on the rationales. The typical voting rules will apply. If the work group cannot adopt a rationale after three votes, the rationale and the opinion -based recommendation will be withdrawn, and a \"recommendation\" stating that the group can neither recommend for or against the recommendation in question will appear in the guideline. Discussions of opinion -based rationales may cause some members to change their minds about whether to issue an opinion -based recommendation. Accordingly, at any time during the discussion of the rationale for an opinion -based recommendation, any member of the work group can make a motion to withdraw that recom mendation and have the guideline state that the work group can neither recommend for or against the recommendation in question. CHECKLIST FOR VOTING ON OPINION -BASED RECOMMENDATION S When voting on the rationale, please consider the following: 1. Does the reco mmendation affect a substantial number of patients or address treatment (or diagnosis) of a condition that causes death and/or considerable suffering? 2. Does the recommendation address the potential harms that will be incurred if it is implemented and, if th ese harms are serious, does the recommendation justify; a. why the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms and/or b. why an alternative course of treatment (or diagnostic workup) that involves less serious or fewer harms is not being recommended? 3. Does the rationale explain why the work group chose to make a recommendation in the face of minimal evidence while, in other instances, it chose to make no recommendation in the face of a similar amount of evidence? 4.

AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 131 APPENDIX X I INTERPRETING THE FOR EST PLOTS Throughout the guideline we use descriptive diagrams or forest plots to present data from studies comparing the differences in outcomes between two treatment groups. In this guideline there are no meta -analyses of treatments (combining results of multiple studies into a single estimate of overall effect), so each point and correspond ing horizontal line on a sample plot should be viewed independently. In the example below, the odds ratio is the effect measure used to depict differences in outcomes between the two treatment groups of a study. In other forest plots, the point can refer t o other summary measures (such as the mean difference or relative risk). The horizontal line running through each point represents the 95% confidence interval for that point. In this graph, the solid vertical line represents \"no effect\" where the Odds Rati o, OR, is equal to one. When mean differences are portrayed, the vertical line of no effect is at zero. For example, in the figure below the odds of a patient experiencing Outcome 1 are 5.9 times greater for patients who received Treatment B than for pati ents who received Treatment A.. This result is statistically significant because the 95% Confidence Interval does not cross the \"no effect\" line. In general, the plots are arranged such that results to the left of the \"no effect\" line favor Treatment A whi le results to the right favor Treatment B. In the example below, the odds ratio for Outcome 1 favors Treatment B, the odds ratio for Outcome 3 favors Treatment A, and the odds ratio for Outcome 2 does not favor either treatment because the 95% CI crosses the \"no effect\" line (i.e. the difference is not statistically significant). Outcome 1 Outcome 2 Outcome 3 Outcome 5.90 (3.38, 10.29) 0.72 (0.43, 1.19) 0.11 (0.06, 0.20) Odds Ratio (95% CI) 5.90 (3.38, 10.29) 0.72 (0.43, 1.19) 0.11 (0.06, 0.20) Treatment A Treatment B 1 1 AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 132 ABBREVIATIONS USED I N THIS REPORT 95% CI 95% confidence interval AAOS American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons ANOVA analysis of variance BOC AAOS Board of Councilors BOD AAOS Board of Directors BOS AAOS Board of Specialty Societies CI confidence interval CME Continuing Medical Education CORQAT AAOS Council on Research, Quality Assessment, and Technology CRPS complex regional pain syndrome CT computerized tomography CTS carpal tunnel syndrome DASH Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand DRF distal radius fracture DRUJ distal radioulnar joint EBP medicine EBPC AAOS Evidence Based Practice Committee Ex-fix external fixation fx fracture GRADE Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation working group GTOC AAOS Guidelines and Technology Oversight Committee HSROC hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve LT lunotriquetral MCID minimal clinically importa nt difference MCII minimal clinically important improvement MFA Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment mm millimeter MRI magnetic resonance imaging n/a not applicable NGT Nominal Group Technique NYOH New York Orthopaedic Hospital OR odds ratio OREF Orthopedic Research and Education Foundation ORIF open reduction internal fixation ORS Orthopaedic Research Society PEMF pulsed electromagnetic field PRWE Patient -Rated Wrist Evaluation instrument QUADAS Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Stud ies instrument ROC receiver operating characteristic curve RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy SD standard deviation AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 Form Health Survey Instrument SF-12 MCS 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument Mental Component Score SF-12 PCS 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument Physical Component Score SF-36 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument SF-36 MCS 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument Mental Component Score SF-36 PCS 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument Physical Component Score SLIL scapholunate interosseous ligament SMD standardized mean difference complex VAS visual analog scale VLP volar locking plate WMD weighted mean difference AAOS v1.0 12.05.09 134 APPENDIX XII CONFLICT OF INTEREST All members of t he AAOS work group disclosed any conflicts of interest prior to the development of the recommendations for this guideline.
