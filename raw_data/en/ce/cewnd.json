And while the hope is that it can someday be used to help those diag-nosed with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia, not enough research has been done in the United States to verify its use for dementia treatment. \"There have been studies that under- score the way that cannabinoids can help with agitation, anxiety and insomnia, all of which can accompany dementia, and there is also observational data showing that cannabinoids help, but randomized prospective controlled trials have not been done,\" explained Melanie K.

Quality Next-Level Care for Patients With Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Dr. Ileana Leyva Medical Cannabis Being Studied for Issues Related to Aging BY DR. ILEANA LEYVA As a progressive neurodegenerative dis- ease, Alzheimer's requires substantial help from caregivers. From bath ing to feeding to other activities of daily living (ADLs), caregivers stepped in to provide an esti-mated 18 billion hours of care last year for loved ones with Alzheimer's and related dementias. These 11.4 million caregivers were unpaid. 1 How do we lighten the burden for fami- ly caregivers without shifting it to already-stressed healthcare settings? For patients who no longer respond to optimized ther-apies and show increased functional decline, hospice may be the answer. Hospice supports caregivers by offering clinical and psychosocial expertise to man-age patient symptoms. This next-level care provides complex modalities for those who require high-acuity care and includes integrative services to enhance their quali-ty of life. The hospice team works alongside care- givers to provide psychosocial support, community resource connections, and respite services. Caregivers receive imme-diate, ongoing grief and bereavement sup-port, reducing depression and anxiety and contributing to better overall health.

Recently elected Chair of the Conference of Florida Medical Society Executives (CFMSE) and appointed to the Florida Medical Association (FMA), his story is an exemplary chronicle of a vision coming to fruition. A Puerto Rican native, Bosch's journey began amidst the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. The har-rowing five-month experience without power, as he describes, compelled him to seek a new horizon. Florida became that beacon of hope. \"After living close to 5 months without power we took the painful deci-sion of starting a new adventure in Miami,\" Bosch reminisces. He began his Florida journey with Cobbe Consulting and Management (CCM) in 2018 and soon took the reins of the Dade County Medical Association (DCMA). The following year, he further expanded his managerial repertoire by overseeing the Miami Orthopaedic Society (MOS). These accomplishments weren't just profession-al milestones; they broke historical barriers as Bosch became the first Hispanic, specifically Puerto Rican, to hold these positions.

There is extensive discus-sion about designing environments for an aging popula-tion. However, I believe it is probably an unfortunate undertaking to try to compartmentalize and humanize any population group to rationalize a design solution that addresses their specific needs. Truthfully , their needs are global needs for all ages and hold true for an aging population, millennial population, or Gen X or Z. All designs need to create stimulating spaces that pro- mote physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing, and encourage social and technological interaction. Buildings will continue to accommo-date changing needs and healthcare's ever-changing capacity to heal at an expedited pace. Operational efficiency and economical quality design solutions are universal requirements. Our designs will continue to move in a responsible social direction to improve compatibility among generations. It is the intergenerational support struc-ture that addresses many of the needs of the elderly . Whatever spaces we design - from restaurants, apartment buildings, to homes and assisted living facilities - intergenerational interaction will be the norm.

After the success-ful removal of an annoying (but most importantly , benign) vocal cord growth last week, I was sentenced to 7 days of total voice rest. (Carol's applause was deafening.) According to the resident \"warden,\" my speaking privileges return tomorrow at 12:01 a.m. and not one second (or one little word) before then. I know many of you think - how tough could the last week possi-bly have been? Well, if you're like I am and tend to talk a lot and extremely loudly , this past week felt like months. And to make matters worse, my typing and spelling both leave a lot to be desired, so even my \"type to voice\" app was frustrating. Carol blames it on all my Zoom meetings and phone calls, often mentioning that even Alexander Graham Bell understood that increased volume didn't necessarily equal clearer communication. But alas, in a few short hours I get to consign my trusty white board, pen and eraser to the storage closet, while Carol breaks out her earplugs once again.

As part of its Aeromed Regional Transport Program, the hospital oper- ates five aeromedical helicopters, each outfitted with advanced life-support equipment and specially trained medical teams. Aeromed helicopters transport patients from a vast region, including the state's East Coast and all South Florida. Critical injuries and illnesses can strike anywhere, including locations far from hospitals and health care professionals. That's when TGH's Aeromed program can make the differ-ence between life and death. Last year, the program completed 1,916 transports. That included more than 800 adult trauma and 140 pediatric trauma patients, as well as people who suffered burns, heart attacks, strokes and other emergencies. For the health care providers aboard, these emergency flights challenge their skill-sets in the best way . \"I love my job,\" said Jimmy Holt, a veteran flight nurse and a TGH chief flight nurse of seven years. \"You get up in the morning and you don't know if you'll be 40 miles away or in the middle of nowhere on a two-lane highway at an accident, giving blood while trans-porting someone to a surgeon. You have to be prepared for everything, every day .\" Holt recalled a Mother's Day when his helicopter crew was called to help a 20-year-old man with a stab wound to the chest. A ground ambulance team was the first to respond and provided basic life support. The ground ambulance crew requested Aeromed with blood, breathing equipment and advanced medications. Holt provided critical care while transporting the patient to the nearest trauma center, where a cardiothoracic surgeon was successfully able to stop the bleeding, saving the patient's life. He was discharged a week later, thanks to the close integration of the ground ambulance, the Aeromed crew and the ever-ready trauma center. \"Every shift, there's something like that,\" Holt said. \"That's the fulfilling part, getting to affect somebody else's life and that of their family's as well.\" The medical teams on the Aeromed flights must have advanced critical care training and experience, and be able to treat patients of all ages, including infants. Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients are among those transported, often to TGH, for advanced care. \"It is imperative that our air transport medical services function at this high level,\" said Kelly Cullen, TGH's executive vice president and chief operating officer. Aeromed teams are also qualified to transport patients requiring a form of artificial life support called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO machines keep blood pumping and oxygenated when the heart and lungs aren't functioning properly . This type of advanced treatment is not typically available in ground ambulances or other air medical programs, and focuses on stabilizing patients and getting them to advanced car-diac centers, like TGH, as quickly as possible. \"I have great respect for all our ground partners,\" Holt said. \"We serve different purpos- es. We are a tiny emergency department out in the field. We do a lot of what emergency room doctors do to alleviate problems that would cause someone to perish.\" TGH's Aeromed program has been a four-time recipient of a full, three-year accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS). This recognition is considered the gold standard for patient care in the transport setting. Operating a service like this is costly but vital, noted Michele Moran, TGH's senior director of emergency services. \"John Couris, our president and CEO, is a big believer in taking care of everyone, every day , no matter the circumstances,\" she said. \"A lot of communities really rely on us because of our training and expertise. If it were someone I loved out in an area that doesn't have a large medical center but needed care, I would want a team of experts like this to bring it to them.\" Air transport services provided by Metro Aviation, Inc.

According to BDO's 2023 Healthcare CFO Outlook Survey , 71% of healthcare CFOs reported the talent shortage as a top threat this year. As regular visits to primary care physicians have risen to pre-pandemic levels and fewer clinicians are entering the industry , provider organ-izations must get creative to address labor shortages and increase workforce resilience. Investing in technology can help alle- viate talent shortages and potentially retain current employees. With the right technology , provider organizations can automate certain tasks, streamline care, increase patient access and optimize cli-nician scheduling to prevent burnout. While overhauling or evaluating cur- rent technology systems, software and processes may seem like a daunting task, it could be the difference between strug-gling to staff your provider organization or thriving with a workforce that has the tools it needs to succeed. Here are a few ways to use technology to increase workforce resilience: Automate wherever possible to improve the patient experience and reduce the burden on staff. Any task that can be automated should be when it can reduce the burden on staff. For example, can your organization use robotics to deliver medication from the pharmacy to the nurse's station? Or to bring water to patients? While these tasks may seem small, the time spent on them adds up quickly for clinicians that are caring for multiple patients at a time. Integrate the patient care experience. Health systems must find ways to seamlessly integrate the in-person, virtu-al and home care experiences. Integrating your virtual platform with your in-person system can free up beds, improve patient outcomes and reduce the need for additional staff. Integration may require establishing a digital com-mand center to manage the system and reskilling or upskilling current staff. Once rolled out, organizations can pro-vide services such as remote patient monitoring for visits that typically must happen in person, such as pre- and post-op care. Remote monitoring or virtual visits can be led by physician assistants or nurses, in addition to physicians, to ease staffing shortages. Enhance the staff experience. While nearly three-quarters of CFOs are worried about the talent shortage, only 34% plan to invest in digital trans-formation this year, which could be a missed opportunity to address staffing challenges. Optimizing your organiza-tion's electronic health record (EHR) sys-tem, streamlining systems with multiple logins or disparate data and providing flexible work options are all opportuni-ties to better support your workforce. Include your staff in technology changes. Involving staff that will use new tech- nology each day is a crucial step many organizations overlook. Whenever a health system wants to change or inte-grate new technology , staff members from each department that will be impacted should be included in the deci-sion-making process with IT. This step ensures their input is considered when determining what changes are necessary , whether the changes will improve their workflows and the best ways to roll out new systems to their teams. Finding a professional service firm that has the experience to help you alleviate workforce shortages, increase financial resilience and enhance innovation through digital transformation is key . The interdisciplinary team at The BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence & Innovation understands how the health-care industry is constantly evolving and what it takes to be competitive.

Contact: Alfredo Cepero, Assurance Market Angelo Pirozzi, Partner (646) 520-2870 / apirozzi@bdo.com Four Ways T echnology Can Help Support Your Healthcare Staff BY ALFREDO CEPERO BY VANESSA ORR In August, The Wash - ington Post ran an article that reported on how much money doctors in the U.S. make each year. Based on a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the article also showed how much income doctors made from wages versus other sources of income. While the amount of money that physi- cians earn garnered quite a bit of attention, the fact that doctors were making a good part of their living from outside business activities may have been lost in the shuffle. But doctors need to ensure\u2014especially if much of their income is derived outside of their practice salary\u2014that they are protect-ed in case of a lawsuit. \"The interesting part of this article to me and to many doctors is that overall, when you look at the total population of doctors studied, 94 percent of their income came from wages,\" said Matt Gracey , Managing Director, Risk Strategies / Danna-Gracey . \"However, if you look at the top 10 percent of earners in the medical world, that num-ber drops to 69 percent.\" He noted that within the top 5 percent of doctors studied, only 49 percent of their total income comes from wages, and that in the top 1 percent, that amount decreased to only 15 percent of their income coming from wages. \"This is a stark reminder that doctors who make much more than the average physician are doing so with what we assume are outside business activities,\" said Gracey . \"A lot of very successful doctors\u2014and we know this from our experience insuring doctors\u2014are doing different things to make money outside the normal course of practice, seeing patients and the like.\" This is important, accord- ing to Gracey , because doc-tors often believe that these outside income-producing activities, many of which involve medicine, are cov-ered by their malpractice insurance. Examples of these activities may include serving as expert witnesses, providing independent medical exams (IMEs), tak- ing part in product sales to patients, and becoming involved in clinical trials and other research. \"What these doctors need to understand is that malpractice insurance only covers direct patient care and administrative duties associated with direct patient care,\" Gracey said. While the article does not denote how physicians are earning money outside of wages, for example, if they receive real estate income, if the activity involved is linked to medicine, it's imperative that they know what is and isn't covered through their malpractice insurance. \"I am always surprised with the ques- tions I get from doctors about the exclud-ed activities in their malpractice insurance coverage,\" said Gracey . \"As these top wage earners are not relying solely\u2014or in some cases\u2014very much at all on wages, it raises the fact in the medical and insurance com-munities that doctors are taking part in activities other than medical practices that involve patient care. \"This is why they need to consult with a malpractice insurance expert to make sure that any activities they are doing are either covered by malpractice insurance, or seek out advice on how to get coverage for those outside activities,\" he added.

Matt Gracey Malpractice Insurance EXPERT ADVICE Physicians Earning Outside Income Need to be Aware of Policy ExclusionsSouth Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com September 2023 7BY DANIEL CASCIATO In the sun-drenched cor- ridors of West Florida, an ambitious entrepreneur has been carving a path that bridges the gap between the veterans and newbies in the world of Cancer Registrars. Betsy Johnson, the dynamic founder of HIMpros, has created a blueprint for an authentic business in the heart of the corporate world. Starting in a small company before its absorption into a giant corporation, she saw a rapidly changing landscape. A land-scape where value and authenticity were sacrificed in the name of progress. From her intimate understanding of recruitment, sales, and grassroots business growth, she longed to create a place where she would want to work. In her own words, she yearned for an environment that was \"authentic and true.\" Johnson's voice resonates with authen- ticity and a keen understanding of her niche. Founder of HIMpros, a woman-owned healthcare staffing firm, Johnson's journey from a small company to a corpo-rate entity is what spurred her entrepre-neurial spirit. \"I was in a small company , and then we got bought out by a big corporation, and things changed,\" she recalls. \"I wanted to be authentic and have a company where I felt good about what was happening daily .\" The genesis of HIMpros is intertwined with her desire for genuineness. It's not just about staffing; it's about creating a culture where people would aspire to build their careers, where they would receive the serv-ices they need, and where clients could genuinely find the assistance they were looking for. But Johnson didn't stop at HIMpros. Her vision extended to creating a unique net-working platform named \"The Pros Network.\" Delving into the core of this ini-tiative, Johnson shares, \"The Pros Network was created to provide an avenue for Cancer Registrars to connect, collaborate, and cultivate mutually beneficial relation-ships.\" The platform, which will launch in October, is a revolutionary space explicitly meant for Cancer Registrars to voice their insights, challenges, and aspirations. The platform's focus, Johnson adds, isn't merely about \"educating on how to abstract the chart\" but understanding the professionals' pulse. She emphasizes, \"Because you're not in our business, what we're saying might not make sense.\" The discussions, she assures, are slated to be \"current and relevant,\" presented in an interactive ask-and-answer format. The Pros Network will meet on the 4th Thursday of every month at 2:00 pm ET. The topics will be generated by the group and presented by peers. All meetings will have a posted agenda and start and end on time, with the recorded ses-sion available for those unable to join. According to Johnson, the Pros Network will balance learning, fun, and building peer connec- tions. Building on this founda- tion of connection and collaboration, Johnson has grand visions for the future of HIMpros. Her foresight for HIMpros and The Pros Network extends well into the future. She envisages a future where The Pros Network isn't limited just to Cancer Registrars but expands to other fields like trauma and coding. She dreams of a healthcare staffing network where professionals can find their niche, pose questions, and share experi-ences. As she aptly puts it, her mission is to build a foundation over the next five years, cultivate relationships and offer support across niche areas in healthcare. Her dedication extends to ensuring the platform remains inclusive. The Pros Network will rely heavily on feedback from its community . The aim is to evolve based on the actual needs of the field constantly , addressing pain points and providing actionable solutions. But it's not all just about networking. Johnson recognizes the importance of pro-fessional growth. While structured educa-tional sessions are available elsewhere, The Pros Network offers something unique - a relaxed environment where peers can dis-cuss challenges, share insights, and navi-gate their career paths. The initial discus-sions will showcase the varied roles within the cancer registry domain, revealing the multitude of career avenues available. Her response resonates deeply when reminded of Albert Einstein's words about striving for value over success. For her, it's about making a difference within one's cir-cle. Through HIMpros and The Pros Network, she seeks to be the conduit that facilitates success for every stakeholder in the wheel, ensuring everyone benefits. As Johnson continues to pave the way in healthcare staffing and networking, her motivation remains clear: building plat-forms of genuine connection, collabora-tion, and support. Through her dedication to HIMpros and The Pros Network, Betsy Johnson is redefining what it means to be a leader in the healthcare community of West Florida and setting a remarkable example for future leaders in the industry .

Betsy Johnson: Building Authentic Connections in the World of Healthcare Betsy Johnson In Memoriam Linda Slote Quick 1948-2023 As the president of South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association (SFHHA) for 22 years, Linda Slote Quick earned a reputation as a collaborator and coalition builder and a staunch supporter of those working in the healthcare industry . She once said that it was an honor to be in the same room with the people she repre-sented\u2014and they , in turn, felt the same. On July 31, 2023, Ms. Quick, 75, passed away at her home, leaving behind a legacy that not only encompasses South Florida's health and human services systems, but state and national health policy as well. A lifelong Floridian, Ms. Quick received her bachelor's degree in psychiatry from Newcomb College of T ulane University in 1970, and her MSM from Florida International University in 1974. In her role as president of the South Florida Hospital & Healthcare Association (SFHHA), she worked with more than 50 hospitals, association members and affiliates in Broward, Dade, Monroe, and Palm Beach counties providing advocacy at the local, state and national levels and educational programs for members. During her tenure, Ms. Quick took on a number of leadership roles, including serving on the Governing Council of the American Public Health Association, as the president of the American Health Planning Association, and as the chair-person of the Conference of Metropolitan Hospital Associations. She was on the Regional Policy Board of the American Hospital Association and served on sev-eral AHA committees and task forces. After retiring from SFHHA, Ms. Quick formed the Quick Bernstein Connections Group, where in her role as president she helped to connect people and organizations in human services and worked with a wide array of clients ranging from educational institutions and policymakers to foundations, the business community , and the media. Ms. Quick also took an active volunteer role in the community , working with the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, OneBlood of Florida, the Economic Council of Palm Beach County , Carrfour Supportive Housing, Camillus House & Health, the PACE program of Miami Jewish Health System, FIU's President's Council, and both the University of Miami and Barry University's graduate pro-grams in Health Administration. She is survived by her husband Jerry Bernstein and children Allison and Joe and their families.

BY LOIS THOMSON \"As much as I would like to plan my day , it doesn't necessarily go that way .\" That's the way Aganette Parks, MHA, PMP , described her position as the associate administrator at Delray Medical Center. \"I oversee the daily operations for sever- al ancillary departments,\" she continued, highlighting surgical services, pharmacy , food and nutrition services, therapy servic-es, the inpatient rehabilitation facility , and environmental services as being among them. She doesn't do everything every day , but said, \"A lot of my work is putting out fires. If any of my departments runs into any issues, I help remove any barriers, and provide them with the resources they need to do their job.\" Parks became interested in healthcare at a young age. She said her parents were Haitian immigrants who came to America before she was born. \"I watched at a very young age how my parents, who didn't speak much English, tried to navigate the healthcare system, and how complex it was.\" She noticed the lack of cultural com-petency within the field, and said, \"Seeing that at a young age made me want to get into healthcare and health administration to see if I could make a positive impact, to reach not just the Haitian community , but others within the community and be a rep-resentative.\" Parks said that was the main driver in seeking a leadership role, to have a seat at the table, and be able to directly influence decision-making that affects patients for all the right reasons. \"I'm not clinical, I'm not an RN, but to help remove any barriers for our clinicians to provide the best care for patients - that's what I enjoy doing the most as an administrator.\" Parks credits her current, and all of her previous positions under the Tenet umbrel-la, to her association with the American College of Healthcare Executives, an organization she became associated with when she was a student in graduate school in 2014. \"I did my masters of health administration at the University of Florida, and we were introduced to ACHE as stu-dent members. I met some great people, fellowshipped, networked. Since then, I've always continued to be a member and joined my local chapter.\" For Parks, the membership has been a matter of building relationships, network-ing, getting education about her field. When she first joined, Parks said she understood healthcare executives to only be in hospitals and expected to just be con-necting with other healthcare leaders. \"But I've gotten more than that, I've been able to get so much more education, which has helped me to stay abreast of fresh topics in healthcare. That's probably the best thing I've gotten out of the organization.\" Last year, Parks served on an ACHE panel on women in leadership, and said that as a black female administrator, it was a great opportunity to be able to showcase that. \"Having a leadership role and being able to speak to others about the challenges I faced, and how I navigated the field, has probably been my biggest contribution to the organization so far.\" Parks said she would \"absolutely\" rec- ommend joining ACHE, especially as a student, and called it a great organization to be plugged into to meet other like-minded individuals. \"ACHE covers more than just hospital administrators, they cover all different specialties in healthcare - outside of hospitals, clinics - they have such a wide spectrum of all the subspecial-ties of healthcare. You can see that in the education they provide, the different top-ics. So I recommend for anyone who has a speck of healthcare within their job, to be a part of this organization.\" ACHE of South Florida Member Spotlight: Aganette Parks Aganette Parks On the 180th day since Former President Jimmy Carter entered hospice care, VITAS\u00ae Healthcare and other hos-pice providers from across the U.S. joined for a special celebration in Times Square in New York City to honor the life and continued legacy of America's 39th president. The event, hosted by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), commemorated Carter's remarkable six-month milestone journey in hospice care at home. \"As the nation's leading hospice provider, VITAS is honored to join NHPCO and its member organizations in recognizing the impact that Former President Carter's end-of-life journey has had on our country ,\" said Nick Westfall, President and Chief Executive Officer for VITAS. \"Our hope is that his legacy con-tinues to inspire people to discuss end-of-life care options more openly and encour-ages earlier referrals to hospice when appropriate.\" As per Medicare hospice eligibility guidelines, patients qualify for end-of-life care with a prognosis of six months or less, based on the expected course of the terminal disease. Carter's journey empha-sizes the unpredictability of illnesses and underscores the value of prioritizing qual-ity of life. Carter's decision to receive hospice care after a cancer diagnosis has brought signif-icant attention to the importance of this specialized form of care. His journey has raised awareness about the benefits of hos-pice care and the comprehensive support it provides to patients and their families. \u0081 Interdisciplinary care that addresses the physical, emotional and social needs of the patient and their loved ones \u0081 Specialized services such as veteran care, pet visits, music and massage thera-pies, respiratory therapy and more \u0081 Personalized care plans by serious ill- ness condition \u0081 Compassionate care informed by diversity The celebration in the heart of New York City served as a reminder of the pos- itive impact that hospice care can have on individuals facing serious illness and the importance of expanding access to these services nationwide. New research published earlier this year indicates that earlier enrollment and longer lengths of stay , like Carter's, help patients\u2014and their loved ones\u2014maximize the benefits of hospice. The Carter family's transparency in sharing his end-of-life journey is an inspiration for hospice champions around the world.

Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies' Basics4Babies stocks diapers in multiple sizes, which are made available to low-income families in the community , along with other products to off-set some of the high costs associated with infant care. More than 10,000 expectant women are served through this, and other services provided by the nonprofit, each year. \"The board and staff of Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies, extends our gratitude to AmeriHealth Caritas Florida for volunteering with us in our Basics4Babies emergency pantry and for the many ways they continue to invest in our programs,\" said CEO of Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Palm Beach County Michelle Gonzalez. The visit from AmeriHealth Caritas Florida is the most recent in several collaborative efforts with Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies\u2014a 40-year nonprofit committed to improv-ing birth outcomes. AmeriHealth Caritas Florida has also contributed a total of $5,000 to the nonprofit's Stronger Together initiative to provide doula certification to Black women, qualifying them to provide psychosocial, emotional, and educational support to mothers of similar racial backgrounds through the coalition's maternal health program. Through its maternal support program for members, Bright Start\u00ae, AmeriHealth Caritas Florida also has referred expectant women to Healthy Mothers, Health Babies for educational and support services. \"Over the years, Palm Beach County has seen dramatic racial disparities in maternal deaths. Working in tandem with Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies on these initiatives to create greater maternal health equity not only strengthens our communities today but cre-ates a path for healthier and more prosperous communities tomorrow ,\" said AmeriHealth Caritas Florida Market President Melody Bonomo.Volunteer Efforts at Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Latest in AmeriHealth Caritas Florida's Ongoing Support My wife and I took my son and his girlfriend to a newer Hibachi place. Despite some of the pre- dictable antics like the onion volcano/\"choo-choo train,\" it's always a good time when an entertaining chef prepares the food right in front of you. The place was packed. The place was really cool too! Complete with realistic looking cherry blossom trees and a koi pond winding in and out of the seat-ing areas. We were told by the hostess there's a wait of 20- 30 minutes (also very predictable). After about an hour, we finally found ourselves seated in front of the giant skillet. Everyone was handed menus and my wife whispered to me, '18% gratuity included in every check'. 'Here we go,' I thought immediate-ly . What was coming was in my mind again predictable. Slow service. We all have enough experience to know that when there is little to no incen- tive for people to go the extra mile, they rarely do. And the staff were not dis-appointed. T wenty minutes to take our drink orders. T wenty minutes for the drinks to come. Fifteen more minutes to take our food orders. No exaggera-tion. The staff had two speeds, slow and stop. The hibachi chef was actually excellent. Entertaining, funny , cooked the food to perfection, and of course stacked the sliced onions neatly into a mountain. Is this the same thing going on in your organization? Despite the main rea- son patients are coming, the doctor, surgeon, etc. being great, the supporting staff is letting you down? The question is how are you incentivizing them? Many times, like service at a restaurant, you get what you pay for. It doesn't take much. Encouraging and rewarding the team to limit wait times, over-com-municate, explain delays and generally ensuring that from the time the patient arrives until the time they leave, the experience is consistent and positive. This will go a long way to patient satisfaction, more referrals, and driving revenues. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff, ImageFIRST .

BY JAY JUFFRE When It Comes to Patient Care - Incentivize 10 September 2023 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital Newsrelated to dementia, it has not yet been proven in humans, according to Dr. Bone, who notes that in Israel, research about using cannabis for dementia is ongoing. She adds that until 2021, all cannabis used for studies in the U.S. had to be obtained from one source, the University of Mississippi, and though the DEA now permits approved private growers to sup-ply products to facilitate studies, institu- tional review boards (IRBs) have to approve all human studies looking at safety parameters. \"I had such a study , but the IRB raised legitimate concerns about dizziness and falls since the study was going to be on a locked memory care unit where falls already happen with more frequency than elsewhere, and it would be difficult with a small study to determine if the interven-tion caused more falls,\" said Dr. Bone. \"Additionally , the patients were unable to provide informed consent so it was up to the families who may or may not have wanted their loved ones to participate.\" Though Dr. Bone's study was finally approved, the number of patients available to take part in the study has decreased during the interim, making the number of patients she was going to study too few to make any substantive conclusions. As the director of medical cannabinoid therapies at MorseLife Health System, Dr. Bone continues her research into the use of cannabis for residents and those using the health system for palliative and hospice care and affiliated therapies. MorseLife is the only senior care provider authorized by the state of Florida to offer cannabis-based therapies in a variety of care settings as part of a pilot program. Those using THC-containing products at MorseLife must have a medical mari-juana card, order and pay for it them-selves and self-administer the product. Those who use CBD only can have it administered with their regular medica-tions, provided that Dr. Bone writes the orders and follows their progress. \"At MorseLife, we have had the same success that is typical for cannabis use by patients in my private practice and else-where\u2014it seems to help people about 70 percent of the time,\" said Dr. Bone. \"The rest stop for a few reasons: either it is not working well enough, it is too hard to navigate the system or the expense is too much. \"We could make it better if we figured out a way to mainstream cannabis and get it covered by insurance,\" she added. At this time, no federal funds will cover resources associated with cannabis-based therapies including those for med-ical marijuana patients. Dr. Bone notes that after doing this type of work since 2016, while not all patients with dementia have an over-whelmingly positive change with cannabinoids, there is little to no down-side to trying it. \"There may be rare gastrointestinal upset, and in some cases, patients have had difficulty with swallowing or chew-ing the products which has led to the need to stop, but the underlying ailment did not get worse,\" she said. Dr. Bone adds that senior patients do need a lot of guidance to get to efficacy without side effects, and sometimes become frustrated when the first recom-mendation is not the perfect one. \"Because their metabolism is changing and they are often on many other medica-tions, it is imperative to take the time to try to determine possible drug-drug interac-tions and risk of dizziness, falling, and impaired perception, especially if they are dosing themselves,\" she said. \"Usually , the older the patient, the more challenging it can be to initiate a new inter-vention, including cannabis. In addition, if there is age-related cognitive impairment, it can add to the challenge,\" she continued. \"But many seniors are still sharp and do very well with cannabis.\" Cover Story: Medical Cannabis Being Studied for Issues Related to Aging Continued from page 1 Balance For Life Florida to Host October Holistic Retreats Ft Lauderdale area-based Balance for Life Retreat has partnered with the world-class Wyndham Deerfield Beach Resort to create three all-inclusive programs from October 8 to 14, 15 to 21 and 8 to 21, designed for lifestyle health reju- venation, stress management and weight loss.

Memorial Primary Care Brings Mobile Health Resources and Services to Underserved Community Memorial Healthcare System continued its \"One City at a Time\" community outreach program with a kickoff event at C.W . Thomas Park in Dania Beach. Broward County's oldest city now joins Hallandale Beach in receiving ongoing mobile health services from Memorial, making it easier for individuals with limited resources to access care. The event featured free health screenings for adults and children, with numerous parents using the opportunity to get kids a school-required physi-cal before classes resumed. Elizabeth Justen, chair of the South Broward Hospital District Board of Commissioners, helped distribute healthy food packages, and there were also giveaways to those who qualified of Wi-Fi-enabled tablets that can be used for telehealth visits. Memorial Primary Care representatives and vendors offered nutritional counseling, Medicaid eligibility/insurance enroll-ment information, and connections to social services, while attendees also enjoyed music, lunch, and kid's activities. Leaders from Memorial Healthcare System and the City of Dania Beach spoke about the importance of a partnership that will have adult and pediatric mobile health centers on-site at the park on a regular basis for the next two years. \"We know that not having easy access to care is one of the social determinants that impact a per-son's overall health,\" said Melida Akiti, chief community officer for Memorial Healthcare System. \"Our ongoing efforts are about removing barriers and helping people proactively manage their health.\" 'One City' primarily assists those who are uninsured or underinsured, with out- reach to communities in Hollywood and Miramar planned for the near future. It's all part of Memorial Primary Care's commitment to proactive health that can prevent or more easily treat chronic conditions before they become a crisis for an individual and his or her family South Broward Hospital District Board Chair Elizabeth Justen delivers foodPhysician Assistants (PAs) have an increasingly important role in changing the behavioral health landscape. Their contributions help address the growing demand for mental health services, help reduce the shortage of mental health providers across the nation, and improve patient care and outcomes. According to the Association of PAs in Psychiatry (APAP), approximately 4% of PAs nationwide practice exclusively in psy-chiatry , and work as part of a collabora-tive team, including psychiatrists, social workers, and other health care profes-sionals, to ensure that patients receive comprehensive care that addresses men-tal and physical needs. Since providers encounter patients with mental health challenges in all practice specialties, PAs have extensive education including behavioral medicine. The significance of understanding and addressing behavioral health conditions is reflected in the cur-riculum of the PA Program at South University West Palm Beach. Training in behavioral medicine begins in the didac-tic year in the Essentials of Behavioral Medicine course, and continues through-out the didactic year as part of other courses such as Essentials of Emergency Medicine, Clinical Medicine and Pharmacotherapeutics, and Clinical Medicine and Pharmacotherapeutics Lab. The Essentials of Behavioral Medicine stands as a foundational pillar in educat-ing PAs about evaluating and managing patients grappling with mental and behavioral health chal-lenges. This course equips stu-dents with effective interview-ing techniques, comprehensive assessment methods, and essen-tial pharmacotherapeutic prin-ciples, to develop appropriate treatment plans for various behavioral and mental health conditions across our lifespan. Pharmacological teachings enable students to create indi-vidual treatment plans by edu-cating on major drug classes, mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and population-specific modifi-cations using evidence-based medicine including American Psychiatric Association guidelines. The course curriculum includes social and behavioral sciences applicable to clinical practice, covering topics such as human sexuality , substance abuse detec-tion and treatment, violence and neglect identification and prevention, and response to stress and trauma. The Essentials of Behavioral Medicine course aims to equip PA students with essential skills and knowledge. Education in this area extends beyond the didactic year and into the clinical year, where all PA students do a five-week core rotation in Behavioral Medicine. Students are placed at inpa-tient or outpatient behavioral health facilities and are paired with clinical pre-ceptors to perform various assignments to strengthen their clinical skills in prac-tice. South University PA students gain experience with patients of all ages and mental health conditions, preparing them for real-world clinical settings. South University PA students are also fortuitous to have Medical Director Dr. Jeffrey Bishop who is board certified in both Family Medicine and Addiction Medicine. He is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and spent 10 years as a USN CWO2 Physician Assistant prior to med-ical school. He is on the Board of Directors for Trustbridge, and is the Medical Director for several SUD Centers, and SKYKARE, Medical Transport company . Starting on June 23, 2023, all DEA pre- scribers are required to complete eight hours of education on the treatment and management of patients with opioid or other substance use disorders. Dr. Bishop will be teaching this course at South University for all students, faculty , and alumni, and this will be an annual course offered to South University PA program graduates to support our community .

BISHOP , DO, AND CAITLIN SPAULDING, MMS, PA-C T ampa General Hospital, Lifepoint Behavioral Health and USF Health Break Ground on New Behavioral Health Hospital Leaders of Tampa General Hospital (TGH), Lifepoint Behavioral Health and USF Health were recently joined by elected officials, board members and other key stakeholders to break ground on the TGH Behavioral Health Hospital, a new four-story hospital in the heart of Tampa's Medical and Research District. The TGH Behavioral Health Hospital, which is expected to open in late 2024, will be the first and only freestanding academic medical behavioral health hospital in Florida. \"As the community continues its trajectory of unprecedented growth, the demand for mental and behavioral health services is higher than ever before,\" said John Couris, pres-ident and CEO of Tampa General Hospital. \"Today marks the start of construction on the first and only freestanding academic behavioral health hospital in the state, and we are proud to have the support of our state lawmakers, local leaders and community in this endeavor. The TGH Behavioral Health Hospital will significantly expand Floridians' access to mental health services, and our patients can expect the world-class care we consistently deliver at TGH.\" The new hospital is the result of a joint venture partnership between Tampa General and Lifepoint Behavioral Health, a business unit of Lifepoint Health, announced last year. Tampa General Hospital will provide a number of facility and medical support services, while Lifepoint Behavioral Health will manage the day-to-day operations. Physicians with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine will provide a full range of inpatient and outpatient care in specialized units for pediatrics, adolescents, adults and geriatrics. The hospital, which is planned to be approximately 83,000 square feet with 96 to 120 inpatient beds, will feature dedicated units for treating patients with behavioral health issues compounded by other medical conditions. The facility was made possible in part by funding from the state of Florida to address the state's growing mental health crisis. This past legislative session, Senator Jay Collins and Representative Lawrence McClure secured $10 million in the state budget to support the construction of the TGH Behavioral Health Hospital. \"The demand for mental health services is greater than ever before,\" said Senator Collins. \"Tampa General Hospital is taking the lead to expand access to high-quality care and fulfill our greatest needs. Right here in the heart of the Tampa Medical and Research District, the patients of the new TGH Behavioral Health Hospital will benefit from the world-class care that TGH provides, the latest innovations and research findings, and the newest technologies.\" At the TGH Behavioral Health Hospital, psychiatrists on the faculty with USF Health Morsani College of Medicine will also offer learning opportunities for USF medical stu-dents and resident physicians. The hospital will be directly linked to Tampa General's nationally recognized Neuroscience Institute, through which best-in-class physicians pro-vide a full spectrum of care to patients of all ages with neurological disorders.Mental Health...

While technology propels modern healthcare, the human element is of para-mount significance. Human interaction is a core principle in the mission to heal the body , mind, and spirit of patients. Nevertheless, the substantial number of per-sonnel involved, multiplied by a myriad of processes and enabling technology creates significant cybersecurity risks. The intersection of healthcare and cybersecurity has never been more critical, as the healthcare sector becomes an attrac-tive target for malicious criminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in its digital infra-structure. Safeguarding patient data and ensuring continuity of care is everyone's responsibil-ity . It requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses three principles: security and privacy first culture, Zero Trust and not \"if\" but when mentality . Robust training and education The phrase \"it takes a village\" is more relevant and poignant in healthcare than any other industry . The care journey of every patient is driven by expert clinicians and healthcare workers who follow a host of processes that usually involve technolo-gy and handling of private information. Each healthcare employee who interacts with the patient, either physically or digitally , should understand cybersecurity implications and risks. Whether it is an email that can contain ran-somware/malware or a med-ical device that has a soft-ware vulnerability , the end user should have a working knowledge to support their responsibility and protect the patient. Training programs should emphasize the importance of strong pass-word hygiene, recognizing suspicious emails, and adhering to established securi-ty protocols. By fostering a culture of cyber vigilance, healthcare organizations can cre-ate a formidable defense against external threats. Security and Privacy First Culture Cybersecurity professionals should work with clinicians and other cross func-tional teams to develop and implement cybersecurity guidelines and governance supported by robust training and aware-ness programs. To build and truly adopt a security and privacy first culture and avoid gaps that create risks, the whole \"village\" must be involved. Cybersecurity strategy should include provisions for managing the security of every person and device with a Zero Trust mentality . The Zero Trust concept is about controlled and managed inclusion with a goal to provide everyone safe and secure access to data needed to perform their job duties or manage their health condition. A Zero Trust cybersecurity program uses authentication, identification and classifi-cation to identify anomalous activity which may indicate impermissible access to patient data. Documenting and classifying where data is stored and how it is used is vital to developing a cybersecurity posture that enhances patient care. Active surveillance and protection of data can only be provid-ed when we understand the acceptable use cases for that data. The technology stack to support securi- ty and privacy controls is complex and unfortunately expensive but vital as the cloud-based industry and Artificial Intelligence become mainstream. New era of patient interactions The healthcare industry's rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), like Memorial's MyChart, and other digital platforms has transformed patient care, streamlining processes and enhancing communication. This digital revolution, while beneficial, has also exposed the sec-tor to potential breaches, data theft and ransomware attacks. The rise of telehealth services further amplifies the urgency of healthcare cyber-security . The widespread adoption of remote medical consultations and data sharing requires secure platforms. As tele-health continues to evolve, so must the strategies to protect it. Robust encryption and secure authenti- cation methods must be integrated into EHRs and other medical systems to safe-guard patient data. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments are essential to identify weak points and address them promptly . Simultaneously , partnerships with cybersecurity firms can provide access to cutting-edge tools and expertise, enabling healthcare systems to stay ahead of emerging threats. Conclusion Data is a valuable asset. The conse- quences of inadequate cybersecurity in healthcare are dire. A breach not only com-promises sensitive patient information, such as medical records and personal iden-tification, but it can also disrupt critical medical equipment and services, leading to life-threatening situations. Cyberattacks can halt patient care, delay surgeries, and result in medication errors, putting lives at risk. Be prepared for the eventually of a cyber- incident. The \"it will never happen to us\" philosophy is flawed and will result in neg-ative outcomes. Be prepared, perform drills and tests to ensure everyone is involved and understands what to do when a cyber-event occurs. Understand the challenges, collectively find solutions, everyone is in this together. Richard Leon is Chief Information Security Officer, Memorial Healthcare System. Fortifying Healthcare System Cybersecurity: It's Everyone's Responsibility BY RICHARD LEON South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com September 2023 13Visit us on the web at www.southfloridahospitalnews.comwww.southfloridahospitalnews.comCover Story: Angel Bosch: A Beacon of Innovation and Leadership in Florida's Medical Society cially in a locale where Spanish is pre- dominant. \"We have to take in consideration that in Miami 67% of the people speaks Spanish and less that 30% speaks only English,\" he says, underscoring his unique vantage point. \"In CFMSE's case, my nature and origins will help broaden the perspective of my colleagues across the state as well as in the FMA, especial-ly these days when people are talking about inclusion, equity and diversity .\" This linguistic competence, married to his Hispanic-American dual perspective, holds promise for fostering inclusion, equity , and diversity in the CFMSE and FMA. In his inaugural speech, Bosch laid out a clear vision: Education, Advocacy , and Financial Stability . Education: Bosch believes in harness- ing the power of technology and artifi-cial intelligence to bridge generational gaps within the medical community . By equipping members with tools to cope with rapid advancements and chal-lenges, such as burnout, Bosch aspires for CFMSE to be a beacon of support and knowledge. Advocacy: Bosch underscores the need for CFMSE to be proactive in voicing its members' concerns, ensuring that the medical community is represented and heard, especially in matters related to healthcare policies. \"CFMSE has to be part of the solution to be relevant,\" Bosch states emphatically . Financial Stability: Recognizing the necessity of external partnerships, Bosch envisages forging win-win alliances that would reinforce the organization's fiscal standing while reciprocating benefits. Bosch has also emphasized the impor- tance of addressing generational gaps, artificial Intelligence, and emotional intelligence. \"We have to emphasize education at all levels, not just the technical aspects of the business such as payroll, account-ing, and membership,\" he says. \"We need to fill the gaps that the different generations have within the same groups. Among our members we have physicians in different cohort groups. As Medical Society Execs, we have to know how to deal with that in order to recruit and retain members.\" Bosch also explains the importance of knowing about the latest in technology to help members to deal with all the changes in treatments and procedures (medical and administrative processes). \"With the growth of technological advances, we have to support our mem-bers with tools\u2014education in emotional intelligence or how to deal with burnout\u2014that can help them to cope with changes, among others. We have to do that in order to be relevant to our actual and future members.\" Bosch's past roles provide a rich tapes- try of experience to draw from. His 9-year stint as the Executive Director of the Puerto Rico Orthopaedic Society (SPOT) furnished him with an in-depth understanding of organized medicine, while his entrepreneurial venture, A Planners\u2014a Public Relations, lobbying, and event planning small business\u2014honed his business acumen. \"Thanks to the business relations I developed during my time with SPOT, I got the opportunity of working in Miami,\" he says. \"That experience pro-vided me with the experience and know- how of working with physicians in the organized medicine environment.\" Having his own PR shop helped devel- op his skills in managing a business and further develop his leadership skills, Bosch notes. \"Being part of Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce during a period of 7 years as an employee gave me perspective and the experience to see the benefits of join-ing the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce at the Board level and its Government Affairs and Healthcare Committees,\" he says. Perhaps the cornerstone of Bosch's leadership philosophy is collaboration. Echoing Dr. Carmel Barrau's sentiments at the FMA Annual Meeting, Bosch champions active participation and engagement. \"Your participation and engagement remain crucial to the suc-cess of our organization,\" he says, chal-lenging every CFMSE member to ampli-fy the society's strength by attracting new members and sponsors. Moreover, his inclusion in the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce and its Government Affairs and Healthcare Committees underscores his commit-ment to strengthening the symbiosis between healthcare and governance. Bosch's journey from Puerto Rico, through the harrowing aftermath of Hurricane Maria, to Florida's medical leadership echelons is a testament to his resilience, innovation, and vision. As he steers CFMSE and FMA into the future, the medical community awaits transfor-mative change. For more information, visit miamimed.com.

South Florida Hospital NewsJust as Baby Boomers are aging into their senior years, America is facing a growing shortage of quali-fied physicians. The initial catalyst for the decline was the COVID-19 pandemic, as doctors left practices nationwide in response to long hours and burnout. Currently there are more than 54 million adults aged 65 and older, and that is projected to reach more than 80 million by 2040. Burnout According to the Medscape 2023 \"Physician Burnout and Depression\" report, 57% of the physicians felt burned out, with internal medicine, emergency medicine and pediatric physicians among those most affected. Contributing factors included too many bureaucratic tasks, too many patients and too many work hours. Even with an assembly-line mentality at work for many overworked physicians, it's still not enough. In fact, a 2022 study from the University of Chicago found doctors would need 26.7 hours each day to pro-vide guideline-recommended primary care for their patients. If only there were a way to rethink the status quo, giving physicians more time with each patient, and making the work of a physician more sat-isfying. There is. At its heart is value-based care, a system that rewards good health outcomes rather than how many patients you can see and how many proce-dures you can get them to undergo. In other words, quality takes precedence over quantity . Also critical is working with an integrat-ed care team, in which health care pro-fessionals such as pharmacists, nurses, behavioral-health specialists and care coordinators work together to see that all the patients' needs are met. Back-office support, too, helps ensure that all the i's are dotted and the t's crossed. As an inter-nal medicine physician with Conviva Care Center Deerfield Beach West, I am fortunate to have each of these advan-tages at my disposal, so I have time to develop deeper relationships with my patients that benefit their wellbeing as well as mine. There is a distinct work/life balance that I find very appealing. I can relate to my professional col- leagues, but my experience with Conviva has opened my eyes to a better way of practicing medicine that allows me to retain my passion for helping patients and maintain that work-life balance. My goal is to not only learn about my patients, but to make sure they are on the path to better health. I love what I do. There's a personal standpoint that I find fulfilling as well. As a native of the Philippines, I appreciate members of the \"Greatest Generation\" who helped save my country from oppression during World War II. Some of my senior patients are veterans, and for me it's an instant connection, because when I talk to them it reminds me every day of the sacrifices they made and how important it is to provide them with the best possible care. Stability Conviva doctors work in a stable envi- ronment. I like being part of an estab-lished, secure business organization that continues to expand in the South Florida market, while offering great benefits and opportunities for personal growth. Conviva's network is growing, and this provides physicians opportunities to work at different locations and experi-ence the benefits of an organization that supports a care team model. Conviva has met and surpassed my expectations, because it's a care model that offers holistic, senior-focused care, and every member of the team is engaged in a patient's life. Medical teams at Conviva enjoy a long list of patient referrals. In fact, it's not uncommon for a physician to treat the son or daughter of someone they treated many years before. I value this continu-ity . Our life's work is our patients, and any day we help a patient is a good day . Seniors seeking care at a Conviva Care Center will see a physician experienced in caring for senior patients. Our staff genuinely cares about every patient's well-being and routinely goes above and beyond to meet their needs. Our patients trust how we manage their care. Smaller patient panels and longer appointments allow me to build better relationships, and I feel more satis-faction, because I know my patients are being cared for in every way .

The monumental effort and resources Florida's hospitals poured into addressing the unprece-dented workforce chal-lenge of 2021 and 2022 are yielding positive results. The results from the Florida Hospital Assoc - iation's vacancy and turnover workforce sur-vey for 2023 reveal a dra-matic 38 percent decrease in hospitals' nurse vacancy rate from 2022 to 2023. Hospitals also saw a dra-matic decrease in the nurse turnover rate. That figure has also dropped 38 per-cent from last year. Florida also excels when comparing the state's nurse vacancy and turnover rates to the overall national rates. Florida's nurse vacancy rate of 13 percent is lower than the national vacancy rate of 16 percent. Florida's turnover rate of 20 percent is also lower than the national turnover rate of 22 percent. During 2021 and 2022, hospitals' labor expenses increased more than any other as they increased salaries, instituted new hiring bonuses, and relied on more costly travel and contract labor to fill workforce shortages more than in any other year. While hospitals' patient admissions increased just three percent from 2019 to 2022, overall workforce costs increased by 45 percent, and costs associated with overtime, incentives, premium pay , and salary market share adjustments com-bined increased more than 245 percent. Those unsustainable figures were the backdrop for the hospital industry's com-mitment both to growing the health care workforce and to supporting the existing workforce. Increasing retention, increas-ing the number of students interested in health care careers, and reducing turnover all were priorities for a multi-pronged workforce investment strategy . Individually and collectively , Florida hospitals worked to improve retention and turnover rates across the state. From deploying organizational strategies to increase job satisfaction and meaningful-ly address employee expectations and needs to implementing tech- nology that reduces ineffi- ciencies and administrative burdens, hospitals of all sizes across the state did every- thing they could to demon- strate and reward the value they have for their work- force. Coming together as an industry , Florida's hospitals also advocated for meaning- ful policy solutions and pub- lic investments to grow and support the health care workforce. Florida's hospitals worked alongside policymakers to grow Florida's health care workforce and make Florida's health care institutions the first choice for a medical career. With hospital indus-try advocacy , lawmakers created and funded new health care workforce pro-grams like LINE and PIPELINE to pro-vide state funds for scholarships, resi-dencies, and career ladder support and appropriated funds for the Hometown Hero Housing Program for health care professionals to purchase a home. Similarly , lawmakers funded professional apprenticeship programs such as the Department of Education's Apprentice - ship Accelerator, which benefit both hos-pitals and health care career seekers. Florida's hospitals met the workforce challenges of 2021 and 2022 with the determination, resolve, and creativity they bring to every challenge. Solving the workforce challenge for the long term takes a multi-faceted approach as well as sustained investment and attention. It would be short-sighted to think that the crisis no longer requires attention. With a projected nurse shortage of nearly 60,000 and a physician shortage of 36,000 by 2035, the continued need to invest in both the current and future health care workforce is clear. The good news is that Florida's hospitals, as always, are committed to partnering with others, engaging in advocacy , and speak-ing up to make sure Florida has the health care system it deserves.

Additionally , a Radiation Oncology Center will open at the Brandon location this fall. The TGH Cancer Institute satellite location in Brandon is part of Tampa General's $550 million master facility plan, the largest in the hospital's almost 100-year history . Once completed, TGH will bring more of the most advanced technology and leading-edge care to the academic health system's patients in Florida and beyond. The TGH Cancer Institute in Brandon means that residents in south Hillsborough will no longer have to travel to the Tampa General Hospital campus near downtown Tampa for infusion treatments, radiation oncology and doctor visits. Its location in the outpatient center means that patients can also receive lab work, standard imaging exams as well as visit the pharmacy for prescriptions and over the counter medications. The addition to the TGH Cancer Institute's Infusion Center will offer seven more chemotherapy areas for the treatment of cancer. This will bring the total number of infu-sion areas to 26, which is expected to make scheduling treatments more efficient. Designed to encourage therapeutic connection and camaraderie, the Infusion Center at TGH Cancer Institute in Brandon is equipped with advanced technology and offers spa-cious semi-private, private, and shared treatment bays, as well as a separate space with beverages and light snacks for patients' family members. At the infusion center, patients can receive treatments ordered by their doctor including chemotherapy , immunotherapy , blood transfusions and more. tural designs will force social generational interaction by creating spaces to engage and empower each other through any variety of collaborative project components. Flexibility in design will be key , since change is constant, and the ability to recon- figure easily for different activities will represent the most successful projects. Technological changes are becoming more user-friendly every day and will bond gen-erations and services together. Telemedicine advancement is just one more example of technology enhancing interactivity and services between people of all ages. As architects, we design spaces for people. Away from generic design, we create buildings that represent best practices along a mix of cultural and individual prefer-ences. We also incorporate elements that engage the senses - such as music, lighting, textured surfaces, and even fragrances from plants or other natural elements. Another global design consideration for all ages is respect - respect for individual- ity , cultures, religions, and preferences. Looking at an assisted living facility designed 20 years ago, versus the ALFs we're designing today , we are adapting spaces and rooms in the facility to have a variety of colors and experiences that coincide with the needs and character of the occupants. Our design responsibilities include under-standing the human condition. It's no more difficult a concept to understand than a group of people ordering dif- ferent meals from a restaurant.

These dedicated profes-sionals often find them-selves navigating a com-plex web of challenges, from managing over-head costs to maintain-ing a strong online pres-ence. Recognizing these needs, Lina has emerged to provide space, com-munity and support for healthcare practi-tioners in private practice so they can focus on what they do best - high quality patient care. A Vision of Support and Empowerment Lina's vision is clear: to support the prac- tice needs of independent health practi-tioners and empower them to thrive in pri-vate practice. Their approach challenges conventional thinking, offering a compre-hensive solution that tackles some of the most pressing challenges faced by health-care professionals. Established in 2017, Lina offers a collab-orative workspace tailored to the needs of medical, mental health, and wellness practitioners. The driving force behind Lina's cre-ation was a deep understanding of the hurdles faced by independ-ent practitioners, coupled with a desire to provide them with a space where they can focus on delivering exceptional care to their patients. Flexible Spaces for Diverse Needs One of Lina's strengths lies in its ability to cater to a diverse array of healthcare specialists. From medical doc-tors to mental health practitioners to well-ness experts, Lina is designed to accom-modate various specialties under one roof. Their private, customizable, and turnkey office suites provide a flexible solution, enabling practitioners to mold their work environment to align with their unique requirements. Additionally , the space encourages a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. When allied health professionals interact regularly , they can easily exchange knowl-edge, discuss cases, and seek advice, ulti-mately leading to improved patient out-comes and the growth of their private practice. This collaborative environment fosters a sense of community among healthcare professionals, which translates to better-coordinated care for patients. With locations currently spanning across New York City and Aventura, Lina's presence is growing. Their innovative approach has resonated with practitioners seeking a space that supports their needs. Reducing Overhead, Enhancing Practice Support The rising costs of establishing and maintaining a private medical practice have become a major obstacle for many healthcare providers. According to Doctorly , consultants estimate that the cost to launch a small primary care prac-tice ranges from $70,000 to more than $100,000. Flexible medical office spaces, such as Lina, offer a viable and cost-effec-tive alternative that benefits practitioners, allowing them to easily launch, expand, and grow their medical practice. One of the most significant advantages Lina brings to its physicians is the substan-tial reduction in overhead costs. Operating a private practice often comes with finan-cial burdens, from leasing office space to managing utilities and administrative sup-port. Lina's membership plans alleviate these pressures, allowing practitioners to focus their resources on patient care rather than logistics. A Future-Focused Approach As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, Lina remains at the forefront of innovation, poised for further expansion and growth. By reimagining the traditional private practice model, Lina is driving pos-itive change, enabling physicians to embrace the future with confidence. In a world where patient-centered care is paramount, Lina's approach aligns seam-lessly . By removing barriers, streamlining operations, and fostering a collaborative environment, Lina empowers healthcare practitioners to practice on their terms. Empowering Independent Healthcare Practitioners in Private Practice BY RACHEL PURI South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com September 2023 19 HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, Baptist Health and the Miami Dolphins Announce the Opening of New Orthopedic Complex Baptist Health is pleased to announce the opening of its new , state-of-the-art orthopedic complex across the street from Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins. Serving Dolph - ins players and the public alike, the new location offers comprehensive or - tho pedic care with a full range of diagnostic imag-ing, physical therapy and rehabilitation services all under one roof. The expansive, 17,000- square-foot facility is located adjacent to the Baptist Health Training Complex, the Dolphins' training facility , with clinical areas overlooking the team's practice field. The new location will provide the public with high-quality orthopedic care, featuring cutting-edge technology and renowned Baptist Health medical experts. \"This new facility serves as a symbol of Baptist Health's dedication to both our commu- nity and our partnership with the Miami Dolphins,\" said Javier Hernandez-Lichtl, CEO of Baptist Health's Doctors Hospital and Baptist Health Orthopedic Institute. \"With its ideal central location, the orthopedic complex will provide even more members of the commu-nity with our trusted care, and we look forward to inviting our patients in.\" The new orthopedic complex commemorates the decades-long relationship between the Miami Dolphins and Baptist Health, which serves as the Official Medical Team and Official Wellness and Sports Medicine Provider for the team. In July 2023, the two entities celebrated the two-year anniversary of the unveiling of the Baptist Health Training Complex where the team, coaching staff and football support staff are headquartered year-round. \"We are excited for the community to 'go where the pros go' and experience the same level of expertise we provide the exceptional athletes of the Miami Dolphins,\" said John Uribe, M.D., orthopedic surgeon and Chief Medical Executive with Baptist Health Orthopedic Care and head team physician of the Miami Dolphins. \"This orthopedic com-plex is the pinnacle of medical expertise, advanced treatment options and expedient care for all patients.\" \"Baptist Health has been an incredible partner for many years, and it's a privilege for us to join them in serving both our community and the players alike by bringing this world-class facility to our backyard,\" said Jeremy Walls, Chief Revenue Officer of the Miami Dolphins and Hard Rock Stadium. \"We're excited that the public will be able to step foot on our campus and experience the same standard of care as our team in this new , innova-tive space.\" Baptist Health is also a proud partner of the Miami Dolphins Foundation, working together on a series of initiatives around the health and safety of South Florida students, coaches and parents to grow youth football participation in the region. Memorial Primary Care to Open Weston Location Expanding on the high-quality , patient-centered health services it provides throughout South Florida, Memorial Healthcare System has opened its 13th primary care office in Weston. Dr. Natalie Jorge-Rodriguez will be the facility's attending physician. She is family practitioner who specializes in caring for adult patients with hyper-tension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity , mental health concerns, and thyroid conditions. She will also provide preventive medicine, including annual physical exams and screenings, for individuals 18 and over. Dr. Natalie Jorge-Rodrigueza 20 September 2023 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsFollowing an April 2023 presidential executive order directing federal agencies to work toward increasing access to high-quality care and caregiver support for both children and older adults in long-term care, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on July 31, 2023, introduced the Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model, a new ini-tiative designed to improve the way care is delivered for people living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia, as well as enable them to stay in their homes and communities longer through a package of care coordination, caregiver education and support, and respite serv-ices. This long-term Federal strategy focus- es on three major challenges: improving care and support for those currently dealing with dementia; advancing research for effective medical treat-ments; and encouraging healthy people to make effective choices to reduce their risk of devel-oping Alzheimer's disease later in life. In addition to finding viable solutions to the day-to-day challenges of living with dementia and pursuing a medical breakthrough, progress is also being made in the often-daunting requirements associated with Medicare and Medicaid billing and payment. The GUIDE Model, which will be test- ed nationwide by requesting organiza-tions on a voluntary basis for eight years beginning July 1, 2024, will provide patients and their caregivers with a care navigator and 24/7 access support line for care coordination and clinical and non-clinical services such as meals and transportation through community-based organizations. GUIDE is also designed to improve access to resources caregivers desperately need, such as respite services, which enable them to take temporary breaks from their caregiving responsibilities\u2014an action proven to prevent or delay the need for their loved ones to enter facili-ty-based care. The GUIDE Model has both bipartisan Congressional support and the enthusiastic endorsement of the Alzheimer's Association, which noted that the program would save the federal government nearly $21 billion over 10 years by simply better coordinating how care is delivered. A devastating Alzheimer's diagnosis is often compounded by the financial impact on those who can least afford it. While some are fortunate enough to have a family member or loved one to provide the needed care, the obligations associat-ed with being a caregiver are unpaid and without respite. In addition to providing 24/7 home care, being a caregiver involves coordinating appointments and fulfilling the often confusing and time-consuming billing requirements. Once fully phased in, the GUIDE pro- gram would cover close to 1.8 million Medicare beneficiaries (about 20 percent of the population with dementia) by the end of the decade. For those living with dementia and suffering from multiple chronic conditions, it is also expected to decrease the fragmented care that can lead to otherwise-unnecessary hospital-izations and emergency department vis-its, as well as improve equitable access to healthcare. . With researchers suggesting that the number of people living with Alzheimer's will likely increase from an estimated 57 million in 2019 to 153 million by 2050, the GUIDE program is a step in the right direction.

This year's theme was \"Recent Advances in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.\" The forum featured presentations and panel discussions with various medical experts including co-host Dr. Ranjan Duara, Director of the Wien Center at Mount Sinai. Presenters focused on the underlying changes in the brain that are caused by Alzheimer's disease, how Lecanemab (latest FDA approved monoclonal anti-body medication) works to remove amy-loid protein (following successful clini-cal trial results), non-pharmacological treatment options, and the potential impact of choosing Lecanemab on patients and their families. At its core, Alzheimer's disease involves the accumulation of brain amy-loid, which can lead to a multitude of pathological changes, including progres-sive deterioration of cognitive and func-tional abilities. With the development of game changing diagnostic tools, researchers and clinicians are now able pinpoint the buildup of amyloid protein through various tests, involving spinal fluid, brain PET scans, and most recently , blood tests. These tests lead to accurate diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, which allow clinicians to monitor the amount of amyloid present in the brain, while determining the effectiveness of certain drugs on the removal process. Tests can also confirm whether brain amyloid may resurface in the future. So far, two drugs \u2014 Aducanumab and Lecanemab have received FDA approval based on their success in removing amy-loid protein. Aducanumab (ADUHELM), which is manufactured by U.S. biotech company , Biogen, is recognized as the first treatment therapy to display the effects of removing beta-amyloid from the brain to delay neurological decline. Through the Clarity AD Clinical Trial, Lecanemab successfully removes amy-loid protein from the brain and does slow down the effects of Alzheimer's on a patient's ability to perform complex day-to-day tasks. However, Lecanemab is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease and does not lead to temporary or permanent improvement in memory or the ability to performing everyday tasks. Currently , Lecanemab is administered in the form of intravenous infusions every four weeks, usually in a hospital-based infusion center, for at least a year to 18 months, along with repeated MRI scans to monitor any serious side effects. Simpler methods of delivering Lecanemab, e.g., via subcutaneous infu-sion are being investigated, although it is challenging to deliver a sufficient and effective dose of the drug with this method. Patients and their families must also weigh the pros and cons of monoclonal antibody treatments (such as Lecanemab) as they can cause adverse effects, including infusion-related reac-tions, ARIA E, and rare brain hemorrhag-es. Also, with regard to retail pricing, treatments can be rather costly , but med-ical coverage is currently under evalua-tion. Lecanemab is likely to benefit patients experiencing mild impairment from the initial stages of Alzheimer's disease and will hopefully receive full FDA approval by the end of 2023 or early 2024. Donanemab, another promising mono- clonal antibody drug (manufactured by U.S. pharmaceutical company , Eli Lilly and Company), is currently in the final stages of clinical trials to treat Alzheimer's. Overall, we cannot wait to see the eventual impact of monoclonal bodies in targeting amyloid protein and treating Alzheimer's disease. Annual Alzheimer's Public Education Forum Focused on New T reatments for Alzheimer's Disease Dr. Ranjan Duara Cover Story: Quality Next-Level Care for Patients With Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Continued from page 1 Reducing Hospital Readmissions and Saving Significant Costs Evidence supports the benefits of hospice for patients with dementia and their caregivers.2 The patient is more likely to die at home and have greater satisfaction with their care. Research indi- cates a 50% reduction in hospitalizations, with better pain and symptom management and fewer care transitions. Studies also show that hospice-enrolled people living with dementia had a higher quality of life compared to those without hospice, and end-of-life transitions were significantly lower. For those in hospice in the last month of life, 68% reported their anx-iety/sadness as managed, and 55% believed they received excel-lent quality of care. 3 At the same time, hospice yields significant savings. A recent NORC at the University of Chicago study found that patients who chose hospice care saved Medicare approximately $3.5 billion in a single year. 4 Further, patients with neurodegenerative disease who had hospice stays of 180 days or greater reduced Medicare costs by 4% compared to non-hospice users. With the rise in Alzheimer's diagnoses, these savings multiply . By 2025, the Alzheimer's Association projects 7.2 million people ages 65 and older will have Alzheimer's disease. 1 Discovering Preferences: Initiating Goals-of-Care Conversations For Alzheimer's and dementia patients, poorly defined goals lead to unwanted treatments, undue suffering, and misuse of resources. While clinicians in busy settings like hospitals have limited time, it's possible to conduct rapid palliative assessments and have efficient goals-of-care conversations when patients are initially diagnosed\u2014while they have decision-making capacity . Involve their family caregivers as well. As the disease progress- es, these caregivers will make the decisions as they seek to fulfill the patient's wishes and values. What Makes a Patient With Alzheimer's/ Dementia Hospice Eligible? Patients become eligible for hospice when they receive a prog- nosis of six months or less to live. Those with Alzheimer's dis-ease who lose the ability to communicate meaningfully , and other dementia patients who become dependent in three of six ADLs (bathing, dressing, continence, transferring, ambulation, feeding), plus have either of the following, may be eligible for hospice: \u0081 A comorbidity resulting in structural/functional impair- ment (e.g., heart disease/advanced lung disease) \u0081 A clinical complication indicating disease progression (e.g., febrile episode, infection requiring antibiotics, pressure ulcers, dehydration, weight loss, eating difficulties, delirium, feeding tube) In these cases, hospice enables patients to remain in the com- fort of their home\u2014while easing the strain on family caregivers.

Accolades Accolades Accolades Accolades Phil Dingle Taylor Baker of the Tampa General Hospital Foundation Honored for Healthcare Philanthropy Leadership Tampa General Hospital (TGH) has announced that Taylor Baker, senior director of development for the Tampa General Hospital Foundation, has been recognized by the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP) as a member of their \"40 Under 40\" class. Baker's recognition by the AHP reflects her leadership in advancing the Tampa General Hospital Heart & Vascular Institute and Women's and Children's Institute through philanthropic outreach and engagement. Baker joined Tampa General in 2019 and has since grown philanthropy for the TGH Heart & Vascular Institute from $50,000 a year to more than $6 million over four years. In her current role as the senior director of Development, Taylor supports the implemen-tation and scaling of novel programs with funds raised through the TGH Foundation, including various centers of excellence within the Heart & Vascular Institute and the Neonatal Exposure program which helps babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, a group of conditions caused when an infant withdraws from certain drugs fol-lowing exposure in the womb before birth. T aylor Baker (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwMVMbmQBug) For those of you older than \"a minute,\" it will be well worth your while to take a second and watch the film clip from the movie Network (1975). The premise of the movie is that a television network cynically exploits a deranged former anchor's ravings and then find themselves unable to control his message (if you have time, a great movie and, even though it was produced in 1975, it is still timely). As I was writing this article, I kept hear-ing the voice of Howard Beale (Peter Finch) exhorting his viewers to scream out their win-dows, \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore.\" As healthcare providers over the last couple of years have dealt with salary inflation, though it still continues to eat into their earnings, they are now shifting gears to focus on managing rapidly escalating drug prices. Those drug prices that are, seemingly , enjoying this inflationary period with drug price increases occurring at dizzying rates. So, how has the United States gotten itself into this mess and what are some of the rea-sons why we seem to be facing higher drug prices than other countries? Putting on my economics hat, prescript ion medications in the United States tend to be more expensive than in other countries for several reasons. First, believe it or not, unlike many other countries, the U.S. does not have direct price controls on prescription medications. Until very recently in the U.S., governments in other countries are negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies to establish prices for their national health systems, or they may regulate the price that can be charged for a drug. In a previous article, I talked about how the U.S. is moving for-ward, albeit slowly , in being able to negotiate Medicare's drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies often argue that the high prices of drugs in the U.S. are necessary to fund expensive research and development (R&D) processes. Why the U.S. has to bear the excess burden of those costs while the pharmaceutical com-panies sell these drugs worldwide is a quandary . While it's true that developing a new drug can cost billions of dollars, it is also worth noting that these same com-panies also spend substantial amounts of money on marketing and administration. The U.S. patent system is also a source of higher prices. The patent system gives market exclusivity preventing competitors from producing generic alternatives for a number of years. This allows the company that developed the drug to set the price without competition. While patents are a global phe- nomenon, the U.S. patent system can sometimes allow for longer periods of monopoly pricing compared to other countries. We also have to understand that drugs pass through many hands. For instance, in the U.S., the system of drug pricing involves multiple intermediaries, such as Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). These entities negotiate drug prices with manufacturers on behalf of insurance companies. While PBMs can secure discounts, they also introduce another layer of complexity and cost into the pricing structure (unsure if there is any value added). I will mention the high cost of litigation in the U.S. and the attempt to recoup legal costs and potential liabilities with no further dis-cussion. Consumers are also not without guilt in this pricing cycle. The American con- sumer often demands and expects to receive the newest treatments, which may not always be the most cost-effective. This can drive up demand for higher-priced drugs even when cheaper alternatives are available. (Caduet that includes amlodip-ine and atorvastatin ($500/$250 generic) when you can get the generic equivalents of the two drugs for about $6.00 and $12.00, respectively). The government is also not without blame. The process of getting a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is rigorous, which can add to the cost of drug development. While rigorous approval processes exist in other countries too, the specific requirements and length of the process in the U.S. impacts pricing. And, we have to look at the cost to administer the U.S.'s healthcare system. Because of our system's fragmentation, we have many players, private insurers and various plans, attempting to negotiate the best results for their companies instead of streamlining the process to reduce some of the administrative burden making the negotiated results available for all. This complexity can add to the cost of drugs. It all adds up to a lot of finger pointing! The answer/solution/change of paradigm might require that all the parties sit down and draft a solution that \"splits the baby .\" A solution that disadvantages all the parties yet preserves the system. Maybe a larg-er role for government to fund R&D and retaining all or some property rights over the drugs/devices that find themselves to market. There are many options to be considered. What I know is that none of the players want to start hearing, \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore.\" For it is at this point that congressmen and legislators become experts and start developing healthcare policy that has political facing but fails to reach the goal of mutual reasonableness.

What's New...What's UHealth Launches Convenient 'One-Stop' Women's Health and Wellness Program South Florida women can benefit from a new \"one-stop\" Comprehensive Women's Health Alliance offered by UHealth - University of Miami Health System, the first such fully coordinated program in the region. What makes UHealth's Comprehensive Health Alliance unique in South Florida is its convenient, integrated approach with nurse coordinators who will help women assess their needs and coordinate care with UHealth's high-quality physician providers based on the patient's multiple medical needs. Many women who are juggling personal, family and career commitments find it diffi-cult to take time for their own health care, said program director Morgan Allyn Sendzischew Shane, M.D., MSCTI, assistant professor of gastroenterology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. \"It is so important for women to be able to connect with physicians, therapists and other specialists in a streamlined and efficient manner,\" Dr. Shane said. \"That's why coor-dinated care through our program can make a huge difference in the lives of young, mid-dle-age and older women.\" \"This is a tremendous benefit for women who are balancing daily responsibilities,\" added Laura Martin, D.O., a gynecologist with a subspecialty in urogynecology and co-director of the new program. \"Rather than spending hours online or on the phone mak-ing appointments with multiple physicians, our nurse coordinator helps busy women access preventive screenings, diagnostic assessments and referrals to specialists who understand women's special health issues.\" With UHealth's Comprehensive Women's Health Alliance, South Florida women can fill out an online questionnaire about their health issues and concerns, and then connect with a nurse navigator for a personal conversation. \"This will be very helpful for women, particularly those with multiple health issues,\" said Dr. Martin, whose urogynecology practice focuses on female pelvic medicine, includ-ing surgical treatments for urinary incontinence, fistulas, vaginal prolapse and other pelvic floor disorders. Along with access to gynecology and urogynecology services, the Comprehensive Women's Health Alliance will include gastroenterology , breast health, bone health, behav-ioral health, dermatology care and nutrition services. The program's nurse navigators will expedite referrals to other UHealth specialists as needed.

With its potential to improve diagnostic yields and reduce the need for more invasive inter-ventions, the Ion Robotic Bronchoscopy Program can have a significant impact on the lives of patients suffering from lung disea ses. New Equipment to Benefit Children with Epilepsy and Other Conditions at Nicklaus Children's Hospital Nicklaus Children's Hospital recently unveiled a new high-density electroencephalo- gram (HD EEG) system and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) machine, becom-ing one of the first in the nation to offer this equipment for the care of pediatric patients. The equipment was made possible thanks to State Senator Ileana Garcia and House Health Care Appropriations Chairman Bryan Avila who championed $500,000 of state funding to support the care of children with neurological disorders, including epilepsy . The HD EEG supports precise and accurate localization of seizure activity in a child's brain, while the TMS is a noninvasive te chnolog- ical breakthrough that involves applying a series of short magnetic pulses to stimulate nerve cells in areas of brain to treat an array of neurological disorders, including anxiety and depression. St. Mary's Medical Center First Hospital in Florida to Adopt Portable MRI T echnology St. Mary's Medical Center is the first hospital in Florida to acquire the Swoop\u00ae Portable MRI unit, capable of providing critical brain images at the patient's bed-side, to help doctors diagnose and treat patients. The unit will also serve Palm Beach Children's Hospital patients. This device is ideal to treat young patients, who might be intimidated by the con- ventional MRI system, which is louder and bigger than the portable MRI. It has the ability to perform a shorter scan with a family member in the room to hold their hand if they are not able to remain in one place long enough to obtain clear images. It can also help if a patient is too ill to travel to the MRI suite. With the Swoop sys-tem, brain imaging occurs at the patient's bedside, where the patient is overseen by the primary care team, without traveling out of the care environment. Bedside imaging with the Swoop system means most patient support equipment can remain in place.

I myself have fasted thousands of people over the past 45 years for a wide variety of health con-cerns, and there is an extensive body of evidence supporting the use of water-only fasting in a wide range of health problems, including obesity . The loss of appetite and fasting are natural to all animals, including humans, in response to disease and stress. If you observe animals in the wild or even your own house pets, you will notice that when they are injured or diseased they will often retire to a quiet and comfortable place, stop the intake of all food and continue drinking water only . When less energy is required for eating, digesting and procuring food, more energy is available for healing and repair. When you stop eating, blood sugar levels begin to drop, and the body is forced to satisfy its blood sugar and energy needs with protein in our mus-cles and fat in our fat cells. There is more protein metabolism and lean muscle breakdown in the first few days of fasting, but within a few days, protein loss begins to slow down as the body shifts to fat metabolism. The ketones produced by fat metabolism in the fast are used directly by the brain as primary source of energy during extensive periods of fasting. The loss of protein and the depletion of blood sugar is more comfortably regulated by ensuring that the fasting person maintains maximum rest. In fact, it is important to see fasting as a deep physiological resting process. In fasting, the body shifts from a typical phase of growth to a phase of energy con- servation maintenance and repair. As evidence of this, the insulin-like growth factor (ILG-F), which is abnormally increased by eating refined foods and animal products and can promote cancer and tumor growth in adults, is reduced during fasting. Not only is fat an available energy reserve in the body , but it also serves as vehicle for the storage of waste and toxic fat-soluble chemicals that we are routinely exposed to. Many of the environmental toxins, and even internal toxic waste products, are typ-ically dissolved in our fat cells. So not only do fat cells of the body provide a primary source of energy , but they also work like a garbage dump, hiding and storing our toxic load. The energy that is harbored in the fasting process can enhance the mobilization of waste stored in body fat and remove this waste through organs and tissues of elimi-nation like the skin and lungs in a process of detoxification. In fasting, the body demonstrates an intelligent control over the processes of detoxification and elimina-tion. So that the body will utilize what it needs least to provide sup- port for organs it needs most and through autophagy , a process of self- digestion and housecleaning that is increased in fasting, it can dis- solve tumors or cysts and support the vital organs of the body . What makes fasting even more beneficial is that while many patho- logical conditions are improved, there is also significant fat and weight loss, as much as one to two pounds a day . I have had people lose 20 pounds in two weeks of fasting, and as much as 30 pounds or more in a month. Fasting is not a mystical process. Although it has been used by a variety of spiritual traditions as a tool for introspective evaluation and spiritual growth, fasting is truly just a simple process of deep physio- logical rest. The goal is to harbor as much energy as possible for the healing work at hand. That means rest on every level, including all the senses. The more time spent being quiet, serene and introspective, the better. For this reason, fasting is also a profound tool for creating a more mindful, self-aware life, and resolving compulsive addictive behavior. Fasting promotes fat breakdown, weight loss, detoxification and repair like nothing else, and is one of the most powerful approaches for resolving inflammation and the complications of autoimmune disease. The body-mind changes evoked by the fasting process make it one of the most efficient and powerful tools to jumpstart any new health program in general, and a significant and successful long-term weight loss pro-gram in particular.
