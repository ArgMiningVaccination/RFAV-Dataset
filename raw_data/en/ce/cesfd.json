Special 30 page Report compiled by Dr. Heather Rice WHO IS DR. HEATHER RICE? Dr. Rice has over 25+ years of experience in the Chiropractic profession. Her connection with Chiropractic started at a young age as both of her parents are Chiropractors. She has a memory of her father adjusting her when she was 13 years old. Dr. Rice remembers because she had strep throat and each adjustment made her feel better. That is when the seed was planted - she too wanted to help people feel better. Two of Dr. Rice's brothers and she went to school to be Chiropractors. She graduated 4th in her class from Palmer College of Chiropractic in 1983 and since then she has become one of the few doctors in Vermont to achieve the highest level of certification in Network Spinal Analysis (NSA). NSA is known for its gentle adjustments and profound changes in the quality of life. Dr. Rice is also certified as a FLOWTRITION practitioner and can also teach this approach. Dr. Rice has traveled the world (especially China & South Korea) practicing Chiropractic but Vermont is her home. Dr. Rice's practice focuses on family wellness care for infants, children, and adults and she is devoted to improving her community. Dr. Rice does this by educating the public in healthier ways to live. Dr. Rice often packs up and travels to offices and schools within the Burlington area to give free lectures or seminars. In addition to being a Chiropractor, Dr. Rice is also trained in Somato Respiratory Integration (SRI) from the Twelve Stages of Healing work, and she has been a staff trainer for the Firewalking Institute of Research and Education. Dr. Rice is proficient in French & Chinese and she loves playing the violin. WHY IS THIS SPECIAL REPORT SO IMPORTANT? Dr. Rice has been studying the subject of vaccines for 30 years. She is not an immunologist. She is a mother, who wants the best for her child, a chiropractor, who wants the best for her practice members, and an individual who wants the best for her own health. Her awareness of the importance of understanding the truth about vaccines started in chiropractic school in a toxicology class. Since then she has spent hours reading extensively, taking trainings, attending conferences and searching the internet. Much of the information below and in the special report comes from Dr. Ted Koren, Dr. Joseph Mercola, Barbara Loe Fisher, Dr. Gary Null, Dr. Russell Blaylock and the extensive research they have done. One of the most important health decisions facing parents today is whether or not to have their child vaccinated. This decision should be based on facts rather than coercion or pressure. Parents want what's best for their children Some parents may think vaccinating their child is best for them; others are questioning this. No matter what decision a parent makes for their child, true informed consent should be part of that decision. Informed consent to parents should include the controversies that are going on inside medical journals and amongst immunologists. More and more parents are refusing to vaccinate their children. They do so for a number of reasons. Some of the most common are.... that they consider the vaccines more dangerous than the disease. In fact, there are hundreds of studies and many books documenting dozens of chronic immunological and neurological conditions children have gotten from shots. It may surprise you that most pediatricians and parents are completely unaware of this. Another reason is that they prefer natural rather than artificial immunity. Natural immunity lasts a lifetime. Artificial immunity - vaccination - does not. They have a vaccine-injured child (this is, sadly a growing number, far larger than most people realize.) Or some other health reason why their child should not be vaccinated. And some have religious or philosophical objections to vaccination. USA Today. Oct. 30, 2000: \"Roughly one fourth of American parents have serious concerns over the safety of vaccinations their children receive.\" The special report that Dr. Heather Rice has written is something that all families need to read so that you can learn the TRUTH about vaccines. Your children's life is obviously of the utmost importance it is crucial to become aware of the alternatives.
