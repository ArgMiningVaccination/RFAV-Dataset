When someone is suffering from multiple chronic conditions, it is a sign their body might be not but functioning as it should be. Functional nutrition goes beyond basic nutrition and promotes foods that both provide the everyday fuel our bodies need and also help reduce the risk of certain chronic conditions. It aims to return the body to a high-functioning state by addressing the root cause of certain health problems, and can help provide relief through dietary and lifestyle changes for those suffering from fatigue, digestive discomfort and other common chronic symptoms. \"Functional nutrition is rapidly growing in popularity among registered dietitians, and it provides another opportunity to help patients improve their health and wellness through nutrition,\" Rowe Hudson, Director of Lee Health Solutions, said. \"Simple lifestyle changes can make a drastic improvement in the way someone feels throughout the day, and we are here to help people live their lives to the fullest.\" Functional nutrition is a retail service that will be offered at Lee Health Coconut Point beginning in August. The program starts with a 90-minute consultation with Julie Hill, RD, who is a certified practitioner of functional nutrition through the Institute for Functional Medicine. A thorough review of the patient's health history will take place to create an action plan aimed at improving symptoms through dietary and lifestyle changes. If necessary, patients will also participate in lab testing and be given supplement recommendations to create the most comprehensive plan for them. Patients will be scheduled for follow-up visits, as needed, to monitor the progress and make adjustments to their plans when necessary. For more information and to schedule an appointment, call Lee Health Solutions at 239-468-0051.
