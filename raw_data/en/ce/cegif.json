As the premier scientific research institute in the nation's fastest-growing research university, Biodesign's impact is accelerating. These are just a handful of ways our research is answering today's challenges. $2.9 billion By 2023, Biodesign's estimated annual impact on Arizona's economy will reach $2.9 billion. $760 million Biodesign has attracted over $760 million in funding from grants as well as philanthropic and industry sources. 200+ projects Scientists at Biodesign are undertaking research in over 200 active research projects. ASU compact X-ray free electron laser The compact X-ray free electron laser (CXFEL) is the first compact instrument of its kind in the world. It will provide short X-ray pulses that allow scientists to explore the structure and dynamics of nature and materials as never before. Movies of biomolecules in action, fine-resolution biomedical imaging and discoveries in quantum science will all be made possible through the ASU CXFEL. Spotlight: Infectious disease New study explores role of key protein in regulating infection by salmonella Infectious diseases continue to ravage human society and remain a leading cause of illness and death worldwide. Improving therapies to treat these afflictions will require a better understanding of the intricate dance between infectious pathogens and the human cells they infect. ASU Researchers solve a Lyme disease mystery Researchers from the Biodesign Center for Applied Structural Discovery advance the race for new therapeutics. ASU teams up with Phoenix Children's and Valleywise Health to study vaccine effectiveness vs. influenza, COVID-19 Project builds on the ongoing, year-to-year efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate how well influenza vaccines perform across populations and under a range of conditions.
