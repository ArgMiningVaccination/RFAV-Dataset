This article should cover everything we know at present that's important concisely. One of the [primary](https://www.muhealth.org/our-stories/how-do-we-know-covid-19-vaccine-wont-have-long-term-side-effects) [drivers](https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/20/are-you-still-hesitant-about-having-a-covid-vaccine-we-put-your-concerns-to-the-experts) of [hesitancy about](https://coronavirus.medium.com/vaccine-hesitancy-makes-sense-9a74e3a5eca7) the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna is that it's a new technology with no long-term safety data. Whereas [traditional](https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html) [vaccine technology](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/vaccine-types) \u2014 such as inactivated, protein-based, and live-attenuated vaccines \u2014 has been used to combat infectious diseases for decades. So, we are relatively more comfortable and less worried about the safety of traditional than modern vaccine technology. We shouldn't be surprised, though. After all, risk-aversion is [a universal trait](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep08242#:~:text=Risk%20aversion%20is%20a%20common%20behavior%20universal%20to%20humans%20and%20animals%20alike.) in humans and animals, built from eons of evolution. But should we really be that uncertain about mRNA vaccines? How mRNA vaccines work in brief The central dogma of molecular biology [states that](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/translation-dna-to-mrna-to-protein-393/) DNA makes messenger RNA (mRNA) via transcription, and mRNA makes proteins via translation. [The mRNA vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000814/) delivers the protein-coding mRNA inside the cell, capitalizing on the cell's machinery to translate the mRNA into the desired protein. But mRNA is incredibly fragile and easily degradable. So, mRNA vaccines are encased within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to promote enough stability until the mRNA gets inside the cells. For the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, the mRNA stores genetic codes for the modified spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes Covid-19). The cells (typically muscle cells [at the injection site](/microbial-instincts/biodistribution-and-spike-protein-safety-of-mrna-vaccines-an-update-788fe58e39b9?sk=5761d42353e9ccf9763b77c66c952692)) that receive the mRNA vaccine are instructed to make the modified spike proteins, which help the immune system build immunity. The immune system will then mount a more robust and efficient immune response the next time it encounters those spike proteins, such as during the actual virus infection. What could go wrong in the long term? 1. The mRNA The mRNA supply is limited, and the cells will stop making spike proteins once the mRNA supply runs out.
