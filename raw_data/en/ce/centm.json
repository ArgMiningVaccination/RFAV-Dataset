Who would've thought three little words could become such a call to action? Those three little words have taken many forms over the past decade, but the basic concept remains the cornerstone of most environmental strategies. Reduce, reuse, and recycle is a staple in environmental education, reaching to even the youngest. You find these three R words at community Earth Days, on T-shirts, at school programs, on posters, inenvironmental campaigns, and increasingly in all sortsof businesses including chiropractic \u2014 all in an effort toreduce the carbon footprint on the world. But those are not the only R words that deal with the going green movement. How about rethink? Rethinking the way you do something not only can be beneficial to your life and tothe future, it also can be beneficial to your practice. In our feature story on page 44, we talk to DCs who run sustainable practices andan architect who designs environmentally friendly spaces, including analternative sports medicine chiropractic center in New York. They share waysthat you, too, can run a green practice, and how it's easier than you think tobe green. Gerry Clum, DC, president of Life Chiropractic College West, offers his suggestions on how to rethink the way you run your practice. He gives hisperspective on going green in the chiropractic profession and poses thequestion, \"... who has a stronger track record, is more conceptually aligned ingeneral, and better suited than the chiropractor to step forward and bring thispotential to the public?\" Read his perspective on page 53. Replace. There's another R word. While it may not usually appear in environmental slogans or campaigns, replacement can be very effective inmaking your practice greener. Replace old appliances with Energy Starappliances, replace old computers with ones that are more energy efficient, andreplace paper files with electronic systems. You also can replace old techniques and old communication styles when it comes to dealing with patients (page 32 and page 36), replace old ways ofthinking when it comes to a multidisciplinary practice (page 19), and replaceold ideas of what a pain management practice consists of (page 24). Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Rethink. Replace. By implementing these R words in your practice, you can be on your way to being green in more ways thanone. Then you can rejoice...yet another R word!

Through its new authority under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), the agency also determined that it is necessary for manufacturers ofthe drugs to provide a Medication Guide to patients about possible side effects. The FDA has notified the manufacturers of these drugs that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to ensure that thebenefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The Medication Guide will beconsidered an element of the REMS. The new Boxed Warning andMedication Guide would strengthen warning information already included inproduct labeling for the fluoroquinolone class of systemic antimicrobial drugs. Fluoroquinolone manufacturers are required to submit the safety labeling changes, including the strengthened warnings and the Medication Guide, tothe FDA within 30 days, or provide a reason why they do not believe suchlabeling changes are necessary.

Clemens, 40, received her private animal massage certification two years ago and started practicing on horses \u2014 eventually growing her business toabout 30 regular horse clients \u2014 but closed her equine massage practice in aWashington, D.C., suburb after state officials told her state law only allowsveterinarians to perform such services. She's also suing the Maryland State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, saying regulators from both agencies are unfairly barring registered massagetherapists who want to practice on animals. In a March letter to Clemens, the MBCMTE told her state law is very specific in barring massage therapists from practicing on animals. Thechiropractic board also included a note from Maryland's state veterinary boardreminding chiropractors and massage therapists of the restrictions. The MBCMTE agency is asking for the court to dismiss the case, citing Montgomery County as an improper venue because the order was issued from Baltimore.

Among the fraud cases detailed for the survey, the median loss suffered by organizations with fewer than 100employees was $200,000 \u2014 more than the median loss forany other category. The results of the survey were published in the 2008 Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud & Abuse.The ACFE's benchmarking data is compiled from 959 casesof occupational fraud that were investigated by CertifiedFraud Examiners between January 2006 and February 2008. The study also found that check tampering and fraudulent billing were the most common of all smallbusiness fraud schemes. In fact, more than one-fourth ofall small business frauds in the survey involved checktampering, making it a much more common method offraud than in larger organizations.

More and more chiropractors are undertaking the conversion of their chiropractic practice into a multidisci- plinary practice without the legal and managerial assistanceof professionals experienced in this highly regulated area. In a Chiropractic Economics survey, 28.7 percent of chiropractors responded they currently practice in amultidisciplinary setting, but only 24.7 percent of thosewho practice in a multidisciplinary setting responded theywork with a practice-management/consulting group. If thisis you, you are winging it. In a traditional chiropractic practice, the necessity of keeping up with ever-evolving rules and regulations ismore important than ever. A multidisciplinary practicebrings its own unique, and at times complex, set of rulesand regulations, and failure to comply can bringunforgiving penalties. For the unwary practitioner, the result of winging it canbe disastrous from both a financial and legal perspective.The lack of proper guidance often results in impropercorporate structure, unmet professional staffingrequirements, and scrambled accounting and billingpractices. Noncompliant documentation of the servicesrendered places licensed and unlicensed staff members(including CAs and associate DCs) at jeopardy for post-payment audits by third-party payors and complianceaudits by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) andother federal and state regulatory agencies. Chiropractors had five common responses when asked what multidisciplinary practice concerns they had. Areview of these responses should provide you with insightinto some of the reasons why winging it is not an option. I don't know the legal requirements. Multidisciplinary practice brings federal and state-specificlegal requirements. In some states, a multidisciplinarypractice requires a complex corporate structure composedof three to four unique corporate entities, while otherstates permit a single corporate entity that varies onlyslightly from that of a solo chiropractic practice. For thisreason, it is essential to work with a healthcare attorneywell versed in the legal requirements for multidisciplinaryTHE MULTIDISCIPLINARY PRACTICE Are you winging VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT practice in your state. I don't know the staffing requirements. The professionals most frequently associated with chiropractors in a multidisciplinary setting are massage therapists (21.3percent), MDs (12.3 percent), physical therapists (PT)(11.2 percent), and acupuncturists (9.0 percent). The Chiropractic, Medical, and Physical Therapy Practices Acts are state-specific and regulate the scope ofpractice of each of its respective professions. In addition,the Stark Laws mandate federal staffing and referralrequirements. In some states it is actually illegal for a chiropractor to employ an MD or PT. In others, you can hire professionalstaff with the same ease as lay staff members. Anexperienced consultant should be able to clarify thespecific staffing requirements for your state. I don't know the coding rules. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates thecoding rules for both chiropractic and multidisciplinarypractices, and therefore leave no room for creativity orpractice-specific interpretation. CMS oversight provides the benefit of being able to view these regulations in black and white, with no shadesof gray. While CPT coding is an ever-changing process, itis completely clear in the Official ACA Policy Statementon Multidisciplinary Practice that only those servicesprovided by a chiropractor may be billed under theprovider number of a chiropractor. Likewise, those services provided by other professional staff members (MD and PT) must specifically identify theprovider of those services both on CMS-1500 insuranceclaim forms and in written documentation.The official word In 2005, the ACA Fraud Sub-Committee, under the Insurance and Managed Care Committee, developed an Official ACA Policy Statement onMultidisciplinary Practice. The committee includeddoctors in private practice from across the country,chiropractic leadership, insurance industryrepresentatives, and legal counsel. The result was a document that, for the first time, provided a clear-cut blueprint for what is andisn't acceptable in a multidisciplinary setting. Thisdocument should be part of the compliance manualof every multidisciplinary practice. See a copy of the Official ACA Policy Statement on Multidisciplinary Practice VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT I don't know the costs. Without proper management, the increased overhead associated withadditional professional staff memberscan become a drain on your bottomline and tax your ability to produce areturn on your investment. In the area of financial management, it is essential to seekprofessional advice. Before consideringa multidisciplinary practice, aconsultant should help you perform acareful analysis of your patient flowand demographics, the healthcareneeds of your community, and theavailability of professional staff forhiring \u2014 all in the context of yourcurrent financial circumstances. You should not undertake a multidisciplinary practice withoutsufficient capital to see your practicethrough startup and into the growthand development phase. I don't know the marketing. Approximately 10 percent of thegeneral public seeks chiropractic care,and that statistic has remainedunchanged for decades. The fear factorassociated with a chiropractic visit bymany nonpatients virtually evaporateswhen an MD or PT joins your staff. The number of individuals willing to consider chiropractic, or refer afriend or family member to you as analternative to traditional medicalcare, increases tenfold. In addition, itis common practice for MDs to referpatients to other healthcare profes-sionals; unfortunately, chiropractorsare typically not in that circle ofreferrals. The conditions that respond best to chiropractic care are those sameconditions that most frustrate tradi-tional MDs. In the absence of an acutehealthcare crisis, many MDs are at aloss as to how to care for conditionsthat have been proven, throughdocumented research, to respondexcellently to chiropractic care. Conversion to a multidisciplinary structure places your practice in thecenter of the circle of referrals fromthe medical community. The rightconsultant should help you maximizethe unique marketing opportunitiesof your multidisciplinary practice. The benefits of providing care in a well thought out, correctlystructured, multidisciplinary settingare many. The efficiencies ofproviding multiple healthcareservices in one location result in animproved coordination ofprofessional communication, higher-quality care at a lower cost, andgreater convenience to your patients. Investing in the best legal and consulting advice is like buying aninsurance policy for the success ofyour practice. Don't wing it.

Typically, a multidisciplinary pain treatment practice combines the services of a DC and an MD, but you can add medical pain management services to your practicewithout hiring an MD. How? Obtain licensure as a naturopathic medical doctor (NMD) and use it as an addition to yourchiropractic pain treatment procedures. Provided you are in one of the 14 states where NMDs can become licensed, obtaining the NMD degree is oneoption for you. With this licensure comes a scope ofpractice similar to that of an MD \u2014 you can add theservices to your practice to complement and enhance theservices you already provide. What follows are just a few of the services that can increase your practice and allow you to help more people,once you've become a licensed NMD. PROLOTHERAPY According to www.prolotherapy.com, the term prolotherapy comes from the word \"prolo,\" which is shortfor proliferation, because the treatment causes theproliferation of new ligament/tendon tissue in areas whereit has become weak. The site says ligaments are the structural \"rubber bands\" that hold bones to bones in joints and thatligaments can become weak or injured and may not healback to their original strength or endurance. In the samemanner tendons may also become injured and cause pain. Prolotherapy requires an injection of a nonpharmaceutical mixture of dextrose, lidocaine, andsarapin into ligament and tendons in the body where itattaches to the bone in order to strengthen the alreadyweak regions. This causes a localized reaction that stimulates the tissue to repair itself. The majority of patients treated withprolotherapy respond within four to six treatments,depending on the health and vitality of the patient. NEURAL THERAPY Neural therapy is a conservative, nonsurgical procedure that treats chronic neck and low back pain, according towww.drmarkstrom.com. For many patients, these episodes resolve in a few weeks. However, in some cases, these short-term episodes turn intochronic, recurring pain, thought to be caused by increasedsensitization of the nerve cells that transmit pain signals. As the site explains, the result is many of these patients progress to a persistent pain pattern that can last for manyyears. Treatment options usually consist of strong painmedications, invasive spinal procedures, and surgery. Neural therapy, however, uses innovative injectionTHE DC/NMD PAIN MANAGEMENT PRACTICE A new business model By Steven Paul Brown, DCCHEC14p24.ps 8/18/08 7:07 VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT techniques in which FDA-approved medications are delivered directly tothe deep tissues near the spine inorder to reach the nerve pathwaysthat transmit pain. TRIGGER POINT INJECTIONS Trigger point injections consist of injecting a local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory medication into alocalized area of muscle spasm andpain, which aids in breaking thespasm and pain cycle. The procedure usually involves little discomfort and can be repeatedon an occasional basis. Most triggerpoints are improved within two tothree injections, and best results areobtained by using some form ofmuscle therapy and strength training. PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS If you are tired of MDs over- and under-prescribing, or prescribing thewrong medications for your patients,licensure as an NMD will allow youto write the prescriptions yourself,eliminating the middleman. INSURANCE COVERAGE Although NMDs are licensed in many states, their services may ormay not be covered by insurance(naturopathic medical services arenot covered under Medicare) \u2014 butpatients will pay cash for effectiveservices, regardless of insurancecoverage. However, prescriptions written by an NMD with a valid DEA numberarecovered by a patient's prescription coverage, regardless of whether or notthe patient has insurance coverage fornaturopathic medical services. NMD DEGREE AND LICENSURE There are six accredited naturopathic medical schools in North America. Although curriculais four years, DCs can qualify foradmission with advanced standingstatus. The basic science courses, physical medicine courses, and part one of thenational boards will be accepted astransfer credits, which shortens thecurriculum to about two and a halfyears if attending full time. Just as inchiropractic, there are state andnational board examinations forlicensure. An NMD license allows you to add services to your practice thatcomplements and enhances theservices you already provide andmakes you and your office a veryunique and valuable healthcareresource. Mark H. Strom, NMD, of the Arizona Pain Clinic in Scottsdale,Ariz., says \"With physical therapistsgoing to the doctor of physical therapy(DPT) degree and adding orthopedicjoint manipulation to their scope ofpractice, DCs need an expanded scopeof practice to remain competitive inthe pain management field.\" Obviously, this type of practice isn't for everyone. If you have thetime, money, and enthusiasm toincrease your education and scope ofpractice, you could be a new type ofdoctor who offers a wider variety ofservices to the public \u2014 making it awin-win situation for you and yourpatients.

It happens when you attempt to do the right thing for patients with no insurance or limited benefits by \"tweaking\" your documentation and coding to result in anoverall lesser charge for the patient. For example: A patient comes to see you and requires more than a routine workup. Since this patient has noinsurance coverage, you decide to use a lower level examcode, perhaps a 99201 for the initial examination insteadof a 99202 or higher. How about a patient you treated in four spinal regions, but only documented one or two levels and charged for a98940? What about a Medicare patient that required adetailed workup including x-rays and you charged a lowerlevel exam code and a two-view x-ray series when youactually performed four, all because Medicare doesn'tcover exams or x-rays? No big deal, right? Wrong! DOCUMENTATION FAUX PAS Down coding your services in an attempt to strike a balance between what insurance coverage may allow andwhat you feel your cash or underinsured patients canafford are actually documentation faux pas. If you don't report what you did and don't charge for services you would normally bill to insurance because youare seeing a cash or underinsured patient, that creates thepotential for fraud because of a dual standard of care and apotential dual fee schedule. Even worse, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and United States Department of Health and Human Services(HHS) considers down coding or failure to bill a Medicarepatient's accurate services an inducement and is subject toserious fines and penalties. Because you must document what is done and bill for all the services provided in order to stay profitable and inpractice, you're often out of compliance when tryingsimply to do the right thing. Be sure to document whatyou do, everything you do, and then code and bill itproperly. Ultimately, down coding and under-documenting is perceived as illegal and inappropriate, just as up coding iswhen it is used to allow you to bill differently based onwhether you have an insured or cash patient. Documentation of necessity means just that. Don't let your perceived need to maximize reimbursements bybilling your UCR fees or contract rates to insurancecompanies, but not to cash or underinsured patients.Don't presume the correct way to make this right is todownplay your service by altering your documentation.There is never a good excuse to document anything butthe truth. WHAT YOU CAN DO So how can you document, bill, and code properly for maximum reimbursement when there is insuranceavailable and still be able to help cash patients? Join acash discount program and encourage your patients to dothe same. It is one of the most logical, legal, and ethical ways to allow you to accept a lower fee than your normal clinicfees. It allows you to have a contracted fee schedule foryour cash and underinsured patients, just like your othermanaged care networks. The contract model is not new and is what allows you to contract with multiple insurance companies fordifferent rates for the same codes without it being a \"dualfee schedule.\" Cash discount plans simply provide the protection of a contract and allow you to document, code, and billDoing the right thing the wrong way can cost you By Kathy Mills Chang Be sure to document what you do, everything you do, and then code and bill it properly.CHEC14p28.ps 8/18/08 7:10 VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT properly, and still pass on some savings to your cash andunderinsured patients.

Do you have dual fee schedules by having one set of fees for personal injury, out-of-network insurance, andanother for cash patients? CIRCLE VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT TEAM TIPS Ever hear the phrase, \"It's not what you say, but how you sayit\"? This is especially true in how you talk to and present things to patients, and it is extremely important for good communication. Ensuring your patients hear you correctly helps you communicate the appropriate message because your wordchoice sends a message by itself. Choose your words carefully, and remember, you want every patient to have a good experience during theappointment. TURN A PHRASE Avoid words with negative implications, such as \"never,\" \"no,\" or \"that's impossible.\" Instead, turn yourwords into a positive message, \"I'm sure we can find a way,let me see how I can help you.\" Instead of using such phrases as \"squeeze in\" or \"fit in\"\u2014 which may imply to patients they won't get the bestpossible service \u2014 have your scheduling person say, \"Letme find a time when the doctor can spend time with you.\"Keep in mind that when patients ask your office tosqueeze them in, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be aquick appointment. You may also shortchange the patient and stress your staff when someone squeezes into a time slot. Another negative implication is to say, \"We're too busy.\" You would never want the patient to think you'retoo busy to see them. This could also wreak havoc withpatient referrals. If you're too busy to see a patient, why would they want to refer someone else? Put a positive spin on it and say,\"We have a lot of patients scheduled today, but we havean appointment available at 2:00 p.m.\" LEAD THE WAY The person scheduling the appointments must be assertive and able to lead patients toward appointmentswhere they will get the best possible experience. If aCommunicate the correct message By Susan Hoy HANDLING VACATIONS The schedule always gets busy a few days before and after you take a vacation, so plan ahead. Haveyour CA lead regular and wellness patients away frombusy days by saying, \"Dr. Smith will be on vacationthat week, so, since you're on a regular schedule let'sschedule your appointment during the less busydays.\" Or \"Dr. Smith will just be returning that week,so let's schedule your appointment for the week afterthat.\" Try to keep those immediate appointments foracute patients who must see you. LIMIT CHOICESWhen it comes to scheduling, too many choices lead to inefficiency. For best results, give only two choicesto the patient: \"Would you prefer morning? OK, themorning appointments available are 9:15 a.m. or 10:45a.m. Which would you prefer?\" Be sure to leadpatients to an area that serves them and your staff.For example: Your daily cluster-booking slot is 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. You want to book the three 9:00a.m. appointments before booking any 9:15 a.m.appointments, and fill in appointments from early toafternoon and late to afternoon. Your goal is to haveavailable spots in the middle of that cluster for catch-up purposes. NEW PATIENTSSet aside time in your schedule for new patients. Since most patients are not used to getting anappointment the same day, have your CA say, \"Wealways put special time aside for new patientsbecause we know that when you call you need to beseen as soon as possible. The times we have availabletoday are 10:15 a.m. or 3:15 p.m. Which would youprefer?\" Now you have impressed your new patientwith your patient-services techniques, and led themto nonbusy VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT patient requests an appointment at 11:00 a.m. and that isn't the besttime for her to get the best results,lead her to a more optimum time.\"Mary, I don't have 11:00 a.m.available, but I do have 10:45 a.m. or11:15 a.m. Which would you prefer?\" Also, never indicate you overbooked your schedule by tellingpatients, \"We already have too manypatients at that time.\" Have yourCA flip it to show the patient howvaluable you think they are bysaying, \"The best time for you to seethe doctor today would be at 2:00p.m. or 2:45 p.m.\" Another phrase for your CA to avoid would be, \"I'll schedule you at11:30 a.m., but be prepared to wait along time.\" No patient wants towait, so have your CA lead themwhere you want them with thepromise of little waiting time, but trynot to use the word \"wait.\" Have theCA say, \"We will do our best to getyou in to see the doctor as quickly aspossible. We have time set aside foremergency appointments, so if youare in pain, please come at the end ofthe day and the doctor will take careof you.\" LOOSE LIPS Your CA should avoid revealing too much information, such as \"Thedoctor is off today.\" You don't wanther to imply you are off playing golfor fishing, even if you are. It's betterto have her say, \"The doctor is out ofthe office on Thursday,\" or \"Thedoctor doesn't schedule patients onThursday.\" When a patient notices you're busy and asks how many patients yousee in a day, don't tell them, \"Weusually see 50 patients a day.\" Thepatient may multiply that number byyour office visit fee and decide youmake too much money. Do say, \"Weare able to help a lot of people, isn'tthat great?\" Note: If you have a busy practice and use a sign-in sheet,change it often. It's best to have only12 to 15 patients per page so thepatient can't count the names. Choosing your words wisely helps ensure your patients hear youcorrectly, saving you time and hasslelater, and guarantees they have agood experience during theirappointment.

Sencer, MD Sooner or later, you will be confronted by an unhappy orangry patient. How you handle the situation may determine whether you lose a patient or gain a referral source. Your ability to defuse this potentially volatile situation can help preventa malpractice suit or complaint against you to yourprofessional board. The first step in dealing with an unhappy patient is determining the cause of the patient's distress. Generally,you will find that angry or dissatisfied patients fall intoone of four groups: They are unhappy with you, they areunhappy with the office, they have externalized orprojected their dissatisfaction onto you or the office, orthey received a poor clinical outcome. They are unhappy with you. They may feel you are not listening, or that you seem cold or arrogant. Do notdismiss these complaints \u2014 you can learn a lot bylistening to patients' complaints. Remember, many malpractice suits occur against doctors not liked by the plaintiff. But when patients knowyou care, they are less likely to sue you or file a complaintwith the board. They are unhappy with the office. Most complaints relate to office procedures or one of your staffmembers. For example, a patient may complain about thewaiting time in the office, difficulty on the phone, or aninattentive staff member who seems too busy to help. You are ultimately responsible for the situation, and patients will go to you for resolution. They have externalized or projected their dissatisfaction onto you or the office. Sometimes patients have no legitimate complaint against you or yourpractice, but may project their unhappiness onto you.Often they are angry because they are sick or in pain, orproblems in their personal life or financial difficultiesmakes your bill seem like another burden. Carefullistening and investigation of their complaints will usuallyreveal what is really going on, and can help solve theproblem. They received a poor clinical outcome. The patient may not be happy with you because of yourdiagnosis. If the patient is not getting better, seekconsultation with another chiropractor or a member of adifferent specialty, such as an orthopedist or neurologist.Be sure the patient understands why you are referring himso he doesn't feel you are trying to get rid of him, anddepending on the consultant's recommendations you maycontinue treatment. This shows the patient you areflexible and have his or her best interest at heart. If the patient is noncompliant and it contributes to the poor result, you may need to discharge the patient. Makesure the patient understands you are doing this becauseyou care about the outcome, not because he or she is adifficult patient. Be sure to consult with your healthcareattorney as to the proper procedure to follow in your statewhen you discharge a patient. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Regardless of the cause, there are certain general principles that most practice management consultantsrecommend when dealing with an unhappy patient. Listen attentively. You must listen and give the patient your full attention. Often, that is all the patientwants. Resist the urge to interrupt until the patient isfinished or there is a pause indicating he wants you torespond. Be empathetic. Your response should be empathetic, never defensive. For example, \"It must have beenfrustrating not being able to get your MRI results on thephone,\" as opposed to, \"We were very busy that day andone of our staff was on vacation.\" Never tell patientsabout your busy schedule. Watch your body language and facial expressions. A video of yourself can be eye-opening. If you are open, empathetic, and a good listener, your bodylanguage should take care of itself. Make an apology. Sincerely tell the patient you are sorry they felt uncomfortable, but do not qualify yourapology with an excuse. Saying, \"I'm sorry the charges were not explained to your satisfaction,\" is a good approach. Resist thetemptation to add, \"But we did give you a written billbefore you left the office.\" Remember, the purpose of the encounter is to make an unhappy patient happy, not to prove you are right.CHEC14p36.ps 8/18/08 7:16 PM Page 36CIRCLE VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT Propose a solution. Involve the patient and, if necessary, appropriate staff members and ask if the proposed solution is satisfactory. If not, let the patientknow you will continue to work on a solution until asatisfactory resolution is achieved. Follow-up. Check with the patient and any involved staff members to ensure the problem is resolved. Remember, whenever you identify an area of complaint and a solution, you are getting a chance to make yourpractice a more patient-friendly environment \u2014 whichultimately means more word-of-mouth referrals. In the long run, you are not just solving one patient's problem, but correcting a problem in your practice for thefuture. Marc H.

The most common patient complaint relates to the office or its staff. [ ] 2. If the patient complaint is related to a poor outcome, you should offer to arrange for another opinion. [ ] 3. The most important intervention you can make is to explain why the situation thatmade the patient unhappy occurred. [ ] 4. Every patient has a complaint. Answers: No. 1 and No. 2 are true. While most complaints relate to waiting times or inattentive staff members, when a complaint is related to apoor outcome you should arrange for anotheropinion. No. 3 and No. 4 are false. No. 3 is false because the most important intervention is to listen withoutinterruption. It is a mistake to try to justify whathappened with an excuse. Apologize and try toresolve the problem. No. 4 is also false because less than 5 percent of consumers will actually complain when they areunhappy. If you successfully resolve the 5 percent'scomplaints, you are also resolving complaints of the95 percent you didn't know were unhappy. VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT PRACTICAL LEADERSHIP We've all seen it: The one- time campaign, the one-time class, the one-day training event sold as a solution. It's called drive-by training \u2014 and it's not uncommon and it's not effective. Yet it happens in respectable companies daily. It's the one-day event meant to be thebe-all and end-all to your employee's problem, yet no oneever asked the employee what he learned at the event orwhat the real problem was \u2014 so he didn't care. If you expect those you work with to care about training, make it something worth caring about. Make itsomething they are involved in, not something you forcethem to attend. Sell them on the idea that this trainingand follow-up coaching will add tools to their currentchoices and add skill to their current abilities, andessentially make their lives easier. Your goal should be to solve the problem through training, not to pawn off the responsibility to someoutside source simply because you do not have the time toworry about it. LOOK WITHIN Look closely at the root cause of your employee's behavior or lack of performance. Is she not greetingpeople when they walk in because she doesn't want to orbecause no one ever spelled it out for her? You shouldn'thave your employee take customer-service training whenthe real issue is you failing to share your expectations,coaching, or consequences. If you believe that everyone you work with just knows what you want without you having to share expectationsor how you would like for things to work, you might beexpecting telepathy skills to work in your office. The same goes for training. If you expect people to immediately know how to apply the skills from a trainingsession in another city to the goings on in your office, it isnot likely to happen unless you go over it with themafterward and pull out the points you find most relevant. BECOME A VALUABLE RESOURCE If you're a valuable business resource to those in your office, you can get to the heart of your challenges andconduct meaningful training, instead of a mere exercise. Those you work with want training from you. They want direction and coaching, but if you are always too busy, tootired, or too focused on patients, you send the message thatyou don't have time for training. So when they do gettraining from elsewhere, it really isn't that important. The more you are involved in training or coaching those you work with, the faster you will find solutions. Those whodeal with the patients when they walk in every day areoften closer to the front-desk problems than you are. Ask them for suggestions on how tomake the process flowmore smoothly. Askthose that answer the phones how to streamline answering questions or how tomultitask more effectively. Maybe it is nothing more thana hands-free headset that is needed, instead of a trainingsession on motivation. However, if it is a motivational problem that stems from lacking rewards, they might tell you that as well.Maybe they don't feel valued. Again, a drive-by trainingclass will not fix this challenge. Training is the transfer of knowledge and skill needed when there is a skill gap, not when there is a difference ofopinion. Have employees truly forgotten how to performcustomer service or are they struggling with a culture thatonly supports \"Do as I say, not as I do?\" Performanceproblems rarely stem from a lack of memory.

By Tammy WorthVOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 45Isabelle Roy, DC, epitomizes green living at her home in Wendover,Ontario, Canada. She composts or recycles much of her waste, and her three-acre community garden \u2014 complete with free-range chicken and ducks \u2014 supplies vegetables for neighbors. Sheheats her home with wood, gets water from nearby wells,and uses only clean energy (though she would like to createenough of her own power to go completely \"off the grid\"). This chiropractor's green habits are also pervasive in her practice, Essence Life Studio. A home-based officekeeps her from driving to work, she uses polar fleecesquares that are washable and reusable in lieu of facepaper, and her office system is nearly paperless. \"Chiropractic is a lifestyle,\" she says. \"If we understand that the body is a reflection of our environment, and cankeep that as natural as possible, we willhave a better quality of life. I think mygeneration of chiropractors is reallywalking the talk.\" Even before green was \"cool,\" people understood the importance of living ina more sustainable manner, particularlythose in the healthcare industry.Research shows there is a direct linkbetween public health andenvironmental health. In many areas,resources like water and fresh air arebecoming scarcer every day. And therehas been a growing recognition that even small, painlesschanges can have a positive impact on the environment. The decision seems to be one that flows organically from home to practice, and for some, like Roy, the two areinseparable. Whether the goal is to live off the land orjust put your toes in the water, there are numerous ways tomake a difference and have an impact on your patients,staff, and the environment. WHY GO GREEN \"It is important today to be sustainable,\" says Denise Kehoe, DC, co-owner of Kehoe Family Chiropractic inNew Port Richey, Fla. \"Our resources are dwindling andthe population is growing. It seems to tie along with thephilosophical standpoint of chiropractors: Conservationand minimalism \u2014 we work with the body just as we tryto do with the environment.\" By undertaking efforts like reducing energy usage and recycling, a practice can significantly reduce the amountof natural resources consumed. According to the Going Green Initiative's Web site, the energy saved from recycling one aluminum can couldrun a television for six hours, and the amount ofelectricity saved by recycling one glass bottle could light aspace with a 100-watt bulb for four hours. The health of patients and staff can also improve by being mindful of products used. Some cleaners and paintscontain harmful additives and emit toxins that can causehealth problems. The U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) estimates healthcare costs of \"sick\"buildings to be $30 billion a year. For any practical business owner, cost savings is an important part of the equation. When using green products,the upfront costs are often a bit higher, but as moreenvironmentally friendly products become mainstream,costs decrease. A 2002 EPA study found that officebuildings equipped with Energy Star products cost 40percent less to operate than an average office building. BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING \"The model for green healthcare is choosing practices that are the least invasive and the least toxic and thatbenefit humans and the environment they are workingin,\" says Niyati Desai, associate director of the TeleosisInstitute. \"Without fresh air, clean water, and clean land,we are a little bit doomed to say the least.\" Teleosis Institute, based in Berkeley, Calif., specializes in bringing environmental sustainability to healthcare byproviding education, assessments, and tools for sustainablepractices. She says the best way to begin is to look at eachstep from the minute you walk in the door until themoment you leave. Analyze the following areas to create a more sustainable practice: Solid waste reduction and recycling,energy and water conservation, pollution prevention,medical technology, and healthy people. Desai adds thatfiguring out problem areas (paper towels in the bathroom)makes it easier to find potential alternatives (replacingwith washable cloth towels). WHAT YOU CAN DO While you may not yet be ready to \"live off the grid,\" there are a lot of quick and simple changes that can help make your practice green on a smaller scale. Change your lightbulbs to compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs); When building or remodeling, use low- or no-VOC (volatile organic compounds) paints; Buy local products, and sell green and organic products; Reduce the use of paper and recycle what is used; and Purchase eco-friendly, nontoxic cleaning supplies and soaps.CHEC14p45.ps 8/18/08 7:24 PM Page C HIROPRACTIC VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008Kehoe recommends starting with simple steps. For instance, when purchasing new lightbulbs, choosecompact fluorescents \u2014 they use lessenergy and last longer than traditionalbulbs. Or when leaving the office atnight, adjust the thermostat so itdoesn't run all evening. \"It literally is just a few extra steps here and there, but then they becomeroutine,\" Kehoe says. \"It is justmaking wiser, more educated choices.\" REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE Roy began incorporating sustainable activities into her lifestyle about 10 years ago withsmall steps, such as recycling,reducing purchases, and eatinglocally and organically grown foods. As she progressively became more focused on environmentally friendlyliving, almost all areas of her workand home have gone green. Roy uses 100 percent recycled content paper, though she needs verylittle because her office system isnearly paperless. All of herinformation including patient charts,financials, and scheduling is in aWeb-based system. Any notes shemust take are on scrap paper and shekeeps one file per patient \u2014 a 100percent recycled cardboard folder withinformation from their initial intake. Other aspects of waste management can include using washable cups forwater and tea, recycling, composting,properly disposing of computers andbatteries, and donating or purchasingused items. For Kehoe, sustainability directly relates to the health of her patients.Since she and her husband Brianopened the practice in 2005, theyhave used only environmentallyfriendly cleaning supplies, laundrydetergent, and hand soap. \"This is family heathcare, so we take care of kids,\" she says. \"We useproducts that are safe, biodegradable,and don't have toxic fumes.\" Along with green purchasing, Roy encourages chiropractors to mindwhat they are selling. She saidwhether it is pillows, vitamins, orFEATURE CIRCLE 162FREE INFORMATIONCHEC14p46.ps PM Page 14 EPTEMBER 8, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 47supplements, seek out companies with sustainable operations whichtend to use less packaging andproduce less waste. Energy and water conservation are two other major areas of focus forKehoe and Roy. Essence Life Studiobrings in natural light throughskylights in the adjusting rooms toreduce power consumption, and thecomputers are energy efficient and\"go to sleep\" when not in use. Other possible avenues include purchasing renewable energy, usinglow-flow water fixtures, havingenergy and water use auditsperformed, and planting nativelandscaping to decrease watering. Downsizing is another way to reduce the use of resources. Kehoesays their feeder room system allowedthem to lessen the square footageneeded, using less energy, equipment,and resources. BUILDING ENVELOPE \"Americans waste space,\" says Amie Gross, president of New YorkCity's Amie Gross Architects.

But demand hasgrown, and in the past year all of her projects were green.

If you have to replacesomething repeatedly, you arecreating more waste. Buy local. The farther away something is produced the moreenergy it takes to get to you. Purchase recycled materials (especially locally made ones). When using wallpaper, paints, and stains, make sure they arenontoxic so they don't emit vaporsinto the space. Because green design has become so ubiquitous, Gross says many paint andflooring options are easy to locate andmost vendors have the information athand. If a more complicated project isundertaken, work with a well-verseddesigner in sustainability or one who iswilling to learn quickly. SPREAD THE WORD Being green is also about more than just altering the physical spacein which you work. Desai says thepractices within the building must begreen, and communication withpatients is a large part of the picture. She recommends sending newsletters, appointment reminders,and other communication via e-mailso patients see the paper usagereduction. She also recommendsputting notes around the office for amini eco-tour of your sustainablepractices to communicate yourvalues.

In thisinevitability lies a great opportunity for the chiropracticprofession; the opportunity to not simply make acontribution, but to take on a leadership role. In terms of going green as it relates to healthcare, who has a stronger track record, is more conceptually alignedin general, and better suited than the chiropractor to stepforward and bring this potential to the public? Chiropractors have historically been cautious about all forms of healthcare intervention. Our caution has been directed at issues ranging from the use of fluoride in drinking water to pharmaceuticals to surgical procedures. As a discipline, we never bought into DuPont's concept of better living through chemistry. If we did follow a Madison Avenue ad campaign, it was more likely to be \"it's not nice to fool [with] Mother Nature! As a discipline, we have always seen, respected, and supported concepts of natural healing. This is not an awareness we need to come to or one we recently arrived at, it is the premise upon which our entire existence is based. The chiropractor has always seenthe human being as a self-renewing, self-regenerating font ofhealing capacity. We have always taught our patients to bein harmony with the elements of healing. Our colleagues in medicine have taken another path. Theirs is steeped in chemical intervention, so much sothat the prescription pad itself is synonymous with thepractice of medicine. They did so in the age when babyformula was determined to be better than mother's milk,and Tang became the breakfast drink of choice over freshorange juice. Stronger drugs, like more powerful engines,were a sign of progress. More power was good and itsapplication was without thought of side- or after- effects. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES Today, the \"law of unintended consequences\" is considered at the start of every effort and intervention.The venue doesn't matter. We have come to therealization that the use of power has consequences, andGoing green in chiropractic By Gerry Clum, DC CHEC14p53.ps 8/18/08 7:30 PM Page 5354 C HIROPRACTIC WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PERSPECTIVE often, those consequences are far more destructive than the originalintent was designed to change. We have seen the emergence of such concepts as living a carbon-neutral lifestyle, and decreasing theenvironmental impact of our homeson the planet. The translation of theseconcepts into healthcare is well under-way. In many circles it remains underthe radar, but it is not out of sight. As an example, a current line of reasoning with respect to allergies andasthma is the hygiene hypotheses.Simply stated, the hypothesis suggestswe have unnaturally \"over-cleaned\"our world and have not given ourchildren exposures that would helpthem develop normal, tempered,immune response. Rather, we have bathed them in antiseptics, we have caused them notto experience normal childhooddiseases and we have left themimmunologically unprepared. At thesame time, we strengthened themicrobial world and have empoweredthe conversion of plain old Staphaureus to Methicillin-resistant Staphaureus (MRSA). We burned coal to warm our homes and sped up the accumulationof greenhouse gases. We had a warmhouse, and we now reap the effects ofthe law of unintended consequences.We had simple infections and weblasted them for generations with themagic bullet of antibiotics. For many years, we had fewer, simpler infections thanks to theeffort, but soon we began to learnabout antibiotic resistant organisms and super bugs. We failed toappreciate that these outcomes werenot a part of a normal evolutionarycycle, but rather the consequences ofour unfettered use of power. Our automobiles, machines, and circumstances made us comfortable,our calorie intake increased and ourcalorie output decreased as wewelcomed the age of obesity. Our children didn't drink milk and play in the sunshine asgenerations before them. Their babybottles and sippy cups were filledwith sweet carbonated drinks and, ahalf century later, their bones arebreaking with far greater regularity. The parallels are endless. The mechanisms are the same \u2014 a goodidea \u2014 a time-saving, money-saving,progressive idea replaces a time-honored reality and we reap all formsof harmful secondary effect. RETHINKING OUR WAYS No one wants a world without advances and conveniences, whether we are speaking about the home(house) we live in, or the home(body) we live in. All around us,people are rethinking totallyaccepted and fully integrated lifestylematters. We need to help themtranslate this rethinking into theirhealth and wellness decisions. In days gone by, houses didn't need CIRCLE 187FREE VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008PERSPECTIVE to be designed to be energy efficient or minimally environmentallyimpactful \u2014 remember \"conspicuousconsumption.\" Today they do. In days gone by, we didn't need to think about strengthening ourselves ashealing entities \u2014 a script for this anda script for that and away we went. The \"layers\" of green thinking that will need to be applied to healthcarein the days ahead are almost mind-numbing. If we begin with the effectof more judicious personal healthdecisions, we can then move on tothe impact of health-related productson the environment. The pollution of ground water with pharmaceutical products hasbeen a matter for the 11 o'clocknews for months. The volume ofmaterials generated as waste throughhealthcare practices is predicted toclog landfills across the country. The carbon footprint of theproduction, storage, and distributionnetworks associated with healthcare-related products is one of the mostintensive of the industrialized worldwith extraordinary solvent use andwaste generated per final product unit. Finally, the end use packaging systems are notorious for theproduction of waste materialsassociated with the delivery of eachand every dose of medication. MOVING FORWARD One does not need to be very creative to begin to appreciate thecompounding effect of strategies thatmove people away from a product-oriented medical model of healthcareto a personal-behavior supportedmodel augmented by systems andapproaches that rely on the inherenthealing power of the individual. Advancing the concept of western- style medicine as an environmentallytaxing, if not hostile, activity is aseasy as demonstrating theenvironmentally harmful practices ofpetroleum-based lifestyles. Advancing the use of nonproduct- oriented healthcare, such aschiropractic, is similarly as easy asdemonstrating the effectiveness ofwind or solar energy approaches. Today, more than ever, we must see our bodies as renewable, health-generating systems. We need tosupport the system and generate evenmore good health. We can generateenough health-sustaining capacity toreduce the ecological load on thegrid of healthcare. Gerry Clum, DC, is the president of Life ChiropracticCollege West.

Thepatient was given informed consent forms and signedthem prior to care. The attending doctor recommended x-rays, especially in the complaint region, but the patient expresslydeclined. The doctor again made this recommendationand explained the importance of such an imagingprocedure and indicated it in the clinic notes. The patientagain declined and the attending doctor entered thisdecision in the clinic notes. The attending doctor conducted a careful spinal examination, identifying numerous regions of vertebralsubluxation, and proceeded to adjust those spinalsegments using a mechanical adjusting device on severalof the regions and gentle pressure (short of a low-velocitythrust) on two others. The doctor then recommended aseries of gentle stretching exercises, and scheduled afollow-up appointment in one week. The patient returned to the chiropractic clinic four days later complaining of greater discomfort than before \u2014especially in the primary region of the initial complaint. The attending doctor asked the patient about any new stress, injury, or activity as cause for possible exacerbationof the area in question, but the patient was notforthcoming with information on any new injury. Thedoctor again recommended x-rays of the problematicregion and again the patient declined. The doctor then declined additional adjustive care unless she took x-rays, and the patient indicated she would thinkabout it. The patient also declined to be re-examined andleft the clinic. The patient failed to appear for the scheduledappointment and did not return any inquiry calls. T wo months after the patient's initial visit, the attending doctor was contacted by the patient's attorneywho indicated the patient was considering malpracticecharges. The charges were based on the doctor's failure todiagnose osteoporotic bone loss in the thoracic region ofthe spine \u2014 including the failure to determine themedications the patient was taking and their impact onthe integrity of spinal structures. The patient had been on a lengthy course of prescribed steroid medications, the bone erosion consequences ofwhich, the attorney stated, were \"common knowledge.\"Because of the doctor's failure to diagnose the bone lossand its pharmaceutical basis, the attorney indicated thepatient was injured upon the first series of adjustments,and those adjustments caused a minor compressionfracture of the sixth thoracic vertebrae. The attorney stated the patient had, after a period of six weeks, sought medical advice, and the malpractice com-plaint would be based on the findings of the attending MD. LIABILITY ANALYSIS The attending chiropractor reported the incident to his malpractice carrier and had its chiropractic consultantscarefully explore the aspects of the case. It was determined that despite the long delay in reporting the complaint, and the possibility that duringthat period some other source of injury was responsible forthe fracture, there was exposure because of thechiropractor's failure to obtain the indicated diagnosticimaging findings prior to administering the adjustment,and in determining if there were contraindications to theadjustment process. Such x-rays prior to the adjustmentprocess might have also revealed the fracture existed priorto the patient's seeking chiropractic care. It was also determined the chiropractor had carefully performed the standard examination procedures; tookdetailed clinical notes indicating all procedures andrecommendations; and applied adapted adjustiveprocedures using low-force, instrument techniques, out ofconcern for the patient's profile. The patient's repeatedrefusal to be x-rayed, along with the delay of many weeksbefore seeking medical care, also significantly limited theNo x-rays = trouble By Stuart E.

Davis, Wake-Up VOL54: I SSUE 14 S EPTEMBER 8, 2008LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ASK THE ATTORNEY I am starting my own practice in an area with a large senior citizen population on Medicare andwould like to provide services to them. What do I need to know from a legal perspective? To be eligible for Medicare reimbursement, youmust be state licensed and meet nationalstandards. Check with the Medicare carrier in your area about getting on its approved list. Medicare will only pay for manual adjustment of the spine, which must be for neuromusculoskeletal conditions.The manipulation must be directed to the spine to correcta subluxation, which is defined by Medicare as: incompletedislocation; off centering; misalignment; fixation orabnormal spacing of the vertebrae; and spinal axis aches,strains, sprains, and functional mechanical disabilities. Medicare will pay for a maximum of one treatment per day unless documentation can show that more treatments arereasonable and necessary. Medicare will not pay for \"inten-sive care\" treatment that may include room or ward fees. Medicare assumes that acute subluxation problems may require up to three months of treatment, and assumesfrequency of treatment will decrease as the patient'scondition improves. Medicare will recognize thattreatment of chronic or permanent conditions may lastlonger, but you must prove that the additional treatmentis medically reasonable and necessary. If your patient's problem is acute, include an \"AT\" modifier or your claim will be denied and the carrier willassume your claim is for maintenance therapy \u2014 which isnot covered by Medicare. Your carrier will also deny services if you exceed its local coverage determination (LCD) on frequency limits. If yourcarrier limits the number of times you may bill active treat-ment, but you believe that further treatment is medicallynecessary, have the patient sign an Advance BeneficiaryNotice of Non Coverage (ABN) before providing thetreatment and bill with the appropriate modifier. Remember, Medicare does not pay for chiropractic services you provide to prevent disease, promote generalgood health, or maintain or prevent deterioration of achronic condition. These services are consideredmaintenance therapy, which is not medically reasonableor necessary.PROVIDING PROOF You must prove the patient's need for treatment by submitting documentation verifying the patient has asubluxation. You may do this by either submitting x-rays or initial exam proof. Submit x-rays. Submit an x-ray taken one year before or three months after treatment begins. For chronicconditions, such as scoliosis, you may submit an older x-ray if it supports the existence of the condition. CT scansand MRIs that show the subluxation are also acceptable.(Medicare will not pay you for ordering, taking, orinterpreting x-rays. A provider may submit an x-ray as part of the documentation that supports a claim, but it's not required.This policy also applies to diagnostic and therapeuticservices other than x-rays). Initial exam proof. The initial physical exam must reveal two of the following four criteria: 1. Pain/tenderness evaluated in terms of location, quality, and intensity; 2. Asymmetry/misalignment identified on a sectional or segmental level; 3. Range-of-motion abnormality; or4. Tissue, tone changes in the characteristics of associated soft tissues. (CA VEAT: The exam must at least indicate either asymmetry/misalignment or range-of-motion abnormality). The patient's record must also include the symptoms causing the patient to seek treatment; family history (ifrelevant); past health history; mechanism of trauma;quality and character of symptoms/problem; onset,duration, intensity, frequency, location, and radiation ofsymptoms; aggravating or relieving factors; and priortreatments, medications, and secondary complaints.

Someday these people will be your colleagues and fellow chiropractors, scattered across the globe, taking their place in the industry. It would be nice to have a large network of friends you can rely on when the time comes. A concept many chiropractors fail to realize until they are years into practice is one you develop for patients, butit can expand to almost everyone you know. This conceptisdeveloping relationships. Once you graduate, the hope is to get into practice as soon as possible. You begin developing relationships withpatients as you work to gain their trust and get them well.But equally important is developing working relationshipsand friendships with other chiropractors in thesurrounding area. That way, you develop a network ofdoctors who may be able to help you if the need arises. No matter where you practice, there is a state-run chiropractic association. In some states, the association isbroken into local chapters. Usually, these associations havelocal and statewide meetings where they bring chiropractorstogether for continuing education and social events. Theseare effective ways to meet other DCs in your area. Having a local network of chiropractors also helps you search for employees, get advice on how to run an office,and find a fill-in doctor when you vacation. Anotherimportant benefit is you can cross-refer patients. There arepatients who come to you who may benefit from seeing afriend of yours with a particular specialty and vice versa. If you can keep in touch with some of your friends once they leave school, you can also establish a network outsideyour area. On many occasions, you can look in theNational Directory of Chiropractic and refer a patientwho is traveling or moving to a friend of yours in anotherstate. Maintaining these relationships really works! Aside from having a solid support system of chiropractors, you should get into the mindset of working with otherhealthcare disciplines. Patients walk into your office lookingfor guidance and help with their condition. Chiropracticworks well for many ailments, but it is not the be-all andend-all. No profession or health discipline should be soarrogant to think it can solve all of the world's problems.You need to establish a network of other healthcarepractitioners you can turn to when you need help. Still a bit hesitant to the idea? MRIs, CT scans, supervised exercise sessions, acupuncture needles, surgicalprocedures, and prescription medications are just somethings your patients may need that you may not be able toprovide. You may want to establish connections with other healthcare providers, such as a massage therapist,acupuncturist, physical therapist, naturopath/homeopath,medical doctor or general practitioner, internist, www. student DCcom Home Colleges Career Development Financial Preparation Job Search Practice Startup Checklists Resources From classmate to colleague By Kevin Wong, DCClick it!
