They are broad and long-term. In conformance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, which calls for the alignment of goals with budget requests in strategic plans, the activities of individual components are usually found under a single goal in the plan. In practice, however, components often per\u00ad form duties that fall within each of the four goals. Their inclusion under a single goal is a matter of administrative convenience to com\u00ad port with the OMB circular. As suggested by the \"Key Cross-Cutting Programs\" sections of the plan, many are undertaken in collabora\u00ad tion with, or the support of, other federal, state, and local agencies. As in the past, our goals and objectives reflect several major themes. These include: Partnership. We are committed to con\u00ad tinuing and strengthening collaborative efforts with other federal agencies, states and localities, tribal governments, community groups, foreign countries, and others. Since critical crime and jus\u00ad tice issues transcend traditional jurisdic\u00ad tional and functional boundaries, effec\u00ad tive partnerships are a key ingredient to achieving results. This is especially true with information-sharing among law enforcement and intelligence communi\u00ad ties to prevent acts of terrorism against the United States. In addition, the cur\u00ad rent state of the art in communications and transportation, the growth of the Fiscal Years 2003-2008 global economy, and the breakup of for\u00admerly totalitarian states have under\u00ad scored the transnational dimensions of the Department's work. Leadership. We are committed to fulfilling our leadership responsibilities in forging a coordinated national and international response to crime and justice and assisting states, localities, and tribal governments. We are also committed to targeting federal investigative and prosecutorial resources on those areas where the need is most crit\u00ad ical and where they can have most strategic effect, for example, in preventing and investigating terrorist threats or attacking multijurisdictional criminal enterprises. Preparedness. We are committed to main\u00ad taining a high-level capability to deter and respond quickly to newly emerging crime threats, including those threats posed by new technology and criminal strategies. Preparedness involves attention to core infrastructure needs to ensure that ade\u00ad quate skills, tools, and processes are in place for meeting the new challenges that face us. Institutional Integrity. We are committed to preserving and enhancing the integrity and trustworthiness of not only the Department, but the Nation's entire system of justice. This not only includes the way we carry ourselves as representatives of the law, but the diligence we exercise in man\u00ad aging the funds entrusted to us to carry out our mission.

Their reach is glob\u00ad al in nature, they are tenacious, and they adapt quickly to increase their chances of survival.\" This characterization of terrorist groups by the Director of the FBI explains the strong response the Department has taken to combat the insidious dangers these groups pose. The attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and on the Pentagon in Washington, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, have brought terrorism dramatically to American soil. With these incidents, terrorism for most citizens shifted from being a distant, occasional threat to a realization of imminent danger to our\u00ad enormous loss of life and property argues forcefully that the Homeland must be protect\u00ad from future terrorist Department of Justice has been unrelenting in waging its battle against these threats. tory, they also changed the meaning of dramatically shifted DOJ priorities. Now, the prevention of terrorist attacks is the prosecution of persons suspected of terror\u00ad ist acts is the top priority of U.S. Attorneys and the Criminal Division. This resolve is most vividly reflected in the Department's Strategic Goal One, but is apparent throughout the DOJ Strategic Plan: nearly has a critical role in countering the terrorist threat. The efforts of those components are described throughout this plan. The Department of Justice's approach to protecting the U.S. from terrorism is three- pronged, focusing on the prevention of ter\u00ad rorist acts; the investigation and prosecu\u00ad intend to commit, terrorist acts in the against the United States by strengthening counterintelligence capabilities. Prevention is our highest priority, because success in preventing terrorism saves lives and prop\u00ad erty, and reduces the need to investigate incidents and prosecute individuals. We FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security cannot wait for terrorists to strike to begin investigations and make arrests. The death tolls are too high, the consequences too great. Strategic Objective 1.1 Prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur DOJ is committed to stopping terrorism at any stage of development, from the posi\u00ad tioning of those who would conduct an act to the financiers of the operations. A terror\u00ad ist attack, such as a bombing, is the culmi\u00ad nation of extensive planning and resource gathering. The DOJ's fusion of national intelligence and law enforcement creates an inhospitable terrorist environment that exposes terrorist activity and prevents ter\u00ad rorist attacks. In responding to terrorist threats, the Department will develop a comprehensive knowledge of terrorist organizations and a comprehensive understanding of their intentions. This requires effective mecha\u00ad nisms to receive information on a timely basis and to develop program-specific intelligence products that will provide improved evaluation, exploitation, and dis\u00ad semination of information. A closely coor\u00ad dinated effort among FBI Headquarters, FBI field offices, the U.S. Attorneys' offices, the Criminal Division, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. intelligence community, state and local partners, and the Department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information related to specific threats is essential. Once threats are identified, all appropriate inves\u00ad tigative actions must be taken, with the goal being the successful prevention of ter\u00ad rorist acts and prosecution of those involved. Every effort will be made to locate those responsible for terrorist acts wherever they are and prevent them from inflicting further harm. Much of the terrorism that threatens the United States emanates from foreign nations. As part of its war on terrorism, the Department assists other countries in developing effective criminal justice sys\u00ad tems that can prevent terrorism, or disrupt it before it passes through their borders to threaten the U.S. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Disrupt terrorist presence Preventing terrorists from entry into the country, enhancing intelligence to monitor terrorist subsistence, and increasing aware\u00ad ness of terrorist surveillance on potential targets are methods that the FBI will employ to disrupt the terrorist presence to stage an attack. Disrupt terrorist ability The FBI will protect the U.S. from terror\u00ad ist attack by disrupting the terrorists' abili\u00adty to conduct an act. Training, finances, recruiting, logistical support, pre-attack FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.10 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security planning, and preparation are all required components of terrorist operations. These dependencies create vulnerabilities and the FBI will focus on creating a comprehensive intelligence base to exploit these vulnera\u00ad bilities. Develop intelligence-driven operations The FBI will focus on gathering intelli\u00ad gence from all sources. Each terrorist case opened will collect intelligence information concerning potential terrorist activity in field divisions. All cases will be nationally managed and applied to a broader national perspective. This intelligence focuses on identification of terrorist training, fund raising, recruiting, logistical support, and pre-attack planning activity. Multiply preventive efforts through increased representation in Joint T errorism T ask Forces (JTTFs) JTTFs are located in each of the FBI's 56 field divisions and in larger resident agencies. Each JTTF consists of FBI Special Agents and regional investigative experts from the intelli\u00ad gence community, other federal agencies, and state and local law enforcement. Prevention is achieved through sharing information and acting promptly. The JTTF is the medium through which operational information is disseminated accurately and expeditiously from FBI headquarters and acted upon. JTTF members are operational force multi\u00ad pliers in the war against terrorism. Utilize Anti-T errorism Advisory Councils within each judicial district to coordinate anti-terrorist activities At the direction of the Attorney General, each U.S. Attorney's Office identified an expe\u00ad rienced prosecutor to serve as the Anti- Terrorism Coordinator for that specific district. Assisted by the Counterterrorism Section of the Criminal Division, representatives from federal law enforcement agencies (including the FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals Service, Secret Service, and the Department of Home\u00ad land Security Directorate of Border and Transportation Security) and from various state and local law enforcement organiza\u00ad tions constitute the district's Anti-Terror- ism Advisory Council (ATAC). The adviso\u00ad ry councils will be part of a national network that will coordinate specific anti-terrorism ini\u00ad tiatives, initiate training programs, and facili\u00ad tate information sharing. They will work closely with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.11 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security Develop an intelligence capability that fully supports the Department's counter-terrorism efforts The DOJ will develop a comprehen\u00ad sive intelligence program that can iden\u00ad tify emerging threats and patterns, find relationships among individuals and groups, and provide useful information to investigators in a timely manner. This intel\u00ad ligence and analysis effort will range from tactical to strategic to program intelligence in order to fully support the investigative aspect of the counterterrorism effort throughout all aspects of operation. Finally, the Department will ensure that the infor\u00ad mation collected and analyzed is dissemi\u00ad nated appropriately to ensure that all rele\u00ad vant partners are fully informed and engaged in the counterterrorism effort. Fully coordinate with federal, state, and local government agencies in a comprehen\u00ad sive effort to develop and maintain adequate domestic preparedness Because of the catastrophic conse\u00ad quences posed by a terrorist attack involv\u00ad ing weapons of mass destruction, we must increase the preparedness of the Nation by strengthening capabilities at the local, state, and federal levels to respond effectively to terrorist events. At present, there are sever\u00ad al international terrorist organizations that have expressed an interest in constructing weapons of mass destruction and appear to have the requisite money, resources, and access to do so. Through the Anti-terrorism Advisory Councils and the Joint Terrorism Task Forces, the Department will work with communities throughout the country to ensure that they have the resources and training to respond to incidents of terror\u00ad ism and to assist U.S. citizens who are the victims of such violence. A comprehensive training program is integral to an effective terrorism response. In addition to partnerships with federal counterparts, the Department will continue to foster the promulgation and dissemina\u00ad tion of cooperative domestic preparedness initiatives in support of state and local emergency responders. Consistent with the leadership and guidance of the Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorneys have been charged with the responsibility of develop\u00ad ing district crisis response plans. The plans will provide a crosswalk to FBI crisis response plans as well as similarly focused state, local, and regional emergency response plans. Assist foreign partners to ensure internation\u00ad al judicial cooperation International cooperation is critical in our battle to fight international terrorism. Our experience has been that some of our allies in the effort to prevent terrorist attacks do not have the legal structure and technical capacity to prevent terrorist fund\u00ad raising or the movement of funds in sup\u00ad port of terrorist conspiracies. The DOJ has been a leader in the drive to assess our for\u00ad eign partners' legal structure and capacity FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.12 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security to stop terrorist networks by identifying and choking off their funds. Where defi\u00ad ciencies are noted, we advise our foreign partners on the appropriate legal structure and train government officials in an effort to increase their capacity. Reform the Federal Bureau of Investigation The Department will continue imple\u00ad menting its reform and reorganization of the FBI in a deliberate, phased approach, focusing on the Bureau's new priority of fighting terrorism. To that end, the FBI has installed a top-level management structure to ensure a solid framework capable of aligning resources with national priority concerns. It has restructured its Counter\u00ad terrorism Division, shifting from a reactive to a proactive orientation; implemented a more active, direct management approach to ensure more coordinated national and international investigations; and enhanced its analytical capabilities while increasing the use of data mining, financial record and communication analyses, and other spe\u00ad cialized techniques to combat terrorism. The Department and FBI are next mov\u00ad ing to implement a revitalized Intelligence Program, recognizing that the FBI must enhance its intelligence collection and ana\u00ad lytical capacity and create formal and reli\u00ad able mechanisms to ensure that critical information is disseminated and shared appropriately. The new focus on intelli\u00ad gence will ensure that the FBI can fulfill the information collection needs of the new multi-agency Terrorist Threat Integration Center. The reform of the FBI is one of the Attorney General's 10 Management Initiatives, described in Chapter III of this strategic plan. Make resources available for counterterror\u00ad ism efforts by realizing efficiencies in DOJ programs and activities To ensure sufficient funding in the fight against terrorism, the Department is work\u00ad ing to consolidate duplicative functions within its components, to streamline departmental processes and eliminate inef\u00ad ficiencies. The budget savings expected from this effort will be applied to countert\u00ad errorism activities. This initiative is also one of the Attorney General's 10 Management Initiatives, described in Chapter III. Coordinate Communications and Outreach The Department will continue the lead\u00ad ership role in information-sharing and operational cooperation, particularly in the area of countering terrorism. This strategy, discussed more fully in Chapter III in this document, is also one of the Attorney General's 10 Management Initiatives. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Department of Homeland Security . DOJ will work closely with the newly-estab- lished Department of Homeland Security as it exercises its responsibility to develop and coordinate the implementation of a FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.13 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security comprehensive national strategy to secure the United States from terrorist threats or attacks. FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force System. In the past, the FBI JTTF System has been the principal component for counterterrorism coordination efforts within the DOJ. With the establishment of the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Councils (ATAC) coordinated out of U.S. Attorney Offices, described among the strategies of Objective 1.1, representa\u00adtives of the JTTFs will participate as mem\u00adbers of the ATAC organizations, but contin\u00adue to exercise primary operational authori\u00adty over counterterrorism investigative activities. InfraGard. The FBI, in conjunction with the private sector, has developed an initiative called \"InfraGard\" to expand direct contacts with private and public sector infrastruc\u00adture stakeholders to share information about cyber-intrusions, exploited vulnera\u00adbilities, and physical infrastructure threats. Financial Systems Assessment Teams (FSAT). The Department, through its par\u00ad ticipation on the interagency Terrorist Financing Working Group, develops and provides money laundering, asset forfei\u00adture, and terrorist financing assistance and training to countries deemed to be most vulnerable to terrorist financing. As an ini\u00adtial step, the Criminal Division brings unique technical expertise in the area of money laundering, asset forfeiture, and international money movements and par\u00adticipates on the FSATs, which determine the anti-money laundering and terrorist financ\u00ading capacity of the selected countries and develop action plans for the training and technical assistance that these countries need to effectively identify and freeze assets used to finance terrorism and to cre\u00adate an effective legal, regulatory, and enforcement regime to combat terrorist financing. Strategic Objective 1.2 Investigate and prosecute those who have committed, or intend to com\u00ad mit, terrorist acts in the United States Although the Department emphasizes pre\u00ad venting acts of terrorism against Americans and their institutions, many of the same investigative tools and organizational structures developed for prevention can be used to investigate crimes of terrorism once they have been committed. Just as coordi\u00ad nating task forces, intelligence-gathering, and information-sharing are key elements of a prevention program, so too are these the essential elements of an effective inves\u00ad tigation of crimes that have been commit- FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.14 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security ted. The Department also assists other countries to develop the capacity to identi\u00ad fy and investigate criminals who commit terrorist acts. This assistance enables those countries to become effective partners for the U.S. in its efforts to bring terrorists to justice. After investigation, the Department of Justice's approach to protecting its citizens from terrorism is the effective prosecution of those who have been charged with crim\u00ad inal violations related to terrorism. A suc\u00ad cessful prosecution strategy carries a dual benefit. Not only does it bring criminals to justice and take them off the streets, it also can deter future acts of terrorism by dis\u00ad rupting terrorist organizations by incarcer\u00ad ating their members and discouraging those who remain at large. Many of the same methods developed for preventing terrorism can be applied to build a strong case for prosecuting terrorist crimes. Coordinating task forces, collabora\u00ad tive intelligence-gathering, and coopera\u00ad tive information-sharing have been described above as key elements of preven\u00ad tion and investigation strategies. They are also essential elements of an effective pros\u00ad ecution program. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Utilize regional expertise in terrorism inves\u00ad tigations with the FBI's Joint T errorism T ask Force The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces are points of fusion for state, local, and federal law enforcement and the intelligence com\u00ad munity. The collective regional knowledge of task force members enhances the inves\u00ad tigative capacity of each FBI field division and many resident agencies. Additionally, the participating agencies in a JTTF allow for enhanced cooperation and coordination in sharing information and pursuing inves\u00ad tigations. JTTFs bring the resources of mul\u00ad tiple counterterrorism partners under one roof to investigate potential terrorist activi\u00ad ties. Deploy the Anti-T errorism Advisory Councils created within each judicial dis\u00ad trict to coordinate specific anti-terrorism initiatives, initiate training programs, and facilitate information sharing. The Anti-Terrorism Advisory Councils, described earlier under Strategic Objective 1.1, will coordinate anti-terrorism initia\u00ad tives by ensuring that federal, state, and local enforcement efforts are focused and coordinated as they pursue targets that may be connected to terrorism. They will also mobilize certain national prevention- based initiatives that involve significant prospects of imminent prosecution, and they will provide a central forum for agen\u00ad cies to congregate and identify potential terrorism links. These advisory councils will sponsor various training programs related to terrorism. They will facilitate information sharing among various law FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.15 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security enforcement entities and will disseminate terrorism-related information to ATAC members on a regular basis. The advisory councils will work in close coordination with the JTTFs. Promote and, when available, use new legis\u00ad lation and authorities to conduct investiga\u00ad tions of terrorist incidents Because modern terrorism defies con\u00ad ventional crime fighting laws and authori\u00ad ties, the Department will endorse changes that will strengthen the likelihood of crimi\u00ad nal terrorists being identified and brought to justice, while at the same time protecting civil liberties. Among these laws are those related to surveillance and wiretapping, ensuring law enforcement's ability to trace the communications of terrorists over cell phones, computer networks, and new tech\u00ad nologies that may be developed in the com\u00ad ing years. Under the President's leadership, Congress has amended the laws, most notably by passing the USA PATRIOT Act, and authorized new technology-neutral tools to combat and defeat terrorism and to detect and disrupt terrorist plans. The Department will implement these tools and constantly evaluate their efficacy and con\u00ad tinued need in the fight against terrorism. Apply all resources available to develop a comprehensive approach to investigating acts of terrorism The Department will expend the full range of its investigative resources to iden\u00ad tify and apprehend criminals responsible for terrorist acts. To this end, DOJ will enhance its internal capabilities, such as by hiring investigators and support staff who are fluent speakers in languages used by terrorist organizations. The Department will also seek to complement its internal capacity by developing treaties with for\u00ad eign powers and agreements with other agencies to share intelligence and collabo\u00ad rate on criminal investigations. It will con\u00ad tinue to seek to charge terrorists and terror\u00ad ist organizations with all crimes and viola\u00ad tions committed by them, such as narcotics trafficking or money laundering, as exem\u00ad plified by recent indictments against mem\u00ad bers of Colombian terrorist organizations such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the United Self- Defense Groups of Colombia (AUC). The FBI's Legat program works in close coordination with the Department's coun\u00ad terparts in the law enforcement and intelli\u00ad gence community overseas to, among other critical missions, prevent, mitigate, and investigate terrorist attacks on U.S. inter- FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.16 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security ests abroad. The Department will work to expand the FBI's Legat program by open\u00ad ing new offices and sub-offices in those areas of the world where the counterterror\u00ad ism mission needs additional support and involvement. Build strong cases for prosecution through the U.S. Attorney's Offices and the Counter\u00ad terrorism Section of the Criminal Division U.S. Attorney's Offices in each district, in conjunction with skilled attorneys from the Counterterrorism Section of the Criminal Division, will work to build stronger cases, coordinating efforts thr oughout inves\u00ad tigations, so that evidence is solid, proper\u00adly obtained and developed, and appropri\u00ad ately preserved while protecting classified evidence and other intelligence interests. In certain instances, prosecutors will utilize the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Councils to coordinate efforts that require the assis\u00ad tance of other law enforcement organiza\u00ad tions. With clarified prosecution strategies, federal and local law enforcement authori\u00ad ties will be better guided toward the strongest, most relevant evidence available for a sound prosecution. Promote and, when available, use new legis\u00ad lation and authorities to prosecute suspected terrorist criminals to the fullest extent of the law Until passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, our laws made it easier to prosecute mem\u00ad bers of conventional organized crime than to crack down on terrorists who, as events have shown, can kill thousands of innocent people with a single act. The same is true for drug traffickers and individuals involved in espionage-our laws have treat\u00ad ed these criminals and those who aid and abet them more seriously than terrorists. Under the President's leadership, Congress has amended the laws to place terrorism on a par with organized crime and drug traf\u00ad ficking. The Department will continue to assess the need for greater legal restrictions on terrorist activities while protecting civil liberties of law-abiding citizens. Strategic Objective 1.3 Combat espionage against the United States by strengthening counterintelligence capabilities Foreign intelligence threats are planned, authorized, and financed by powers beyond our boundaries. Given the origin, nature, and constantly changing focus of these threats, they can never be completely eliminated. However, the success of foreign intelligence operations and the harm that they can cause to the United States can be mitigated with effective counterintelli\u00ad gence. In recent years, the foreign intelligence threat to the United States has expanded dramatically and has become more com\u00ad plex and less predictable in scope and nature. In addition to traditional threats targeted toward obtaining sensitive infor\u00ad mation on traditional U.S. targets, (i.e., national defense, military operations and FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.17 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security policy, U.S. intelligence, and science and technology information), numerous non\u00ad traditional threats and targets have emerged. Moreover, many of these intelli\u00ad gence threats have expanded their targets to include other sectors affecting U.S. secu\u00ad rity, most notably sensitive economic infor\u00ad mation and proprietary technology infor\u00ad mation. Concurrently, foreign threats now have elaborate sophisticated networks con\u00ad sisting of governmental and nongovern\u00ad mental entities engaged in long-term efforts to obtain information using a wide array of intelligence collection platforms to achieve their goals. Moreover, rapid and continuous changes in technology have provided for\u00adeign intelligence threats with new, inexpen\u00ad sive, and efficient means to target, collect, and disseminate sensitive information. Intelligence operations against the United States are now far more fluid and complex than at any time in the past, making detec\u00ad tion and prevention far more difficult. Strategy to Achieve the Objective Strengthen the Department's intelligence base and analytical capability to assess and respond to intelligence threats The DOJ will expand its knowledge of the intentions, methods, and capabilities of foreign intelligence threats. In addition, the Department will review the precise appli\u00ad cation of existing policies and guidelines addressing these threats, particularly when foreign powers conduct activities in previ\u00ad ously atypical areas. The basis of the foreign counterintelli\u00ad gence program is the analysis of reliable human source information and timely information derived through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Gaining such information will require strengthening cross-program sharing of information and expertise; improving surveillance capabili\u00ad ties; and developing new technologies, including improved information manage\u00ad ment systems, to keep pace with the rapid\u00ad ly changing foreign intelligence threats. The Department will improve its capacity to evaluate and anticipate threats posed by the intelligence activities of foreign powers. An increased emphasis on predictive analysis should produce operational intelli\u00ad gence products of broader scope and improved timeliness, as well as long-range strategic studies addressing the intelligence collection plans, methods, intentions, capa\u00ad bilities, and personnel of foreign powers. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS National Security List. The Department, in coordination with other elements of the intelligence community, engages in long- range analysis to identify and counter emerging threats. Foreign intelligence threats are investigated under the National Security List, which includes two cate\u00ad gories of threats: country threats and issue threats. The categories were established to focus investigative efforts on activities which are detrimental to U.S. interests, and to provide sufficient resources to maximize efforts against those that are the most sig\u00ad nificant. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.18 CHAPTER II GOAL I Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security Strategic Partnerships. Leveraging the jurisdiction and expertise of other mem\u00ad bers of the intelligence community through working groups and task forces provides an effectiveness and efficiency not present in any one agency. The widespread use of this technique brings instantaneous infor- mation-sharing and synergy to better counter hostile intelligence activities. Domain Knowledge. There has been a renewed emphasis to systematically and thoroughly understand the U.S. targets identified by foreign intelligence services, in order to deter their intelligence collec\u00ad tion efforts. The breadth of intelligence activities targeting economic and propri\u00ad etary information has necessitated a com\u00ad prehensive program to ensure all potential targets are aware of and understand how to combat the threat. MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE Effectively Managing Counterterrorism Resources. In recent years, the threat of ter\u00ad rorist attacks against the United States has increased. Despite substantial funding for anti-terrorism programs and activities Governmentwide, there may remain potential funding gaps (or duplication of service between state and local govern\u00ad ments). Additionally, clear linkages need to be established between DOJ threat analysis and the development of a national anti-ter- rorism strategy. A recent audit by the Inspector General found that funds dis\u00ad seminated to state, local and non- Department of Justice federal agencies were particularly at risk due to lack of over\u00ad sight. The Department will meet the manage\u00ad ment challenge by ensuring accountability in all its programs, especially its counterterror\u00ad ism efforts. FY 2008 O UTCOME GOAL There will be NO terrorist acts com\u00ad mitted by foreign nationals against U.S. interests within U.S. borders.

Goal Two reflects that cycle, encompassing the activi\u00ad employees are responsible for investigating crimes, but for litigators who prosecute cycle, and those who otherwise protect America's legal interests in the courtroom. Goal Two covers the broad area that has reflects the Department's concern with violent dren. It reflects the Department's resolve to combat crimes committed with firearms, explosives, and fire, particularly when these are committed by organizations bent on vio\u00ad lent exploitation of others.

It describes tating effects on their victims and society as a geting of threats to the Constitution and indi\u00ad viduals' civil rights, whether through crimes of hate or human trafficking. Finally, Goal Two describes the role of chief litigator, representing the United States Government in court, enforcing fed\u00ad those protecting civil rights, safeguarding the environment, preserving a competitive market structure, defending the public fisc against unwarranted claims, and preserv\u00ad ing the integrity of the Nation's bankruptcy FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People The Justice components that share responsibility for this strategic goal include the U.S. Attorneys; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); the U.S. Trustee Program, and the Civil, Criminal, Antitrust, Environment, and Tax Divisions. Strategic Objective 2.1 Reduce the threat, incidence, and prevalence of violent crime, includ\u00ad ing crimes against children This objective outlines the Department's strategies in reducing violent crime, partic\u00ad ularly violent crime involving the illegal use of guns, explosives, fire, organized criminal enterprises, and illegal trafficking of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco products. Increasing the quality and number of gun crime prosecutions, both federally and at the state level, is an established priority of the Department. ATF is committed to improving our law enforcement response to gun violence and to assisting communities in addressing evolving violent crime problems through Project Safe Neighborhoods and its Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy. Enhanced enforcement of gun laws across the Nation, including ATF's regulation of the firearms industry, is a means to achieving a reduction in gun violence. Moreover, it sends a clear message to anyone who illegally uses or possesses a gun that there is a unified effort at all levels of government to bring armed vio\u00adlent offenders to justice. Besides guns, another means for acts of violence by terrorists and organized criminal enterprises is explosives. The Department is committed to protecting the public from the criminal use of explosives through investigations and the effective regu\u00ad lation of the explosives industry by ATF. Organized criminal enterprises, often associated with violence, consist of both traditional and non-traditional crime groups. While the traditional groups oper\u00ad ate with a hierarchical organization, the non-traditional groups have a looser, but evolving, structure. Traditional organized crime syndicates, such as La Cosa Nostra (LCN), focus on making money through illegal activities, including various racket\u00ad eering crimes, such as narcotics trafficking, fraud, money laundering, extortion, gam\u00ad bling, arson, counterfeiting, and prostitu\u00ad tion. Syndicates such as these maintain and enforce power through murder and intimi\u00ad dation. The threat they pose to American socie\u00ad ty is two-fold. First is the sheer amount of criminal activity they generate, ranging from drug trafficking to theft, loan-shark- ing, white collar schemes, and labor and management racketeering. According to law enforcement estimates, annual losses attributable to them are estimated to be more than $100 billion, much of which is passed on to consumers in higher prices for goods and services. Second is their ability to corrupt public, labor union, and business officials. It is this ability that is one of the defining factors separating \"organized FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.24 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People crime\" from violent street gangs and other criminal activity. Corruption provides pro\u00ad tection for the organization, shields its leadership from prosecutions, and creates a circle of self-perpetuating criminal activity. Non-traditional organized crime groups from Russia, Eastern Europe, Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and many other parts of the world have begun to operate effectively and very dangerously in the United States. These groups have flour\u00ad ished in the drug underworld and have employed violent means to establish them\u00ad selves. They are not as firmly established as the domestic traditional organized crime syndicates, although some of them have emulated the LCN in the way they have structured their operations. Mounting evi\u00ad dence shows that terrorists and organized criminal enterprises are funding their oper\u00ad ations through the illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products. Members of domestic and ethnic street gangs frequently engage in drug trafficking activities and often use firearms in the com\u00ad mission of their crimes. These violent gangs are taking over parts of cities, flooding streets with drugs, and terrorizing and killing inno\u00ad cent people. An emerging problem is gangs comprised of older, more experienced and hardened criminals that have formed net\u00ad works with counterparts across the Nation. These gangs are more violent than their pred\u00ad ecessors and their criminal activities are far more sophisticated. Violent street gangs often engage in gun trafficking in order to raise money as well as fortify gang members. In order to obtain firearms, gang members engage in rob\u00ad beries, home invasions, and other acts of violence. Gang members acquire false identification in order to purchase firearms. Additionally, gang members recruit associ\u00ad ates without criminal records to travel interstate for the purpose of purchasing firearms, using the proceeds from drug trafficking, robberies, and other criminal activity. In a recent survey on gang activities conducted by the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC), 85 percent of the law enforcement agencies responding reported that gangs were active within their jurisdiction. These reporting agencies identified more than 13,700 gangs and 750,000 gang members. According to the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Association National Threat Assessment published in February 2000, there are more than 30,000 gangs and 800,000 gang mem\u00ad bers. While gang membership is difficult to estimate, experts agree that the numbers are much higher than they were a decade ago. Among the disturbing trends noted in the survey is the increase in the possession of guns by gang members. Despite the fact that the incidence of gun violence has declined and federal prosecutions for firearms offenses have increased, violence stemming from the illegal use of guns FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.25 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People remains a serious concern. Although the Brady Act has been effective in denying the sale of guns to more than 500,000 felons, fugitives, and other persons prohibited from possessing firearms, all too often guns are in the wrong hands. Every day in the United States, 93 people die of gunshot wounds either accidentally or intentionally inflicted. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Reduce violence stemming from the illegal use of guns in each of the 94 federal judicial districts In May 2001, the President and Attorney General announced Project Safe Neighborhoods, a nationwide commitment to r educe gun crime in America by networking existing local pro\u00adgrams that target gun crime and providing those programs with additional tools nec\u00ad essary to be successful. The effectiveness of Project Safe Neighborhoods is based on the ability of federal, state, and local agencies to cooperate in a unified offensive that is guided by the United States Attorney in each of the 94 federal judicial districts across America. Through intensive collabo\u00ad ration with federal, state, and local law enforcement, each United States Attorney is implementing the five core elements, described below, of Project Safe Neighborhoods. The elements are being contoured to fit the specific gun crime problems in a given district. To comple\u00ad ment the efforts of local gun crimes units, the Department of Justice has created a Firearms Enforcement Assistance Team composed of prosecutors, agents, and ana\u00ad lysts experienced in each of the five core elements of this initiative. This team stands ready to assist in the field as needed to con\u00adsult, advise, and prosecute in districts with problems. The goal is to create safer neigh\u00ad borhoods by reducing gun violence and sustaining the reduction. 1. Partnerships. This initiative requires every United States Attorney to coordi\u00ad nate all gun-related programs at the fed\u00ad eral, state, and local law level within the district. Each United States Attorney has established a task force consisting of fed\u00ad eral and local officials to review and pre\u00ad pare gun cases for prosecution in the most appropriate forum. Good exam\u00ad ples of strong, coordinated partnerships exist nationwide, from Boston, Massachusetts, to Portland, Oregon, to Memphis, Tennessee. The success of these programs is based largely upon the strength of the partnership estab\u00ad lished between federal and local law enforcement and prosecutors. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.26 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People 2. Strategic Plan. Of vital importance to the success of any law enforcement part\u00ad nership is the development of strategic plans to attack gun violence. The strate\u00ad gic plans, like the specific gun violence problems, will vary from one communi\u00ad ty to another. In one area, an aggressive plan to target violent gangs may be appropriate, while in another area, a plan to target illegal gun possessors may be more effective. Although the means may differ, the goal is the same: 4. Outreach. Community outreach and public awareness constitute essential components of any successful gun vio\u00ad lence reduction plan. By conveying the priorities, message, and results of this enhanced enforcement effort to the media and community members, the United States Attorney can help shape the attitudes of law abiding citizens and those who would otherwise believe they can violate gun laws with impunity. to reduce gun violence. Strategic networks have been established with new or existing coalitions within each community with the goal of encouraging 3. Training.

This will help to assess our progress and to instill accountability into our enforcement efforts. The Department is committing substan\u00ad tial resources to the Project Safe Neighbor\u00ad hoods: more than $900 million over its first three years. The funding has been used to hire new federal and state prosecutors, to support investigators, provide training, and develop and promote community out\u00ad reach efforts. With respect to organized gun traffick\u00ad ing, ATF will identify trafficking patterns from its crime gun trace data and will tar\u00ad get and investigate the traffickers as part of its Integrated Violence Reduction Strategy. The FBI, through its Safe Streets Task Forces, targets the organized acquisition, transportation, and distribution of firearms by violent street gang enterprises. This is designed to supplement the arsenal of investigative tools used by task force inves\u00ad tigators to target criminal enterprises. T arget specific organized criminal enterprises to eliminate their power and influence in America The Department will continue to identi\u00ad fy, penetrate, and dismantle major criminal enterprises so that real progress is made toward reducing their influence. For well- entrenched international organized crime, our strategy is to identify the most signifi\u00ad cant organizations operating in the United States; identify their structure, hierarchy, and operations; and initiate joint investiga\u00ad tions designed to curtail their emergence. Addressing the threat posed by the Eurasian Criminal Enterprises (ECEs) requires a dual strategy. First, it involves neutralizing the ECEs that have the poten\u00ad tial to engage in complex criminal conspir\u00ad acies that can inflict substantial harm to American economic interests; second, it involves assisting vulnerable foreign gov\u00ad ernments to build their own investigative capacity to reduce the number of places within which ECEs can freely operate, or to prevent these criminal organizations from establishing a foothold in the first place. Our strategy regarding Asian Criminal Enterprises is to concentrate on identifying the most significant groups, their leader\u00ad ship, and their scope and territory of crimi\u00ad nal activity. T arget, investigate, and prosecute the most violent street gangs in our cities and commu\u00ad nities FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.28 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People The FBI will continue to focus its National Gang Strategy (NGS) on major violent domes\u00ad tic street gangs and drug enterprises that pose significant threats to the integrity of American society. Historically, NGS groups have dis\u00ad played the ability to be well-organized, inno\u00ad vative, and extremely violent in protecting and securing the organizations' criminal goals. Coupled with the ability to quickly expand nationally, NGS groups are formidable oppo\u00ad nents of law enforcement. These organizations have a strong foothold in many rural and urban cities across the country, and therefore need to be targeted and/or monitored proac\u00ad tively through joint federal, state, and local investigative initiatives to neutralize future growth. and violent criminal activity by identifying and neutralizing emerging national trends. In responding to the national priorities, the two agencies will identify, prioritize, and target violent street gangs whose activities pose a significant multijurisdictional threat. In areas where no NGS group is present, they will pri\u00ad oritize and target for investigation those vio\u00ad lent street gangs deemed to be the most signif\u00ad icant and criminally active in that region. Prevent the criminal use of explosives through investigations and effective regulation of the explosives industry The ATF will continue to infiltrate, investigate, and seek prosecution for vio\u00ad lent gang members who use firearms in furtherance of their criminal activity. ATF's history of successful investigation and prosecution of Outlaw Motorcycle Organ\u00ad izations, Street Gangs, and Violent Anti\u00ad government Groups, often in partnership with state and local law enforcement, is well established. Violent crime is this Nation's primary pub\u00ad lic safety and Homeland security issue.

FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.29 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People The Department will utilize the inves\u00ad tigative and technical resources of the Bureau of ATF and its training facility at Fort A.P . Hill, Virginia, to provide in-depth training on explosives destruction tech\u00ad niques and post blast investigations to State, local, international and other federal law enforcement agencies to strengthen their ability to respond to terrorist inci\u00ad dents. DOJ will also utilize unique methods and techniques to support State and local preparedness, including the training and deployment of explosives and accelerant detection canines through the ATF Canine Training facility. Provide effective investigative and technical expertise and training to federal, state, and local law enforcement to ensure that arson crimes are solved and to reduce the impact of crimes involving fire on communities Crimes of arson can terrorize communities and result in millions of dollars of property damage each year. The Department will use the investigative resources and technical expertise of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to promote law enforcement readiness and foster innovation where the nature of the fire incident is beyond the investigative jurisdiction or resources of the state and local authorities. The primary resource within ATF for this expertise is its cer\u00ad tified fire investigators, who are agents trained as expert witnesses in fire origin and cause. These agents are the only group of fire origin and cause specialists available within the fed\u00ad eral sector. Prevent the illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products that fund terrorist and criminal activities Recent criminal cases have shown that organized criminal enterprises, including terrorist organizations, are increasingly using the illegal trafficking of alcohol and tobacco products to fund their operations. The Department will devote the effective investigative and technical expertise of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to prevent terrorists and crimi\u00ad nal enterprises from funding their activities by the illegal trafficking of these products. Provide operational enforcement assistance and training to tribal governments The Department will continue to pro\u00ad vide both training and direct investigative and prosecutorial assistance to tribal gov\u00ad ernments. Accordingly, the U. S. Attorneys have designated Assistant U.S. Attorneys as tribal liaisons to work cooperatively with tribal police, prosecutors, and judges. The FBI, which has primary jurisdiction over major crimes committed by or upon FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.30 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People Indians within Indian Country, funds train\u00ad ing, operational expenses, and equipment purchases for Indian Country law enforce\u00ad ment efforts. Through its Office of Indian Country Investigations, the FBI assists tribes in the investigation of violent crimes committed in Indian Country. In addition, the Bureau provides a large share of the forensic exams for FBI Indian Country investigations, either directly through its own laboratory or by funding non-FBI labs. United States are accurately represented to our international law enforcement partners. In order for many foreign countries to cooperate more effectively with the U.S. in the investigation and prosecution of vio\u00ad lent and organized crime, DOJ will contin\u00ad ue to provide development assistance to countries with weak criminal justice insti\u00ad tutions. This involves supporting the enact\u00ad ment of more comprehensive laws and strengthening police, prosecution, court, and correctional institutions to enable them to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate those Promote increased cooperation with foreign who commit violent and organized crime law enforcement authorities within their borders, and to cooperate with the U.S. and other countries in combating transnational violent and organized crime. The Department will continue to build strategic relationships aimed at aligning international cooperation in the fight against terrorism, violent crime, and organ\u00ad ized crime. These relationships will be strengthened through enhanced interna\u00ad tional liaison, training, and technical assis\u00ad tance. DOJ will also strongly support and expand efforts to use Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties as a means to acquire evidence and other assistance from foreign countries, and continue to pursue the arrest and extradition of fugitives aggressively. Through the U.S. National Central Bureau/International Criminal Police Organ\u00adization (INTERPOL), the Department will communicate and exchange information, as well as process requests for assistance between domestic and foreign law enforce\u00ad ment agencies, in order to elicit effective coop\u00ad eration and ensure that the interests of the Combat crimes against children The criminal victimization of children impacts not only the victims but also their families, community, and society at large. Children, because of their legal and social vulnerabilities, may be victimized in a vari\u00ad ety of ways involving physical and sexual abuse. Many of the individuals who prey on children are not first-time offenders, but rather serial offenders who target children as a matter of preference and who may have traveled interstate during the com\u00ad mission of multiple criminal offenses. Because of these vulnerabilities and the potential for long-term harm caused by this victimization, society demands that chil\u00ad dren receive appropriate protection. A rapid and effective response to crimes against children (CAC) incidents could lit- FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.31 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People erally mean life or death for a victim. Primary areas of the FBI's investigation of CAC involve kidnaping and non-family child abductions; domestic and internation\u00ad al parental kidnaping; sexual exploitation of children; and sexual or physical abuse of a minor on a Government reservation. The Department will continue to pro\u00ad vide leadership and technical assistance to ensure that our nationwide ability to respond quickly and effectively to crimes against children is strengthened. The Department has initiated several major programs to combat crimes against chil\u00ad dren, undertaking efforts in close coopera\u00ad tion with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. For example, the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) system now allows state and local law enforcement agencies to \"flag\" entries to its computerized system when a child is missing under suspicious circumstances or may be in danger. NCIC promptly relays this information to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a non-federal agency that has done landmark work to help endangered children. The Department also continues to support, coordinate, and manage the National Sex Offender Registry. Additionally, the Department's Criminal Division serves as the legal advisor to the Internet Crime against Children initiative. Task Forces are being funded by a grant pro\u00ad gram from the Office of Justice Programs. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS INTERPOL Notice Programs. Criminal activity has become increasingly more global in scope. Similarly, criminals are more likely to travel internationally to elude arrest. Through the U.S. National Central Bureau/INTERPOL, the Department administers a system of inter\u00ad national lookout/advisory notices to assist law enforcement authorities in INTERPOL's 181 member countries in locating and, when appropriate, arresting for the purpose of extra\u00ad dition, fugitives wanted for violent and other types of crimes. Strategic Objective 2.2 Reduce the threat, trafficking, use, and related violence of illegal drugs The devastating impact of drug traffick\u00ad ing and the use of illegal drugs is amply illustrated by figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC estimated that 19,102 peo\u00ad ple (an average of 52 per day) died in 1999 FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.32 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People as the direct result of drug-induced causes. Additionally, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) in March 2003 reported that the total economic cost to society stemming from illegal drug use in 2000 was an estimated $160.7 billion, a 57 percent increase from 1992. That economic figure included costs from unnecessary health care, crime, and lost productivity resulting from substance abuse. Illicit drug use hurts families, businesses, and neigh\u00ad borhoods; impedes education; and chokes the criminal justice, health, and social serv\u00ad ice systems. Three and one-half million Americans are chronic drug users and over one-half million drug-related emergencies occur each year in the U.S. Sophisticated foreign-based drug traf\u00ad ficking organizations are responsible for supplying the U.S. with most of its illegal drugs and precursor chemicals for large clandestine laboratories. Trafficking of these drugs and precursors is a significant factor in the crime and violence that occurs in our communities. As a result of exten\u00ad sive and effective law enforcement opera\u00ad tions in the U.S. and the international arena, the operations of many of the notori\u00ad ous Colombian drug trafficking cartels which controlled the illicit drug trade in the 1980s and early 1990s have been signif\u00ad icantly disrupted. Unfortunately, the threats posed by those cartels have been replaced by smaller entrepreneurial drug trafficking organizations based in Colombia, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and elsewhere that transport cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methampheta\u00admine, and other synthetic drugs across the southwest border of the United States. Furthermore, there has been a clear nexus established between narcotics trafficking and designated terrorist organizations. The connection is evident from the actions of sev\u00ad eral organizations, including Al Qaeda, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the United Self-Defense Groups of Colombia (AUC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN). As a result of law enforcement activities in the Caribbean and South Florida, Colombian cartels have formed alliances with Mexican smuggling groups to trans\u00ad ship large loads of cocaine across the Mexico-United States border. The smug\u00ad gling groups have evolved into large scale, sophisticated drug trafficking organiza\u00ad tions which control the drug trade across the 2,000 mile border. Today, approximate\u00ad ly 70 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. is smuggled across the southwest bor\u00ad der. Mexican drug trafficking organizations also engage in substantial acts of violence and public corruption along both sides of the border to support their drug trafficking operations. Law enforcement strategies targeting the organizations that traffic in illicit drugs and precursors must address a variety of smuggling and production efforts: Cocaine, in both powder and crack forms, remains one of the primary drug threats in the United States. Recent sup\u00ad ply availability estimates indicate that FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.33 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People between 260 and 270 pure metric tons of cocaine are currently available to drug users in this country. A majority of the Latin American and Mexican command and control organizations identified on the Attorney General's Consolidated Priority Organization Target (CPOT) list, a unified, multiagency list of the most significant international drug and money laundering organizations, is involved in the large-scale distribution of cocaine. Methamphetamine trafficking and abuse dominates the West Coast and much of the Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions of the country. Mexican trafficking groups predominately facilitate the domestic pro\u00ad duction and wholesale distribution of methamphetamine. \"Super labs\" (laborato\u00ad ries capable of producing in excess of 10 pounds of methamphetamine in one 24\u00ad hour production cycle) are concentrated in Western U.S., but increasing numbers have been established in the Midwest. The street availability of methamphetamine in 2001 was estimated at between 110 and 140 met\u00ad ric tons. The northern border is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the smuggling of Canadian pseudoephedrine - metham- phetamine's precursor agent - by Middle Eastern criminal organizations. In the U.S., methamphetamine is transported through\u00ad out the country via private vehicle or trac- tor-trailer over well-established cocaine, marijuana, and heroin distribution routes. Heroin is a major drug threat facing the Nation and remains widely available throughout the U.S., especially in major metropolitan areas. An estimated 13 to 18 metric tons was available for use in America in 2001. Heroin's availability stems from four major areas: South America, Mexico, Southeast Asia, and Southwest Asia. Predominant in the U.S. are South American Colombian heroin, particularly east of the Mississippi, and Mexican heroin west of the Mississippi. A significant quantity of heroin is smuggled across the southwest border by couriers who use commercial airlines or vehicles. Maritime ports are also used as points of entry. Marijuana is the most available illicit drug in the United States. Recent esti\u00admates indicate that between 10,200 and 24,900 pure metric tons of marijuana are available in the country. The demand for marijuana far exceeds that for any other illicit drug, and the size of the American user population equates to steady prof\u00ad its for traffickers. The availability and popularity of the drug r enders it a signif\u00ad icant threat to the health and safety of the Nation. The indoor and outdoor cultiva\u00ad tion of cannabis in most regions of the country and importation from foreign sources contributes to the pervasiveness of the drug. Both the DEA and epidemiology reports identify methylene dioxy methampheta\u00ad mine (MDMA), ketamine, and gamma hydroxybutiric as significant threats. MDMA (popularly known as \"Ecstasy\"), a synthetic drug with both FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.34 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People stimulant and hallucinogenic properties, is one of the club drugs that has become popular among teens and young adults at dance clubs and all-night parties called \"raves.\" A 2002 national high school survey found that 10.5 percent of high school seniors had used MDMA in the past year. Most MDMA tablets are produced in Western Europe - chiefly the Netherlands and Belgium - and traf\u00ad ficked to the U.S. by air and other meth\u00ad ods. Whereas seizures of MDMA by Customs and DEA were under one mil\u00ad lion tablets per year until the late 1990s, mately dismantling them. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Program has been a primary mechanism for bringing together these agen\u00ad cies. The Department also focuses enforce\u00ad ment resources on identifying and eliminating the individual retail-level traffickers who sell drugs on the streets. Over the years, the Department has mounted, and will continue to mount, a comprehensive, multilevel, orga\u00ad nizational attack on the drug trafficking and money laundering organizations that pose the greatest threat.

The Department's drug strategy utilizes the collective talent and expertise of all federal law enforcement agencies to identify and tar\u00ad get the most significant drug supply organiza\u00ad tions and components nationwide, and to attack the financial infrastructure supporting those enterprises, thereby disrupting and ulti\u00adfinanced, and sophisticated criminal organ\u00ad izations that are responsible for importing and distributing most illegal drugs in the United States, the Department has placed renewed emphasis upon comprehensive intelligence-gathering and information- sharing. To this end, we are developing advanced technology systems capable of ingesting and analyzing volumes of inves\u00ad tigative drug and financial data from mul\u00ad tiple sources. This centralized intelligence system enables the Department's drug enforcement components to discover links among disparate drug and money launder- FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.35 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People ing networks operating nationwide, and permits enforcement to target the elimina\u00ad tion of the entire organization, including its suppliers, transporters, and distributors. Such strategic targeting and coordination of national-level drug investigations and prosecutions is accomplished by the DEA-led Special Operations Division (SOD). The SOD is a multiagency national law enforcement entity comprising agents, analysts, and pros\u00ad ecutors from DEA, ATF, FBI, DOJ Criminal Division, NDIC, IRS, and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at DHS. The mission of SOD is to coordinate and support regional, national, and transna\u00ad tional criminal investigations and prosecu\u00ad tions against the major drug trafficking organizations, now called Priority Target Organizations (PTOs), threatening the United States. While SOD continues to focus on the major transnational criminal drug trafficking organizations operating in Colombia and along either side of the U.S.-Mexico land bor\u00ad der, it has extended its efforts to include PTOs in Europe and Asia. To fulfill its mission, the SOD works close\u00ad ly with the Organized Crime Drug Enforce\u00adment Task Force program, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, and U.S. Attorney offices across the country. The SOD performs its mission seamlessly across both investigative agency and district jurisdictional boundaries. The NDIC routine\u00ad ly assists SOD by deploying Document and Computer Exploitation teams in support of the highest priority SOD missions. We expect continued expansion in the accomplishments from SOD with the recent inclusion of the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigative Division and the establishment of a financial investigative section within the division. T arget drug traffickers and their organiza\u00ad tions through OCDETF or equally complex investigations, using asset forfeiture as well as other tools when appropriate, and inves\u00adtigate and prosecute the movement of drug proceeds into, within, and out of the United States The Department's counternarcotics strategy is built around the recognition that the best way to attack sophisticated nar\u00ad cotics trafficking and money laundering organizations and their attendant criminal activity (e.g., corruption, violent crime, organized crime, and tax evasion) is through the use of a coordinated, intera\u00ad gency task force. The Department relies upon the OCDETF Program, with its feder\u00ad al, state, and local partnerships and its focus on coordinated, multiregional inves\u00ad tigations against entire drug networks, as a driving force behind its drug strategy. The OCDETF program combines a wide range FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.36 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People of agency expertise and experience from seven federal law enforcement agencies within the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Treasury, working in concert with the United States Attorneys Offices, the Department's Criminal and Tax Divisions, and state and local counterparts.

Prevent, detect and reduce the illegal diver\u00ad sion of controlled pharmaceuticals while ensuring their adequate supply and avail\u00ad ability for legitimate medical needs Licit controlled pharmaceuticals will always be sought by drug abusers and traf\u00ad ficked by criminals as a substitute for illic- itly-manufactured drugs. Nonetheless, ensuring an adequate, uninterrupted sup\u00ad ply of controlled pharmaceuticals for legit\u00ad imate medical use is of paramount consid\u00ad eration in developing and implementing diversion control strategies. DEA, in part\u00ad nership with state and local authorities, investigates and prosecutes violators of controlled substances laws; enforces these laws pertaining to controlled substances manufacture, distribution and dispensing; ensures compliance with the regulated industry in order to prevent diversion; develops internet investigations as a major deterrent to diversion; and develops and coordinates e-commerce initiatives as a fur\u00ad ther diversion deterrent. Reduce the domestic production of illegal drugs and the illegal diversion of precursor and essential chemicals Precursor and/or essential chemicals are crucial for manufacturing most illicit drugs sold on the streets of the United States. For example, the processes used to refine raw coca into powder cocaine and to produce methamphetamine require a vari\u00ad ety of chemicals. Consequently, chemical control strategies continue to be one of the most effective tools employed against drug traffickers. These strategies offer a means of attacking illicit drug production and dis\u00ad rupting the process before the drugs have entered the market. The Department is sup\u00ad porting several domestic and international initiatives to limit the availability of precur\u00ad sor chemicals to drug traffickers. DEA continues to participate in several international initiatives including: Operation Purple which targets the international move\u00ad ment of potassium permanganate, the drug traffickers' chemical of choice for oxidizing cocaine hydrochloride; Operation Topaz, aimed at international monitoring of acetic anhy\u00addride, a heroin precursor chemical; Operation Seis Fronteras , a DEA chemical enforcement initiative now involving eight countries in South America that targets the diversion of illicit chemicals used in the production of cocaine and heroin; and Project PRISM, an ini\u00ad tiative aimed at assisting governments in developing and implementing operating pro\u00ad cedures to more effectively control and moni\u00ad tor trade in precursors. Domestically, DEA engages in several ini\u00ad tiatives. Operation Velocity supports investiga\u00ad tions of domestic pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine distribution groups and clandestine laboratory operators. Equally important, the Department, along with DEA and the Department of State, is working with Canadian authorities to develop stronger pre- FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.38 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People cursor regulations which would prevent illicit shipments of pseudoephedrine from entering the U.S. from Canada. These illicit shipments of pseudoephedrine are a critical factor in the production of methamphetamine. Also, the Department, through DEA's Domestic Cannabis Eradication and Suppression Program, enhances the ability of federal, state, and local agencies to suppress culti\u00ad vation of marijuana and increase crop destruction. responsible for leading drug law enforcement efforts in the international arena. DEA also supports Sensitive Investigative Units (SIUs) in ten countries. These units are composed of carefully screened host nation law enforce\u00ad ment personnel who operate and function under DEA's guidance. One of the most criti\u00ad cal international programs, SIU's have been instrumental in disrupting and dismantling the most significant international drug traf\u00ad ficking organizations. Finally, the Department participates in the ONDCP-funded National Methamphetamine Chemical Initiative, a multiagency working group consisting of representatives from the DEA, FBI, USAOs, NDIC, and state and local law enforcement officials. Representatives of this working group collaborate in the produc\u00ad tion and dissemination of timely information bulletins focusing on emerging trends related to the production and distribution of metham\u00ad phetamine. The Department's Bilateral Case Initiative, which began when the DOJ and Colombian law enforcement conducted unprecedented investigation and prosecution efforts against the most significant traffickers in Colombia, has now expanded to other countries in the region. In the past two years, more than twen\u00ad ty high-level foreign traffickers have been charged under this initiative, including Colombian narcoterrorists and numerous CPOT targets.

DEA continues to explore future additions to the working group such as the National Narcotics Control Commission, People's Republic of China. Additionally, the NDIC has trained Her Majesty's Customs and Excise on the use of RAID (Real\u00ad time Analytical Intelligence Database) and docu\u00ad ment exploitation and, at the request of the Department of State, is providing the same train\u00ad ing to law enforcement personnel in Mexico. DOJ also helps build effective international partners through programs such as Plan Colombia, which provides assistance to Colombia in developing special investigation units, training personnel, and enhancing its forensics capacity to investigate and prosecute major drug traffickers. In its leadership role, DEA administers annual specialized training programs to sup\u00adport International Law Enforcement Academies. In addition, the agency provides basic and specialized drug law enforcement seminars to foreign narcotic counterparts via the Department of State International Narco\u00ad tics Law Enforcement Affairs. DEA also facili\u00ad tates several conferences, including the International Drug Enforcement Conference, which brings together senior-level interna\u00ad tional law enforcement officers from over 50 countries to discuss high-level drug enforce\u00ad ment issues. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Organized Crime Strike Force Units. The Department maintains Organized Crime Strike Force Units in 23 USAOs, staffed by Assistant U.S. Attorneys who are dedicated exclusively to prosecuting LCN/Italian, Eurasian, and Asian organized crime cases. These offices have liaison with representatives of various federal investigative agencies as well as some state and local law enforcement agencies. To ensure that the program is coor\u00ad dinated from a national point of view, the Strike Force Units operate under general oper\u00ad ational supervision and oversight of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division. OCDETF. The DOJ is responsible for the administration of the OCDETF Program, which includes organizations within the Department of Justice (ATF, DEA, Criminal Division, FBI, Tax Division, USMS, and U.S. Attorneys), as well as other federal law enforcement organizations (ICE, IRS, and the U.S. Coast Guard), and state and local law enforcement agencies. Its purpose is to reduce the drug supply by pursuing complex inter\u00ad national or multiregional investigations of high-level drug trafficking or money launder\u00ad ing enterprises. The OCDETF Executive Office and the National High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Director's Office work collab\u00ad oratively to target these organizations. HIDTAs. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 authorized the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, to designate areas of the United States which exhibit serious drug traf\u00ad ficking problems as High Density Drug Trafficking Areas. The HIDTA program FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.40 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People improves the efficiency and effectiveness of drug control efforts by facilitating coopera\u00ad tion among federal, state, and local law enforcement and demand reduction agen\u00ad cies. Since 1990, 31 areas within the United States have been designated as HIDTAs. High Intensity Financial Crimes Areas (HIFCAs). The Departments of Justice and the Treasury have designated the first seven HIFCAs, where high concentrations of money laundering and other related financial crimes exist, and will coordinate federal, state, and local law enforcement resources to identify and target money laundering within the designated areas. NDIC's technology programs-such as upgrading the RAID database to provide cross-case analysis and internationaliza\u00ad tion, as well as NDIC's tive to improve computer exploitation-will enhance law enforcement's ability to process, analyze, and share information. Furthermore, the NDIC cooperates with, supports, and co-produces joint assess\u00ad ments with the intelligence components of the HIDTA and OCDETF task forces, the DEA, FBI, and the SOD; it also conducts a quarterly multi-agency training course for the benefit of federal, state, and local law enforcement and intelligence personnel.

NDIC Threat Assessments and Intelligence sharing. NDIC produces strategic intelligence products that provide policy makers with timely information relating to the supply and demand of illicit drugs in the United States. Examples of these products are the annual National Drug Threat Assessment, state and regional assessments, information bulletins, the annual Arrival Zone Threat Assessment, and the Maritime Drug Threat Assessment. NDIC fosters information-sharing among fed\u00ad eral, state, and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies through its National Drug Intelligence Library, and by distributing the Counternarcotics Publication Quarterly. cal drug-related intelligence. The coordina\u00ad tion services provided by EPIC are infor- mation-based and draw on the expertise of staff from multiple federal agencies. EPIC supports U.S. law enforcement and inter\u00ad diction components through the timely analysis and dissemination of intelligence on illicit drugs. It also provides an around- the-clock mechanism for real-time dissemi\u00ad nation of all-source database information in support of domestic and international tactical law enforcement operations. Asset Forfeiture Program. The Department's Asset Forfeiture Program (AFP) is a nation\u00ad wide law enforcement program that continues to be an effective and powerful weapon in the Department's fight against crime. The primary mission of the AFP is to maximize the effec\u00ad tiveness of forfeiture as a deterrent to crime. Illegal organizations - large and small - are enhanced by the profits and proceeds FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.41 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People obtained through such illicit activity. The AFP is committed to destroying criminal organiza\u00ad tions by means of depriving drug traffickers, racketeers, and other criminal syndicates of their ill-gotten proceeds and the instrumental\u00ad ities of their trade. The AFP includes training to educate federal, state, and local forfeiture prosecutors and investigators in ways to enhance the expertise needed to integrate for\u00ad feiture into every appropriate investigation and prosecution. The Department encourages cooperation among law enforcement organi\u00ad zations by sharing the proceeds of a forfeiture with the foreign government or state or local agency that participates in an investigation which results in a forfeiture. Strategic Objective 2.3 Combat white collar crime, eco\u00ad nomic crime, and cybercrime. The Department recognizes that a strong deterrent capability is necessary to prevent criminals from defrauding and, therefore, weakening the Nation's industries and institutions, eroding the trust of the American public. White Collar Crime (WCC) encompasses illegal acts character\u00adized by deceit, concealment, or violations of trust. These acts are generally not depend\u00ad ent on the application or threat of physical force or violence. They are committed by individuals and organizations in order to obtain money, property, and services, or to secure personal or business advantage. WCC has been conservatively estimated to cost the U.S. billions of dollars annually. Precise financial losses resulting from WCC for consumers, government, and business are unknown since no systematic data col\u00ad lection exists. Only periodic case studies of some aspect of white collar crime, such as personal fraud or health care fraud, have been undertaken. For example, a 1995 National Institute of Justice (NIJ) study enti\u00ad tled \"Victimization of Persons by Fraud,\" estimated that annual losses from personal fraud exceeded $40 billion. The NIJ study also found that 31 percent of survey respon\u00ad dents reported being a victim of personal fraud in 1995. A more recent National White Collar Crime Center study published in 2000 found that 36 percent of survey respon\u00ad dents said someone in their household had been a victim of fraud in the past 12 months. White collar crime accounted for approxi\u00ad mately 13 percent of all cases filed by the Department of Justice in Fiscal Year 2000; financial institution fraud accounted for 36 percent in the same year. The true cost of WCC is not always meas\u00ad urable in dollars. The corruption of public officials undermines trust in Government, while ecological crimes, such as the illegal dumping of toxic wastes, can result in FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.42 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People irreparable harm to the environment and endanger public safety. Corporate fraud and some internet fraud schemes, such as market manipulation of certain stocks, can cause massive losses for unwary investors. Other schemes, such as fraudulent online sales of dangerous drugs or bogus medical devices, can create a risk of serious physical harm or death. Unchecked, WCC can have a devas\u00ad tating impact on the Nation's public welfare and economic well-being. The Internet Fraud Complaint Center works to identify and measure internet crime, and a Corporate Fraud Hotline has been established to assist in identifying corporate executives involved in deceptive business practices. It is often noted that just as the internet and other global network computer sys\u00ad tems have transformed the way we con\u00ad duct business, run governments, educate, and communicate, such networks have also provided a powerful new medium in which to commit unlawful acts. The inter\u00ad net provides con artists, extortionists, van\u00ad dals, and other criminals with a formidable tool to commit traditional and new crimes. Because end users are spread across the world, a single scheme through the internet can reach a vastly larger pool of potential victims than was possible a decade ago, at a far lower cost and unprecedented speed. The internet also can provide a veil of anonymity that is difficult or impossible to achieve except in cyberspace. Combating computer crime requires investigators, forensic experts, and prose\u00ad cutors who must all have technical expert\u00ad ise. Unlike law enforcement agents fighting traditional crime, these individuals not only need to know how to investigate or prosecute a crime, but must also have spe\u00ad cialized skills and training in computers and technology. They must be sufficiently conversant with technology to ensure that evidence is not lost or overlooked. Forensic experts need to know how to protect evidence and how to recover, ana\u00adlyze, and protect digital evidence that is often perishable and easily damaged. Prosecutors must know more than stan\u00ad dard evidentiary and procedural rules; they must understand the specialized lan\u00ad guage and other complexities of high-tech- nology crimes and be able to translate the evidence in a manner that is technically accurate, but also understandable to judges and juries. In addition to corruption and cyber\u00ad crime, WCC encompasses other criminal economic schemes which vary in scope and complexity. Some of these are summarized in Table 1. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Bolster the effectiveness of white collar crime investigations and prosecutions by strengthening coordination among domestic and international law enforcement agencies Key Department strategies for addressing WCC are developing partnerships with, and fostering coordination among, domestic and international law enforcement and regulatory agencies.

The Department's Computer Crime and Telecommunications Coordinator (CTC) program, created to address high-technology crimes, has proven to be one of the most effec\u00ad tive prosecutive networks in the country. Designated prosecutors in each of the U.S. Attorney's Offices are specially trained to han\u00ad dle computer crime and intellectual property cases. In FY 2002, there were 190 designated CTCs in the U.S. Attorney's Offices. In addi\u00ad tion, the Department recently created Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) units in 13 U.S Attorney's Offices to supplement the CTC program With the increasing globalization of crime, DOJ will work with its international partners to develop the global infrastruc\u00ad ture - legal, technical, and operational \u00ad necessary to combat criminal activity involving computers, networks, and intel\u00ad lectual property. The Department also con\u00ad tinues to provide training and assistance to federal, state, and local law enforcement. Such assistance has included building vir\u00ad tual and personal networks among law enforcement personnel to facilitate cooper\u00ad ation in the investigation of complex cases. Recognizing that technologies affect public safety, the Department will work with the computer and telecommunications indus\u00ad try to ensure that industry understands the public safety implications of the technology it develops. At the same time, Justice will strive to ensure that law enforcement understands the new technologies that may present threats to public safety. Deter public corruption by increasing its investigation and prosecution One way to reduce future corruption is to vigorously investigate and prosecute current corruption and to seek substantial prison terms for persons convicted of these crimes. Aggressive and effective prosecu\u00ad tions, followed by long sentences, send a clear message that these crimes will not be tolerated and that those engaging in them do so at their peril. The Department intends to increase its efforts against corruption in three ways: first, it will increase awareness of public corruption, of the significant harm it causes, and the interest the Department has in combating it at all levels of government; second, it will make public corruption investigations and prosecutions a top priority; and third, it will increase the number and scope of training events for federal prosecutors and investigators that focus on the handling of corruption investi\u00ad gations and prosecutions. Increase the investigation and prosecution of corporate fraud to restore confidence in the securities economy The Department has adopted the position that the efficiency and effectiveness of securi\u00ad ties markets is substantially enhanced by con\u00ad sistent and successful prosecution of criminal offenses. Working closely with the Securities Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and state regu\u00ad latory entities, the Department has placed an emphasis on investigating allegations of cor\u00ad porate and security fraud. The Department FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.46 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People intends to continue addressing this problem by aggressively pursuing prosecution of cor\u00ad porate executives, employees, or their associ\u00ad ates who deceive public shareholders and/or illegally enrich themselves at the expense of the public. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a recent\u00ad ly enacted law which imposes significant new corporate governance and financial statement reporting obligations on public companies, will significantly deter corporate executives from engaging in corporate fraud in the future. replacing its predecessor, the Economic Crime Council, established in 1983.

That number is expected to increase signif\u00ad icantly as the American and international communities become more aware of its mission and capabilities. Later this year, the IFCC will be renamed as the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) to more accurately reflect its mission. Corporate Fraud Task Force. In response to the corporate fraud scandal, the President instructed the Department to form the Corporate Task Force, whose mission is to reduce and deter corporate fraud by aggressively enforcing the federal criminal laws which outlaw such behavior. Members of the task force include the Deputy Attorney General (Chair), FBI Director, Assistant Attorney Generals of the Department's Criminal and Tax Divisions, several U.S. Attorneys, and several other agency officials. National Health Care Fraud and Abuse Task Force. Consisting of senior officials of the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, as well as state attorney generals and local district attorneys, the task force discusses policy issues and develops directives to member agencies for implementing initiatives to fight common problems affecting federal and state health care programs. President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE/ECIE) is composed of Inspectors General (IG) of various agencies of the Executive Branch. Established by a 1996 Executive Order, the Integrity Committee for the PCIE/ECIE handles criminal allegations against IGs and their senior staffs. Investigative procedures for the Integrity Committee were drafted in 1997 with the assistance of the Department. The procedures provide for coordination with the Department in this sensitive area, including initial DOJ review of allegations for possible criminal prosecution. Asset Forfeiture Program. The Depart- ment's Asset Forfeiture Program is a nationwide law enforcement program that continues to be an effective and powerful weapon in the Department's fight against crime. The primary mission of the program is to maximize the effectiveness of forfei\u00ad ture as a deterrent to crime by depriving the criminals of their ill-gotten proceeds and the instrumentalities of their trade. The Department encourages cooperation between the Federal Government and foreign, state, and local law enforcement by sharing the pro\u00ad ceeds of a forfeiture with the foreign govern\u00ad ment or the state or local law enforcement agency that participates in an investigation that results in a forfeiture.

The Department's jurisdiction to act is triggered by the receipt of a written complaint from a parent or a student alleging that the stu\u00ad dent has been denied equal protection of the laws, or in the cases of public colleges, that the student has been denied admission or not permitted to continue to attend the college on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or religion. In addition, the Department enforces the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, which prohibits discrimination in stu\u00ad dent and faculty assignment, and faculty and staff employment, and requires that states and school districts take appropriate action to overcome students' language bar\u00ad riers that impede equal participation in the instructional program. Furthermore, the Department has enforcement responsibili\u00ad ty, upon receiving a referral from a govern\u00ad ment agency, to enforce several statutes that prohibit recipients of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of race and national origin, sex, and dis\u00ad ability. The Department enforces federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in housing, con\u00ad sumer credit, and public accommodations. The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 substantially expanded the Department's enforcement authority to combat housing dis\u00ad crimination by enabling it for the first time: (1) to initiate cases referred by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), on behalf of individuals who have been discrimi\u00ad nated against; and (2) to seek actual and puni\u00ad tive damages for aggrieved individuals in both the HUD-referred cases and the pattern or practice cases the Department has had authority to bring since 1968. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits discrimination in credit transactions on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or on the basis that an applicant's income is from public assistance. Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, or national ori\u00ad gin in certain public accommodations, such as restaurants, hotels and motels, and places of entertainment. Finally, the Department enforces the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on behalf of people with disabilities to make the promise of equal access to everyday life a reality. Enforcement responsibilities cover a broad spectrum of potential actions to encourage individuals and entities to com\u00ad ply with ADA requirements, including new construction, removal of physical barriers, provision of auxiliary aids, access to employment, and elimination of discrimi\u00ad natory policies.

The Division is also increasing its work with foreign gov\u00ad ernments to combat trafficking, both by training foreign prosecutors and law enforcement officers in handling trafficking cases and in building its contacts with for\u00ad eign officials with whom the Division can collaborate on specific cases. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Generally, the Department's civil rights enforcement and outreach are coordinated with all federal agencies that provide finan\u00ad cial assistance to state, local, and nonprofit agencies, and with the other federal agen\u00ad cies with civil rights enforcement responsi\u00ad bilities (e.g., the Departments of Health and Human Services, HUD, Education, Labor, and Transportation). Coordination includes long-standing working relationships, such as jointly developing policy guidelines and handling enforcement cases, and more short-term task forces to address specific problems. Current task forces and agree\u00ad ments include: Interagency Fair Lending Task Force. The bank regulatory agencies (Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), HUD, and the Department are members of an intera\u00ad gency fair lending task force that meets regu\u00ad larly to consult on fair lending policy and peri\u00ad odically issues joint policy statements. Memorandum of Understanding on Hous\u00ad ing Rights. The Department's Civil Rights Division and HUD have a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure that criminal inter\u00ad ference with housing rights is addressed through the most effective means. HUD refers all forcible interference reports to the Civil Rights Division, which reviews and either pursues or defers back to HUD for further action. This allows instances of provable crim\u00ad inal violations to be addressed through prose\u00ad cution and then processed for civil remedies through HUD. National Task Force on Violence Against Health Care Providers. This task force coor\u00ad dinates the investigation and prosecution of violations of the Freedom of Clinic Entrances Act. The Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and the FBI provide investigators, and the Treasury Department helps to oversee this prosecutorial effort, staffed primarily by prosecutors from DOJ's Civil Rights Division. Memorandum of Understanding on Low- Income Housing Tax Credit Program. The Departments of Justice, Treasury, and HUD have a Memorandum of Understanding to promote enhanced compliance with the Fair Housing Act in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program administered by the Internal Revenue Service.

Together, these Justice components ensure that the Federal Government speaks with one voice with respect to the law. Antitrust The work of the Antitrust Division is broken down into two broad categories, criminal and civil. On the criminal side, antitrust violations are increasingly com\u00ad plex matters including bid-rigging schemes and price fixing cartels that are highly sophisticated, increasingly international, significant for the large volumes of com\u00ad merce involved, and extremely broad in terms of the number of businesses and con\u00ad sumers affected. In civil matters, the Department main\u00ad tains and promotes competitive markets largely by enforcing federal antitrust laws. These laws affect virtually all industries and apply to every phase of business, including manufacturing, transportation, distribution, and marketing. They prohibit a variety of practices that restrain trade, such as mergers likely to reduce the competitive vigor of par\u00ad ticular markets and predatory acts designed to maintain or achieve monopoly power. Successful enforcement of these laws - which both decreases and deters anticompetitive behavior - saves U.S. consumers billions of dollars, allows them to receive goods and services of the highest quality at the lowest price, and enables U.S. businesses to com\u00ad pete on a level playing field nationally and internationally. Several key trends have impact on the Department's antitrust efforts. The first of these is the globalization of trade. The sec\u00ad ond is rapid technological change. The third is deregulation. All three trends have ramifications for the Department's antitrust work and workload. The value of mergers occurring globally is significant, and large cross-border merg\u00aders are no longer an anomaly. In our civil non-merger program, as well, the cases we encounter often have global reach. Whether taking more time to coordinate with foreign antitrust counterparts or expending more money to translate foreign documents, the Department's increasingly common inves\u00ad tigations with international dimensions are significantly more complex than in previ\u00ad ous years. A number of our most important indus\u00ad tries have been characterized recently by unprecedented levels of technological change. The accelerated flow of information means the collection and review of evidence has become more laborious. The greater technological sophistication of the market\u00ad place means the methods to constrain com\u00ad petition have become more sophisticated, as well. New industries are created virtually overnight. The Department must stay on top of all these developments to effectively enforce the antitrust laws. In recent decades, legislative and regulato\u00ad ry changes in the United States have reversed a generation of pervasive Government regula\u00ad tion and have deregulated such basic indus\u00ad tries as telecommunications, energy, financial FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.54 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People services, and transportation.

In addition, Department officials routinely par\u00ad ticipate in interagency task forces related to competition issues. At the international level, Department membership in bodies such as the World Trade Organization provides an oppor\u00ad tunity for the promotion of \"competition\u00ad friendly\" policies and practices. In all cases, our goal remains the deterrence of anticom\u00ad petitive behavior. Guide and educate businesses, consumers, and counterpart agencies about antitrust law to increase their awareness and under\u00ad standing Whether through direct contact and tar\u00ad geted communication with specific audi\u00ad ences, or via the development, publication, and distribution of policy guidance, the Department seeks to increase the breadth and depth of awareness of antitrust law. One example of Departmental activity in this area is our Business Review Program, which provides timely information on antitrust law and how it applies under dif\u00ad ferent situations, along with the likely reac\u00ad tion of the Department to a proposed busi\u00ad ness action or arrangement. Another exam\u00ad ple is tailored training provided to state antitrust attorneys and investigators. In all instances, by reaching as many individuals, companies, agencies, and other groups as possible, and by providing them with detailed and specific guidance on the law, the Department seeks to promote competi\u00ad tive behavior and deter anticompetitive behavior. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAM Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Merger Clearance Process. Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, requires certain enterprises that plan to merge or to enter into acquisition transactions to notify the Department's Antitrust Division and the FTC of their intention, and to submit certain information to those authorities. Once pre-merger notifica\u00ad tion has been made, the Department and the FTC employ a clearance process, based largely on complementary areas of expertise, in order to quickly determine which body will review and/or investigate a particular merger transaction. Following clearance, the trans\u00adaction is reviewed to determine whether there are any competitive issues at stake. Throughout the clearance process the agen\u00ad cies maintain close communication in order to ensure that competitive concerns are addressed efficiently and effectively and that the process is undertaken without unduly burdening legitimate business interests. Environment and Natural R esour ces As the Nation's chief environmental litiga\u00ad tor, the Department enforces federal pollution abatement laws to protect the health and envi\u00ad ronment of the United States and its citizens. DOJ also defends suits challenging environ\u00ad mental and conservation laws, programs, and activities; represents the United States in all matters concerning the protection, use, and development of the Nation's natural resources and public lands; and litigates on behalf of Indian tribes and individual Indians. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.56 In performing these functions, the and waters. In addition, the Department defends development of the Nation's public lands over water quality and watersheds, the management of public lands and natural tive habitats, and land acquisition and exchanges. ships the United States has with Indians Under these authorities, the Federal Government performs a number of func\u00ad tions on behalf of these tribes, including lit\u00ad igating to establish or defend their rights. These suits include establishing water and fishing rights, collecting damages for agencies in litigation and assist in the U.S. Department of Justice 2.57 CHAPTER II Department seeks to obtain redress of past violations that harm the environment, ensure that those who violate criminal statutes are appropriately punished, establish credible deterrents against future violations of these laws, recoup federal funds spent to abate envi\u00ad ronmental contamination, and obtain money to restore or replace natural resources dam\u00ad aged through oil spills or the release of haz\u00ad ardous substances into the environment. We also take action to ensure that the Federal Government receives appropriate royalties and income from activities on public lands challenges to federal environmental and conservation programs and activities by representing the United States in all mat\u00ad ters concerning the protection, use, and and natural resources.

Strategies to Achieve the Objective Pursue civil enforcement cases against those who violate laws that protect public health, the environment, and natural resources The Department will represent federal development of effective enforcement FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People strategies that seek compliance with, and deter violation of, the Nation's environ\u00ad mental enforcement and conservation laws. The Department strives for the fair and consistent application of these laws throughout the country. For example, the Department enforces statutes designed to address the cleanup of hazardous waste sites; the management of hazardous wastes and used oil; the pollu\u00ad tion of surface waters and the integrity of drinking water; the quality of air and the regulation of chemical substances and mix\u00ad tures which present a risk to human health and the environment; the regulation of pes\u00ad ticides; claims that wetlands or other U.S. waters have been filled without required Clean Water Act permits; and the regula\u00ad tion of ocean and coastal water. In these cases, the Department will work to attain economic parity for the vast major\u00adity of law-abiding U.S. businesses by assur\u00ad ing that illegal operators do not gain an economic advantage through noncompli\u00ad ance with the Nation's laws. That this approach has been effective is evidenced by the Department's landmark settlements with more than a dozen refineries through\u00ad out the country that have agreed to reduce air emissions significantly. Additionally, we will maintain the integrity of our Nation's infrastructure and continue to enforce infractions involving pipeline integrity, leaky storage tanks, endangerment from chemical and manufacturing plants, and threats to public drinking water systems. Conserve the Superfund The Superfund law provides funding for the cleanup of contaminated hazardous waste sites and for the reimbursement of cleanup costs by those responsible for the contamination. The Justice Department's recovery litigation returns money to the Superfund that helps to sustain the fund and in turn supports the cleanup of addi\u00ad tional dangerous sites. The Department will place a renewed emphasis on recover\u00ad ing cleanup costs from violators to help ensure the continued availability of the Superfund. Ensure proper payments to the U.S. from income-generating activities on public lands, and pursue claims for natural resource damages It will take enforcement actions to protect endangered species, sensitive habitats, and natural resources in national parks and marine sanctuaries. DOJ will pursue claims for natural resource damages on behalf of federal agen\u00ad cies that act as trustees of those resources, including the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce Departments. The Department will seek claims for contribution against pri\u00ad vate parties for contamination of public lands and recoupment of monies spent by the Coast Guard to clean up oil spills. In carrying out these responsibilities, DOJ will continue to emphasize the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and other litigation-streamlining techniques to FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.58 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People achieve faster, more comprehensive, and more cost-effective resolution of these com\u00ad plex cases. tion initiatives, training, outreach, and domestic and international cooperation and coordination. Investigate and prosecute environmental Defend U.S. interests in suits challenging crimes statutes and agency actions Prosecution remains a cornerstone of the Department's integrated approach to en\u00ad sure broad-based environmental compli\u00ad ance. Notably, it is the goal of investigators and prosecutors to discover and prosecute criminals before there has been substantial damage done to the environment, resulting in serious health effects or economic dam\u00ad age to consumers or honest competitors. The Department enforces criminal statutes designed to punish those who would pollute the Nation's air and water; illegally store, transport and dispose of hazardous wastes; illegally transport haz\u00ad ardous materials; unlawfully deal in ozone- depleting substances; and lie to officials to cover up their criminal conduct. The deterrent effect of criminal enforce\u00ad ment is difficult to measure, but available research indicates that a strong criminal enforcement program deters violations and thereby protects human health, natural resources, endangered species, and the competitive position of legitimate compa\u00ad nies. The Department will enhance its capa\u00ad bility to convict and deter environmental crimes through leading law enforcement initiatives such as the Chlorofluorocarbon Phaseout, vessel pollution, laboratory fraud, and hazardous materials transporta-The Department will continue to represent federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service, in suits challenging the Government's administration of federal envi\u00ad ronmental, conservation, and land manage\u00ad ment laws. The Department also will defend claims arising under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act that a federal agency is a liable party at a Superfund site and so must share in the costs of cleanup. The Department will con\u00ad tinue to represent agencies against allegations that they have taken real property without just compensation, violating the Fifth Amend\u00ad ment. As defense counsel, the Department repre\u00ad sents federal land management agencies in challenges to regulatory and permit activities which impact public lands. The Department will defend decisions to allow oil and gas leas\u00ad ing on public lands, including the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska, along with other actions the land management agencies take in fulfillment of their multiple use mandates. The Department also will defend the management and planning activities of the National Marine Fisheries Service and Fish and Wildlife Service regarding endangered species and habitats. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.59 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People The Department faces a growing caseload in the natural resource areas. Defensive litiga\u00ad tion includes representing U.S. interests in general stream adjudications which affect hundreds of thousands of parties and tens of thousands of water claims in western states; lawsuits over the restoration and management of public lands, waters, and natural resources; wildlife protection; and the acquisition of fed\u00ad eral property. Act in accordance with U.S. trust responsi\u00ad bilities to Indian tribes and individual Indians in litigation involving the interests of Indians The United States has established trust relationships with Indians and Indian tribes through numerous treaties, statutes, and Executive Orders. Under these author\u00ad ities, the Federal Government is obligated to perform a number of functions on behalf of these tribes, including litigating to estab\u00ad lish or defend their rights, as well as pro\u00ad tecting more than 56 million acres of land held in trust by the United States. The Department represents the United States in its trust capacity. This work includes devel\u00ad opment, investigation, and litigation of environmental issues that arise on Indian reservations; and the pursuit of longstand\u00ad ing land and water claims on behalf of Indian tribes. The Department is responsi\u00ad ble for protecting treaty-based hunting and fishing rights. The Department is also charged with protecting tribal regulatory, adjudicatory, and tax jurisdiction, includ\u00ad ing a tribe's sovereignty to exercise jurisdic\u00adtion in domestic relations cases involving tribal members, and to enforce gaming laws and state compacts. Develop partnerships with other federal agencies, state and local governments, and interested parties to maximize environmental compliance and improve natural resource management The Department emphasizes construc\u00ad tive relationships with all involved federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes, and the public. We will continue to make it a priority to work cooperatively with state attorneys general on joint enforcement actions. States are now rou\u00ad tinely given the opportunity to join the Department in enforcement cases and, where appropriate, share in any penalties obtained in settlements. Through Supple\u00ad mental Environmental Projects in civil cases, the public harmed by an illegal activ\u00ad ity can be assisted in recovery. Also, Department attorneys have created a potential model for resolving future dis\u00ad putes among tribes, states, and local gov- FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.60 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People ernments by mediating what is believed to be the first negotiated settlement of a chal\u00ad lenge by a state to an Interior Department decision to accept land into trust status. by non-member Indians within the bound\u00adaries of a reservation.

Those activities consist principally of: Enforcement of the Nation's criminal tax laws; Representation of the United States in federal civil tax litigation in all state and federal trial courts, except the United States Tax Court; and Representation of the United States in all federal civil tax litigation in the fed\u00ad eral circuit courts of appeals and in the state appellate courts. Criminal Tax Enforcement. Each year, noncompliance with the federal tax laws costs the Government hundreds of billions of dollars. The Tax Division, either on its own or in concert with United States Attorneys' offices, prosecutes a wide vari\u00ad ety of tax crimes, including: Tax evasion on income earned through legal sources; Tax evasion using domestic trusts and other abusive tax shelters; Defrauding the IRS by promoting frivo\u00adlous \"tax protest\" theories; Secreting assets in foreign countries to evade tax liability; and Tax violations with respect to proceeds of drug violations or fraud. Civil Tax Enforcement. The Tax Divi- sion's civil trial work covers a broad spec\u00ad trum of litigation in the federal district and bankruptcy courts, the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the state courts. The work has profound effects on tax administration. Decisions in the Tax Divi-sion's civil cases create precedents that can govern millions of taxpayers. One favor\u00ad able decision can resonate far beyond the parties directly involved and lead to bil\u00ad lions of dollars in additional tax collections. Much of the Division's civil caseload involves defending the United States in lit\u00adigation brought by others, including: Tax refund suits brought by taxpayers to recover payments made toward con\u00ad tested federal tax liabilities; Bankruptcy litigation raising issues con\u00ad cerning the validity, dischargeability, and priority of federal tax claims and the fea\u00ad sibility of business reorganizations; Suits challenging IRS determinations made following \"collection due process\" proceedings; Damages suits stemming from tax assessment or collection activity by IRS and other Government officials; and Suits against the IRS under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The Tax Division also represents the United States as plaintiff in a panoply of FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.62 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People actions vital to efficient tax administration The Division also concentrates on sever- and effective tax enforcement, including: al other areas of noncompliance. For exam\u00ad ple, it focuses on prosecuting promoters of sham trusts and other illegal schemes Suits to enforce IRS administrative designed to avoid taxes; illegal tax protes\u00ad summonses seeking information tors who engage in tax evasion schemes essential to determine and collect fed\u00ad eral tax liabilities; Suits to enforce tax liens and IRS levies, including suits to set aside fraudulent conveyances and to enforce tax liens on assets held by nominees or alter egos; and Suits to establish the immunity of the and those who harass IRS employees; and taxpayers who use tax haven and other off\u00ad shore countries to evade United States taxes. The Department's tax lawyers also investigate and prosecute tax violations occurring in the course of other criminal conduct, such as narcotics trafficking (sup\u00ad porting the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force), corporate fraud, Federal Government and its instru\u00adsecurities fraud, bankruptcy fraud, health mentalities from state and local taxes. care fraud, organized crime, public corrup\u00ad tion, and terrorism. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Focus civil enforcement efforts to promote Identify, investigate and prosecute tax tax compliance fraud In addition to its continuing work pros\u00ad ecuting a wide variety of tax crimes, the Division has launched a series of new ini\u00ad tiatives to deter noncompliance and help ease the burden of noncompliance on law- abiding taxpayers who pay their fair share of taxes. The Division has redoubled efforts to address tax crime involving income from a legal source-such as the consultant who The Tax Division's primary strategy to reduce the tax gap is to litigate, both defen\u00ad sively and affirmatively, federal civil tax cases filed by and against taxpayers in the federal courts. Through this litigation, the Division ensures that the tax laws are prop\u00ad erly enforced, often targeting particularly acute tax enforcement problems that threaten to seriously undermine tax admin\u00ad istration. reports only part of his income, the restau\u00ad rant owner who skims from the cash regis-As part of its representation of the ter, or the doctor who keeps two sets of Government in the courts, the Tax Division bookkeeping records.

This independence, backed by a willingness to engage in aggressive litigation where appropriate, ensures collection of taxes owed, while also serving as a check against potential abuses in tax administration. Combat the abuse of tax shelters The Tax Division combats complex and abusive corporate and individual tax shel\u00ad ters, which cost the Treasury an estimated $10 billion annually. As the Government's representative in court in tax refund suits and other cases involving these shelters, the Tax Division is instrumental in shutting the shelters down. The stakes in these cases - which regularly involve millions of dol\u00ad lars in tax revenue with respect to the par\u00ad ties in suit and implicate billions more with respect to other shelter purchasers - are often enormous. The Division has also successfully obtained orders enforcing IRS administra\u00adtive summonses issued to several major professional services firms believed to pro\u00ad mote these shelters and continues to pur\u00ad sue similar orders in ongoing litigation. These orders will assist the IRS in gathering information concerning the promotion of these shelters, help the IRS identify pur\u00ad chasers of the shelters, and enable the IRS to determine whether these firms have complied with the shelter-registration and shelter-investor list maintenance require\u00ad ments imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Combat tax schemes, scams, and protest Over the last several years, the Division has sued to enjoin dozens of tax-scheme promoters who cost the Treasury billions of dollars each year by providing bogus tax advice (e.g., tax credit for slavery repara\u00ad tions or income earned within United States not subject to federal taxation) over the internet and in the media, and has obtained court orders shutting down sever\u00ad al multimillion dollar schemes. In a complementary effort, the Tax Division's prosecutors have obtained numerous indictments and convictions against abusive scheme promoters in cases involving hundreds of millions of dollars in evaded taxes. The Tax Division also deals with the fallout from the promotions, defending the Government in the hundreds of new cases brought each year that involve frivolous tax-protest claims, many of them the same claims targeted through the Division's injunction suits. Vigorous and successful defense of these cases is essential to preserve public confidence in the tax sys\u00ad tem and to ensure that honest taxpayers are not discouraged from voluntarily paying their taxes by the perception that those who engage in illegal tax-protest activity have \"gotten away with it.\" Pursue tax collections and offshore tax evasion The Tax Division frequently files suits to collect revenue, deter illegal activity, and FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.64 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People address systematic noncompliance with the tax laws, including suits: (1) to reduce to judgment tax, penalty, and interest assess\u00ad ments made by the IRS; (2) to void fraudulent transfers made by delinquent taxpayers to place their assets out of the reach of the IRS; and (3) to enforce federal tax liens on these and other assets. The Division also represents the Government in more complex, tax-relat- ed bankruptcy matters, many of which have significant collection potential. The Tax Division also conducts defensive litigation vital to the protection of the IRS agents and officers engaged in tax assessment and collection activity. Specifically, the Division vigorously defends these agents and officers, and the Government itself, against spurious damages suits arising out of that activity. Absent representation of the quality provided by the Division, these suits could cripple or seriously impair effective tax collec\u00ad tion and enforcement. The Division targets particularly serious KEY CROSSCUTTING ACTIVITIES collection enforcement problems. In this regard, as part of an IRS initiative aimed at Joint Task Forces.

The Tax Division is represented on the Domestic Terrorism Task Force chaired by the Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section of the Criminal Division, and Tax Division prose\u00ad cutors investigate and prosecute domestic groups that funnel money to international terrorists. Training Revenue Agents to Detect Tax Evasion Schemes. As part of its effort to stop abusive tax scheme promotions, Tax Division attorneys regularly give training presentations to IRS revenue agents and other IRS personnel across the country to educate them about how to develop evi\u00ad dence that will support a suit to shut down a promotion at its source - the promoters and salesmen. These presentations have led to an increase in injunction suits filed by the Department to halt tax evasion promo\u00ad tions on the internet and elsewhere. Using Parallel Civil and Criminal Proceedings to Stop Tax Evasion Schemes. As part of the same effort, select Tax Division personnel have participated in a joint IRS/DOJ task force to explore the coordinated use of both civil and criminal tools to stop abusive tax scheme promo\u00ad tions. Protecting Federal Instrumentalities from State and Local Taxation. The Tax Division represents numerous other federal departments, agencies, and instrumentali\u00ad ties in cases involving the immunity of the Federal Government from state and local taxation. Although these representations often culminate in litigation, the Division has had great success in heading off much litigation through pre-litigation consulta\u00ad tions with appropriate state and local offi\u00ad cials. Civil Law The Department, through its Civil Division and the U.S. Attorneys, each year represents some 200 federal agencies, the U.S. Congress, and the public treasury in litigation arising from federal contracts or alleged Government misconduct. The Division also defends challenges to the laws, policies, and programs of the United States, in particular, those which support the Department's top priority, the war on terrorism. The Department has experienced a sub\u00ad stantial increase in civil litigation targeting the coordinated response to the September 11 attacks and legal challenges to the Admin- istration's counterterrorism policies. Civil attorneys defend against challenges to the constitutionality of counterterrorism laws, FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.66 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People such as the USA PATRIOT Act, and protect Presidential war powers. Other landmark cases deal with access to immigration hear\u00ad ings in \"special interest\" cases and defend the holding of detainees in Guantanamo Bay and New York. By upholding the Secretary of State's designations of foreign terrorist organizations and defending the subsequent freeze on their assets, DOJ effectively strips such groups of their abili\u00ad ty to fund terrorism. Most civil suits handled by the Department are defensive in posture and have huge sums of money at risk. Plaintiffs advancing contract claims, allegations of negligence, claims of patent infringement, and the like seek to assign liability to the Government. Most significant has been the emergence of a variety of class actions chal\u00ad lenging the Federal Government's actions, such as the handling of Indian Trust Funds, loan-making by farm credit programs, and employment practices. At the same time, Department attorneys are defending mas\u00ad sive suits alleging breach of contract in defense procurement, in nuclear waste dis\u00ad posal, and in the savings and loan industry. It is the Department's job to ensure that only meritorious claims are paid. The laws, programs, and policies of the United States are often attacked in court. Recent litigation involves some of the most probing issues of our time. Examples include the Children's Internet Protection Act, inclusion of the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, use of marijuana for medical purposes, assisted suicide, and \"reverse\" discrimination. Unlike the major\u00adity of civil suits handled by the Department which involve monetary claims, these law\u00ad suits seek remedies that can affect vital aspects of our society and governance - for example, how we respond to terrorism and poverty or the President's authority to wage war. Other lawsuits take aim at various pro\u00ad visions of our entitlement programs such as Medicare and Food Stamps, and can profoundly affect federal expenditures. Reforms embodied in the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 generated broad class actions seeking millions of dollars in increased fed\u00ad eral aid. Any health care reform legislation enacted in the next few years will also be a fertile area for litigation. Likewise, efforts to reform the Social Security Administra- tion's $58 billion disability benefits pro\u00ad gram during the next few years will launch numerous substantial broad-based chal\u00ad lenges. Through the implementation of special\u00ad ized tort compensation systems, the Department has improved access to justice for the Nation's citizens, leading to more efficient and effective resolution of dis\u00ad putes in the areas of occupational disease and vaccine injury. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) created an alternative to traditional prod\u00ad uct liability and medical malpractice litiga\u00ad tion for persons alleging injury from vacci\u00ad nations. Under the NVICP , individuals meeting the statutory criteria are compen\u00ad sated fairly and quickly, and non-meritori- ous cases are successfully defended, there\u00ad by preserving program funds for those FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.67 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People who are truly entitled to them. Some $1.5 billion in vaccine compensation has been awarded since 1988. Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), indi\u00ad viduals whose health was put at risk to serve the national security interests of the United States are provided an effective, efficient, non-adversarial forum in which to seek redress. Individuals who contracted certain diseases as a result of their exposure to radiation released during nuclear weapons tests or in the mining, milling, or transport of uranium ore have received over $650 million in compensation since 1992. Every year, thousands of aliens go to federal court to oppose orders of detention, expulsion, or exclusion. This immigration caseload increased seven-fold between 1995 and 2002 and shows no sign of abat\u00ad ing. The phenomenal increase coincides with intensified enforcement efforts and the emergence of new laws. This caseload has taken on increased importance within the war on terrorism. Hundreds of millions of dollars are lost to the U.S. Treasury each year as a result of procurement fraud, health care fraud, loan defaults, and bankruptcies. These losses reduce resources vital to a host of federally- funded programs, including Medicare. More than $11 billion has been recovered in civil fraud cases since the False Claims Act was amended in 1986, including $6.7 bil\u00ad lion in health care fraud. Today's docket includes a number of matters that are mas\u00ad sive with respect to potential recoveries, the size of evidentiary collections, and the com\u00adplexity of issues that underscore the Government's case. As our adversaries enlist the help of top law firms and con\u00ad sultants, substantial Government resources are required to achieve favorable settle\u00ad ments and judgments on behalf of the United States and victims of crime. Finally, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, and the Federal Trade Commis\u00ad sion Act pose threats to the health and safe\u00ad ty of millions of Americans. When such violations involve major patterns of fraud, illegal conduct, and unfair credit and mar\u00ad keting practices, the Department pursues civil and criminal actions to stop and deter such activity. Success in these cases protects consumers from dangerous or worthless products and exploitive practices. Litigation is often hotly contested, reflect\u00ad ing the very high stakes at issue. For exam\u00ad ple, major drug manufacturers challenge the Food and Drug Administration's approval of generic versions of some of the most widely used name-brand drugs. Success in these cases fosters the control of health care costs. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Vigorously defend the Nation's counterter\u00ad rorism measures when challenged in court The successful defense of counterterrorism cases is an essential element in the ongoing efforts to investigate the September 11 attacks and to prevent future attacks. Effective defense FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.68 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People of the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress, such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, enables the Federal Government to use the full power of these laws. Other litigation supports efforts to freeze terrorist assets, a crit\u00ad ical aspect in dismantling the complex, global financial networks that support terrorism. Administer the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 is an unprecedented example of the generosity and compassion of the American people in responding collectively to the tragedy and horror of September 11. The Act is a unique attempt to reach out to those in need - physically injured victims and families of deceased American citizens and foreign nationals who happened to be in the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, or on the air\u00ad planes on that fateful day. The program works to assure that all eligible claimants receive and order. Many of these civil lawsuits compensation from the American people as threaten the war on terrorism, our national an expression of their sorrow for the deaths security, public safety, or affect how size- and injuries which occurred on September 11. able portions of the federal budget are spent.

Such defensive FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.69 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People litigation requires the diligence of Department staff who fight for and guard the financial interests of the United States at trial, at the set\u00ad tlement table, and at the highest levels of judi\u00ad cial review, asserting the Government's inter\u00ad est in major disputes as they proceed through appellate stages. Implement civil justice reform initiatives to resolve classes of claims for which traditional litigation has proven ineffective The Department must defend against thousands of plaintiff claims alleging Government neglect or wrongful conduct. Such suits usually involve massive discov\u00ad ery requirements, protracted trial sched\u00ad ules, arcane subject matter, and substantial stakes. When traditional litigation has proven ineffective, Congress has created specialized programs (e.g., National Child\u00ad hood Vaccine Injury Act, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund). When appropriate, the Department must continue to evaluate cases to deter\u00ad mine whether they will benefit from use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and, if necessary, engage in such processes to expedite case resolution and reduce costs. Defend immigration laws and policies, as well as class action suits or immigration judg\u00adments involving individuals The Department's heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement has spurred a rise in its immigration caseload. Litigation ranges from constitutional challenges to immigration laws, to class action suits against critical features of the Nation's counterterrorism strategy, to individual challenges to federal enforcement actions. Recover monies owed to the United States and victims as a result of fraud, loan default, and bankruptcy The Department protects the public fisc through a variety of affirmative litigation actions to fight fraud, loan default, and bankruptcy, focusing on matters involving widespread fraud and the potential for sub\u00ad stantial recoveries. We investigate allega\u00ad tions brought forth by \"whistle-blowers\" and, where appropriate, pursue recoveries and civil penalties available under the False Claims Act. The Department emphasizes health care fraud enforcement through col\u00ad laborative efforts with other federal and state agencies to recover the billions of dol\u00ad lars lost from Medicare and other federally- funded programs. The Department also actively pursues collection of federal and non-federal restitution and criminal fines. Enforce consumer protection laws by seeking civil and criminal penalties available under existing statutes The Department will pursue cases involving fraud perpetrated by manufac\u00ad turers and distributors of misbranded, adulterated, or defective consumer prod\u00ad ucts - as well as unfair business practices. Activity will be concentrated on matters involving consumer law violations which pose the greatest potential threat to the public. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.70 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Civil Cases Involving the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. The Civil Division will continue to work closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in handling cases filed under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. Managers at the respective agencies coordinate matters of policy, budget, case processing, and strategy. At the trial level, medical staff at HHS assist the Department in developing medical evi\u00ad dence and providing expert witness sup\u00ad port. In conjunction with the Office of Special Masters at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, HHS and the Department have striven to ensure just decisions in the thou\u00ad sands of cases filed since the inception of the program in 1988. In the United States, federal bankruptcy law allows individuals, businesses, corpo\u00adrations, farmers, and municipalities to file bankruptcy. Filing bankruptcy provides relief from debts owed to creditors through the liquidation of assets, wage-earner repayment plans, or business reorganiza\u00ad tions. Since 1996, bankruptcy filings in America have increased at a significant rate. In FY 1996, total bankruptcy filings processed by the UST were 1,060,679. By FY 2002, total filings had increased to 1,470,348. This represents a 39 percent increase in the last six years with the great\u00ad est growth attributed to individual filings. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Enforce compliance with federal bankruptcy laws and take civil actions against parties who abuse the law or seek to defraud the bankruptcy system Strategic Objective 2.6 Protect the integrity and ensure the effective operation of the Nation's bankruptcy system The Department, through the U.S. Trustee Program (UST), oversees and administers bankruptcy cases and combats bankruptcy fraud. The UST works to ensure that cases are administered prompt\u00ad ly, effectively, and in accordance with the law. Expeditious administration of bank\u00ad ruptcy cases is critical to the integrity of the bankruptcy system and the maximum dis\u00ad tribution of funds to creditors. The Program has shifted its focus in response to public concern regarding abuse of the bankruptcy system. UST is more vig\u00ad orously combating fraud and abuse through the use of civil enforcement reme\u00ad dies. The focus is on identifying and obtaining civil remedies for debtor abuse, as well as providing consumer protection to debtors who are victimized by attorneys and others who prey upon those in dire financial straits. Common actions include dismissal of cases for \"substantial abuse\" (typically, because a debtor has demon\u00ad strated an ability to pay debts); denial of discharge for the concealment of assets; and the disgorgement of fees, fines, and FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.71 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People injunctive relief against attorneys or non\u00ad professionals who defraud debtors (e.g., \"credit doctors\" or mortgage assistance operations). In the first six months of FY 2003, the Program took more than 22,000 civil enforcement actions yielding more than $225 million in debts not discharged, fines, and other remedies. Pursue violations of federal criminal laws pertaining to bankruptcy by identifying, evaluating, referring, and providing inves\u00ad tigative and prosecutorial support of cases The integrity of the bankruptcy system depends upon debtors to report honestly and accurately all their assets and liabilities when they file for bankruptcy protection. Such disclosure is necessary to resolve dis\u00ad putes and to distribute money and proper\u00ad ty. The U.S. Trustees have an affirmative duty to refer instances of possible criminal conduct by debtors and third parties to the U.S. Attorney and to assist in prosecutions. The bankruptcy system needs a strong impetus to encourage honest, lawful behavior. Moreover, criminal referrals from the Program show that bankruptcy crimes are often linked to other white collar crimes, such as fraud in obtaining federally guaranteed mortgage loans, money laun\u00ad dering, identity theft, mail fraud, and wire fraud. In the first six months of FY 2003, the Program made more than 450 criminal referrals to U.S. Attorneys. Promote the effectiveness of the bankruptcy system by appointing and regulating private trustees who administer bankruptcy cases expeditiously and maximize the return to creditors The U.S. Trustee appoints and regulates private trustees who administer cases filed under Chapters 7, 12, and 13. In FY 2001, trustees distributed more than $5.3 billion. The U.S. Trustee monitors the activities of these private trustees to ensure they handle cases effectively and efficiently. This entails maximizing the recovery of assets, prompt\u00ad ly administering cases, accurately distribut\u00ad ing funds to creditors, and conducting themselves in accordance with high fiduci\u00ad ary standards. The Program trains trustees and evaluates their overall performance, reviews their financial operations, ensures the effective administration of estate assets, and intervenes to prevent loss of estate assets when instances of embezzlement, mismanagement, or other improper activi\u00ad ty are uncovered. Ensure financial accountability, compliance with the Bankruptcy Code, and prompt dis\u00ad position of Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases Even though Chapter 11 filings repre\u00ad sent less than one percent of all bankruptcy filings, they generally require urgent atten\u00ad tion and ongoing oversight. The Program prescribes financial reporting require\u00ad ments, questions debtor representatives under oath, and evaluates prospects for successful reorganization. U.S. Trustees promptly file a motion either to dismiss or convert a case if the debtor is not complying FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.72 CHAPTER II GOAL II Enforce Federal Laws and Represent the Rights and Interests of the American People with the Bankruptcy Code or is unable to reorganize. The role of the U.S. Trustee is especially important in smaller Chapter 11 cases in which creditors lack a financial stake to participate actively. The goal of the U.S. Trustee is to ensure Chapter 11 debtors com\u00ad ply with the law, and move promptly to resolve their financial difficulties and confirm a plan of reorganization. In addition, the Program has addressed many complex Chapter 11 filings by large corporations that have billions of dollars in assets and liabilities, and employ large num\u00ad bers of workers. Novel legal issues that require intensive scrutiny by Program staff often arise in these cases including review of professional fees in order to prevent dissipa\u00ad tion of the bankruptcy estate. Electronic Case Filing. Another crosscut\u00ad ting program is electronic case filing, which resulted from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts' (AOUSC) requirement that all cases be electronically filed nationwide. The AOUSC developed the Case Manage- ment/Electronic Case Filing (ECF) System, which allows attorneys to file petitions and other electronic documents with designat\u00ad ed Courts through the internet using a standard web browser. ECF is a major DOJ initiative, since all litigating components will be required to use it. The USTP's need for ECF access is greatest among DOJ com\u00ad ponents due to its administrative role in moving cases efficiently through the bank\u00ad ruptcy system. The USTP is involved in every case and does not have the discretion to decline them. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS FY 2008 O UTCOME GOALS National Bankruptcy Fraud Working Group. By FY 2008, the Department will: The UST plays a leading role in the National Bankruptcy Fraud Working Group (NBFWG), comprised of U.S. Attorneys' Offices, DOJ Criminal Division, FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Trade Commission, the Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, and other agencies.

Within OJP , the programs administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) provide grant resources, a comprehensive range of training and technical assistance services, and leadership to help communities more effec\u00ad tively administer justice. Annually, OJP manages a portfolio of hundreds of programs and projects worth billions of dollars. It provides these resources to stakeholders through a mix of formula and discretionary grant programs. Additionally, OJP offers comprehensive training and technical assistance opportu\u00ad nities and sponsors the required research and statistical activities needed to educate and inform a broad base of stakeholders, including the federal, state, and local crim\u00ad inal and juvenile justice community, pri\u00ad vate and nonprofit organizations, and the general public. Through its initiatives, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services promotes harmony between the citizens of a community and the law enforcement offi\u00ad cers who patrol their neighborhoods. Created as a result of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the mission of COPS is to advance commu\u00ad nity policing in jurisdictions of all sizes across the country. COPS provides grants to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire and train community polic\u00ad ing professionals, acquire and deploy cut-ting-edge crime-fighting technologies, and develop and test innovative policing strate\u00ad gies. COPS-funded training helps advance community policing at all levels of law enforcement - from line officers to law enforcement executives - as well as others in the criminal justice field. The Community Relations Service is the Department's \"peacemaker\" for community conflicts and tensions arising from differ\u00ad ences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only federal agency dedicated to assist state and local units of government, private and public organizations, and com\u00ad munity groups with preventing and resolv\u00ad ing racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony. Objective 3.1: Improve the crime fighting and criminal justice system capabilities of state, tribal, and local govern\u00ad ments The Department of Justice supports the notion that the most effective way for the Federal Government to impact local crime is through building partnerships and providing resources and leadership to encourage inno\u00ad vation and collaboration. The ultimate goal, from a federal perspective, is to assist local agencies and communities in building and sustaining capacity. Through its partnerships, OJP leverages the human and financial resources necessary to develop, operate, and FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.78 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or evaluate a myriad of criminal and juvenile justice programs. OJP has lead responsibility for provid\u00ad ing assistance to the problems of youth crime and victimization. By statute, OJP provides leadership, conducts research, and provides financial and other assistance to state, local, and tribal governments to improve their juvenile justice systems and implement effective enforcement and pre\u00ad vention programs. OJP provides support in this area through its formula and discre\u00ad tionary resources, training and technical assistance, research, and statistics. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Provide resources to states, tribes, and local jurisdictions to enhance law enforcement efforts OJP's formula funds to states assist in car\u00ad rying out programs that offer a high probabil\u00ad ity of improving the functioning of the crimi\u00ad nal justice system, with a special emphasis on drug and violent crime control strategies. Recipients of funding direct the funds received to one or more of the 28 program pur\u00ad pose areas. OJP also supports improvements in local criminal justice systems (i.e. supports law enforcement hiring, training, and equip\u00ad ment procurement; school safety enhance\u00ad ment; case adjudication enhancement; and the establishment of task forces and crime preven\u00ad tion programs). An example of OJP efforts to provide resources to states, local jurisdictions, and Reduce Crime and Violence tribes to enhance law enforcement efforts is in the area of DNA technology which has played an increasingly vital role in ensur\u00ad ing accuracy and fairness in the criminal justice system. OJP's Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Initiative, a col\u00ad laboration with federal partners, calls for a 5-year federal initiative to fortify state lab\u00ad oratory infrastructure and reduce the exist\u00ad ing backlogs. As a result of this initiative, states will be in a better position to sustain this critical criminal justice workload with\u00ad out relying on the Federal Government. The initiative also calls for the creation of a National Forensic Science Commission to assess the needs of the forensic science community, and to stimulate public aware ness of and interest in the uses of forensic technology to solve crimes. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.79 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence Provide direct technical support to state, local, and tribal law enforcement The Department provides direct support and technical assistance to state, local, and trib\u00ad al law enforcement agencies in a number of ways. These include ballistic fingerprinting, using ATF's National Integrated Ballistic Imaging Network (NIBIN) to conduct bullet and casing comparisons, and ATF's Fire Research Center for advanced training and support of cause and origin determinations. ATF's Bomb Arson Tracking System (BATS) provides an internet-accessible system that allows law enforcement agencies to share information about bombings, arson cases, and incidents. The FBI conducts fingerprint checks under its Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identi\u00ad fication System (IAFIS), criminal history checks through its National Crime Inform\u00ad ation Center (NCIC), and background checks on prospective firearm purchasers using the National Instant Background Check System (NICS). The Bureau also provides DNA pro- file-matching services through the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), including the Mitochondrial DNA database being created within CODIS. The FBI lab provides a large share of forensic support for Indian Country inves\u00ad tigations. The Indian Country Evidence Task Force, created on June 1, 2000, is com\u00ad posed of FBI Laboratory experts in the dis\u00ad ciplines of DNA, trace evidence, latent fin\u00ad gerprints, and firearms. The Bureau also funds Indian Country examinations con\u00adducted by the Arizona State Crime Laboratory in Phoenix. Facilitate the prosecution and adjudication of federal, state, tribal, and local laws OJP programs under this strategy fund prosecutors and services required to improve the operations of the criminal jus\u00ad tice system and decrease the incidence of violent crime. Multiyear funding of the Community Gun Violence Prosecution and the Project Sentry portions of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) are the key initia\u00ad tives of this strategy. The PSN initiative is based on a deterrence theory of crime reduction. While incarceration will inca\u00ad pacitate convicted gun offenders for some period of time, it is not the primary mecha\u00ad nism expected to lead to a reduction in gun violence. Instead, the enhanced law enforcement sanctions and aggressive com\u00ad munications of PSN enforcement are expected to act as deterrents to the perpe\u00ad tration of such crimes by increasing the risk of apprehension and prosecution, and increasing the certainty and severity of punishment. Another OJP initiative under this strate\u00ad gy encourages states to pass laws enabling the use of closed-circuit televising and videotaping of the testimony of children in criminal proceedings. The initiative assists the courts in establishing procedures for televised testimony in child abuse cases. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.80 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Enhance the human and technological capa\u00ad bility of state, tribes, and local jurisdictions to share information and resources to com\u00ad bat crime In the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Attorney General turned to OJP to provide the leadership to facilitate mak\u00ad ing information-sharing between federal, state, and local agencies more effective, reliable, rapid, and secure. As a result, OJP expanded its Regional Information Sharing System (RISS), a web-based, secure system that allows law enforcement officials to share knowledge and intelligence related to the investigation and prosecution of criminals. It now serves as the backbone for the Department's information-sharing ini\u00ad tiatives with state and local law enforce\u00ad ment agencies. As local law enforcement has taken on a more prominent role in the fight against terrorism, so has RISS. For example, the collaboration between OJP and the FBI led to the connectivity of the FBI's Law Enforcement Online (LEO) system to RISS. The blending of these two systems expand\u00ad ed the reach and scope of the RISS user community and provides a secure conduit for distribution of sensitive but unclassi\u00ad fied Homeland security information. Looking to the future, OJP plans to contin\u00ad ue to expand RISS by linking it to the National Law Enforcement Telecom-muni- cations System (NLETS), expanding the RISS network to nontraditional users such as local hospital and school systems. This Reduce Crime and Violence will facilitate the rapid and secure dissemi\u00ad nation of relevant law enforcement and other public safety information. Finally, the RISS program is supporting the Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX) pilot system. This data mining technology allows local law enforcement to increase and enhance the rapid collection and analysis of terrorist and other criminal activity intelligence and disseminate it securely, efficiently, and timely to other law enforcement agencies throughout the country. The creation of the AMBER Alert Program is a prime example of how a suc\u00ad cessful innovation, conceived and demon\u00ad strated at the local level, can be replicated nationally. OJP's Assistant Attorney General serves as the national coordinator for this initiative, and will oversee the activities targeted toward assisting state and local officials with developing and enhancing AMBER plans, and promoting statewide and regional coordination among plans. Under OJP's leadership, states and communities across the country will be provided training and technical assistance to strengthen the AMBER Alert System and increase the likelihood that abducted children are recovered swiftly and safely. Provide assistance in improving the transi\u00ad tion of ex-offenders back into the communi\u00ad ty, and test alternatives to traditional correc\u00ad tional programs FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.81 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence In an effort to develop alternatives for correctional programs, OJP continues to provide assistance to improve the ability of ex-offenders to transition successfully back into the community through the Serious and Violent Offender Re-entry Initiative. Additionally, OJP manages the develop\u00ad ment of comprehensive approaches to manage sex offenders as they transition back into the community. The strategy and its corresponding programs are designed to assist state and local jurisdictions, includ\u00ad ing probation and parole officials, in man\u00ad aging sex offenders under community supervision. Reduce violent crime in communities while promoting achievement of crime prevention and economic revitalization OJP provides critical technical assistance and training to implement programs that will assist with serious crime problems within a community. Community-based programs work to empower communities in building safer and healthier neighbor\u00ad hoods, and in strengthening social and family ties. OJP will continue to support this community-based strategy because collaborative partnerships among criminal justice agencies, other private and public organizations (e.g., schools, religious cen\u00ad ters, tribal colleges), and residents are rec\u00ad ognized as key in addressing crime preven\u00ad tion and economic revitalization. Encourage community-based approaches to crime and justice at the state and local level through comprehensive and collaborative programs OJP is taking steps to enhance its out\u00ad reach to state and local communities with the establishment of the Community- Capacity Development Office (CCDO). The CCDO will provide robust training and technical assistance opportunities to help communities better help themselves. As envisioned, the existing Weed and Seed strategy will be the flagship program with\u00ad in the CCDO. Weed and Seed seeks to pre\u00ad vent and control violent crime and provide a safe environment in which community residents can live, work, and raise their families. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.82 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or The approach couples intense geographi- cally-targeted law enforcement efforts with community-focused human services pro\u00ad grams and neighborhood improvement initia\u00ad tives. \"Weeding\" includes law enforcement efforts to remove violent offenders, drug traf\u00ad fickers, and other criminals from the target areas. \"Seeding\" includes human services, law enforcement-established prevention pro\u00ad grams, and neighborhood revitalization efforts. Through the CCDO, OJP will build upon the success of Weed and Seed program and expand its collaborative, community- driven approach to reach other criminal jus\u00ad tice, public safety, and victim-related activities. Provide funding, information, training, and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal entities to prevent juvenile delinquency and improve the juvenile justice system OJP provides information, training, and technical assistance to state, local, and trib\u00ad al entities to prevent juvenile delinquency and improve the juvenile justice system. This is accomplished through a funding stream that authorizes formula grants to states to carry out activities under one or more of the 25 eligible program areas designed to prevent juvenile delinquency. In addition, OJP's efforts focus on training and technical assistance activities to pre\u00ad vent, treat, and control juvenile delinquen\u00ad cy and to provide support and funding for the collection, preparation, and dissemina\u00ad tion of useful, scientifically-sound research and evaluation findings. Reduce Crime and Violence Improve the fairness and responsiveness of the juvenile justice system and increase accountability of the juvenile offender OJP continues to support and strives to improve the fairness of the juvenile justice system by providing more effective and responsive services to juveniles in order to increase their accountability in the system. Demonstrate and transfer effective juvenile justice and community-based strategies to prevent delinquency and respond to juvenile justice needs OJP supports state capabilities by fund\u00ad ing units of local governments, Indian trib\u00ad al governments, public and private agen\u00ad cies, organizations, individuals, or combi\u00ad nations thereof, to demonstrate and trans\u00ad fer effective juvenile justice and communi- ty-based strategies. This strategy includes development, testing, and demonstration of promising initiatives and programs for the prevention, control, or reduction of juvenile delinquency. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.83 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence Create and coordinate federal policy and conduct research on juvenile justice and delinquency prevention OJP provides resources necessary to cre\u00ad ate and coordinate federal policy and con\u00ad duct research on juvenile justice and delin\u00ad quency prevention. Recipients are encour\u00ad aged to focus training and technical assis\u00ad tance activities on prevention, treatment, and control of juvenile delinquency. In addition, OJP supports the collection, preparation, and dissemination of useful, scientifically-sound research and evalua\u00ad tion findings. Improve the Grant Management System In order to improve the accountability, reli\u00ad ability, and efficiency of the grant system, the Department has developed and implemented a unified grant application and award system, the Grants Management System (GMS). In addition, the Department continues to work with OMB and Congress to restructure the OJP to flatten its organizational structure, improve its operational efficiency, and improve its accessibility and service to state and local law enforcement, crime victims, and other constituencies. Grant management reform is one of the Attorney General's 10 Management Initiatives, described in Chapter III of this strategic plan. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Department of Interior. All Department of Justice Indian Country initiatives are coor\u00addinated with the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Department of Defense. The Justice Depart\u00adment and the Department of Defense col\u00ad laborate on the deployment of technologies that support both national defense and law enforcement needs. Safe Schools/Healthy Students Program. In this collaborative interagency initiative, the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Education have pooled resources, thereby creating one, unified application process that enables school dis\u00ad tricts to apply for an array of funding to address school violence. Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) Program. Originated in 1992 through a combined effort of ATF and the Phoenix Police Department, the G.R.E.A.T. Program now comprises thou\u00ad sands of law enforcement officers who pro\u00ad vide a wide range of structured communi- ty-based activities and classroom instruc\u00ad tion for school-aged children, with the aim of empowering them to avoid involvement in youth violence, gangs, and criminal activity. Objective 3.2: Break the cycle of illegal drugs and violence through prevention and treatment OJP has long played a role in providing drug-related resources to federal, state, local, FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.84 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or and tribal communities in an effort to break the cycle of drugs and violence by reducing the demand and use of illegal drugs. OJP administers programs that address the prob\u00ad lems of substance abuse-related crime, includ\u00ad ing treatment of offenders with substance abuse problems and their ability to transition back into society. OJP also continues to support and encourage states to adopt comprehensive approaches to substance abuse treatment for offenders, including relapse prevention and transitional services. These services Reduce Crime and Violence involve coordination between the correc\u00ad tional treatment program and other human/social service and rehabilitation programs. Strategy to Achieve the Objective Support and replicate effective and promis\u00ad ing approaches to reduce substance abuse by offenders OJP developed a long-term vision to cre\u00ad ate new drug courts and to improve state and local capacity to enhance and sustain existing drug courts. OJP intends to build capacity at the state and local levels by pro\u00ad viding training, technical assistance, and the resources to support drug courts. Under this strategy OJP will also increase the knowledge and skills of drug court practitioners to plan, implement, and sus\u00ad tain effective drug court programs. Additionally, OJP developed the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment ini\u00adtiative to address the issue of substance abuse dependence and the direct link to public safety, crime, and victimization by providing treatment and services within institutions and communities. OJP pro\u00ad vides funding for this initiative to all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and U.S. Territories. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.85 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Drug-Free Communities Support Program. In conjunction with the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Department provides grants to support community coalitions of youth, parents, media, law enforcement, school officials, religious organizations, and other community representatives. These coali\u00ad tions work to prevent and reduce young peo- ple's illegal use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Joint Substance Abuse Programs. The Department coordinates its substance abuse treatment programs with ONDCP and the HHS Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. Objective 3.3: Uphold the rights of and improve services to America's crime victims, and promote resolution of racial tension One of the major changes in America's response to crime in the last three decades is the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims. In 1984, Congress enacted the Victims of Crime Act, which authorized OJP's establishment of a Crime Victims Fund and a variety of direct service pro\u00ad grams and national-scope training and technical assistance to benefit crime vic\u00ad tims. OJP provides federal leadership in safeguarding the rights of crime victims through the development of policy and funding practices that show promise; mon\u00ad itors compliance with federal victims' rights statutes; and supports public aware\u00adness and education activities intended to promote justice for crime victims. Racial tensions adversely affect local communities, officials, community leaders, private individuals, and businesses. Racial tensions have a lasting effect on communi\u00ad ties and, if left to fester, can lead to more serious conflicts and violence, including major civil disturbances and fatalities. The Department, through the Community Relations Service, has learned through decades of experience that persons directly affected by racial tensions are the best source of solutions for resolving local con\u00ad flicts and for reducing community violence and racial tension. Only through coopera\u00ad tive efforts by police chiefs, local elected officials, and community and business leaders, and only by their combined energy and willingness to promote the resolution of racial tensions, can the different needs and interests of all parties be identified and addressed in a satisfactory manner. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Fund and facilitate payments and compensa\u00ad tion for victims and their survivors Through the Public Safety Officers Benefits program, OJP supports public safety officers by providing a one-time financial benefit to the eligible survivors of officers killed in the line of duty and disability benefits for federal, state, and local public safety officers disabled in the line of duty. In addition, dependents of these officers may be eligible to receive educational support. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.86 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Support appropriate victim services and vic\u00ad timization prevention strategies OJP supports this strategy by awarding resources to state agencies designated by the Governor to administer federal funds for state and community-based victim assistance programs. The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 requires states and territories receiving these funds to spend a minimum of ten percent on certain priority victims: victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse, as well as victims who are underserved. In addition, OJP supports a consortium of prevention, education, and prosecution projects to address the issues of fraudulent telemarketers. The major elements of this program are to: 1) raise awareness of tele\u00ad marketing fraud within the state and local prosecutorial and law enforcement com\u00ad munities; 2) assess needs of states and local communities to prevent and combat tele\u00ad marketing fraud; 3) identify how state and local law enforcement officials can best leverage their resources; and 4) educate consumers about how to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing fraud. Build capacity to improve responses to vic\u00ad tims and increase offender accountability OJP intends to improve responses to vic\u00ad tims and increase offender accountability by providing training and technical assis\u00ad tance to build capacity within communities Reduce Crime and Violence to improve the manner in which courts and the child welfare system manage child abuse cases. Another instance of OJP's building capacity is to provide training and technical assistance to professionals involv\u00ad ed in investigating, prosecuting, and treat\u00ad ing child abuse. In addition, OJP supports the dissemination of information, offers court improvement training programs, and provides technical assistance at the nation\u00ad al and state levels on permanency planning for the purpose of improving dependency courts' handling of child abuse and neglect cases nationwide. OJP also addresses the issue of missing and exploited children by focusing on building an infrastructure to support the national effort to prevent the abduction and exploitation of the Nation's children. OJP provides the only federally-coordinat- ed mechanism for locating and recovering missing children through state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. Assist communities in preventing violence and responding to conflicts that arise from racial and ethnic tension The Community Relations Service will improve and expand its delivery of conflict resolution and violence prevention services to state and local officials and community leaders in the coming years. These services include direct mediation and conciliation; transfer of knowledge and expertise in the establishment of partnerships and formal agreements for locally-derived solutions; FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.87 CHAPTER II GOAL III Assist State, Local, and Tribal Efforts to Prevent or Reduce Crime and Violence development of community trust and coop\u00ad eration; improvement of local preparedness for addressing violence and civil disorders; and assistance in enhancing the local capac\u00ad ity to resolve conflicts. The most significant benefits to state and local communities of CRS's intervention are the cessation of racial violence, restoration of peace in the community, restoration of public trust in the local government and law enforcement, and reduction in the likelihood of recurring violence. Build trust between police and their com\u00ad munities The Office of Community Oriented Policing Service's Police Integrity Init\u00ad iatives meet emerging and changing law enforcement needs by assisting agencies in creating or strengthening local programs that build trust between police and their communities. These efforts culminate in a police-integrity focus that concentrates on the effective use of early warning systems, complaint investigations, use of force poli\u00ad cies, and racial profiling. These efforts help to create community policing environ\u00ad ments that foster trust and mutual respect between police and citizens. Additionally, the COPS Police Integrity Training Initiative delivers training on ethics and significant integrity issues to law enforce\u00ad ment officers and community members through the national network of Regional Community Policing Institute. Support the advance of community policing strategies COPS supports the advancement of community policing strategies by provid\u00ad ing training to enhance law enforcement officers' problem-solving and community- interaction skills; encouraging law enforce\u00ad ment and community members to develop innovative initiatives to prevent crime; sub\u00ad stantially increasing the number of law enforcement officers directly interacting with community members; and supporting the development of new technologies to shift law enforcement's focus to preventing, rather than reacting to, crime and disorder within their communities. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Partnerships and collaboration. The Depart\u00ad ment works with HHS to examine the causes of violence against women and violence with\u00ad in the family, and provides prevention and intervention services for such violence. Activities focused on providing services and assistance to victims of federal crimes are coor\u00ad dinated among Department components (ATF, DEA, FBI, USAs, and Civil Rights Division) and other federal agencies. In implementing its community-based pro\u00adgrams, the Department works closely with all levels of government. At the federal level, these include the Departments of Labor, HHS, Education, and Treasury.

We support the federal courts by pro\u00ad participants in federal court proceedings; providing courtroom security; making sure that persons in custody are escorted to and from proceedings in a safe and secure man\u00ad ner; and apprehending federal fugitives from justice. We also ensure that sentenced criminals are removed from society and housed in prisons that are safe and secure. Finally, we adjudicate immigration cases in a timely manner, ensuring that criminal aliens serving sentences in U.S. prisons are deported upon release, before they become physical threats or economic burdens to the Strategic Objective 4.1 Protect judges, witnesses, and other participants in federal proceedings, and ensure the appearance of crimi\u00adnal defendants for judicial proceed\u00ad ment, ensuring that laws are upheld fairly and that offenders receive just punishment participants who are fearless and unyield\u00ad ing to threats, intimidation, or harassment.

Federal judicial proceedings must be open, secure, and free from obstruction, intimidation, or threat of violence. Security FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System for federal judicial proceedings is provided by the Department through the United States Marshals Service. With the crackdown on terrorism, the work has taken on a dangerous new dimension. As of August 2003, USMS held 66 terrorist defendants in custody and was performing court productions in 19 dis\u00ad tricts. The threat of violence perpetrated upon the courts by terrorists sympathetic to the defendants has led the USMS to pro\u00ad vide heightened facility protection and per\u00ad sonal protective details for judges, prosecu\u00ad tors and other court officials, witnesses and the general public. USMS further mitigates threats by assessing court facilities prior to terrorist court proceedings, evaluating courthouse security plans to identify defi\u00ad ciencies, and responding with security upgrades when needed in USMS-con- trolled areas and cellblock space. The U.S. Marshals Service is also respon\u00ad sible for the safekeeping and transportation of federal prisoners in its custody. This includes the critically important function of providing in-district transportation of pris\u00ad oners for judicial proceedings, legal hear\u00ad ings, meetings with attorneys, and trials, as well as for out-patient medical care and hospitalization when they are required. This function consumes an enormous amount of Deputy U.S. Marshal resources, in that prisoners must be produced in a timely fashion to meet court schedules. In FY 2002, the USMS completed more than 600,000 in-district prisoner productions. In addition to the daily local transportation of prisoners to various legal proceedings and meetings, the USMS uses the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) for long-haul prisoner movements. JPATS was created in 1995 by merging the air transporta\u00ad tion fleets of the USMS and Immigration and Naturalization Service, then part of DOJ. JPATS is responsible for moving federal pris\u00ad oners and detainees in the custody of the USMS or BOP . Strategies to Achieve the Objective Monitor, assess, and investigate threats made against judges, court personnel, witnesses, and victims to stop or deter potential vio\u00ad lence Investigating potential threats of vio\u00ad lence planned against court officials - judges, prosecutors, victims, witnesses, and court support staff - is a critical aspect of FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.94 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the providing security. Because of such threats, security must sometimes be provided both inside and outside the court facility. In 2002, there were 565 inappropriate commu\u00ad nications, which included threats and ver\u00ad bal assaults against judges and other mem\u00ad bers of the court family. The USMS, with the help of other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, must carefully assess each potential threat based on the best intelligence available and respond in a timely and appropriate way. In addition, the USMS provides witness security pro\u00ad tection for Government witnesses and their immediate dependents whose lives are in danger as a result of their testimony against known terrorists and other crimi\u00ad nals who would resort to violence for retal\u00ad iation. Meet court security standards In 2002, the USMS conducted a security survey of prisoner movement space in fed\u00aderal courthouse facilities in the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The survey evaluated each facility against USMS security specifications and requirements. This was the second time the survey was conducted. The first time was in 1999, where survey results indicated that 94 percent of the federal courthouse facili\u00ad ties did not meet minimum security stan\u00ad dards. In the most recent survey it was determined that 81 percent of the federal courthouse facilities did not meet mini\u00ad mum security standards. This represents a Federal Justice System significant improvement in building secu\u00ad rity and was primarily accomplished by consistent funding for renovation construc\u00ad tion. As a key means to improving security of these facilities, USMS continues to reno\u00ad vate U.S. courthouses and court-occupied space in order to bring them up to stan\u00ad dards. At the same time, the USMS works to ensure that court proceedings are ade\u00ad quately staffed. Unfortunately, with prison\u00ad er populations growing throughout the country, the USMS is challenged to main\u00ad tain a high security standard. Along the southwest border in particular, large num\u00ad bers of prisoners have dramatically affect\u00ad ed the ability of Deputy Marshals to pro\u00ad duce defendants. The USMS continues to work closely with the U.S. Courts, the U.S. Attorneys, and other Federal law enforce\u00ad ment agencies to schedule court appear\u00ad ances to allow the USMS to keep pace with the rapidly growing workload. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.95 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Memorandum of Understanding on Court Security. A Memorandum of Understand\u00ad ing (MOU) established in December 1997 between the USMS and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) provides guidelines and procedures to implement the recommendations of the Attorney General's Task Force on Court Security. The MOU defines the USMS court security programs and expresses the terms and conditions under which funds appro\u00ad priated to the judiciary will be transferred to the USMS from AOUSC for use in pro\u00ad viding security to the federal courts. MOUs with other agencies. Providing security in federal court facilities requires coordination among several key federal agencies, each with different jurisdictional responsibilities. The General Services Administration Federal Protective Service is responsible for perimeter security and preventing unwarranted entry into a U.S. courthouse facility. The USMS Judicial Security Systems staff is responsible for security of the interior spaces within a U.S. courthouse facility for which the Judiciary or AOUSC pays rent. The USMS Central Courthouse Management Group is respon\u00ad sible for security of all spaces for which the USMS pays rent, including all prisoner movement and detention areas. The physi\u00ad cal unification of the specified security sys\u00ad tems and devices usually occurs in the USMS command and control centers locat\u00ad ed in the USMS office within the U.S. court\u00adhouse. These agencies are mutually sup\u00ad portive of the mission to provide the prop\u00ad er level of security for a U.S. courthouse as defined in the MOU among them. Strategic Objective 4.2 Ensure the apprehension of fugitives from justice The Department is responsible for enforcing federal warrants and apprehend\u00ad ing fugitives from justice, including escaped federal prisoners; bail jumpers; parole, probation, and supervised release violators; and other fugitives wanted because of complaints or indictments. Additionally, the Department is responsi\u00ad ble for the location and apprehension of fugitives wanted by agencies without power of arrest, and fugitives wanted by foreign countries and believed to be in the United States. The apprehension of fugitives ensures the effective operation of the judicial sys\u00adtem, reduces crime, and improves public safety. Additionally, the aggressive pursuit of fugitives serves as a deterrent for present and future defendants who may attempt to flee. Apprehending fugitives clears crowd\u00ad ed court dockets, ensures that convicted defendants serve their sentences, and pre\u00ad vents fugitives from committing additional crimes. Finally, it ensures that resources expended by other agencies investigating crimes and prosecuting defendants are not wasted. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.96 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Currently there are thousands of fugi\u00ad tives from justice in the Department's area of responsibility. The USMS and the FBI are the two primary agencies within DOJ tasked with fugitive apprehensions. Their relationship and responsibilities are delin\u00ad eated in a joint memorandum of under\u00ad standing. Strategy to Achieve the Objective Focus on apprehending Most Wanted and Major Case fugitives Locating and apprehending the 15 Most Wanted, Major Case, and other violent fugitives are the main priorities of the USMS fugitive program. These fugitives may consist of terrorists and material wit\u00ad nesses to terrorism, along with the worst narcotics traffickers and most violent felons wanted by federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies. USMS participates in 81 federal, state, or local fugitive task forces, and has established four permanent Regional Fugitive Task Forces, all of which are available to support the investigation and capture of suspected terrorists. These fugitives often have lengthy crim\u00ad inal histories and are likely to commit addi\u00adtional crimes if not apprehended in a time\u00ad ly manner. The Presidential Threat Protec\u00ad tion Act of 2000 enabled the USMS to estab\u00ad lish permanent fugitive apprehension task forces in designated regions of the United States. The creation of Regional Fugitive Task Forces (RFTF) enables the USMS to Federal Justice System pool the resources and expertise of other agencies in order to more effectively appre\u00ad hend violent fugitives. These permanent task forces are in addition to the many mul\u00ad tiagency task forces that the USMS coordi\u00ad nates by teaming up with other law enforcement agencies to concentrate appre\u00ad hension efforts on violent fugitive felons and drug offenders. The Department will continue to elicit the public's assistance in fugitive appre\u00adhensions through increased media publici\u00ad ty. Currently, the USMS maintains a Most Wanted list that receives extensive media attention. USMS will continue to maintain its internet web site displaying the most significant fugitives, and participate in national television shows when the oppor\u00ad tunity is available. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Fugitive warrants. During the past decade, the USMS has entered into MOUs with a number of federal law enforcement agen\u00ad cies, which have relegated administrative and investigative responsibility for their fugitive warrants to Marshals. These agen\u00ad cies include the FBI, DEA, organizations within DHS, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Internal Revenue Service, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, vari\u00ad ous Offices of the Inspector General, and others. These MOUs allow the participat\u00ad ing agencies to take advantage of the expe\u00ad rience and expertise of the USMS in fugi\u00ad tive matters, and to free their agents to investigate additional crimes. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.97 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System In addition to these MOUs, the USMS is also a signatory to several others which address information sharing, data match\u00ad ing, and other investigative assistance. For example: The United States Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, runs a periodic data match of USMS fugitives against the USDA list of food stamp recipients nationwide. The Social Security Administration, Office of Inspector General, runs a peri\u00ad odic data match of USMS fugitives against its list of Social Security Supplemental Security Income recipi\u00ad ents. The U.S. Department of State, Office of Consular Affairs, runs a periodic data match of USMS fugitives against pass\u00ad port applicants. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General, runs a periodic data match of USMS fugitives against records of indi\u00ad viduals receiving HUD housing assis\u00ad tance. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, runs a periodic data match of USMS fugitives against records of individuals receiving VA bene\u00ad fits. The Drug Enforcement Administration shares information contained in the USMS Warrant Information Network (WIN) and Electronic Surveillance Unit (ESU) database with the DEA Special Operations Division (SOD). SOD also shares information contained in its indices with the USMS in connection with narcotics-related fugitive investi\u00ad gations. The specifics of this MOU are classified. The United States Secret Service pro\u00advides forensic support and expert tes\u00ad timony by personnel assigned to its Forensic Services Division in connec\u00ad tion with USMS criminal, fugitive, and protective investigations. The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), facilitates DS law enforcement assistance to the USMS in foreign countries in connec\u00ad tion with extraditions, fugitive investi\u00ad gations, and protective assignments. The MOU also describes the USMS role in providing support to DS in con\u00ad nection with protective functions for foreign dignitaries. OCDETF. The USMS participates in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program, where it is responsible for the location and apprehension of most OCDETF fugitives, including the most seri\u00ad ous drug offenders. Fugitive Task Forces. Through its network of 81 interagency fugitive task forces located throughout the United States, including Regional Fugitive Task Forces in New York, California, Chicago, and Atlanta, the USMS assists other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in an effort to locate fugitives wanted for vio lent crime and drug FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.98 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the offenses. These task forces cleared over 30,000 federal, state, and local warrants in 2002. Strategic Objective 4.3 Provide for the safe, secure, and humane confinement of detained persons awaiting trial, and/or sen\u00ad tencing The Department of Justice is responsible for detaining persons charged with violat\u00ad ing federal criminal statutes, provided they have not been released on bond or person\u00ad al recognizance pending disposition of their cases. The USMS houses and main\u00ad tains presentenced detainees in secure facilities from the time they are initially brought into federal custody until they are acquitted, arrive at a designated Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facility to serve a sentence, or are ordered released. BOP assists the USMS by housing some presen\u00ad tenced federal detainees in specified BOP facilities. The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) is responsible for provid\u00ading guidance to and establishing the deten\u00ad tion policy for the Department of Justice. The Federal Detention Trustee has the authority for managing DOJ detention resource allocations. OFDT is also responsi\u00ad ble for the financial management of deten\u00ad tion operations; coordinating with the com\u00ad ponents involved in detention on impor\u00ad tant issues, including implementation of Federal Justice System detention standards; detention planning activities (with input from law enforcement components whose initiatives create the federal detention population); and the implementation of efficiency and effective\u00ad ness improvements in DOJ detention oper\u00ad ations. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Acquire needed capacity through a multi- pronged approach that includes state and local agreements, contracts with private ven\u00ad dors, construction and operation of federal detention facilties, and the use of alterna\u00ad tives to detention The Department acquires detention beds through reimbursable agreements FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.99 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System with state and local governments for the use of their jail space, through contracts with private vendors, and through the con\u00ad struction and operation of federally-man- aged and -maintained detention facilities. DOJ also encourages state and local gov\u00ad ernments to provide bed space for federal use by awarding funds under the Cooperative Agreement Program for jail modifications and renovations. Although the USMS and BOP both use state and local jails to an extent, the USMS traditionally has been the primary user of state and local detention space. In recent years, the ability of the Department to rely on state and local facili\u00ad ties to meet its detention needs has dimin\u00ad ished, as these facilities are increasingly used for non-federal detention require\u00ad ments. With available space diminishing and with prohibitive costs for federal con\u00ad struction in every locale where space is needed, the Department has been facing a severe challenge. Responding to the chal\u00ad lenge, the USMS increasingly has turned to the private sector. For example, in fiscal year 1994, the USMS housed one percent of its population in privately-owned or -oper\u00ad ated facilities; in fiscal year 2002, that rate rose to 20 percent. Use of private detention facilities, how\u00ad ever, raises its own set of issues and chal\u00ad lenges. While there are numerous advan\u00ad tages to the use of private contracts (e.g., reduced start-up/construction time, in\u00ad creased facility locations, etc.), there may also be disadvantages, such as possible increased housing costs, liability issues, and security concerns. Another considera\u00ad tion is the long-term commercial viability of these privately-owned and -operated facilities. In the coming years, the OFDT will examine the role of private sector con\u00ad tractors in the housing and supervision of federal criminal detainees. Improve management of detention resources through more accurate forecasting of deten\u00ad tion needs, better coordination, strengthened oversight, and other means OFDT, USMS, and BOP all rely on accu\u00ad rate population forecasting to project and plan for future resource and bed space needs. Both the OFDT and USMS currently rely on a combination of historical data and information obtained from the field to fore\u00ad cast their populations. They, like the Executive Office for the U.S. Attorneys, have contracted with a private vendor to develop statistical models that incorporate various workload indicators in an effort to develop sounder statistical projections. The Department will build on these efforts to develop a comprehensive model that can project total Department needs based on any given initiative or policy change. Such a model would project the number of USMS detention beds required, as well as the number of Deputy U.S. Marshals need\u00ad ed to manage the projected population. Eventually, these models would provide projections for sentenced prisoners in BOP custody. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.100 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Space Providers. OFDT works cooperative\u00ad ly with the private sector and state and local governments to establish and main\u00ad tain adequate capacity to detain persons in federal custody in cost-effective, safe, secure, and humane facilities that meet all appropriate standards. National Repository. OFDT will establish a national repository for state and local gov\u00adernments and private detention service providers to electronically post vacancies, rates, services, administrative costs, avail\u00ad ability, mode of transport, and medical facilities and services. Detention space and service providers will supply their daily rates, costs, and any applicable service fees, as well as the basis for the calculation of the rates. Those posting vacancies will also be required to list and provide a means for verification of their credentials and accred\u00ad itations. The goal in creating this nation\u00ad wide electronic detention space repository is to enable federal users to find more cost- efficient space where they need it and to provide a means for controlling transporta\u00ad tion costs. Partnership with the Federal Judiciary. OFDT will continue the long-established partnership with the federal judiciary to ensure that adequate funds are available for the courts to place defendants whom the courts would otherwise detain into nonsecure detention settings (e.g., halfway house and home confinement), with an electronic monitoring component. Federal Justice System Strategic Objective 4.4 Maintain and operate the Federal Prison System in a safe, secure, humane, and efficient manner The federal inmate population has been growing rapidly for approximately 15 years. As of July 31, 2003, there were 171,475 inmates in BOP custody, an increase of over 8,000 since September 30, 2002. Most of these inmates were confined in one of the 103 BOP-operated facilities located around the country. Over 26,200 were housed in privately managed institu\u00ad tions, state and local facilities, community corrections centers, or home confinement. At the end of fiscal year 2002, the crowding rate in the Federal Prison System was 33 percent. As of July 31, 2003, crowding had risen to 38 percent. The BOP projects that by 2008 the total inmate population will exceed 207,000 and BOP facilities will expe\u00ad rience a crowding rate of 33%. The rapid inmate population growth is a result of aggressive law enforcement poli\u00ad cies and the imposition of lengthy sen\u00ad tences. The BOP strives to accommodate the increasing population in the most cost effective manner, following a policy of adding capacity through the use of private\u00ad ly operated and other contract facilities, expansion of existing facilities, acquisition of military and other properties for prison use, as well as new construction. The BOP protects the community, keeps institutional crowding at manageable proportions, and FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.101 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System ensures that inmates serve their sentences in a safe, secure, and humane environment. Strategies to Achieve the Objective Manage BOP operations efficiently The BOP strives for the most effective use of resources and efficient delivery of services by placing inmates in the least restrictive correctional environment com\u00ad mensurate with their custody and security needs. Acquire additional capacity through a multi- pronged approach of contracts with private providers of correctional services, with other units of government, and new construction As of July 31, 2003, the BOP housed 18,097 low security inmates, primarily criminal aliens, in privately-operated pris\u00ad ons and state- and locally-operated facili\u00ad ties. The Bureau of Prisons continues to consider property transfers, joint-use con\u00ad tracts, and other cooperative arrangements as a means to maximize prison capacity and meet its goal of reducing systemwide crowding to 33 percent over rated capacity. New construction is one key element in the Department's long-range plan to ensure that the Bureau of Prisons has adequate bed space to keep pace with growth and main\u00ad tain crowding at manageable levels. Four newly-constructed facilities were scheduled for activation during FY 2003. However, as a result of the late passage of that fiscal year's appropriations, only one facility was activated, in April 2003, adding 1280 beds to rated capacity. A work camp at another facility is scheduled to be activated September 2003, adding 128 beds to rated capacity, while the main institution is scheduled for activation in November 2003, adding an additional 960 beds. The two remaining facilities will be activated in FY 2004 and provide an additional 2,048 beds. Seven facilities are scheduled for activation by the end of FY 2004, adding 8,000 beds to rated capacity. Eight more facilities are under construction and scheduled for acti\u00ad vation during FY 2005-2006, which will increase the BOP's rated capacity by over 9,536 beds. Ensure that BOP facilities comply with the standards of the American Correctional Association and all applicable environmental, health, and safety codes and regulations The BOP will prepare all activated facil\u00ad ities for accreditation with the American Correctional Association (ACA). ACA is an independent accrediting authority for cor\u00ad rectional agencies that wish to validate that their correctional management is sound and effective. This program offers the opportunity to evaluate programs and facilities, remedy deficiencies, and upgrade the quality of programs and services. Once accredited, all facilities submit annual statements of continued compliance. At ACA's discretion, a monitoring visit may be conducted during the initial 3-year accreditation period to ensure continued compliance with standards. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.102 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the The BOP also maintains a moderniza\u00ad tion and repair program to ensure that its facilities, 32 of which are over 50 years old, are safe and secure. Included in this pro\u00ad gram are \"life safety\" projects to meet National Fire Code standards. These proj\u00ad ects are given the highest priority. Ensure safety and security A safe and secure institutional environ\u00ad ment for inmates and staff is of fundamen\u00adtal importance. The BOP assigns inmates to institutions according to their security and custody needs, ensures that correctional staff are properly trained and equipped, and has systems in place to minimize vio\u00ad lence and the introduction of drugs in prison facilities. In addition, the BOP con\u00ad ducts routine mock emergency exercises with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. It works closely with both the FBI and the USMS when an escape or emer\u00ad gency situation exists. KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Space Providers. BOP works cooperatively with the private sector and state and local governments to establish and maintain adequate capacity to detain persons in fed\u00ad eral custody in cost effective, safe, secure, and humane facilities. Interagency Cooperation. The BOP must work cooperatively with DOJ agencies, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Courts, U.S. Military, other state and local law enforcement, and numerous private Federal Justice System and not-for-profit organizations to carry out its mission successfully. Strategic Objective 4.5 Provide services and programs to facilitate inmates' successful reinte\u00ad gration into society, consistent with community expectations and stan\u00addards. The BOP provides inmates with basic services (such as clothing, food, and access to health care) and an array of educational, vocational, religious, and other programs. A majority of inmates will return to the community at some point, and thus it is important to provide them the means to increase their chances for successfully re\u00ad entering society as law-abiding and pro\u00ad ductive citizens. Most inmates lack educa\u00ad tion and job skills. Many have a history of drug dependency. Research has shown that inmates who complete at least one educa\u00ad tional course or a residential drug treat\u00ad ment program and those who work in prison industries while incarcerated are less likely to recidivate. For example, inmates who have worked in Federal Prison Industries (FPI) are 24 percent less likely to recidivate than inmates who have not had FPI experience. As of Fiscal year 2002, Federal Prison Industries (whose trade name is UNICOR) provided job skills training and work for more than 21,500 inmates serving sentences in BOP . As a result, providing residential drug treatment and work and education programs is the agency's highest priority. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.103 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the Federal Justice System Strategies to Achieve the Objective Provide work and education programs The BOP requires inmates without a high school diploma or General Education Development (GED) credential (approxi\u00ad mately 40 percent of the total population) to enroll in a literacy program. The imple\u00ad mentation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (VCCLEA) and the Prison Litigation Reform Act mandates that inmates with needs must participate and make satisfactory progress in literacy in order to vest their good conduct time or be eligible to earn the full amount of good conduct time. These two acts have almost tripled the demand for literacy programs since their implementation. The BOP also requires all sentenced, medically able inmates to work. It makes available a vari\u00ad ety of occupational education programs designed to enhance job skills and increase the employability of offenders upon release. In addition, BOP has established a residential prerelease program. Make available residential drug treatment programs for eligible inmates with drug problems Under the VCCLEA, the BOP is required to provide residential drug treatment to all eligible inmates. The residential drug abuse program is designed for inmates with mod\u00ad erate to serious substance abuse problems who are in need of intensive treatment. It provides unit-based living with extensive assessment, treatment planning, and indi\u00ad vidual and group counseling. In addition, BOP provides drug abuse education and non-residential drug abuse counseling services. Provide quality inmate health care services while controlling costs BOP institution health care operations are accredited by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organiza\u00ad tions (JCAHO) which is the accrediting body for health care operations in the com\u00ad munity. The BOP recognizes the value of JCAHO accreditation which confirms that BOP health care professionals are meeting the same standard of care as are the more than 17,000 other JCAHO-accredited health care organizations nationwide. Medical services are provided by a vari\u00ad ety of professional and para-professional health care personnel. If an inmate has a health condition which is beyond the pro\u00ad fessional capability of an institution's or a BOP medical referral center's medical staff, the inmate is referred to an outside physi\u00ad cian or other health care provider, or a hos\u00ad pital in the community. Increasing numbers of federal inmates are requiring medical care, in part because of the general aging of the inmate population. Over the decade, the focus has shifted from acute and sub\u00ad acute needs to chronic and long-term needs. FY 2003-2008 Strategic Plan U.S. Department of Justice 2.104 CHAPTER II GOAL IV Ensure the Fair and Efficient Operation of the KEY CROSSCUTTING PROGRAMS Community Participation. The BOP active\u00ad ly recruits volunteers to assist with reli\u00ad gious and other services, organizes com\u00ad munity service projects, and holds mock job fairs through partnerships with com\u00ad munity groups, public service organiza\u00ad tions, and other agencies. Drug Treatment Providers. The BOP also works closely with and monitors private sector drug treatment service providers to ensure that inmates receive proper after\u00ad care. Federal Agency Partnerships. The BOP contracts with the U.S. Public Health Service for qualified health care personnel. The BOP partners with the Department of Veterans Affairs to utilize its laboratory testing contracts and prime vendor con\u00ad tract for pharmaceuticals. Strategic Objective 4.6 Adjudicate all immigration cases promptly and impartially in accor\u00ad dance with due process The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) provides for the review and adjudication of immigration cases. EOIR's workload is largely determined by the activities and initiatives undertaken by various components of the Department of Homeland Security. EOIR's ability to process cases in a timely fashion directly affects DHS goals to remove criminal or Federal Justice System other removable aliens expeditiously and to use limited detention space efficiently. Strategy to Achieve the Objective Adjudicate priority cases within specified time frames EOIR has identified three adjudication priorities for the immigration courts and has set specific processing time frames for each. The first priority is the adjudication of alien inmates incarcerated in federal, state, and local institutions as a result of convictions for criminal offenses. The aim is to adjudicate these cases prior to the inmate's release from criminal custody so that those found by EOIR to be removable may be removed quickly from the United States by the DHS. The second priority is the adjudication of expedited asylum cases within 180 days. The third priority is the adjudication of cases involving detained aliens (without applications for relief) within 30 days. Similarly, EOIR has established adjudica\u00ad tion priorities for the Board of Immigration Appeals. To ensure efficient use of DHS deten\u00ad tion space, EOIR has established 180 days as its goal for processing appeals for detained aliens. Two other adjudication priorities are based on procedural reforms implemented in 2002. The goals are to adjudicate cases decided by a single Board Member within 90 days of completion of the record of proceedings, and to adjudicate cases decided by a three-mem- ber panel within 180 days of completion of the record of proceedings.
