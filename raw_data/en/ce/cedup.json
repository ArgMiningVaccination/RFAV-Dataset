Patient/family centered care has been adopted throughout the Medical Center in all areas of practice. Actual and deliberate focused work on this approach to care began in 1995 in Children's Hospital. Terrell Smith, RN, MSN, Director, Patient and Family Centered Care lead that successful work which was only one of the many underpinnings of the success of Children's Hospital as we know it today. When Terrell began the work of Patient and Family Centered Care for the adult hospitals and clinics in 2005, it was also the time - Elevat e - and the original 5 Pillars (People, Service, Quality, Growth, and Finance) were introduced as a strategic framework upon which to build our annual goals and measure performance. Acco mplishment of goals supporting patient care initiatives, both by the organization and individual employees would be rewarded and recognized, thus, building a strong culture of de veloping, adapting and evaluating our approach to patient and family centered care. Terrell's leadership in this work involved all levels of nursing and all members of the health care team. Her work with the individual unit/clinic/department councils was instrumental in defining current patient/family focused practices and identifying opportunities for improvement. Over time, the components of the model have evolved as health care has changed and patient care and nursing practice have changed at Vanderbilt. More about the involvement of the patient/family in care planning and delivery is outlined in EP 4. Application of the Model Over time involvement of the patient/family as the focus of care has grown. Examples include: Nurses involving patients and families in interdisciplinary rounds Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 2 Nurses involving patient and families in shift reports The establishment of patient and family Advisory Councils Having a patient/family member as a member of the Quality/Patient Safety Committee Interactive TV System (Skylight) for patient education and improved access to services Nurses giving family members the education/ tools to call for the Rapid Response Team Evaluation of the Model Indicators used for evaluation of the mode l include (each of these are reported on and data is provided throughout the document). Nursing staff are involved in the evaluation processes through their area ba sed board or staff meetings. They also participate in other committees which evaluate our delivery of nursing care. Nursing Sensitive Patient and Quality Indica tor outcomes which include NDNQI as well as organizational and unit specific indicators (Data in OO 23 and examples provided throughout this document) Patient Satisfaction Data - provided by PRC ( Data in 00 26 and data and examples in EP 35 and 35 EO and throughout the document) Nursing Satisfaction data (both NDNQI RN Sa tisfaction and Staff/Faculty Satisfaction Data through HR Solutions) (Data in OO 12 and examples throughout the document) University Health System Consortium 2009 Quality and Accountability Performance Scorecard for Patient Centeredness - ranked number one in the consortium for 2009 [EP1-Exhibit A-1-UHC Ranking ] Patient/family focus groups have also been conducted by nursing leadership. Examples include Women's Services, Vanderbilt Psychi atric Hospital, Vanderbilt Eye Institute, Heart and Vascular Institute. The Executive Chief Nursing Officer regularly attends and participates in the Patient and Family Advisory Council which offers her mont hly, direct interaction with patients and families in an environment conducive to conver sation and reflection on their experience of care at the Medical Center Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 3 Nursing research studies ( Throughout the document and concentrated in NK) Use of resources for evidence-based practice (Throughout the document and concentrated in NK) Involvement of staff in professional activiti es, such as: VPNPP Advancement, achieving certification, taking advantage of tuition reimbursement, participation in Front-line Leadership Program (Information provided in SE, EP 20 and throughout the document) Advancements in integrated technology th at support the practice of professional nursing, such as: quality dashboards, MyHealth at Vanderbilt Adaptation and Modification of the Model \"Patient and Family Engagement\" In their autonomous role as patient advocate s, the direct care nurses are able to access from the many resources available to then what they need to provide patient-centered care. Our current work with the model is around \"p atient and family engagement\". In June, 2010 we had an interdisciplinary Design Shop le d by Terrell Smith RN, MSN, to discuss how we will continue to move forward in \"patient and fa mily engagement\". Staff determined that the engagement of the patient/family in their healthcare is the next step toward safer and improved outcomes. Our goal is to intentionally change how we collaborate with patients and families - to truly make them a member of the interdisciplinary team. Current involvement by patients/familie s through councils, serving on various committees, such as Medical Center Quality Coun cil, new space design, and others is a first step. The questions we are currently trying to address which will advance and possibly change our model include: Clear communication on why patient/fam ily participation and collaboration is important. How to access patient/family read iness to participate/collaborate? How do we really validate and record patients' understanding? How do we involve the patient and family in mutual goal setting? Our work in patient/family engagement is new and developing. Although our patient/family centered care approach has served us well, we believe we will begin to see more Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 4 improvement in patient safety and quality outc omes as we work toward creating a true collaborative relationship with those we serve. [ EP1-Exhibit B-1-Patient & Family Update for CEEC ] In 2009 there were over 54,000 patient visi ts in which the patient had limited English proficiency. From our Nursing Ethics Survey (discussed in EP 23 and NK) , the number one ethical issue was providing care for English langua ge learners. The number four ranked issue on the survey was caring for patients with different cultural and ethnic beliefs about health care. Based on the results of this survey, a clinical-enterprise wide Cultural/Linguistics Council was established to address the many issues of deliv ering patient and family centered care to a diverse patient population. Chaired by the Dire ctor of Patient and Family Centered Care, the Council has community representation, nurses, an interpreter, physicians and an ethicist. Cultural competency training has been incorporat ed into the general orientation of the staff. As we planned for the Critical Care Tower, the practice model (focus on patient/family) influenced the actual design of the building. In addition to thoughtful planning for the patient space and nurse work space in the rooms; dedi cated space was designed into the rooms for increasing family presence and participation. This included sleep space and a bathroom for the family member. Visiting hours are open and a support person can stay in the room 24/7. Evidence based practice was incorporated into the critical care orientation regarding the importance of family presence during hospitalization and the positive clinical effects such as decreased blood pressure, decreased intracranial pressure and a decrea se in fall rates. Shared Governance Development As discussed in SE 1, we have had a shared governance structure at Vanderbilt since the late 1970's. The initial premise of shared gove rnance has not changed as our structures and processes have evolved over the years. Through our shared governance work we are vested in: Involvement Ownership Accountability Openness and honesty Decisions being made close to the work Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 5 We continue to have training and developm ent for the leaders and the staffs who serve as co-chairs of the unit/clinic/department based councils. As new areas open, the Director of Shared Governance works with those areas to ma ke sure shared governance is the base from which they work. Application At the point-of-care level, the inpatient boards are co-chaired by direct care nurses. The majority of the core members of the boards ar e nurses and care partners . However, many of them have other members of the interdisciplin ary team as regular attending members and/or they are invited members when interdisciplinary issues are discussed. Other members of the interdisciplinary team also bring practice issues to the boards. In the clinics and departments where there is a greater ratio of other disciplines as core members of the team, the boards are more inte rdisciplinary from the beginning. This also includes physicians. Evaluation We continuously evaluate our shared governance structure in a number of ways: Results of staff satisfaction surveys Membership/attendance of staff at committees/councils/task forces Attendance at the four entity staff nurse councils CNO breakfast conversations Examining shared governance as part of recruitment/retention structure We also have a more formal process where we assess the strength of shared governance in each of our entities in altern ate years: inpatient in 2009 and 2007 (including VUH, VCH and VPH) and outpatient clinics (V MG, DOT, Franklin) in 2008 and 2006. This evaluation process consists of structured inte rviews with unit/clinic board chairs and their managers. The questions are designed to measure the six essential elements of a shared governance board: Regular meetings Staff member chair Formal agenda Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 6 Consensus decision-making Charter Ground rules We also use the Group Cohesion Scale, a short 6-item survey that reflects feelings of cohesion (e.g. belongingness. The Decisional Involvement Scale (DIS; Havens & Vasey, 2006) measures staff nurses' actual to preferred in volvement in decisions related to the work environment, such as staffing, recruitment, a nd unit governance. These evaluations have been conducted annually since 2004, allowing us to assess change over time. The results of these shared governance assessments are shared/discussed at several points. First, through the Shared Governance Committee, then the Be the Best Steering Committee. (See details in TL) These two groups have the responsibility for broad overview assessment of our shared governance structure across the enterprise. Most importantly, the results are shared with the entity specific lead ership, staff nurse council and unit/clinic. Each unit/clinic receives a targeted report for thei r area that provides a detailed analysis. [ EP1- Exhibit C-1-UB Assess 4E 2009 ] From these results, decisions can be made about targeting resources to work with a specific team. The Director of Shared Govern ance can conduct a more in-depth assessment to determine the exact needs and what educatio n and/or development needs to occur. The ultimate responsibility for keeping shared governan ce on track rests with the entity leadership, managers and staff. The most recent shared gove rnance assessment was in the Fall of 2009 for the inpatient areas. [ EP1-Exhibit D-1-BTB Minutes, UB Assess 2003-09] ] Only one unit surveyed did not have a strong unit board at this time. There had been a leadership turnover and the new leader was getting the unit board structure re-establishe d. Other conclusions are listed below: Unit boards continue to function well with 40% of them having 5/6 essential elements Group cohesion and satisfaction remain high and stable Gaps between actual and preferred decisional involvement remained stable One of the areas for improvement identified in both 2008 and 2009 was the gap in the staff nurses' desire to be involv ed in professional recruitment ac tivities such as interviewing prospective staff nurse candidates. In respon se to this gap, the Nursing Education and Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 7 Professional Development Department negoti ated greater access to Targeted Selection workshops given by Human Resources. This ha s supported a greater number of direct care nurses to complete this trai ning on developing and aski ng interview questions. Adaptation and Modification Each year our physical campus and our sta ff numbers increase and the practice of nursing at Vanderbilt evolves, therefore, we ar e challenged to adapt our shared governance structures and processes to keep pace. We are continuously searching the literature and connecting with like organizations, but most fre quently find ourselves in a pioneering space. During the 2008 Nursing Staff Bylaws Conventi on, the direct care nurse representatives from across the enterprise voted to have 4 separate staff counc ils (one for each entity) as opposed to one staff council for the organization. This came directly from the staffs that were involved in our one staff council and identified a need to have a larger group of \"like\" representatives to discuss \"like\" concerns. Th is change has been a welcome and good one for us. The entity CNOs are part of their respective staff councils. In addition the direct care nurse co-chairs of each council, the entity CNOs and the Executive CNO meet once a quarter for the Nursing Staff Council Cabinet. This is the forum for discussion of entity-wide issues. Communication Challenges We have been faced with the task of how we bring groups together for education, training and shared governance activities when th ey are literally miles apart. Using some of the new technology, such as \"Skype\", private soci al networking avenues, and shared computer drives has proven helpful. Supporting staff a nd leaders in this manner serves more than one purpose; maintaining involvement and decreasing travel time. An excellent example is the LifeFlight staff. LifeFlight has several helicopter bases out in the surrounding communities in order to put them closer to potential patients. Additionally, if when a shift is on duty, rarely would they have the opportunity to \"gather\" for a meeting. They have developed an electronic system for getting unit board business accomplished. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 8 Professional Practice Model Source of Evidence EP 1 Empirical Outcome Describe and demonstrate the result(s) of applyi ng the Professional Practice Model. Include two (2) examples related to nursing practice, collaboration, communication, or professional development activities. As we continue to improve patient access a nd outcomes and decrease costs, application of the Professional Practice Model evolves. As part of our shared governance structure, nursing plays a key role in developing and implementi ng initiatives around patient/family centered care. Back to Patient Focus with Telephone Tria ge Nurses in the Cancer Access Center Purpose/Background: All cancer patients, especially those underg oing active treatment for their disease frequently have issues that arise between their office visits and need to call with questions. Several issues impeded the delivery of patien t centered care and quality outcomes for our cancer patients when they called the Cancer Clin ic. Problems included: timeliness of return of phone calls; appropriate triage of phone calls to the correct provider; varied use of treatment protocols; and continuity of follow-up after phone calls from one provider to another. Another issue for the Cancer Center was pa tient volume. As the only NCI designated Cancer Center in TN and our surrounding service area, our referral base is large. Getting the referring provider to the right place was a challe nge, particularly without multiple transfers and possible loss of calls. Also, community and ou tlying area patients called for information on treatments offered at Vanderbilt and possible rese arch protocols; with the same possibility of being transferred multiple times or having their call dropped. Initially, The Cancer Access Center was de veloped to streamline patient and physician access to: schedule appointments provide convenient, direct communication with referring physicians provide more real time communication for patients/families with nurses Nursing Triage is part of The Cancer Access Center. The goals for nursing triage are to: Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 9 1. Provide consistent management of patient/family concerns 2. Provide improved symptom management A consistent approach is provided through a de dicated team of nurses who use evidence-based protocols to address patient concerns and provide symptom management. One of the key issues in this work is that patients are given a choice and can choose to sp eak to a nurse or not. Another goal was to create consistent docume ntation, using tools that serve to support the 'hand-over' of care from triage nurses to other members of the health care team. Methods: A group of oncology nurses led a team th at worked on the development of triage protocols to be used by the nurses answering pa tient calls. Based on the history of phone calls, knowledge of the most frequent problems canc er patients encounter and collaboration with key physicians; a list of the most common chief complaints was developed. This group started with this list of the most common chief complain ts and developed evidence-based protocols to address them. The list of chief complaints included: Table EP 1 EO - 1: Complaints Bleeding Fatigue Constipation Fever Diarrhea Mucositis Dysphagia Nausea and Vomiting Pain Rash/Skin Irritation To develop the protocols, the team reviewed evidence from the following resources: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network National Cancer Institute National Institutes of Health American Society of Clinical Oncology Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 10 Society of Surgical Oncology Oncology Nursing Society Society of Gynecologic Oncologists American Association of Thoracic Surgery American Cancer Society American Nurses Association The protocol format was designed to be cons istent from protocol to protocol to assure ease of use by the nurses and to provide cons istent information. Emergent, urgent and supportive nursing assessments were defined in each protocol to provide guidelines as the nurse spoke with patients on the phone. The format includes: 1. Outcome Goal 2. Statement 3. Definition 4. Procedure 5. Emergent Nursing Assessment 6. Urgent Nursing Assessment a. Chemotherapy b. Radiation c. Surgery i. Pre-op ii. Post-op 7. Supportive Nursing Assessment 8. Nursing Intervention 9. Notify Provider to Obtain Order as Needed 10. Documentation 11. References Physicians were then asked to review all the protocols and provide input. Upon completion, the Executive Chief Nursing Officer (Marilyn Dubree, MSN, RN, NE-BC) and the Chief Nursing Officer/Chief Operating Officer (CNO/COO)(Margaret Head, RN, MSN, MBA) for the VMG met with the group to review and ask quest ions to validate the process. The final step was to obtain signatures from the lead physician in each clinical area as well as the CNO/COO of VMG and the Nursing Administrative Director for th e Cancer Center (Carol Eck, RN, BSN, MBA). See Table below. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 11 Table EP 1 EO - 2: Participants Kay Armstrong RN 3, OCN Medical Oncology Ann Hankenson RN 3, BSN Medical Oncology Beverly Medical Oncology Melinda Smith RN 2, OCN Medical Oncology Elisa Bryant RN 2, OCN Oncology Debbie Hematology- Stem Cell Salajanu RN, MSN, OCN Nurse Ma nager, Hematology/Stem Cell Transplant Debbie Preston RN, BSN, OCN Nurse Manager, Cancer Clinic Linda Dial RN, MN, AOCN Nurse Educator, Cancer Patient Care Center Katherine Wright RN 3, BSN, OCN Medical Oncology, Cool Springs, VICC Katie Madison MSN, RN, Manager, Cool Springs, VICC Leah Atwell Nurse Manager, Cancer Infusion Center Sheryl Redlin- Frazier RN, MSN, OCN Consultant, Nursing Education and Professional Development Teresa Knoop RN, MSN, AOCN Clinical Nurse Specialist, CIP Jennifer Woods RN, BSN, MBA, MHA Operations Engineer, Vanderbilt Performance Improvement Office Cancer Physicians Outcomes: These calls represent patient issues/concerns that were handled real time at the point of service that might have othe rwise gone for hours unattended. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 12 We are monitoring the volume of calls for abandonment rate. The abandonment rate target goal is 5 % and is defined as \"a call where the call is dropped or not received\". This is due often to the caller hanging up before someone answers. This is measured weekly and adjustments are made based on data such as to add staff or alter hours of operation. In December, 2.0 FTE nursing positions were added based on the abandonment rate and the number of calls that were not being answered (rolled over to a scheduler phone line) per day. When the average rollover rate per day increases to 50 plus calls, we are able to provide an additional RN. The call statistics below are from January 2010 through August 31, 2010 and reflect the focus, teamwork and dedication of this proces s change to provide improved patient centered care. The data represents approximately 30,0 00 patients who had their questions answered promptly leading to better access to care for our patients. The 5.7% abandonment (dropped call) rate indi cates that patients and caregivers have a high level of service. Prior to the Access Cent er opening, the abandonment rate fluctuated between 20% and 60% depending on the day of the week. We cu rrently have 7.25 FTEs Cancer Telephone Triage Nurses. The average nurse can handle up to 40-50 calls per day. We are still trying to determine the percentage of calls that we believe should be handled by the Triage Nurses, thus not sent on th e clinic provider or clinic RN. We estimate that between 40% and 60% of calls can be handle d by the telephone tria ge nurse. In August, we saw about 26% of the calls being handled by the telephone triage nurse compared to around 16% being handled by the triage nurse in December.

Cancer Access Center Telephone Nursing Tr iage service opened in November 2009. Within the first month, calls were answered without delay and nurses were able to address patients' concerns right away. One patient stated, \" I called and hung up 3 times thinking I had dialed the wrong number. When I called the fourth time I deci ded to ask for help, so at least someone could direct me to the right place .\" He continued, \" I think what you are doing is a wonderful thing .\" A Central Appointment Scheduler (CAS) received a call from the lab technician regarding a critical lab value. A week prior the CAS would have sent a message to a clinic nurse's message basket and would page the nurse. Th is week the CAS was able to put the nurse who was sitting next to her on the phone to immediately asses the call, and send the appropriate information to the provider, follo w-up with patient, providing excellent care in real time. A non-English speaking patient called the Access Center just before 5pm. He was experiencing severe pain, which was being translated to the nurse through a friend, whose communication in English was limited, stating \" strong pain, strong pain \". The patient had undergone an extensive abdomina l surgery two weeks prior. Following her assessment, the nurse determined the patient needed to be evaluated by the emergency department. On follow-up the next day, we learned the patient had been experiencing appendicitis; he was transferred to VUMC for emergency surgery. Changes in Patient Satisfaction at VPH Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 15 Problem/Background: Since PRC has been conducting our patien t satisfaction phone calls, VPH patient satisfaction scores were very low and reflected dissatisfaction with 'overall quality of care', 'helpfulness of treatment plan' and 'nurses cari ng and understanding'. Discussion about this problem and how to resolve was challenging, due to the patient population itself. Was their hospitalization voluntary or mandatory, were th ey unhappy with being discharged (still wanting the security of hospitalization), could changes in medication panel affect their outlook, or would required changes in their lifestyle post -hospitalization affect their responses. The threshold target set for VPH based on PRC data is 'At or above the 70th Percentile'. The interdisciplinary team was interested to explore the options to see if there was a way to improve the patient satisfaction scores. Based on positive antidotal comments from patients/families, the team considered, \" are we asking the wrong questions \", or \" do we just need a better way to measure psychiatric patient satisfaction \"? Methods/ Approach: The team worked with our in-house PRC data experts for information on other PRC Psychiatric Hospitals that had high PRC scores . Two nurse managers visited one of the top ranking PRC comparative group hospitals to learn about best practices that had been shown to influence PRC scores. Based on that information, the team developed the following action plan: Discharge Phone Calls: Began May 1, 2010 A VPH staff member Registered Nurse persona lly calls discharged patients to discuss how the patient is doing. [ EP1EO-Exhibit B-1-Discharge Phone Call Record VPH ] The target time frame for calls is 48-72 hours post discharge. When the managers round, they complete the top portion of the form. The nurse who discharged the patient, then pulls the form and completes the call. They ask the patient if they are having any prob lems or concerns and also check on their medications and follow-up appointments. Th e caller encourages the patient to give feedback to help improve patient care. The staff, supervisors and managers receiv e immediate feedback which gives them the opportunity to highlight the positive comme nts, or address and correct concerns. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 16 Recognition letters are sent to all staff members who are named specifically in the feedback from the discharge phone calls. The clinical information are collected and logged for follow-up. The nurse caller will direct questions as they are identified, to the appropriate clinician. The feedback collected is given to the Chief Administra tor (Bill Parsons, Ph D) and the CNO (Avni Cirpili, RN, MSN). Discussion occurs throug h the shared governance structure and the data is monitored for trends. As this is a new project, data collection and analysis are too new to see trends yet. Administrative Coordinators: A nursing leadership role which has been added to the interdisciplinary team. The Administrative Coordinators provide a valuable resource to problem solve with staff and intervene to resolve patient concerns immediat ely. The Administrative Coordinators are present in the hospital from 9 pm to 7 am da ily. This provides overlap for evening shift and coverage for night shift. Faculty Members: VPH has recruited new faculty members who are now seeing almost all the VPH patients that has resulted in a virtually closed staffi ng model. Having all patients have a on-site provider helps us to address issues more quickly and provide a better continuum of care.

(see below) Several clinical issues have been identified that allowed nursing to resolve issues that may have impacted outpatient care. Some of these issues have included: preautho rization of medication and potential conflict with follow-up appointments . During two phone calls, the nurse was able to connect the inpatient provider with the pati ent who had been experiencing an exacerbation of symptoms. Appropriate care was th en provided for patient safety. Graphs EP 1 EO 4 - 6: VPH PRC Pa tient Satisfaction Results Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 18 VCH Problem/Background The number of patients presenting to Childre n's ED has grown significantly over the last 4 years, particularly during the winter months. Le ngth of stay times for low acuity patients during winter months averaged 170 minutes per visi t. Inpatient holds were lasting several hours and transfer times once rooms were patient ready could take 4-5 hours. There were also trust issues between the ED and the inpatient areas. Staff questioned if rooms were being held and not released when they were ready. Methods/Approach With the patient as the focus, an interdisci plinary team began to analyze the multiple issues that affected long ED stays to improve patient throughput/flow for our patients. The team identified two goals: 1. Reducing the length of stay for low acuity patients in the ED from 170 minutes on average to 80 minutes on average. Reducing the LOS for low acuity patients improves patient safety and satisfaction, relieves overcrowding, improves employee morale and lowers cost. 2. Reducing the time from discharge of patient to next patient in room from 400 minutes on average to 90 minutes on average. This improves patient safety and satisfaction, reduces ED overcrowding, improves employee morale, reduces costs. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 19 Processes included: A Strategic Analysis of patient type and mix for the ED and how it was going to change over time Development of fishbone diagram to visually look at barriers Engagement with entire VCH team to develop alternative models to address throughput and overcrowding.

WIC provides federal grants to States for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education fo r low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non- breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk. The problem was that when patients were di scharged, many of them were not following up to receive the services. Reasons included tran sportation, language challenges, potential lack of understanding of need and le ngthy recovery periods. Methods/Approach With involvement from physicians, nutrition services, nursery, NICU, labor and delivery, case management, IT, and post partum, we were ab le to offer in-hospital registration for WIC, and ensure that mothers receive vouchers for f ood and formula before leaving the hospital. This process new mothers immediate access to the available resources. The initial suggestion that we offer WIC vouchers in-house came from one of our resident physicians, Dr. Bryant, who promoted the idea as part of her Resident Project. Dr. Bryant took her suggestion to Susan Wallace, wh o was part of the Administrative Team at Children's Hospital. An interdisciplinary team (involving Women's and Childrens) was formed and met monthly in order to achieve our collaborative goals. Nutrition Services provided a work area fo r the WIC representatives to process their paperwork and print vouchers. IT support (Tina Kurtz) worked with us to make changes with how we enter data in HED (electronic documentation system). The unit management team worked together to educate staff about assisting with form completion and HED documentation, since sp ecific data on the application forms is critical to the enrollment process, and can only be obtained from the medical record. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (1) 23 Once we began the process, we recognized th e need to change our practices in order to guarantee that all data was available for the fo rm completion. Frequently, the nurses had to page the physicians to order a postpartum lab that is not routinely completed on all patients. The lab value, however, is required for WIC enro llment. We found problems with the process: delays in the labs being drawn, in results bein g recorded on the application by nursing, and in the vouchers being printed. As a result, many patients were still being discharged prior to receiving their vouchers. To address the issues, a new protocol and additional order were created. The new order was added as an option for the physician s to select when they approve all other post partum orders. The nurse can order the lab test, per protocol, based on the patient's desire to enroll in WIC. The protocol provides specific guidelines for nursing to determine who should receive the lab test, which is now available on eD ocs (electronic repository of protocols, patient teaching materials, etc). if pt is enrolled or plans on enrolling in wic: per protocol obtain post partum pcv x 1 prior to discharge. We also had to make a change in our Star Panel chart to include a question about WIC for our patients. See below. This is a snapshot of the previous screen in Star Panel: Income/benefits information: Employed: X yes no Enrolled in: X WIC Social Security income Families First/AFDC food stamps We added as below: \"Are you interested in receiving informat ion about the WIC program for you and your infant?

Tracking, analyzing and addressing nurse sa tisfaction data is a priority for nursing leadership at VUMC. In our rapidly growin g and changing environment, we strive to understand and support the needs of nurses at all levels. Involving direct-care nurses in these processes has been critical to our success in affecting change based on their needs. The two main satisfaction surveys we use are a community/staff/faculty (all staff at VUMC) survey and the National Database Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) RN Satisfaction Survey with the Practice Environment Scale (P ES) and Job Enjoyment Scale. We are now administering the surveys in alternate years. In 2009 our community survey vendor changed from Morehead to HR Solutions. Our last HR Solutions staff/faculty survey was in September 2009 and the NDNQI RN Satisfaction survey was in October 2008. Our next NDNQI Survey is in August 2010. Throughout the year, we do \"pul se\" surveys on various topics which give us immediate information to address specific issues. The \"pulse\" surveys may also be for specific entities and/or groups of nurses. Special attent ion is paid to try to avoid \"survey fatigue\". Our complete survey results are pr ovided in Organizational Overvi ew - Exemplary Professional Practice -Question 12. Tracking and Analyzing Nurse Satisfaction Data As discussed in Question 1 under Structur al Empowerment - Professional Engagement, Vanderbilt Nursing has practiced shared govern ance since the late 1970's/ early 80's. Our nursing shared governance structure is the vehicl e by which direct-care nurses are involved in tracking and analyzing nurse satisfaction data. Nursing leadership is responsible for sharing the data and developing action plans based on di scussion and feedback at all levels. We are a transparent organization and nursing satisfaction data is reported in various formats and venues. Data is provided in el ectronic format by the following categories: Overall VUMC nursing Entity (VUH, VCH, Clinics, VPH, Heart Instit ute, Cancer Center, Women's Services, etc.) Patient Care Center (Medicine, Surgical, Neurology, etc.), Individual unit, clinic and department Other \"cuts\" of the data as requested Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 28 This provides nursing with several ways to trac k and analyze the data and the data is evaluated at each of these levels for different purposes. The Nursing Executive and Administrative Boar ds do a high level broad analysis of the nursing satisfaction data for the entire organizati on. Nursing Leadership Boards of each of the entities and Patient Care Centers analyze the data for their entity. In addition, at the entity level each of the four staff nurse councils analyze the data for trends related to adult, pediatric, clinic or psychiatric nurses and compare their data to the other entities, overall organizational data and benchmarks. As is the backbone of our shared govern ance program, we believe best results are accomplished when the data is tracked and analyz ed at the closest point of contact; individual unit, clinic and department. From the point of contact level (unit/clinic/department), change can be implemented as needed or recommendations can be directed to the Patient Care Center or entity level. From that point, recommenda tions can be made to the Nursing Executive or Administrative Boards and then on to the organizational level if needed. As stated above, detailed data for nursing satisfaction is located in OO 12. The table below provides a summary of the results for nursi ng by Dimension and our compares to the RN National Norm and Magnet Hospital Norm fr om HR Solutions. The numbers represent the percentage of staff who responded favorably to the questions in that dimension. The comparison is for registered nurses only.

These are completed electronically and are sign ed off by the one-up manager/supervisor. Action plan progress is monitored through the same shared governance structures as the survey data are analyzed and tracked. Nursing Leadership Top Issue Satisfaction with salary has been a top issue on our last couple of surveys. On a routine basis, VUMC conducts community market survey analysis of salaries and adjusts as deemed appropriate. Our most recent nursing salary ma rket analysis was initiated by the Executive CNO and the Nursing Executive Board. An outside consulting firm, Buck Consultants, conducted a comprehensive review of compensation acro ss the Medical Center which included local, regional and national benchmarking. They also l ooked at issues around best practices for items, like bonuses and specialty pay. A proposal for addressing nursing compensati on has been developed at the time of this writing (July, 2010) and is being reviewed by the Nursing Executive Board for implementation this fiscal year (2011). VUH Inpatient Women's Services This inpatient Women's Services scenario serves as an example of how we involve direct-care nurses in the process of analyzing an d addressing staff satisfaction. Although the scores were above the benchmarks for the unit, discussion starting at the Women's Services Patient Care Center Meeting level down throug h the unit board/staff nurse level indicated a Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 30 need for clarification of a few of the HR Solutions survey scores [ EP3-Exhibit A-1-Women's PCC EP3-Exhibit A-4-4 East Charge Nurse Minutes 04-14-09 ]. A five question Survey Monkey was developed by 4 East (OB/GYN) nursing leadership to better identify the issues and actions needed [ EP3-Exhibit B-1-Community Survey Feedback Survey Monkey ]. This was also helpful in reaching staff that could not be present during initial discussions. The tables below show the actual scores from the survey and a broad summary of the how the questions lead to clarification and assisted in the development of action plans [ EP3-Exhibit C-1-4 East Community Survey Action Plan 2009, EP3-Exhibi t C-2-L & D Community Survey Action Plan 2009 ] Table EP 3 -2: 4 East (OB/GYN) 2009 HR Solutions Staff Survey Results DIMENSION SCORE * MAGNET NORM Overall Job Satisfaction 85% 71% Pay 43% *Numbers represent the percentage of sta ff who responded favorably to the question (possible total 100) Table EP 3 -3: 4 East (OB/GY N) Staff Satisfaction Follow-up Community Survey Question Survey Monkey questions assisted leadership in clarifying employees Community Survey Responses Examples of action plan items to address specific issues identified by the di rect-care nurses on 4 East (OB/GYN) Senior leaders frequently visit my department. Defining who the staff identified as senior leadership for the purpose of improving communication and *To increase direct communication between the staff, faculty, and the Women's Patient Care Center's Physician and Nursing Leadership, Town Hall Meetings were developed and held on Jan 5, 6 th and 7th 2010 and June 21, 22, July 1st, 2010 to share outcomes, strategic direction and to get feedback from staff on plans and concerns. Town Hall meetings will be held Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 31 rounding twice a year. *Senior nursing leadership to attend staff meetings on a quarterly basis (Robin Mutz attends quarterly; Nicole Herndon attends monthly) *Posted an organizational chart with the names and photos of senior leadership (Administrative Director & Assistant Admin Director; Nursing Management and respective Medical Officers - Chair, Vice Chair, & Unit Medical Directors) in the break room & on unit bulletin board [ EP3-Exhibit D-1-Women's PCC Organizational Chart ]. The necessary material and equipment are available when I need to perform my job. Determining what equipment and materials were needed to support staff in patient care activities Develop processes for reporting equipment repairs needs, inadequate supplies and supply delivery issues. Red tag notification system was implemented in February 2010. Staff notifies the manager or Assistant manager of supply needs, and they work with the service center to have items added to par levels, as needed. Work with unit staff and Service Center staff around new processes. One example of this is the silver dressings. In June 2010, additional sizes of silver dressings and shapes were available, and the ANM was able to have them added to the cell, rather than the service center. This change occurred over a couple weeks, and has helped facilitate the nurse's ability to meet the patients' needs more quickly. Ordered an additional blood pressure monitor (Feb. 2010) for the unit, thermometers (Feb 2010), and speaker phones (June 2010) for use with the phone interpreter service. The speaker phones were requested to help the nurses communicate with the patients without having to interrupt their work flow by having to go find a speaker phone or have to pass the handset back and forth to the Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 32 patient. It also allows for the patient's support person to hear the information at the same time. There is reasonable consistency between departments in how Human Resource policies are administered and followed. Identifying specific human resource policies which were confusing or appear to be handled inconsistently. Routine review of at staff meetings -particularly new and/or changes (the staff requested specific clarification of the attendance and pay practice policies) Attendance, Pay pr actices, Hours of Work policies were reviewed with an HR representative present for clarification at the Unit Board meeting Jan. 2010. These policies have been consistently applied, and staff has adjusted. As issues arise, the staff is redirected to the policies and the need for consistency is reinforced. N/A Determining how to improve overall job satisfaction Reviewed the current staffing models to determine if the model criteria and variances support optimal staffing levels. Based on nursing feedback, changes were made in how the CP is assigned to patients. Rather than having a static number, their assignments are based on patient acuity and department census. Patients are assigned to the CPs by taking into account their location and acuity. This was a change from the old model where the most difficult patients were assigned CPs, and some patients weren't assigned at all. Improved communication regarding salary analysis process by discussing at unit board. Develop career development plan with each of the staff. During staff evaluations in April 2010, qualified nurses were encouraged to advance through the VPNPP process. 2 have achieved RN3 since the survey, and four additional nurses are working toward that goal. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 33 Clinics/VMG Examples: VMG Nursing Staff Council At the February and March 2010 VMG Nursin g Staff Council, Margaret Head, RN, MSN, MBA (VMG CNO/COO) discussed the results of the nursing results from the HR Solutions Staff/Faculty Satisfaction survey [ EP3-Exhibit E-1-VMG NSC Minutes 02-03-10, ]. Issues identified included; pa y/benefits and senior leadership rounding. Margaret was able to share informat ion about ongoing work with community salary comparisons and entire compensation structure for VUMC. Other ideas were discussed which support/enhance compensation such as; certific ation support and conference attendance. A commitment was made in the area of senior le adership rounding and assuring that staff can identify senior leaders who are rounding. MCE Cardiology Clinic Workload was an issue in the evaluation of the HR Solutions staff satisfaction results for the Cardiology Clinic. Nursing leaders facilitated discussion with every nurse and technician in the clinic [ EP3 Exhibit F-1-Summary of Community Su Meeting Minutes 04-14-10 ]. The tables below show the satisfaction survey scores and provide examples of the issues identified and action plan items to address.

Working with clinic re-design team Added extended RN position [EP3-Exhibit G-1-MCE Cardiology Action Plans ] Children's Hospital Example Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 35 The Hematology/Oncology Services (inpatien t and outpatient) at Children's Hospital actually had scores on the 2009 HR Solutions Sta ff/Faculty Survey that were comparable to or higher than the national comparisons from the survey company HR Solutions [ EP3-Exhibit H-1- Hem-Onc Community Survey Results ]. The results were presented to the staff and leadership of the areas. Discussions in those venues brough t attention to one particular question that was below the \"Best in Class\" benchmark score provided by HR Solutions. The question was \"The person I report to en courages me to try new ways of doing my job\", which falls under the Management Domain. Their score was 60% of staff answering this question positively as opposed to 65% overall in VUMC and 67% for \"Best in Class\" benchmark. The brainstorming among staff and leadership le ad to the development and submission of an action plan for improvement in this area. The focus of the plan is on increased visibility and reward and recognition. The tables below show the scores from the survey and the action plan submitted.

In monitoring their turnov er rates, they have identified that they have a high number of staff who transfer to the ICUs. While this is keeping the staff at Vanderbilt, it does create turnover for 6 Nort h. The group decided that they did not want to change their support of nurses moving to the ICUs. They also did not want to change the support of working the staffing schedule around class schedules for st aff, which can also lead to staff moving to new roles within the Medical Center such as NP, etc. What the group decided to do and put in their Action Plan was to: Provide observation experiences for the nurses who might be considering moving to the ICU to make sure the nurse s' realized the skill level needed. The staff member can develop a plan for increasing their skill level if that is needed if they are not ready to move to the ICU. Begin to further analyze their turnover rate and all the top reasons given. Further in bed into the Neuro Unit the principles of shared-decision making, committee work and learning ac tivities for the staff. Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 41 Below is a copy of the actual plan. Table: EP 3 - 9: VUH 6 North Neurolog y 2009 Satisfaction Survey Action Plan Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 42 VUH 9 South Surgical Unit When the 9 South unit board discussed thei r survey results, one question stood out for them - \"The person I report to encourages me to try new ways of doing my job.\" The result the team wanted was - \"Staff recognize that su ggestions for trying new / different ways of being successful in a job are always welcomed / encouraged. The plan was developed by leadership and staff. Plan Developed: 1. Increase communication overall with staff Email \"Friday Communication\" Informal \"sit downs\" in break room Continue rounding Open-door policy 2. Be receptive to change. When issues are identified, the staff are to be engaged to helping to identify a workable solution. Example: Uninterrupted meal breaks. Staff did not like the idea of have assigned times for meal breaks. Sta ff developed the solution to having uninterrupted meal breaks by implem enting a buddy system. Each staff member would hand off their pager to a buddy when going to lunch. Trialed buddy system for one month and the syst em worked well. Since that time, when staffs enter the break room for lunch with their pagers, they are Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3) 43 reminded by their peers to hand over thei r pagers. This was an example of a successful outcome. VUH 7 North Cardiology Unit The unit board and leadership wanted to a ddress two specific questions from their 2009 Staff Satisfaction Survey. See below: 1. Staff will have what they need and if they don't, they will know how to get it quickly. In January 2010, the unit purchased a Doppler, four - finger sensors, and created five rolling vital sing carts that included five thermometers, ten oral probes and 15 BP cuffs. The telemetry upgrade solved the r oot of the concern when the number of Telecoms went fr om five to 18. 2. Senior leaders frequently visit my department. While senior leaders do round routinely on the unit, they identified more opportunities for the staff to have face time with senior leaders. Monthly safety rounds now bring a di fferent executive leader to each department which increases exposure as they speak directly to the staff. Deb Chamberlain, RN, BSN, MBA, Assistant Administrative Director, attends charge nurse meetings and Robin Steaban, RN, MSN, Administrative Director has attended staff meetings with safety road show. Additionally staffs are a ttending safety focus groups and operations council conducted by senior leaders.

Include participatio n rates, analysis, and evaluation of data. Nursing satisfaction survey detailed data results are in Organizational Overview - Exemplary Professional Practice - Question 12. The structures and processes that involve direct care nurses in tracking and analyzin g the data are outlined below. Purpose and Background Tracking and analyzing nurse satisfaction da ta is an important part of our leadership strategy for retention and creating an enviro nment that is conducive to the professional practice of nursing. Input and decisions regard ing work-life and patient care are best made at the level of the direct care givers. We ut ilize two surveys; NDNQI RN Satisfaction Survey and an overall VUMC staff/faculty survey, administered in alternate years. We have switched our commercial vendor from Morehe ad to HR Solutions. Methods and Approach The methods for administrating the surveys were described in Organizational Overview - Exemplary Professional Practice - Question 12 . In summary, our methods which support this philosophy include: Surveys are web-based, anonymous and administered over a 3-4 week period No incentives are given for survey participation Data results are initially provided to leadership Leaders at all levels review and analyze the data Leaders share/discuss data at leadership m eetings, patient care center meetings, staff meetings, unit/clinic/department board meetings and nurse staff council meetings Action plans are developed with direct care nurse input Recommendations/ actions may be initiated at the point-of-care level or forwarded as needed Progress with action plan goals is monitore d/evaluated at intervals depending upon the action items Exemplary Professional Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3EO) 51 Participants: Participation Rates Historically, we have had exce llent response rates from the nursing staff for satisfaction surveys. This has provided us with ample in formation for review and comparison. The following tables show the VUMC participation rates. NDNQI RN Satisfaction Survey We have been participating with the NDNQI RN Satisfaction Survey since 2007. Our last survey was 2008. The 2010 survey is currently unde rway (August 2010). We have been pleased with nursing participation in the past. The ta ble below shows participation rates. We were not discouraged in our drop from 85% to 73% for two reasons: our numbe r of nurses increased significantly and we did two surveys in the same year, which we have no w changed. The 2010 response rate was 74% with yet a larger N. Th e results of the 2010 survey we will not have until the end of October. Table EP 3 EO - 1: VUMC Nursing Participat ion Rates NDNQI RN Satisfaction Survey VUMC NDNQI Compare Year RN Response Rate Number Eligible RNs Practice Professional Practice Model (EP3EO) 52 HR Solutions 2009 was the first year we used HR Solution s for our VUMC staff/faculty survey. HR Solutions is a national firm that provides empl oyee satisfaction survey and other like services. http://www.hrsolutionsinc.com/ While they have a significan t number of health care clients, they also have a large number of non-health care c lients. This was of interest to us in choosing them in order to see our comparisons for the ov erall organization with other companies as well as other hospitals. Many non-hospital organizati ons have excellent best practices in relation to employee satisfaction and engagement and we want to learn about those and see how we compare. Vanderbilt is among their list of clients that show Best In Class for employee engagement. They do provide benchmark comparisons for dimension results, but not for participation rates. We were pleased with nursing participation rates based on previous numbers from the Morehead Survey and our incr easing numbers of nurses at Vanderbilt. Our next VUMC staff/faculty survey is targeted for 2011.

The score represents the percentage of staff who responded favorably to the question. Comparatives include HR Solutions database RN National Norm and their database for Magnet Hospital National Norm. No comparisons are provided for each of the 57 questions. Due to the differences between the Morehead and HR Solutions surveys, a crosswalk is not possible, so for this survey, we have our first year of data. The 10 Dimensions are: 1. Overall Job Description 2. Pay Satisfaction 3. Benefits Satisfaction 4. Supervisory Consideration 5. Communication 6. Human Resources/Personnel Policies 7. Concern for Employees 8. Training and Development 9. Strategy/Mission 10. Management Index In all 10 Dimensions, VUMC RN Scores are significantly higher than the RN National Norm and Magnet Hospital Norm comparisons. For this survey, there is no overall accumulated score. All dimension scores were at or above 65% except for pay satisfaction which was addressed in EP3. The highest sc ore at 84% rated favorably was Overall Job Satisfaction. Entity sc ores were comparable.

Provide at least two (2) examples of a plan of care that included a patient and/or family member involvement. Our Professional Practice Model (PPM) is ba sed on patient/family centered care. For that work, Vanderbilt Medical Center was referenc ed in January 2009 by the Pickler Institute as a leader in Patient and Family Centered Care among academic medical centers [ EP4-Exhibit A-1- January 2009 Pickler Institute Report-VUMC ]. This success is also grounded by our highly visible shared vision, and clearly defined Credo behaviors. In our interdisciplinary collaborative approach to care delivery, the patient/family are key members of the health care team, involv ed in decision-making through all aspects of planning, delivering care, discharge and follow-up. Direct care nurses lead the interdisciplinary team at the point of patient care. Nurses utiliz e the PPM and the interdis ciplinary care delivery system to individualize the plan of care to meet the special needs of each patient and family. Multiple factors and initiatives support th e ongoing involvement of patient/families in the care planning process. Examples include: Orientation (shared visi on - CREDO Behaviors) Philosophy of Nursing as outlined in our Nursing Bylaws Definition of Evidence-Based Practice Patient-Family Centered Care Culture Patient-Family Advisory Councils Open visitation and inclusion of families in rounding Family Initiated Rapid Resp onse Team Calls Program Web Based Patient portal called My Health at Vanderbilt Case Management Model Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 61 Credo Behaviors Credo behaviors are introduced during orie ntation and are measured each year in employee evaluation feedback/conversations. At Vanderbilt Hospitals and Clinics, we are committed to excellence. Our credo guides ou r work and our interactions with colleagues, patients and visitors and our credo is who we are. We provide excellence in healthcare, research and education. We treat others as we wish to be treated. We continuously evaluate and improve our performance. Our six credo behaviors: I make those I serve my highest priority. I have a sense of ownership. I conduct myself professionally. I respect privacy and confidentiality. I communicate effectively. I am committed to my colleagues Philosophy of Nursing Nursing Bylaws are referenced and presented as supporting evidence in OO 11 and SE 1. Below is an abbreviated summary of how ou r Nursing Philosophy supports patient/family centered care. \"... Nursing embraces the responsibilit y to provided patient centered, high quality, and cost effective nursing care for all patients and their families. ... We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes the inherent worth, dignity and uniqueness of every individual. We promote participation of patients and significant others in decisions regarding the patients' health care and work toward their optimal level of wellness...\" Definition of Evidence-Based Practice Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 62 Our definition is - \"Evidence-based practice is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.\" (S ackett et al. 2000) (From VUMC Nursing Research Website http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/root/vum c.php?site=vanderbiltnursing&doc=9019 Culture of Patient-Family Centered Care Many initiatives contribute to the success of our culture of patient-family centered care. Key to our strong commitment is a role dedicate d to these efforts - Terrell Smith, RN, MSN is the Director of Patient/Family Centered Care [ EP4-Exhibit B-1-Director Job Description ]. Terrell provides ongoing shared vision and operational coordination for patient-family centered care through The Department of Patient and Family Ce ntered Care. Her work with nurses and the other members of the interdisciplinary team cro sses the enterprise and covers many facets. The Department was created to enhance the ability for patients and families to take an active role in health care decisions by creati ng and maintaining an environment that: is supportive for patients and families optimizes safety, quality of care, service, dignity and respect by strengthening partnerships between patients, families, and health providers optimizes patient and family engagement in health care knowledge and decision making by providing access to health information Patient-Family Advisory Councils A cornerstone for the work around patient- family centered care is the Patient and Family Advisory Council structure. Currently there are six councils: Vanderbilt University Hospital and C linics Council (VUH/TVC) which meets monthly One Hundred Oaks Council (outpati ent focus) which meets monthly Eskind Diabetes Center Co uncil which meets quarterly Internal Medicine Council which meets quarterly Vanderbilt Children's Family Advi sory Council which meets monthly Vanderbilt Children's Patient Advisory Council which meets monthly A website serves as a resource to patients and the council members.

One of thei r many undertakings has been their involvement with our patient education goal of making in formation easier to re ad and understand. They partnered with the clinical enterprise to approv e the surgical and procedural template that was used to revise all surgical consents to a 5th grade reading level. The improvements included more white space, larger font and more photogra phs. The Councils have also been involved in the design/function of new space and our campaign for partnership for safety. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 66 Trauma Survivor Network Direct care nurses from the trauma service, along with the Director of Patient/Family Centered Care, trauma unit nurse manager, family members of patients and physicians collaborated to create the Trauma Survivor Networ k. This program provides on line support for families of trauma victims as well as peer ment oring support and other information critical to assist a family during this time of crisis. Nu rses serve as the first educators for the patient family about the Trauma Survivor Network and how it can provide help and support for them [EP4-Exhibit C-1-Trauma Survivors Network Newsletter Dec 09 ]. http://www.vanderbilthealth.com/traumasurvivors/ Inclusion of Families in Rounds Beginning with the Trauma Unit, many areas now include families in rounding with the interdisciplinary team. Direct care nurses are critical to the rounding process and help educate families about their roles and prov ide follow-up. As leaders in the development and provision of the interdisciplinary plan of care, having families involved in rounds supports nurses to develop a stronger partnership in the execution of the plan. Open Visitation The opening of the Critical Care Tower (CCT) in November 2009 (complete story in NK 9 EO) saw the advent of open visitation for our critic al care units. The room s in the critical care tower are also designed to prov ide three distinct work spaces; unique space for the health care team and patient and family. In addition, each unit in the CCT has two distinct family waiting rooms - one that provides for television and in teraction and another that provides for quiet reflection [ EP4-Exhibit D-1-House Organ Nov 09 ]. Family Initiated Rapid Response Calls We understand that when a family member suspects their loved one's condition is rapidly deteriorating, their instincts are often correct. Initiated in August 2009, the Family Initiated Rapid Response Team program supports fa mily members to activate a call to dispatch the rapid response team. Using the same mech anism a staff member would, a family member Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 67 can dial 1-1111 from the patient's room. The Fam ily Advisory Councils worked with us to craft language for this initiative. Initial fears that the system would be abused have been unfounded. We found that rather than abusing the system, the vast majori ty of family members respect it like they do calling 911 at home. Our Patient Handbook, writte n with the Patient/Family Advisory Councils contains information about Family Initiated Ra pid Response Calls and other information about \"partnering with us for safety\" [ EP4-Exhibit E-1-Patient Handbook]. See examples of the family education for Family Initiated Rapid Response Calls [ EP4-Exhibit E-2-Children's FIRST family edu material, EP4-Exhibit E-3 Adult RRT edu material ]. My Health at Vanderbilt My Health at Vanderbilt is a free secure web-based electronic system that supports communication between patients-families and health care providers. The idea for this form of communication came from our clinic nurses, who now monitor this site within their respective clinics. This tool provides for more timely communication between the health care providers and patients; with nursing being the first line of response. https://www.myhealthatvanderbilt.com/myhealth-portal/app TABLE EP 4 - 4: Screen Shot of My Health at Vanderbilt Website Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 68 Patients and designated support persons can: See lab test results Send and receive secure messages with their doctor's office Request new appointments View personal medical information Request prescription refills Pay Vanderbilt bills Read relevant medical information And much more Nursing Based Case Management Model Vanderbilt Case Management structures and processes are designed to support patient/family in the planning and delivery of care from admission and after discharge - across the continuum [ EP4-Exhibit F-1-VUMC Case Management Model, EP4-Exhibit F-2-VUMC Case Management Model Detail ]. Per Case Management's Standard for Service Delivery [ EP4-Exhibit F-3-Standard for Service Delivery April 2009 ] patients are at the center of all services delivered. Direct care nurses in collaborati on with the health care team are responsible for the plan for Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 69 nursing care and Nurse Case Managers (NCM) a nd Social Workers (SW) assist with complex discharge needs to help ensure continuity of care. As members of the team, Financial Counselors (FC) assist patients/families to access their eligible financial resources, including charitable care.

(Complete Medical Records for all examples available on site) \"In Nursing's Own Words\" Vanderbilt University Hospital (VUH) and Vanderbilt Clinics (VMG/TVC) This is an example where local and national health care professionals teamed with the patient and family to create the plan of care that the patient wanted. V was a 26 year old with a new diagnosis of melanoma. At the time, V and her husband were living and working in another country teaching English. The patient ha d family living close to Nashville, so on their return to the US, she was admitted to Vanderbilt. Her work-up determined that she had severe metastatic disease. Emergency surgery was perf ormed to address spinal cord compression and several other surgeries followed. The health care team worked with variou s pharmacies and other outside resources to provide indigent care for V. As per her wish, she was able to leave the hospital and return only for short treatment periods. Th is assistance included living arra ngements close to the Medical Center and transportation. As it became apparent that V would not re cover from her disease, the care was shifted to palliative and end-of-life. V shared with the healthcare team that she had a dream to see the west coast in a recreational vehicle (RV). This was her birthplace and the area of many childhood memories for her. She wanted to share this with her husband who had never seen the area. From donations and much coordination with family and a broader health care team in Tennessee and California, this wish was made into a reality. V had her dream fulfilled and saw the west coast in an RV from Portland, Oregon to LaHoya, California. V died peacefully in LaHoya under the care of a local hospice team and with her family at her side. V lived 75 days from diagno sis to the peaceful end of her life. Thanks to Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 70 the interdisciplinary health care team that lis tened and included the patient and her family in the plan of care, V was able to have her last wish come true. Vanderbilt Children's Hospital (VCH) A 19 year old, 6'4\" young man with autism was scheduled for surgery. Two months prior to his planned admission, the health care team, including an autism specialist, worked with the parents to develop a pre and post-op plan of care. His father worked in Louisiana and due to the agreement that both parents were needed during this time, a letter of medical necessity was sent to his employer to secure le ave. The team also met daily with the family during his hospitalization. One of the most significant challenges was the patient's ability to comply with post operative activity restriction for no weight bearing on the operat ive leg. Due to his size and past interactions with his mother, the team dete rmined that for safety he should be admitted to a rehab facility post-operatively. For his eventual return home, the family and the team identified the following needs: a hospital bed a ramp for the home entrance a removable brace for improved and safe mobility care assistance in the home attendance at school Because the team planned with the family in advance, these needs were addressed and arranged before the patient was admitted. As with all good planning, flexibility is needed. As it turned out, the patient's mother had to have a surgical procedure the week befo re her son which could not be postponed. His mother developed post operative co mplications and was not able to assist in the patient's care. Due to pre-planning and involvement of both parents, the patient's father determined that he and his son were doing well together and he would prefer to care for him at home. The health care team was in agreement and the pa tient was successfully discharged home 10 days after his surgery. Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital (VPH) Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP4) 71 A patient was admitted to the Adult Unit of VPH, who required a lift to transfer him from bed to wheelchair. The particular lift needed was not available through our equipment distribution or for rental from the community. After obtaining permission, the patient's father was contacted and he offered to bring the patient's portable lift for use during his hospitalization. In addition, the patient and fath er also decided that some of his other medical supplies could be brought in and used during the hospital stay. The patient's father brought the portable lif t and once it was approved for use by our Biomedical Department, he instructed the staff on the use of the lift. Due to the size and limited mobility of the patient, the use of the patient's personal lift supported patient and staff safety. Additionally, the father was a main care giver for the patient and this \"hands on\" approach facilitated communication and support ed the patient and family to identify and address the issues that had brought the patient into our care. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP7) 72 Care Delivery System(s) Source of Evidence Number 7 Describe and demonstrate the structure(s) and process(es) used to engage internal experts and external consultants to improv e care in the practice setting. Internal Experts and Cons ultative Services VUMC nurses at all levels have easy ac cess to a variety of internal experts and consultative services which provide support in improving operations, patient care and outcomes. The autonomous nature of the prac tice of professional nursing at Vanderbilt supports nurses to independently contact the re sources they need. Thes e experts also sit on various committees and task forces throug hout the Medical Center. In addition, teams/committees already in existence ma y determine the need to utilize internal experts/consultative services for assistance or an internal group of experts may be appointed to identify/solve a problem. Examples of intern al experts and consultative services include, but are not limited to.

Processes that support staff in the use of internal experts and consultative Services In addition to the nurses having access to contact internal experts and consultative services, embedded in their daily work flow are a number of processes that expedite the use of internal experts and consultative services. The table below provides some examples. Table EP 7 - 2: Processes that support the use of internal expe rts and consultative Services Nursing Activity Associated Processes Falls Assessment When a fall assessment is completed on patients and they are determined to be \"at Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP7) 76 risk for falls\"; the protocol initiated for falls prevention prompts for a physical therapy consult [ EP7-Exhibit B-1-Falls Risk Assessment Adult, EP7-Exhibit B-2-Falls Risk B-4-Falls Prevention Protocol Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment 1) Nutrition Braden sub-score shows up on the dietician's dashboard and triggers a complete nutrition assessment 2) Based on specific Braden Score and for Stage 3 & 4 and un-stageable ulcers, the order set prompts for a Wound/Ostomy or Plastics consults 3) Based on Braden Score, there is a \"advisor\" that has a bed selection tree algorithm for choosing a specialty bed 4) For assessment of Stage 1 & 2 pressure ulcers - with the pressure ulcer prevention and treatment protocol there is an actual recommended product ordering chart [ EP7- Exhibit B-5-Pressure Ulcer Flow Chart, EP7- Exhibit B-6-Pressure Ulcer B-7 PU Prevention Tree - PEDS ].

Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP7) 77 Geriatric Practice Guidelines (developed through the ACE Steering Committee) A nutrition consult is triggered (if the patient is not already being followed) for a registered dietician, if the patient: 1. is not tolerating the ty pe or amount of tube feeding 2. is losing weight 3. Has poor wound healing 4. Has a change in nutritional status 5. Needs nutrition education and discharge diet instructions 6. has poor food intake Diagnosis specific pathways Within the Nursing Plan of Care there is a section for consults such as social work, physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc. [EP7-Exhibit B-14-Diagnosis Specific Pathways- Protocols ]. Diagnosis specific Protocols Within the protocols themselves are triggers for specific related internal consults Example: Early Mobilization Protocol for the MICU triggers a Physical Therapy Consult [ EP7- Exhibit B-15-Diagnosis Specific Pathways- Protocols ]. Infection Control Experts Utilized in various arenas to develop evidence- based protocols for management of central line placement to prevent blood stream infections and management of Foley catheters to prevent catheter associated UTI, etc. Specific Example: Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU): Utilized the infection control experts (Kathie Wilkerson, RN and Dr. Tom Talbot) to develop a plan for decreasing C-diff diarrhea (Complete story and data in EP 7 EO) Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (EP7) 78 Example: Use of Internal Experts - 9 South Surgical Step-down In August, 2009, 9 South had a low percentage rate for compliance with hand hygiene. With Claudette Fergus, RN, BSN from CCI, we developed a Plan for 9 South that was implemented in November, 2009. Our plan incl uded observations of hand hygiene compliance on 9 South. Using available data, during the unit board we talked with staff about the focus on hand hygiene and got their perception of hand hygiene compliance on 9 South. When we shared the actual observation data, they were su rprised at our low percentage of hand hygiene compliance. Agreement was made and we had required hand hygiene in-services for all 9 South staff. In addition, we put the following initiatives in place: \"Staff Huddles\" where each shift (at 8:15AM and 9:00PM) staff gather at the Charge Nurse desk to discuss hand hygiene and other quality initiatives. During this time, the Char ge Nurse also shares hand hygiene observation results with staff and emphasize peer accountabi lity. They are reminded to provide real-time remediation by politely asking anyone not observ ing adequate hand hygiene to please foam in and out each time. In addition to huddles, we ask that each staff member pass their pager off for five minutes during their shift and round on the unit observing hand hygiene. Again with these rounds, remediation can be provided if inadequate hand hygiene is witnessed. We started to experience a positive trend in the hand observations for 9 South. Table EP 7 - 3: Hand Hygiene Resu lts for 9 South Surgical Step-down Month Oct. 2009 Nov. 2009 Dec. 2009 Jan. 2010Feb. 2010Mar. 2010Apr. 2010May 2010Jun. 2010 Delivery System(s) (EP7) 79 In April, we saw a decrease in our compliance rate. In evaluating our instances of non- compliance, all surrounded medication administrati on involving the workstations on wheels. Laurel Balthaser, RN and Jenny Ledbetter, RN from 9 South exam ined the work flow of \"hand hygiene meets AdminRx.\" Administering medi cations with AdminRx requires contact with computer, patient, and patient medications multiple times during the process. Because of contact made between computer, patient and pati ent medications, the hands must be sanitized multiple times during the process. After evaluating the process and discussing issues with staff, Laurel and Jenny prepared two st aff education posters. The post ers were placed in the break room and demonstrated, with pictures, process work flow. A poster was made for patients on isolation and patients not on isolation. Initiatives used on 9 South in an effort to improve hand hygiene compliance have been rolled out to other areas of the hospital. La urel Balthaser now serves on the Hand Hygiene Committee as the Unit Expe rt from 9 South. External Experts and Consultants Senior leadership at VUMC, nursing and no n-nursing, recognize and support the need to identify and obtain external experts and co nsultants to advise us about operations, improvements and patient care. The structure a nd process is multifaceted. A team/committee that is in place may be trying to address a part icular issue or make improvements or a problem has been identified and a team/committee is then appointed to define a solution. The first steps are always to clearly define the problem/need and look at the evidence. Based on the outcome of those steps, the gro up may determine we have internal experts who can address the problem or that external consul tants are needed or a combination of both. Regardless, these teams/committees are interdisciplinary with nursing at the table. Executive sponsors/champions (senior leadership) are re sponsible for supporting the work and working with the teams to secure the resources they need. A listing of examples of external experts and consultants used in evidence-based practice and research is in Organizational Overvi ew - Source of Evidence 28. The Table below provides examples of specific use of external co nsultants in various roles to improve care in the practice setting.

VUH - Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) Uses Int ernal Consultant to Decrease Infection Rate Purpose and background : For a six month period the C. Diff diarrhea incidence rates per 1,000 patient days were above the set threshold for the MICU. The MICU patients were the perfect population for this condition; many are immunocompromi sed, receiving potent antibiotics, and tube feedings. For some patients, getting this organism and this co ndition was part of their disease and treatment processes, but for others they were the recipient of cross-contamination. Staff of all disciplines and physicians were being observed going into isolation rooms without appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). In addition, the staff/physicians did not feel comfortable confronting others when protocol was breached . The same mop head was being used in all rooms, regular and isolation rooms - no changi ng out after cleaning the floor in a contact isolation room. Supplies stored in patient room s were not always being discarded after the discharge of an isolation patient. Methods/Approach After discussion at the Unit Board meetin g, the manager of the MICU, Julie Foss, RN, MSN, NE-BC contacted Infection Control. Du ring meetings with Infection Control, MICU leadership, staff and Medical Director identified so me steps to be taken. Further discussion of this problem and possible solutions took place at an MICU Unit Board meeting that included the MICU Medical Director and the Medical Director of Infection Control. The staff participated in flushing out the action plan to get this problem under control. Part of that plan was for the MICU Manage r and Manager of Infect ion Control to meet with Environmental Services (EVS) after hear ing the staff nurses comments about observed infection control practices of the EVS staff. The MICU manager and assistant manager along with Infection Control practitioners were invi ted to attend EVS staff meetings to discuss evidence based infection control best practice and to engage the EVS staff as members of our MICU team to help us get this under control. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 84 We also did education, including an in-s ervice presented by Dr. Talbot, the medical director of infection control, to make sure that all staff and physicians working in the MICU were aware of this organism and the interventi ons that were needed when the organism was present to prevent cross-contamination. Flyers were posted with background information and action steps. The Friday Communication newsle tter and Unit Board minutes included the action plan and rationale for it. Each month the infect ion rates for the unit were posted to help the staff stay informed of our progress in getting this problem controlled. Table EP 7 EO - 1: Participants Julie Foss RN, MSN, NE-BC Manager, MICU Dixie Taylor RN, BSN Assistant Manager, MICU Kara Gordon RN, MSN Nurse Educator, MICU Art Wheeler MD Medical Director, MICU Todd Rice MD Associate Medical Director, MICU Critical Care Fellows MDs For MICU Tom Talbot MD Direction, Infection Control Kathie Wilkerson RN Infection Control Practitioner Mike Jolley & Neil Masters Directors, Environmental Services MICU Unit Board MICU Nursing & Clinical Staff Outcomes and impact The outcomes included the following practice changes: If a test is ordered to rule out C. Diff on a patient with diarrhea the patient is to be placed on contact isolation immediately (pre vious practice was to wait for the test results). For patients with positive C. Diff results they stay on contact isolation for their full MICU stay even if subsequent cultures come back negative EVS is to clean every surface in the occupi ed patient rooms daily. The EVS leadership was invited to attend MICU Unit Board to discuss ongoing concerns about cleaning practices and the potential effect this was ha ving on our ability to decrease our infection rates. During this meeting it was discovered that EVS was not cleaning patient equipment between patients or at all, includi ng EKG trunk cables and lead wires, SaO2, BP, and pressure cables. This was a surpri se to the MICU Unit Board. A consensus decision was made to get with Clinical Engineering immediately to find out which Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 85 cleaning products could be used and for the MICU nurses and care partners to take over this task until a better solution could be found. Developed a new sign to be placed on the fo am soap dispenser informing staff to wash with soap and water with this patient since the alcohol in the foam does not kill the C. Diff spores Agreed to re-commit to wearing gowns and gloves on all isolation patients Support for holding others accountable was verbalized and made public, including steps to take if did not get \"thank you\", including an invitation from Drs. Talbot and Wheeler to contact them if the push back was coming from a physician Re-education of MICU staff to assure that shared equipment was being wiped down between patients Having accessible sinks for soap and water washing was a problem - until 11/09 the sinks in the patient rooms were in the opposi te corner from the door to the room and there were minimal sinks outside of the patient rooms and they were not in close proximity to the rooms; the initial practice ch ange was to give staff permission to take off PPE walk across to the sink to wash ha nds prior to leaving the room. November 2009 the MICU moved into a new unit, now the sink s are right inside the door into the room, allowing for hand washing and immediate exit from the room. Change practice to do a te rminal clean on all isolation [EP7EO-Exhibit A-1-2009 April handwashing flyer ] Impact - see graph of infection rates per 1000 pati ent days; since November 2009 through July 2010 our average monthly C. Diff rate per 1000 pati ent days is 0.86. Doing a comparison with the same months the previous year - November 2008 - July 2009 the average rate is 3.59 per 1000 patient days.

Diff Infection Rate per 1000 Patient Days VMG - Use of Internal and External Experts to Initiate Changes in Anticoagulation Clinic Practices Purpose and Background Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 87 Anticoagulation therapy was being initiated in a number of clinics across the enterprise. Nurses in these clinics were using a variety of forms and strategies to manage patients' anticoagulation therapy. In addition there was no formalized training or standardization of processes to manage these patients. Nurses ha d to follow multiple protocols. Outcomes and adverse events could not be measured across th e organization due to the wide variation in protocols and process. There was a large influx of new patients and new staff with limited experience in managing a high risk, problem-pr one process of long term adult anticoagulation therapy. There were two formalized phone based anticoagulation clinics, one through the Pharmacy Department and one through Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute (VHVI), each using a different documentation tool. The inte rnal tool, developed by the RN staff in the Pharmacy based clinic was created using a fl ow sheet model. The Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute staff used a commercial pro duct designed for anticoagulation management. The commercial product representative, Lester Demaree, works with hospitals/clinics throughout the country and has up to date know ledge in current trends in anticoagulation management, patient safety strate gies and software features. The challenge was to create a single do cumentation tool that would be easily assimilated by nurses of varying backgrounds to minimize traini ng and standardize practice. The tool also had to be available to the VUMC pr oviders at large. Once anticoagulation practice is standardized (protocols developed), outcom e measurements will be more meaningful. In addition, the quality of care and safety for the patients would be greatly enhanced. The organization decided to initiate a si ngle source for anticoagulation management throughout the enterprise. This would enhance adherence to ev idence based practice, provide continuity of care and ensure patient safety. The Pharmacy and VHVI Clinics for management of anticoagulation therapy would be combined. All parties agreed on three import ant considerations for our work: A single software tool, easily unde rstood by all, was a must have Standardized practices (protocols) which fit the documentation tool had to be developed and consistent training was necessary Once standardized practices were hard -wired, outcome measurements could be extracted from the software data, enabling the system to measure like elements Methods and Approach Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 88 An extensive review of the workflow and use of the two informatics products by Health Information Systems was undertaken with nurse and pharmacy input. A decision was made to use the internally created flow sheet because it integrated with the electronic medical records system and the anticipated addition of decision support tools could be standardized and used by all parties. Lester Demaree, the third party software vendor, was used as an external expert, meeting with the Health Information Services Manager RN regarding common practices and transitioning the data to the internal flow sheet model. Experienced nurses served as internal experts and provided direct input in the development of the electronic anticoagulation flow sheet, specifically advocating decision support tools to dosage calculat ion for patient safety. The Health Information Services Manager was able to translate the nurses' recommendation s into a streamlined flow sheet format. Other enhancements included a documentation tool fo r low molecular weight heparin use (patient safety) and a patient education checklist to ensu re all key topics are covered (efficiency and quality). The Pharmacy RN staff and the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute RN staff, in concert with the RN Health Information Servic es Manager, provided input for key features which provide decision support (Coumadin dosa ge calculator), enhance documentation (low molecular weight heparin administration) and pati ent education (initial education checklist). The resulting tool was fine tuned for \"read-on ly\" access to providers so they had real time information regarding the status of their patients on anticoagulation therapy. Internal consultants included Information Technology, Pharmacy (Adult and Pediatric), Lab, Medicine and Nursing Management. The commercial product vendor (external consultant) provided detailed information regarding the f unctionality of anticoagulation management systems. Anticipated improvements included: Immediate recognition of current daily do sage and automatic dose calculation for current and future doses Consistent documentation of low molecular weight heparin use Consistent documentation of patient education More effective/efficient orientation of new staff using automated dosing calculations for anticoagulant dose checking and documentat ion cues with less reliance on memory Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) PharmD, BCPS,3; Good, Chester B.

The nursing st aff in each department collaborated on software changes and new processes that came with the initiation of the dosage calculator, documentation of low molecular heparin administra tion and the patient education checklist. An extensive training tool for the software was created by Health Information Services with review by the lead nurse for each group. An initial outcome report, extracted from flow sheet data was developed by Health Information Services in May 2010. The two separate teams (Pharmacy and Vande rbilt Heart) moved together to a larger office in June 2010. Additional staff has been hired to begin the process of expanding services to the rest of the enterprise. Efficiencies gained through software enhancements have: allowed more nurse/patient contact time (mea sured by the number of outgoing calls) Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 91 shown that greater compliance with the test ing regime has improved due to increased nursing contact with patients (fewer delinquent patients) shown a reduction of the backlog of calls to be made (decrease in the backlog of INRs to follow up on) The Time in Therapeutic Range has remained consta nt (the appearance of a slight decrease in April reflects those test results not yet received; the report is always slightly behind.)

Use of External Experts to Create a STEMI Network Purpose/Background In cardiology, there is a term that is very fa miliar to all healthcare providers and many in the lay public, \"Time is Muscle\" - heart muscle. In January 2007, a ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Network committee was formed to organize and implement protocols and systems for the emergent transfer of STEMI patients from outlying communities in middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. Current eviden ce suggests that patient's experience the best outcomes when they receive primary percut aneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 minutes of onset of myocardial infarction (M I) symptoms. To date, there are 15 hospitals participating in the Network. The timeframe fo r this work is from Ja nuary 2007 - January 2010. Many of the Cardiologists practicing at Vanderbilt have outlying clinics in middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. The Vanderbil t Chest Pain Center committee and the STEMI Network committee were working simultaneously to improve door to balloon (D2B) times of patients presenting directly to the Vanderbilt Emergency Department (ED) and those patients transferring to Vanderbilt from outlying community hospitals that do not have cardiac cath lab availability. Guidelines for STEMI treatment set forth by both the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Associat ion (AHA) were used. As medical and nursing practitioners, we feel strongly that people living in rural Tennessee and Kentucky deserve the same level of care and treatment of acute MI's as those living in urban areas. As mentioned earlier, there is strong evidence to suggest that PCI is the definitive treatment for STEMI, and many rural communities do not have nearby access to Cath Lab fac ilities. Also, the data in NRMI Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 96 3 & NRMI 4 clearly shows there is often a delay in treatment of STEMI's for patients requiring transfer to a PCI facility. Goals for our STEMI Program: 1) When a patient arrives to VUH ED, the door-to-balloon time will be less than 90 minutes 2) When a patient is transferred from an outlying hospital within a 60 mile radius of VUH, the door-to-balloon goal w ill be less than 90 minutes 3) When a patient is transferred from an outlying hospital greater than a 60 mile radius of VUH, the door-to-balloon time will be less than 120 minutes Methods/Approach An interdisciplinary group met weekly to a ssign roles and formulate protocols for each department at Vanderbilt involved in the care of a transfer patient. Once this was accomplished and systems were in place, Dr. Joe Fredi and Ca rol Scott RN, MSN, APN visited with ED medical directors, ED nurse managers, and hospital admi nistrators of outlying community hospitals to discuss the STEMI Network and the services it provides. When an outlying hospital indicates a desire to participate in the network, Carol Scott RN, MSN, APN travels to the facility and educates the ED staff on the Vanderb ilt STEMI protocol and procedures. A single phone call from the outlying ED physician connects the physician to the Vanderbilt emergency transport system (Flight Com). The dispatcher activates the cath lab through a single burst page and connects the Vande rbilt Cardiologist on-call to the outlying ED physician. Upon arrival, the patient is taken straight to the cath lab, bypassing the ED. Within 24 hours of a STEMI patient transf er, all departments involved at Vanderbilt including Interventional Cardiology, Intervention al Cardiology Fellow, Cardiac Access Center, Chest Pain Center Coordinator, Cath Lab, th e outlying ED nurse manager and ED medical director, and the Ground or Air transport service involved receive data identifying the times of each interval measured against the goals for each interval as set forth by the 2008 STEMI guidelines from the ACC/AHA. This allows for th e immediate identification of delays and then the department responsible for the process dela y is responsible to investigate and resolve issues. The STEMI Network committee now meets monthly to review case studies and to discuss system processes in orde r to improve patient outcomes. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 97 The STEMI Network also consulted with Ba rb Unger of Abbott Northwestern Level 1 program and Nancy Loberg of North Memorial Me dical Center Air Care, both in Minneapolis, MN, in November 2007. Ms Unger and Ms Loberg visited Vanderbilt and spent an entire day meeting with each department to help problem so lve and resolve issues that we experienced in the early stages of our program. Their expertise and the success of their programs resulted in each department recognizing the overall goals of a STEMI program and the paradigm shifts required to make a program successful.

Our three goals are being met the majority of the time and we continue to monitor and refine our program. By allowing the ED physician of the referr ing hospital to activate the STEMI alert, patients are arriving much faster to a PCI facility where percutaneous intervention is performed and therefore, reducing patient mortality - outlying ED physician and nursing staff, patient, Vanderbilt Cardiologists, cath lab, ground/air transport services receive continuous feedback to assist with ongoing improvement efforts Single phone call from outlying ED physician and automatic acceptance without approval from Vanderbilt Cardiology allows for simpler process and faster transfer and treatment - this outcome affects outlying ED physician and nursing staff, the Cardiac Access Center, Vanderbilt University hospital admitting, FlightCom (Life flight communications), patient, Cardiologists, cath lab Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 99 Simplified STEMI treatment protocol - this outcome affects outlying ED physician and nursing staff, patient Transmission of ECG's from the field by Em ergency Medical Service (EMS) or LifeFlight allows faster activation of cath lab - this outcome affects the patient, ground/air transport, Vanderbilt Cardiologists, cath lab Call back from Cardiologist to referring ED physician immediately after the case discussing catheterization findings and treatm ent provides professional collaboration - this outcome affects the Vanderbilt Cardio logist, referring ED physician, patient Feedback of the door-to-door- to balloon (DD2B) times within 24 hours to the referring hospital (those In the Network and Out of th e Network) allows for collaboration in order to improve system processes if needed - this outcome affects the patient, outlying ED staff Feedback of the DD2B times within 24 hours to the ground/air transport involved allows for collaboration in order to improve system processes if needed - affects patient, EMS, LifeFlight, AirEvac Feedback of the DD2B times within 24 hour s to Vanderbilt Cardiologist, Cath lab managers, Cardiac Access center, and Admitting allows for collaboration in order to improve system processes if needed -affects pa tient, Vanderbilt Cardiologists, cath lab, VHVI transfer center, and Admitting STEMI Network protocol states that patient is taken directly to cath lab upon arrival, bypassing the ED, allows for quicker treatm ent - affects Vanderbilt Cardiologist, cath lab, ground/air transport, patient, admitting, and ED staff All of the data collected on STEMI patients transferred to Vanderbilt is kept in a database. The data is collected by Carol Scott, RN , MSN, APN and it is entered into the database and managed by Dr. Rob Huang. Data collection and analysis are ongoing. The difference that the Vanderbilt STEMI Netw ork has made is evaluated by the remarks from outlying hospital ED physicians who state that \"the Vanderbilt program has set the standard that we measure all other programs by and they do not compare\". \"We love the simple protocol and that one phone call does it all\" . \"It is just so easy\". \"Vanderbilt is the only program that gives us feedback and we want to know how our patients are doing because these are people that we go to church with, ar e our neighbors, that our children go to school with their children\". Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 100 This information is used across the Vande rbilt organization to show improvements made in patient care and areas where improvement is needed. It is also used in presentations by Dr. Fredi and Carol Scott RN, MSN, APN discus sing STEMI's.

Feedback from the Patient/Fami ly Family Advisory Council obtained in November 2007, provided valuable data on the inconsiste ncies experienced by our patients. Additional analysis of patient satisfaction surveys showed: highly rated physician/n urse satisfaction and Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 102 perceived quality of care. However, scores were consistently low for abili ty to access and other key service-related indicators. Key metrics, such as Third Available Appointment, were provided but accuracy could not be verified. Other key operational and service metrics of access, such as Call Management, Telephone Nurs e Triage, Productivity, Template Utilization and Patient Flow, did not exis t prior to this effort. VMG Executive Leadership identified severa l strategic issues which they believed would negatively affect the ability to meet growth, customer service and innovation goals over the long term. These included the following: Barriers to access for patients and referring providers Varying service levels for patients and referring providers Inefficient use of existing space and staff resources Inconsistent application of evidence-based protocols for nursing triage Unclear role delineation for staff and nurses in the clinics Lack of common performance dashboards to facilitate dialogue regarding results The strategic plan for VMG called for very aggressive growth in key service areas. Additionally, the national economic climate and the competitive environment, coupled with the potential negative impacts on the healthcare industry, dictated the need to become more patient-centric and effectively utilize existing resources. North Highland (consulting company) was engaged to conduct an assessment of the clinics, identify key issues, formulate a roadma p for corrective action and estimate the return on investment to the organization. Their comprehensive initial review of clinic oper ations would answer several critical strategic questions: Ability and ease of referring provid er/patients to access the system Alignment of operations and measures to assess strategic objectives and goals Standardization of operations, both acce ss and clinic, across the VMG enterprise Evaluation of supporting technologies and investments Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 103 Ability to measure access, clinic operations and quality service level indicators of performance The approach for the comprehensive review was threefold: 1) Select four outpatient clinics and conduc t a full assessment to identify \"systemic enterprise\" operational issues (Urology, Surgical Service, Primary Care, Heart) 2) Create an Executive Leadership Group re presenting nursing (to include Executive Nursing Officer VUMC and Chief Nursing Offi cer VMG), Administration, Quality, Patient Advocacy, Informatics, Physicians and Development 3) Assign key leaders with the charge to re view the findings from the workgroup and determine key strategies to address any issues identified Methods/Approach Phase I The review process included a 3-month a ssessment working with clinic nurses, physicians and staff. Clinic patients and patient ad vocacy groups were also a part of the review. The effort identified four key areas which pr esented operational challenges across the VMG clinics: Strategy: Core Strategies across VUMC/VMG we re not clearly aligned or specific enough to plan integrated operations or impacts Operations: Inconsistent access and clinical delive ry operations created varying degrees of service and quality delivery for patients and referring providers across clinics Technology: Core operational/technology need s were not being addressed with as much rigor and attention as were initiati ves, which were viewed as innovative Measures: Common dashboards of success, incl uding access, operations and quality, were not available to clinical staff or provid ers to drive more consistent performance or behaviors Based upon the findings, the Senior Leadership Group, in conjunction with Executive Leadership of VMG, defined the need to a ddress the finding as a key component of the VUMC/VMG strategic plan. The decision wa s made to proceed with the following key initiatives: Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 104 Create the VMG Performance Improvement Office (PIO) Define the overall approach and plan to address the issues Define two key strategic clinics to co nduct the \"Learning Lab\" and Pilot the implementation of new processe s (Breast Center and Urology) Phase II The VMG PIO was created in September of 200 8. The mission of the PIO is to support and assist the clinics in designing and implemen ting operational models that improve access, service and evidence-based delivery of qualit y healthcare services for our patients. Strategy: Redesign and implement common/measurab le foundations for access operations Redesign and implement common/measurable foundations for clinical operations Support operations training and development goals of VMG Goals: Demonstrate significant and measurab le impact on key service levels Eliminate unnecessary variability and inconsis tency across clinic roles, processes and technology Design and implement common models to fu rther innovation and support our growth goals Create a foundation of learning and traini ng to export internally and externally The PIO staff is comprised of an interdiscip linary team representing various backgrounds and skill sets pertinent to the stated strategy and goals, including operations, nursing, information technology, strategy and finance. Th e current staff is comprised of a nurse in the role of Clinical Operations Director and four RNs representing a diverse set of clinical experiences and operations engin eering. The nursing team represents over 100 years of hands- on and nursing leadership experience. They serve as integral part of all efforts of the PIO team encompassing both Access and Clinic al Delivery redesign efforts.

The Urology Clinic represented a very high-volume patient care environment, as well as outpatient procedures. Nursing, physi cian and executive leadership determined the common access measures of success, as well as the nursing and operations staff to be involved in the redesign effort. The Vanderbilt \"Learnin g Lab\" model is an intensive review process involving a weekly four-hour Design Shop, whic h includes nurses, support staff, physicians, operations engineers, information technology specialists, PCC Administrators, human resources and others. The Design Shop proc ess is unique to each clinical service line. The purpose of the Design Shop is to assess all aspects of a ccess operations from the perspective of the patient/family or referring provider. The charge of the Design Shop team was to fully assess the current state of access operations, as well as design the future-state access model within the PIO framework and executive leadership guidelines. Nursing involvement from the executive level through the Design Shop process was a critical component for success. Results Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 106 The initial assessment for both Urology and the Breast Center revealed the following core operational issues: Call Management : Both clinics provided poor call service and did not effectively utilize call distribution technologies to route patien ts and referring providers to appropriate personnel. Telephone Nurse Triage: Neither clinic had centralized nurse triage. Evidence-based protocols were not documented or consistent ly applied. Clinic nurses handled nurse triage responsibilities at the end of the day, except in emergent or urgent situations. Staff Roles : Staff roles were unclear with inconsis tent expectations. Job responsibilities were overlapping with clinical staff perf orming clerical tasks and support staff performing clinical tasks. Scheduling : Patients were overbooked and inappropriately scheduled, resulting in delays and decreased patient satisfaction. Physician Templates: Physician templates were il l defined, based on provider preference, resulting in ine ffective clinic operations. Pre-Appointment Coordination : A lack of effective reco rds management resulted in delays and cancellations, requiring clinic nurses to \"chase down\" medical records. Access Leader : The Design Shop process identified the need for a clinical (RN or NP) Access Leader. Measures : Existing systems and data sets did not translate to meaningful or timely information. During subsequent assessment, the team addre ssed the issues identified above in terms of solution design/implementation and the defi ned measures of success. Solutions were implemented and tested in each of the Learning Lab clinics. Effective Call Manageme nt and Distribution: Automated Call Distribution systems were installed which provided options to direct routing of calls. Referring providers were given direct access and made a priority in the call distribution model. These efforts established measureable standards of service. Reorganized and Retrained all Access Staff to Team Model: Access Center staff was reorganized into specific roles includi ng Central Appointment Scheduler, Pre-Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 107 Appointment Coordinator and Patient Service Representative. Acce ss Center staff was retrained on technical content and patient service skills. Centralized Telephone Nurse Triage Function: Established new cent ralized nurse triage role, committed to a centralized model with evidence-based protocols and support tools. Consistent Evidence-Based Tele phone Nurse Triage Protocols: Established consistent, physician approved, evidence-based protoc ols for Telephone Nurse Triage role to improve consistency in standards of care. New Model for Clinic Nurse Team: Nursing leadership and staff nurses determined appropriate team model to be implemente d consistently across the VMG clinics. New Nurse Leader Role: Defined and established a new NP/RN Access Leader role within VMG. The Access Leader role is critic al to oversee access operations effectively. The primary function of this role is clinically driven; therefore it is necessary for a RN/NP to be in this role. New Focus on Coordinating Clinical Infor mation Prior to the New Patient Visit: Established the Pre-Appointment Coordinator (PAC) role to collect and organize all clinical and administrative informatio n prior to the new patient visit. New Technologies: Nursing, Operations and Inform atics collaborated to design and implement multiple operations and reportin g tools. These tools facilitate effective access operations, patient flow, pre-appo intment management and telephone nurse triage to support the Access Team. High Level Standards of Service: Measureable standards of service were established while building dashboards to monitor performance and initiate dialogue among the clinics. Below are some of the dashboard metrics/objectives: o Call Management: Less than 5% abandonment rate for all access lines, with an average answer speed of less than 30 seconds and no option for voice mail. o Pre-Appointment Management: At least 95% of all needed clinical or administrative information collected 2 days prior to new patient visit. o Patient Wait Time: Patients proceed to intake within 15 minutes of appointment time. o Space Utilization: Achieve at least 60% adjusted utilization of assigned space. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 108 o Physician Template Utilization: Meet all new patient appointment requests within 15 days. Work to Date The work to date has focused on the Access Model, which includes Call Management, Provider Templates, Pre-Appointment Management and Telephone Nurse Triage. Additionally, the work within the \"Learning Labs\" of the Brea st Center and Urology identified the critical need to create an additional role: an Access Te am Leader who would be a highly skilled RN with experience in the specific serv ice line the access team supports. Both new roles of telephone nurse triage and RN Access Le ader were developed accordin g to evidenced-based best practices. To date, the Access Models have been fully redesign ed for Breast Center, Williamson County Primary Care, Women's Center, Urol ogy and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. The core components of both the Access and Cl inical Delivery Models are defined below: Graph EP 7 EO - 6: Access Model ACCESS MODEL Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 109 Graph EP 7 EO - 7: Clinical Delivery Model CLINICAL DELIVERY MODEL Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 110 Table EP 7 EO - 7: Participants Design Team Strategic Role Marilyn Dubree, MSN, RN Executive Chief Nursing Officer, VUMC Margaret Head, MSN, MBA, RN Chief Operating Officer, VMG Project Leadership Service Lines Roles Ann S.

Service highlights include the following: Call Management: we currently receive approximat ely 1,060,000 calls annually, with less than 5% abandonment rate. Telephone Nurse Triage: we effectively manage over 200,000 clinical calls annually, which are triaged based upon evidenced-based pr otocols. This cent ralized nurse triage function handles 40% of clinical calls, reducing this workload on the clinics. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 111 Overall Access: we have created approximately 56, 000 patient appointment slots, of which approximately 30% are designated for new patients. Lead-time for new patient access has been reduced. Wait Times in Clinics: average wait times for initial intake has been reduced from 45 minutes to less than 15 minutes. Other significant enterprise-level benefits include: Clinical Nurse Model: Under nursing leadership, the team has defined a vision for the nurse model and scope of practice to be fo llowed once we begin the Clinical Delivery Model. Telephone Nurse Triage Evidenced-Base d Protocols and Standards of Care: Under nursing leadership the team implemented a centralized model of nurse triage and protocol development. Patients can elect to speak immediately with an RN to address their clinical issues. The nursing process is consistently used for all patients to determine status following evidenced-base d protocols. Approximately 40% of all patient calls can be handled without further c linic intervention. Audits revealed that patients select for non-clinical issues 0.5% of the time. This allows more time for the clinic nurses to lead the clinic team, focus on patient care, education and clinical quality. Nursing executive leadership has used this as a model to develop evidenced-based nurse triage protocols and pr ocesses for all VMG outpatient clinics in FY2011. NP/RN Access Leaders: The new Access Leader role was created to process critical clinical information related to scheduling and pre-appointment issues. Therefore, the Access Leaders are experienced NP's or RN 's who provide direction to the Central Appointment Schedulers, Pre-Appointmen t Coordinators, RN Coordinators and Telephone Triage Nurses. Additionally, th ey are part of the team developing and implementing all service-spec ific access strategies. Reporting Dashboards: VMG is developing a comprehensive set of dashboards to consistently measure access performance, in cluding Patient Wait and Cycle Times, Call Management Statistics, Staff Productivity, Pre-Appointment Coordination, Template and Space Utilization, and Nurse Triage Statistics. Quarterly Telephone Nurse Triage Audits: For those clinics that have redesigned the telephone nurse triage function, the Acce ss Leader completes a quarterly audit to further refine protocols, ensure quality of a ssessment standards and train the RN staff. Each triage nurse participates in the audit process. Exemplary Professional Practice Care Delivery System(s) (7 EO) 112 Technical Toolkit: The PIO team, in conjunction with Informatics, has deployed new tools to assist in the management of pr e-appointment administrative and clinical information. This information is reviewed routinely to ensure appropriateness of both scheduling and clinical processes. The Access Leader and RN coordinators work together to assess patient needs and critical clinical information.

The Chief Nursing Officers for VUMC and VMG have determined that every VMG clinic will need to develop and implement evidenced-based standards of ca re and documentation during FY2011. The approach and model developed during this pr ocess will serve as the common foundation. Additionally, the Chief Nursing Officers for VUMC and VMG, in conjunction with Informatics and Quality, have determined that effective outpatie nt telephone nurse triage should be a strategic priority. The information and data developed during this process will serve to define the business requirements for that eval uation and selection process. NOTE: A presentation was accepted entitled: \"Clinic Redesign: Improving the Patient Experience and Access to Care,\" to be delivered by the VMG CN O at the University Health System Consortium 2010 Performance Excellence Forum in March 2010. Summary Nursing has been involved from the beginning in a process that has proved to effectively and efficiently improve patient access to ca re and improve patient care (evidence-based protocols used by nurse triage ). Obviously, we are still in the process of rolling this process/redesign out to all of our clinics and w ill continue to measure outcomes. The data so far clearly shows that patients are benefiting from this work. "}
