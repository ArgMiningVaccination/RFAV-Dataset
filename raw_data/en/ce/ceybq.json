Lake Forest College has always been near and dear to my heart. My father, Dr. Bruce H. Kaplan, MD graduated in 1985, and I grew up going to LFC football games and listening about some of his happiest memories in college. I knew from a young age I wanted to pursue medicine as well and Lake Forest College had a tremendous science program and a great track record for getting their students into medical school. Additionally, I did not want to be sitting in a large lecture hall with little access to my professors. I desired small class sizes, chalk board lectures, and professors who would become life long mentors and friends. How did a liberal arts education make a difference for you? A liberal arts education was vital in making me a critical thinker and having a deeper understanding of physiology and pathophysiology at a fundamental level. A strong understanding of medicine is rooted in a deep appreciation of the basic sciences. This is because at lake forest college, the professors don't simply want you to know facts of a subject, but be able to interconnect them so students have a strong understanding of the material. In addition, the social challenges of medicine are just as important as the medical aspect. There are many challenging family discussions that must be had. The breadth of my liberal arts education prepared me for these challenging situations. LFC more than adequately prepared me for the rigors of medicine. What experiences outside of the classroom do you think helped prepare you for MD school. I was an emergency medical technician while at Lake Forest College. This was very important to me because it gave me an accurate depiction of healthcare in the United States and whether I would enjoy the practice of medicine. It is one thing to be interested in medicine and science, but entirely different to enjoy the practice of it. I implore all pre-medical students to be involved in medicine prior to beginning medical school to ensure they have chosen the right career. How did your time at Lake Forest help you prepare to apply to MD school programs? Beginning on my first day on campus I felt like I had a clear set of expectations in front of me of what I needed to accomplish in order to be able to get to medical school after college. The faculty was always there to ensure I did not deviate from this path that I so desperately wanted to be on. What do you think of the new Health Professions Program between LFC and RFU? Lake Forest College and Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science have always had a strong relationship. Many students from LFC have performed outstanding research and received various post-graduate degrees at Rosalind Franklin University. Personally, multiple former LFC classmates received their doctor of medicine from Rosalind Franklin and have flourished. It is outstanding to see Lake Forest College and Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science formally establish programs between the two schools to further increase the amount of outstanding Lake Forest College students that are able to achieve their dreams of being a health care professional though RFUMS. If this program were available while I was a student at LFC, I certainly would have attempted to receive a masters degree from RFUMS while in college to make myself a more competitive applicant for medical school. Peers of mine would have benefited from this program as well because they would have had more direct access to their health profession of choice. I look forward to seeing how this relationship grows in the near future. What skills and experiences at Lake Forest do you believe will help you be successful? Lake Forest College always challenged me to think for myself, challenge the status quo, and critically think. These skills are crucial in medicine where guidelines and treatment plans frequently change. Physicians need to personally evaluate whether these changes will improve outcomes for their patients or if further study is required. What advice would you give a high school student looking to pursue pre-health and is considering Lake Forest College? Lake Forest College provides all an ample amount of resources and opportunities to be successful in their health profession of choice. Lake Forest College lays the necessary foundation and develops the skills required to be successful in all graduate programs. The faculty are outstanding and truly deeply invested in their students and their professional aspirations. I fondly reminisce about my days at Lake Forest College and the outstanding education I received, which I still use daily as a practicing physician. "}
