Disclaimer: None of the information in this article constitutes medical advice, and is just the opinion of the writer(s). We recommend that patients follow their doctor's guidance in regard to supplemental oxygen. Boost Oxygen is a supplemental oxygen product that is inhaled through a can, and was featured on Shark Tank. The brand claims that their product provides \"all-natural respiratory support\" and that it's used by athletes \"for recovery and performance,\" by those experiencing poor air quality, and other groups. But is supplemental oxygen safe? Is it shown in medical research to have any benefits outside of a clinical setting like a hospital? And how do real users rate this product and describe its effects? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we review medical research to give our take on whether supplemental oxygen is safe and effective, share some concerns we have about the Boost Oxygen brand and share real, unsponsored user reviews of this product. Does Supplemental Oxygen Have Any Benefits? Supplemental oxygen is typically used in medical settings to treat severely ill patients, such as those with advanced respiratory infections or pulmonary diseases. We cannot identify a single clinical trial proving supplemental oxygen to have benefits for healthy adults. A clinical trial published in the Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise journal examined the effects of supplemental oxygen for recovery in athletes, and found that there was no benefit. Another clinical trial found similar results: athletes that received supplemental oxygen experienced no improvement to recovery or exercise performance. As medical research documents, supplemental oxygen becomes useful when a patient is experiencing low levels of oxygen in blood. This would be resolved with medical treatment and monitoring, not with a canister purchased online. We are unable to identify any benefits of supplemental oxygen for healthy adults, and the \"Information & Research\" section on Boost Oxygen's website does not appear to link to any clinical trials proving this therapy to be effective for any specific health outcome. Put simply, we do not understand the purpose or value of this product whatsoever, and the product quality concerns us. As Boost Oxygen's own website details, medical grade oxygen is over 99% pure oxygen, while Boost Oxygen is only 95% pure oxygen and is categorized as \"recreational\" oxygen. Again - why does anyone need \"recreational\" oxygen? We're truly confused by this brand. We are concerned about the safety of \"recreational\" oxygen because we cannot identify any long-term clinical trials proving oxygen at this purity to be safe for adults, and Boost Oxygen does not appear to link to any. Highly Questionable Health Claims on Boost Oxygen Website On the \"Information\" section of Boost Oxygen's website, the brand publishes blog posts suggesting that their products can be effective for treating a number of health conditions. One blog article, titled \"Supplemental Oxygen can help during Cold and Flu season,\" suggests with zero medical evidence or citations that supplemental oxygen can soothe inflamed airways resulting in easier breathing, and \"makes sense\" for those with flu or cold. This is unsafe, and this is a disease claim, which is regulated. We urge the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to look into these claims because it's concerning that a brand is making entirely unsubstantiated health claims about their product, which has never once been clinically tested. In another blog article, Boost Oxygen suggests that \"supplemental oxygen like Boost Oxygen\" makes sense for those experiencing shortness of breath with zero medical citations. We would urge patients experiencing shortness of breath to report these symptoms to a doctor or urgent care facility, because this can be a sign of serious health conditions. In the same article, the brand states that \"there is only 21% oxygen in the air we breathe,\" and \"the majority is useless 78% nitrogen.\" We don't even understand what Boost Oxygen is suggesting here. Humans evolved over millions of years breathing air just fine, without portable canisters purchased online. We hope that Boost Oxygen will remove any uncited health claims from their website and blog, and we consider this to be a huge red flag about the brand. Real, Unsponsored Boost Oxygen User Review A YouTube creator named Alphonso Duncan used the Boost Oxygen device while hiking and explained whether it was effective for reducing altitude sickness and improving endurance: What's in Boost Oxygen Flavors? No One Knows Boost Oxygen not only sells canned oxygen, but also sells \"flavored\" versions of canned oxygen. Again, why does someone need flavored oxygen? We're unsure. But what concerns us is that at the time of writing this article, whatever chemical compounds are used to create the flavor or smell are not listed on the product pages on the website, which is a consumer safety issue. The product is sold in various flavors such as Pink Grapefruit, Menthol-Eucalyptus, Peppermint and more. The lungs are an extremely sensitive organ and we believe that directly inhaling questionable flavoring compounds is a really bad idea. We urge the brand to publish information on their product pages about what constitutes these flavoring agents. Respiratory Therapist Reviews Boost Oxygen One of the most popular YouTube reviews of Boost Oxygen from a medical expert is published by a Respiratory Therapist (RT) named Jimmy McKanna. He reviews whether Boost Oxygen actually delivers 95% oxygen as the label claims, and whether he thinks the product will have any benefits: Boost Oxygen Real Customer Reviews Boost Oxygen is sold on Amazon, which is a more objective resource for customer reviews in our opinion than a brand's website. The unflavored version has been reviewed over 3,900 times with an average review rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars. The top positive review from a verified purchaser comes from a user named \"J. Carle\" who claims that the product was effective for aiding with altitude sickness: \"My mother came to Denver from out of town and did not do well with the high altitude. She was very sluggish. The oxygen cans helped.\" The top negative review from a verified purchaser is written by a user named \"N~~~B\" who performed an at-home test and claims the product is a scam: \"I sprayed the oxygen bottle at the flame on the long handle lighter. It blew out the flame completely. Spraying oxygen on a flame should increase the flame, not blow it out. I did these tests on both bottles. And performed these tests over the sink just in case. This is an utter scam. I am out $35 for two useless empty bottles.\" Boost Oxygen Price Breakdown Boost Oxygen is sold on the brand's website, and at various third-party retailers. Below is a price breakdown accurate as of the time of publishing this article, for a three liter (L) unflavored can. Brand website: $8.99 Walmart: $10.57 Amazon: $10.57 The official brand website appears to be the cheapest place to purchase this product.

Boost Oxygen makes a number of highly questionable claims on their website and blog that we suggest the FDA and FTC investigate, including the absurd and unscientific suggestion that the majority of the air we breathe is \"useless.\" This product is sold in a number of flavors, and the ingredients used to create these flavors do not appear to be published on the product pages. We strongly recommend that consumers do not inhale questionable flavoring compounds. We would recommend that all consumers avoid this brand entirely. "}
