Vaccines are made to meet the highest standards and are continually tested for safety and effectiveness. Do vaccines contain harmful ingredients? Although you may have heard some alarming things about vaccine ingredients, here are the facts. Vaccine Ingredients - [Aluminum](javascript:;) - Used in very small amounts to boost the body's immune response and make the vaccine more effective - Occurs naturally in the body and does not accumulate - usually leaves the body within two weeks - Naturally found in air, food and water - In the first six months of life, the amount of aluminum a baby receives from vaccines is significantly less than the amount they receive through breastfeeding or formula feeding - [Formaldehyde](javascript:;) - Used to keep some vaccines germ-free. The purification process removes almost all of the formaldehyde. - Produced naturally in the human body and helps with metabolism - There is about 10 times the amount of formaldehyde in a baby's body at any time than there is in a single dose of a vaccine - [Thimerosal](javascript:;) - Mercury-containing substance used as a preservative - There is more mercury in a can of tuna than in a vaccine - Thimerosal is not included in any of the routine childhood vaccines in Canada (except the flu vaccine) - Low doses of thimerosal have been shown to be safe Source: Immunization - Get the facts (Immunize Canada) Video: Vaccine Safety - Immunize Canada Video: Vaccine Hesitancy More Information [Vaccine Safety](https://immunize.ca/vaccine-safety)(Immunize Canada) [Immunizations and Vaccines](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/topics/immunization-vaccines.html)(Public Health Agency System](https://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/vaccine_safety)(Canadian Paediatric Society) [Anti-vaxxers exposed: Hidden camera investigation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V522Hs8E6NU&feature=youtu.be)(CBC Marketplace) "}
