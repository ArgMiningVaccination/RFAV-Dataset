The first few days of my stay felt like magic, but all the magic went away once I saw the true face of Miguel. UNSAFE due to the following: During the San Pedro pilgrimage, which was a full day hike on the mountainous Sun Island, we were a group of 16 people. We were supposed to stay together to maintain the safety and the cohesiveness of the group, however, Miguel who was leading the ceremony, was too fast ahead and didn't care to keep pace with other participants, especially that many of us were having our first experience with San Pedro and there was a lot of purging. This resulted in a huge separation of the group, and I was often walking for a long time, sometimes an hour or more without seeing any member of the group. Because of that, we nearly lost another participant when we all reached the final stop then realizing he was not there. Before the Sun-Moon dance, I expressed concerns regarding my ability to fast with no food or water for 3 days. Miguel said, if you feel that you can't continue the dance, you can always leave. However, during the dance, when I wanted to leave, he ridiculed me in front of others and said \"you're not a little girl.\" When my body couldn't take it anymore, the process of leaving the dance took about 2 hours to allow me a sip of water. Going from Allkamari to The Sun Island, Miguel drove recklessly with 8 of us in his car and he nearly had 3 accidents. He nearly hit an old woman and made her jump in horror off the road and didn't even stop to check on her. He never asked about my medical history or any physical or mental health issues. He also never briefed me, neither in person nor in a group about the safety precautions I need to take before participating in the sun and moon dance or plant ceremony. During my first and only Ayahuasca ceremony at Sacha Runa, it was just he and I. He left the ceremony frequently for a lengthy time. He explained after the ceremony that he wasn't feeling well in his stomach for the last few days and needed the bathroom. Why would he risk holding a ceremony with just him and me if he knew he wasn't well and can't fully support me during my first experience? NO INTEGRITY for the following reasons: He made promises he knew he couldn't fulfill just to get money out of me. When I contacted Miguel about the course, I initially wanted to start at the beginning of January, however, he pushed really hard for me to come in the middle of December to participate in the Sun-Moon dance. He said the course is going to be an intense learning experience and I will be participating in 2 to 3 ceremonies a week. He also said half of it will be in Allkamarin (the mountain retreat) and right after the Wachuma pilgrimage which ends on December 30, we will go to the jungles to start my Ayahuasca diet. These were all lies. Miguel later told me he has to be in Santa Cruz to meet with lawyers at the beginning of January for unknown period of time (maybe a few days) to deal with legal issues he has, and no one will be in the jungles. Despite him knowing about his legal issues well in advance, he pushed for me to come during those days, which meant that there was no time for me to go to the jungle for my Ayahuasca diet. I guess he wanted someone to pay for his legal fees. We discussed the living arrangement before booking my flight, and he promised me a room with a private bathroom, and I agreed that another female may share the room with me, but I wasn't going to share a room or a bathroom with 16 others in the dorms. After about 10 days of my stay, I was told that my room is booked and I need to move to the dorms. When I asked Miguel to honor our agreement he told me: \"You can't be poor and expect to be treated like a princess.\" I ended up booking a tour for 5 days to stay away until my room is available. Of course, he never offered a refund or compensation for those days. After, about a week of my stay, I realized that there was no learning happening. Miguel was not holding talks or explanations about the shamanic practices as he promised. He was rarely present and always too busy on the phone. When I addressed this issue with him, he said: \" Those rituals, anyone can make them up and you can learn from books.\" That's when I realized he is a fraud and I am wasting my time. I decided to pay for a new ticket to go back home. When he found out, he promised me one more ceremony before I go, but of course, he never fulfilled his promise. When I asked for a refund, he said: \" Your room cost $100 a night, and now you owe me money.\" Bear in mind that my tiny room didn't even have a closet and I was showering with cold muddy/brown water from a bucket during most of my stay because they have a serious water problem. So the room based on this condition couldn't cost more than $10 based on other Bolivian hotels. Before going to Bolivia, I asked Miguel specifically if anyone died or had a medical emergency during a retreat and he LIED and said no. Later, when I asked the question again to other employees and participants, I was that a young woman died in the third week of November during her retreat. Observing how Sacha Runa has no safety procedure or psychological assessment in place made me believe that there was some negligence from their side. These are only some of the bad things that happened during my Shamanic course at Sacha Runa. There were many other incidents I observed including bullying and betrayals from Miguel, however, since they didn't directly affect me I am not going to discuss them here. Feel free to contact me if you want to learn more. Despite my very negative experience with Sacha Runa, I met wonderful people on their healing journey. I also had a positive interaction with the other 3 shamans Juan, Angela, and Philip. "}
