No, we don't yet have an article on foot fetishism. Or professional wrestling for that matter. Heel is a [corporation](/wiki/Corporation) that develops, produces, and distributes distilled [water](/wiki/Water) [homeopathic](/wiki/Homeopathic) preparations. The company was founded in 1936 by Hans-Heinrich Reckeweg. Heel has offices in 40 countries worldwide including the [United States](/wiki/United_States), where it is located in Albuquerque, [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico). History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Heel&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Reckeweg was a [German](/wiki/German) homeopathy. In 1936, Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH was founded in [Berlin](/wiki/Berlin) to develop and market its preparations. In 1953 Reckeweg moved the company to its present location in Baden-Baden. Between 1936 (the company's founding year) and 1979 (when Reckeweg relocated to Albuquerque), he claims to have developed over 1,000 different homeopathic preparations. When Reckeweg relocated to Albuquerque he created Biological Homeopathic Industries (BHI) and began manufacturing combination remedies in tablet form. In 1997, the Albuquerque company was renamed Heel, Inc., which now manufactures and distributes both BHI products and Heel products. Heel products are primarily marketed to homeopathy practitioners, whereas BHI products are primarily marketed to consumers. Reckweg's theory of disease[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Heel&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Reckeweg was a denier of the [germ theory of disease](/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease) and developed his own idea called [homotoxicology](/wiki/Homotoxicology). Reckeweg believed disease was a response to the build-up of [toxins](/wiki/Toxin) in the body, relative to bodies' ability to expel these toxins. Heel has embraced this [quack](/wiki/Quack) theory and labeled it a \"modern cutting edge theory of homeopathy.\" Many of Heel's [distilled water preparations](/wiki/Snake_oil) are marketed to flush these toxins from people's systems. They have also started pushing their theories into [European](/wiki/Europe) colleges and universities as part of a [biological medicine](/wiki/Biological_medicine) program, even going so far as to endow a professorship at a German university.
