Experts Weigh In on the Best Gems for Pain, Anxiety, Heartbreak, and More Experts reveal the most powerful healing crystals for health and vitality, moving through heartbreak, easing anxiety and depression, and shifting limiting beliefs around money. Curious about crystals and how they can lend a hand in your healing journey? Whether you're looking to feel better in your body, restore emotional equilibrium, get through a bad breakup, or break through limiting money beliefs, there's a gem out there waiting to help you shine your brightest. Even though crystals have been treasured since ancient times for their healing powers \u2014 and mesmerizing beauty \u2014 they're having a major moment right now, making an appearance in jewelry, home products, candles, water bottles, even in serums and moisturizers. A Google search of \"online crystal shops\" yields more than 63 million results, not to mention that #crystal has 7.1 billion views on TikTok and 14.1 million posts on Instagram. Yulia Van Doren, author of the internationally bestselling book series The Modern Guide to Crystal Healing and founder of [Goldirocks](https://www.goldirocks.co/), credits the crystal renaissance to our burgeoning virtual world. She tells DailyOM, \"We've become so digitally oriented, and I think we're really craving the grounding [or connection to the Earth] of a natural physical object like a crystal. And because crystals are so social media-friendly due to their physical beauty, information on their healing benefits is more accessible now than ever.\" What Are Crystals and When Did They Become Used for Healing? Crystals are, well ... rocks, says [Kayce Laine](https://kaycelaine.com/), a certified crystal, [reiki](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/reiki-is-having-a-major-moment-but-does-it-really-work/), and sound practitioner and crystal bowls specialist teacher for the Sound Healing Academy. \"There are thousands of different crystals, and the process by which they're made and the minerals they're composed of creates their different physical and energetic properties,\" she tells DailyOM. \"Crystals are created when atoms come together and form a three-dimensional pattern called a crystalline structure that repeats, gradually growing from a microscopic cluster of atoms to the crystals you find at a metaphysical store.\" The use of crystals for their healing properties isn't anything new, explains Kristen Blythe, whom DailyOM spoke with for this story. The holistic life coach, intuitive energy healer, and teacher at [Rooted Wisdom Holistic Life Coaching](https://rootedwisdomcoaching.com/) says, \"Crystals have been used for thousands of years, dating as far back as the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia. Their use has been identified in cultures throughout the world, such as ancient Egypt and Greece.\" Take the Course: [The Intuitive Crystal Connection](https://www.dailyom.com/courses/the-intuitive-crystal-connection/) The Science Behind Crystal Healing When used in certain ways, scientists agree that there is undeniable value to crystals. \"Our modern technological world is, in many ways, made possible by crystal technology because of their ability to transform pressure into an electrical current,\" Van Doren says. Take LCD (liquid crystal display) TVs or quartz watches, for example. As for the specific theory behind crystal healing, here's where things get a little tricky: Although alternative medicine experts believe in the power of crystals to positively influence the body, no one has scientifically linked crystals to improved health and well-being, and research from 2001 has shown that [a placebo effect may be at play](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1328277/New-Age-crystal-power-is-all-in-the-mind.html)). But some, such as Laine, believe that crystals do have a powerful impact on us. \"On a molecular level, our cells are rather imperfect,\" she says. \"They tend to fluctuate and are easily influenced by other, stronger vibrations that enter into our biofield.\" Crystals, on the other hand, are nearly perfect structures without molecular flaws or impurities, which Laine says leads to a stronger vibration with the power to elevate our own body's energy. How Crystals Can Help You Heal Van Doren believes there are three main \"channels\" through which crystals operate: vibration, color, and as a talisman (an object believed to hold magical properties that offer luck and protection to the owner). Although the vibrational theory has yet to be proven, she notes that \"it has been scientifically documented that [colors have different effects on your emotional and mental well-being](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969996119303547?via%3Dihub). Crystals come in unique, beautiful colors, and having one in your physical space brings that color \u2014 and benefit \u2014 into your space.\" One of the most powerful ways to use a crystal is as a talisman, Van Doren adds. \"When you bring a crystal into your life, with a specific intention in mind, it transforms into a personalized, magic-filled talisman. For example, let's say you want to heal from a breakup and [find a partner](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/how-to-manifest-love-and-what-to-do-if-it-doesn-t-work/), and so you buy a rose quartz, which is the most popular 'love' crystal. Every day, when you see the crystal, your subconscious is reminded that you deserve to be loved, that you believe love is coming \u2014 and that changes your vibration, and what you attract and [manifest](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/what-is-manifesting-and-how-do-you-do-it/).\" Blythe agrees that the healing \"magic\" of crystals occurs at an energetic level. \"Crystal healing work is based on energy or vibration, and therefore crystals have an impact on our energy,\" she says. \"When our energy becomes more balanced, our spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical states follow suit.\" The Best Crystals for Healing Whether you believe in crystals for the magic they contain or feel they're more significant after you bring your own experience to them, they can be a gorgeous addition to your life. \"When you bring a crystal into your life, with a specific intention in mind, it transforms into a personalized, magic-filled talisman.\" Not sure which crystal is right for you? Go with your gut when in a crystal shop or even browsing online, our experts advise. Ask yourself, What am I drawn to? And remember, what matters most is the intention behind your crystal. It doesn't matter if you wear crystal jewelry, carry a stone in your bag, or place a beautiful gem on display. What matters is that the crystal is visible, so that you can subconsciously and consciously harvest your intentions behind it. A word of caution from Laine: \"Crystals should never be seen as a replacement for proper medical care. They should only be used in conjunction with whatever other medical treatment is appropriate for your specific problem.\" Crystals for Physical Vitality, Well-Being, and Pain Relief Bloodstone This dark green-hued crystal supports balance in the blood and circulation, making it beneficial for conditions involving the blood, Blythe tells us. Carnelian Increase your energy levels and vitality with this red pick from Van Doren. If you're experiencing hormonal issues, Blythe says it can help ease [menstrual](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/what-is-cyclical-living-plus-how-to-workout-based-on-your-menstrual-cycle/) pain and lower back pain, as well as balance fertility challenges and [libido](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/hotter-sex-after-40-weighing-out-age-related-challenges-and-benefits/). Jasper Available in a variety of colors with green, pink, and brown notes, jasper promotes physical strength and vitality, according to Laine. \"It's a great crystal for preventing illness when worn or carried.\" (Van Doren also likes jasper for [relief from anxiety](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/how-to-tap-your-anxiety-away-with-eft-tapping/) and depression.) Ruby Although we often think of them as expensive gemstones, red rubies are also available as inexpensive, tumbled stones, according to Van Doren. \"Ruby is a long-beloved gemstone with so much legend and lore, often revolving around warriors. They viewed it as very strengthening and protective, and would wear it into battle to empower themselves.\" Crystals for Healing From Heartbreak and Attracting Love Malachite Corresponding to the heart chakra, this green crystal addresses both the emotional and physical ailments of the heart, says Laine. Moreover, adds Blythe, malachite \"can help us stay open to love, even after heartbreak, and can help us trust enough to love again.\" Rhodochrosite It carries an energy of unconditional love and promotes trust and positive action in relationships, Blythe says of the pink stone. \"It can also allow us to process difficult situations related to the heart in a loving, compassionate, and truthful way.\" Rhodonite Thanks to its black manganese content, rhodonite is particularly grounding and stabilizing, Van Doren says. \"Its pink coloring, correlating to the heart chakra, makes it comforting for a bruised or broken heart.\" Rose Quartz This is Van Doren's go-to for heartbreak. She describes the ballet-pink gem as an \"all-star\" with many benefits. Adds Blythe, \"It helps to balance the heart and bring in the peaceful, soft energy of compassion and unconditional love. It is excellent at helping during times of grieving and loss, as well as cultivating self-love and [love for others](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/what-is-true-love-experts-explain-what-it-looks-and-feels-like/).\" Crystals for Depression and Anxiety Amethyst Amethyst is one of those versatile stones, and it also offers emotional support. \"Amethyst is excellent for helping calm unbalanced and repetitive thoughts,\" Blythe says of the purple rock. Clear Quartz If you're seeking more harmony within, clear quartz can help. \"It promotes clarity of thought,\" Blythe says, \"and it can help us overcome imbalances in all parts of our being \u2014 physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.\" Labradorite One of Laine's favorites, this iridescent green, blue, and brown crystal is known for its magic, protection, and hope, she says. Lepidolite This purple stone is commonly referred to as \"crystal Xanax\" due to its high lithium content, Laine says. Blythe adds, \"It can help you release negative thoughts and emotions, ease symptoms of depression and anxiety, and [promote calm](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/how-meditation-reduces-anxiety/).\" Crystals for Manifesting Wealth and Abundance (aka the Money Stones) Citrine This yellow or golden variety of quartz is also known as the \" [money](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/reach-your-money-goals-with-these-8-powerful-financial-affirmations/) stone,\" since it's believed to bring prosperity and wealth, Laine explains. Adds Blythe, \"It helps promote self-esteem, confidence, and personal power, so it is an excellent crystal for [attracting money and shifting beliefs around abundance](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/improve-your-relationship-with-money-by-practicing-financial-wellness/) of all forms.\" Emerald Another stone with a long lineage, emerald (which is also available in inexpensive versions) was treasured by the ancient Egyptians for fertility and health, Van Doren says. \"Emeralds radiate powerful energies of growth and manifestation, which make them a favorite abundance crystal.\" Jet This charcoal stone \"is excellent for transforming the fears of the past so that we can access our best future,\" Blythe tells us. \"It helps us focus on what we are wanting to attract in life and can help us take responsibility for the past so that we can move forward in new ways.\" Pyrite One of Van Doren's favorites, metallic pyrite \"is great for anchoring your ideas, energy, and [creativity](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/7-science-backed-ways-to-channel-creativity/) into this dimension,\" Laine agrees: \"Also known as 'fools' gold,' pyrite is a stone for manifestation, action, and ambition.\" The Bottom Line If you want them to be, crystals can be more than just pretty objects when amplified with your healing intention. \"As a society, we have largely removed ourselves from [nature](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/5-simple-ways-to-connect-with-nature-in-your-everyday-life/),\" Blythe says. \"One of our solutions is to bring one of nature's energy balancers \u2014 crystals \u2014 into our homes [and hearts]. They are beautiful, make us feel better even if we don't fully understand how, and help us reconnect to the very substances the Earth is made of.\" Brilliant, isn't it?
