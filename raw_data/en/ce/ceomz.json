When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case d ata, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,147,772 for BC overall) and for ye ar 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2021 estimates (n= 5,19 4,137 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: Health Authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on February 13, 2022 , laboratory data on February 11, 2022 , PIR vaccine coverage date on February 11, 2022, and PCMS hospitalization data on February 13, 2022 . Table of Contents Epidemic curve and regional incidence 2 Test rates and % positive 3 Age profile, testing and cases 4 Severe outcomes 6 Age profile, severe outcomes 7 Care facility outbreaks 8 Modeling 9 Wastewater surveillance 9 Additional resources 10 Appendix 10 Hospital admissions and deaths are stable but elevated; provincial COVID -19 incidence decreases. Due to changes in testing strategies in BC, case counts in this report likely underestimate the true number of COVID -19 cases in BC. This underestimation has increased compared to the period prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant in BC. The provincial i ncidence by episode date was 171 per 100K (9,020 cases ) in week 5 , a decrease since week 4 which had an incidence of 214 per 100K (11,242 cases) . Incidence by Health Authority decreased from week 4 to week 5: Fraser Health incidence decr eased from 165 to 120 per 100K Interior Health incidenc e decreased from 395 to 349 per 100K Vancouver Island Hea lth incidence decreased from 177 to 151 per 100K Northern Health incid ence decreased from 412 to 388 per 100K Vancouver Coastal Health incide nce decreased from 147 to 97 per 100K Testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased from the p eak of ~88,900 in week 51 to ~28 ,400 in week 5 . The positivity of MSP -funded specimens decreased slightly between week 4 (35.8%) and week 5 (33.7%). The per capita testing rates decreased in all HAs from week 4 to week 5 . Testing rates decreas ed in all age groups from week 4 to week 5 . Age-specific incidence rates decreased from week 4 to week 5 across all age groups. Incidence rate decreased the most in the <10 age group from 244 per 100K in week 4 to 172 per 100K in week 5. The number of hospital admissions decreased slightly from 710 in week 4 to 677 in week 5. In week 5, 60 -79 year -olds had the highest number of hospital admissions (255 hospitalizations). Hospital data include admissions for people diagnosed with C OVID -19 through hospital SARS - COV -2 screening practices, and will overestimate the number of people who are hospitalized specifically due to severe symptoms of COVID -19 infection. The weekly number of deaths was relatively stable at 67 in week 4 and 72 in week 5. Those aged 80+ accounted for the highest number of deaths in week 5 (44 deaths) In week 5, 10 new outbreaks were declared, based on earliest case onset date. 25 of the 72 deaths (35%) reported in week 5 were associated with care facility outbreaks. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 5 Page 2 of 10 A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Due to changes in testing strategies in BC, case counts in this report likely underestimate the true number of COVID -19 cases in BC. This underestimation has increased compared to the period prior to the emergence of the Omi cron variant in BC. Up to week 5, there have been 334,175 cases for a cumulative incidence of 6,342 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ). The provincial incidence by episode date was 171 per 100K (9,020 cases) in week 5 , which has decreased from the most recent peak of 407 per 100K in week 52. Incidence by episode date may increase as data become more complete in recent weeks . As shown in Figure 2 , incidence has decreased in all HAs from week 4 to week 5. From week 4 to week 5 , incidence rates decreased the most in Vancouve r Coastal Health (VCH) and Fraser Health (FH) fro m 165 per 100K to 120 per 100K from 147 per 100K to 97 per 100K, respectively. Incidence rates also decreased in Vancouv er Island Health (VIHA) from 177 per 100K in week 4 to 151 per 100K in week 5, and in Northern Health (NH) from 412 per 100K in week 4 to 388 per 100K in week 5 . While incidence has also decreased from weeks 4 to 5 in IHA, from 395 per 100K to 349 per 100K, incidence rates in week 5 are the highest in this region. Table 1.

Test rates and percent positive COVID -19 testing guidelines have been updated recently - testing is recommended for peo ple who have COVID -19 symptoms and for whom testing is c linically indicated (including individuals who are hospitalized, pregnant, moderately to severely immunocompromised, or unvaccinated or with vaccines not up to date) or who live/work in high -risk settings. As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 3 , testing of MSP -funded specimens has decreased from the p eak of ~88,900 in week 51 to ~32,000 in week 4, which further decreased to ~28,400 in week 5 . The positivity of MSP -funded specimens decreased slightly between week 4 (35.8%) and week 5 (33.7 %). As shown in Figure 4 , the per capita testing rates (Panel A) decreased in all HAs from week 4 to week 5. From week 4 to week 5, testing rates decreased the most in VCH from 385 per 100K to 299 per 100K . In week 5 , NH had the highest testi ng rate at 1,010 per 100K. Percent positivity (Panel B) for MSP -only specimens increased in NH, decreased in VCH and FH, and remained stable in IH and VIHA from week 4 to week 5. Percent positivity in week 5 ranged from 34.4% in VCH to 40% in VIHA . Figure 3.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 5 , testing rates decreased or stabilized from week 4 to week 5 in all ag e groups. Testing rates in week 5 was hi ghest in those aged 80+ at 1,269 per 100K. As shown by the black dots in Figure 5 , the percent positivity decreased or stabilized in all age groups from week 4 to week 5 . The high est percent positivity in week 5 was in the 5 -9 and 10 -14 year -olds at 52.8% and 54.6 %, respectively. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 6, age-specific incid ence rates decreased from week 4 to week 5 across all age groups. Incidence rate decreased the mo st in the <10 age group from 244 per 100K in week 4 to 172 per 100K in week 5. Age-specific incidences may increase as data become more complete.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of hospital admissions decreased slightly from 710 in week 4 to 677 in week 5. In week 5 , 60-79 year -olds had the highest nu mber of hospital admissions (255 hospitalizations). Hospital data include admissions for people diagnosed with COVID -19 through hospital SARS -COV -2 screening practices, and will overestimate the number of people who are hospitalized specifically due to severe symptoms of COVID -19 infecti on. The weekly number of de aths was relatively stable at 67 in week 4 and 72 in week 5 . Those aged 80+ accounted for the hi ghest number of deaths in week 5 (44 deaths) ( Table 2, Figure 8 ). Detailed information about outcomes by vaccination status can be accessed at BCCDC COVID -19 Regional Surveillance Dashboard . Other information on mortality can be found at the BCCDC Mortality Context Application. Cumulatively, there have been 23 confirmed cases of Multi -syste m Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (MIS - C) in BC since January 1, 2020. There has been no new confirmed cases of MIS -C since the last report. The median age of all cases is 9 years old (range from 1 to 16 years old). Table 2.

Care facility outbreaks As shown in Table 4 and Figure 9, 578 care facility (acute and long -term care setting) outbreaks were reported in total in BC to the end of week 5. In week 5, 10 new outbreaks were declared, based on earliest case onset date. The number of new outbreaks have been declining since week 3 , and the majority have been in long -term care facilities . 25 of the 72 deaths (35 %) reported in week 5 were associated with care facility outbreaks. The number of deaths may increase over time as data becomes mor e complete. Table 4.

As of week 46, VCH and FH no longer declar e outbreaks with single staff cases unless there is evidence of transmission within the facility . G. Modeling Current Rt estimates for BC are considered unreliable due to recent and ongoing changes in the ascertainment of case counts, including capacity limitations of PCR testing and the use of rapid antigen tests . H. Wastewater surveillance The BCCDC and Metro Vancouver have been testing for SARS -CoV-2 in wastewater at five wastewater treatment plants (representing 50% of BC's population) since May 2020 , in order to assess whether COVID -19 virus is present and how it might be changing over time . To account for possible effects of wastewater volume, SARS -CoV-2 concentrations have been normalized by daily wastewater flow. As shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11 , viral signal from the wastewater surveillance correl ates with COVID -19 case counts.
