{"title": "COVID-19 Vaccination-Induced Rash: Does the Choice of Vaccine Matter?", "author": "Mansoor Zafar; Baby Ewnetu; Saif Ahmed; Uzair Iqbal; Mark Whitehead", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "With the introduction of large-scale vaccination programmes against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the world has now begun to visualise a possible end to the ongoing pandemic. As with any vaccination programme, reports of side effects have begun to emerge in the wake of vaccinations. Initial reports were about mild side effects, such as local inflammation, pain, and fever. However, as a significant number of the population began to receive various COVID-19 vaccines, reports of various other moderate to severe side effects have now started to emerge. Although these side effects seem to be rare, the symptoms can be severe, and information and guidelines on how to manage them are scarce. In this case series, we discuss the incidence of widespread rashes that develop in some individuals after receiving COVID-19 vaccines by both AstraZeneca (AstraZeneca plc, Cambridge, UK) and Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer Inc., Brooklyn, NY; BioNTech SE, Mainz, Germany). The systemic skin reaction varied from maculopapular rashes to papules and patches that were widespread and not simply localised to the vaccine injection site. Further clinical information, awareness, and guidelines for practicing clinicians need to be exigently provided as vaccination programmes approach completion and the incidences of moderate to severe side effects of COVID-19 vaccination are becoming more apparent and pervasive.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2021-06-07", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
