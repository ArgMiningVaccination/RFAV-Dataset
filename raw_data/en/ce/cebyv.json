Here are summaries of a few recent studies that have grabbed our attention here at Holistic Primary Care. Modified Atkins Reduces Seizures in Drug Resistant Epilepsy A modified Atkins diet\u2014a less restrictive version of the \"classic\" high-fat, low carb ketogenic diet\u2014can reduce seizure frequency and behavioral problems in drug-resistant epilepsy, according to a new study of 160 adolescents and young adults. All patients were on at least 3 anti-seizure meds at maximum doses, yet continued to have more than two seizures per month. At six months, 26% of those following the diet had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures, versus just 2.5% among the controls who were on the drugs alone, with no dietary intervention. This is not the only study to suggest that ketogenic diets like the modified Atkins can be helpful in reducing frequency and severity of seizures. But most previous studies have been in epileptic children. This is the first trial to show benefits for teens and adults (Mala Manral, et al. Neurology, Jan 2023). High DHA Cuts Alzheimer's Risk A new prospective observational study of more than 1,400 participants in the Framingham Offspring Cohort project showed that those in the highest quintile for red blood cell docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had a 49% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than those in the lowest DHA quintile. All participants were over age 65. This is one of a number of positive signals to emerge from the Framingham Third-Generation study. There were also robust correlations between higher red cell omega-3 concentrations, healthier brain structures, and better cognitive function (Satizabal C, et al. Neurology. 2022). A\u00e7a\u00ed Reduces Arterial anthocyanidin-rich a\u00e7a\u00ed-ju\u00e7ara (Euterpe edulis Martius) pulp resulted in a measurable change in pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, in a cohort of overweight individuals. Cardiologists at the Rio Grande do Sul/University Foundation of Cardiology, Porto Alegre, Brazil, randomized 55 people with BMIs of 25 kg/m2 or greater, to restricted calorie diets with or without daily intake of 200 grams of A\u00e7a\u00ed, the small purple fruits of a particular species of Amazonian palm trees. After 12 weeks, the subjects in the A\u00e7a\u00ed group showed a statistically significant reduction in PWV from baseline. There was no such change in the non-A\u00e7a\u00ed group (Arisi TO, et al. Phytother Res. 2022). A\u00e7a\u00ed fruit has been an important staple food for indigenous Amazonian peoples for thousands of years. Over the last decade, it has become very popular in the US and internationally, often promoted as a \"superfood\" owing to its high antioxidant content, as well as to preliminary data suggesting it can reduce serum cholesterol levels. B Vitamins LowerMetabolic Syndrome Risk People in the highest quintile for total folate intake have a 61% lower incidence of metabolic syndrome compared with those in the lowest folate quintile. Similarly, those in the highest quintile for vitamin B6 had a 39% lower risk; those at the highest level of B12 had a 26% reduced risk. Those are the key findings from a massive NIH-funded prospective study involving more than 4,400 young Americans followed for roughly 30 years, from 1985 to 2016. The researchers took detailed diet assessments at years 0, 7, and 20, and measured serum concentrations of folate, B6 and B12 in years 0, 7, and 15. Participants, half of whom were Black, had a mean age of 24 years on enrollment. Over the ensuing three decades, a total of 1,240 of the 4,414 participants (28%) were diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Across all racial and gender categories, the researchers found the same inverse relationship between B vitamin intake and reduced incidence of metabolic syndrome (Zhu J, et al. JAMA Network Open. 2023). This is not the first paper to suggest that higher B vitamin intake can reduce cardiovascular risk. But it is the largest and most comprehensive prospective study to date. Though not an intervention trial, it does make a strong case for supplementation, because the vast majority of people in the highest B vitamin quintiles were supplement users. The findings also challenge the notion that the heart benefits of B vitamins are solely due to lowering of homocysteine. In a subset of their subjects, Zhu and colleagues adjusted for serum homocysteine and still found significant risk reductions, suggesting that B vitamins have multiple effects on metabolism. \"Low status of these B vitamins may lead to dyslipidemia, vascular endothelial dysfunction, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance through oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and impairment of nitric oxide synthesis, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome,\" they concluded. Vitamin D SupplementationMay Prevent Melanoma People who routinely take vitamin D supplements appear to have a markedly lower risk of melanoma compared with those who never take the \"sunshine vitamin,\" according to dermatological researchers at the University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio. In this cross-sectional study, the researchers examined 498 adults (253 males, 245 females) between the ages of 21 and 79 years, for all types of skin cancers as well as non-cancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses and pigmented nevi. Based on patient self-reported vitamin use, they divided the cohort into three groups: non-users, occasional users, and regular users. For 260 of the patients, they were able to measure serum vitamin D levels. Vitamin D use did not appear to impact the likelihood of having actinic keratoses, pigmented nevi, basal or squamous cell carcinomas. But there seemed to be a clear effect on melanoma. Among the non-users, 32.3% had melanomas at the time of examination or a past history of this type of skin cancer. In the regular users, 18.1% had present or past melanomas, a 56% comparative reduction in risk (Kanasuo E, et al. Melanoma Res. 2022). This observation is certainly noteworthy, but the authors acknowledge that it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion about the preventive potential of vitamin D, because for the majority of the study participants, they relied exclusively on self-reported intake. In the subgroup for which they had actual serum vitamin D measurements, Kanasuo and colleagues did not see the same clear inverse relationships between the vitamin and skin-related parameters. \"Regular use of vitamin D associates with fewer melanoma cases, when compared to non-use, but the causality between them is obscure.\" Low Vitamin D Raises Diabetic Foot Ulcer Risk Preliminary data from 339 older adults with type 2 diabetes shows that those with foot ulcers had markedly lower serum vitamin D levels compared to diabetics of similar age, ethnicity, and disease severity who do not have foot ulcers. The patients with foot ulcers had a mean serum vitamin D level of 29 nmol/L versus a mean 37 nmol/L among the ulcer-free patients (Wang F, et al. BMC Endocrine Disorders. Preprint May 2022). The study, by researchers at the Department of Endocrinology, Air Force Medical Center, Beijing, is still under peer review, and the observed correlation does not prove causation. But the findings do suggest that the severity of diabetes is inversely related to vitamin D status. Daily Potassium Cuts Heart Risk for Salt-Loving Women Analysis of data from a European cohort of over 13,000 women showed that for women in the highest tertile of daily sodium intake, every one-gram increase in daily potassium conferred a 2.4mmHg lowering of systolic blood pressure. This translated into a 13% reduction in incidence of cardiovascular events among the salt-loving women over a median follow-up of 19.5 years (Wouda RD, et al. Eur Heart Journal. 2022). Notably, this inverse relationship between potassium and cardiovascular risk was not observed among the men in the high-salt tertile. \"Potassium intake deserves more attention,\" concluded lead investigator Liffert Vogt, MD, PhD, of Amsterdam University Medical Center. \"The association between potassium intake, systolic blood pressure, and CVD events is sex-specific,\" the authors note. \"The data suggest that women with a high sodium intake in particular benefit most from a higher potassium intake with regard to systolic blood pressure.\" Tart Cherry Boosts Exercise Performance Short-term supplementation with anthocyanidin-rich tart cherry extract can boost exercise performance in hypoxic conditions, according to a new placebo-controlled study involving healthy young people. Previous studies and metanalyses have suggested that tart cherry can increase performance speed or prolong time to exhaustion, possibly by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and boosting oxygen delivery to working muscle tissue. In the present study, researchers at Japan's National Institute of Fitness and Sports, randomized 15 college-aged people (11 men, 4 women) to five days of a placebo or Nature's Life tart cherry product (1200 mg capsules containing 100 mg anthocyanin). The subjects took the assigned treatment twice daily for 4 days, and then once on the 5th day, which was the day of the exercise tests. The same participants then switched treatments for a second 5-day period of supplementation and testing. The testing involved a series of strenuous cycling exercises under hypoxic conditions which pushed participants to exhaustion, defined as: 1) no increase in VO2 despite a further increase in work rate; 2) heart rate at 90% of age-predicted max; 3) a rating of 19 on Borg's scale of perceived exertion, or 4) inability to maintain a pedaling rate above 50 rpm. During the exercise periods, the researchers measured a range of metabolic variables. Thirteen of the 15 volunteers completed the full study. Compared with placebo, tart cherry increased the time to exhaustion in 10 of the 13 participants. The mean time to exhaustion was 940 \u00b1 84 seconds for the supplement versus 912 \u00b1 63 seconds for the placebo. The difference was small but statistically significant (Horiuchi M, et al. Nutrients. 2023). The tart cherry reduced hypoxia deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) while increasing both tissue oxygen saturation peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the vastus lateralis muscle tissue, all of which suggests improved oxygen supply to the muscles. It also reduced urine levels of 8-hydro-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), indicating an antioxidant dysbiosis, restored gut flora diversity, and attenuated side effects in a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Researchers at Nanchang University Hospital, China, randomized 100 patients undergoing surgical resection and chemotherapy for CRC to a placebo or to the probiotic combo taken thrice daily, from the third postoperative day to the end of the first course of chemotherapy (Capecitabine plus Oxaliplatin, XELOX regimen). The probiotic tablets provided over 0.5 \u00d7 106 CFU of B. infants, L. acidophilus, E. faecalis, and over 0.5 \u00d7 105 CFU of B. cereus, respectively. Chemotherapy regimens like XELOX can wreak havoc on a patient's gut microbiome, reducing microbial diversity of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. These changes contribute to the burden of symptoms and side effects that many patients experience. The data indicate that compared with the placebo, the probiotic reduced incidence of chemo-associated nausea (11% vs 34%), reflux vs 40%). The probiotic patients showed increased overall microbial diversity, reduced levels of problematic organisms like Akkermansia and Clostridium, and restoration of beneficial bugs like Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium. Fecal analysis showed an increase in production of butyrate, acetate, propionate, and other important short-chain fatty acids (Huang F, et al. Nutrients. 2023). \"These results support the beneficial effects of the probiotic interventions as novel alternative or complementary strategies in chemoprevention,\" the authors concluded. A number of assessment tools can be used to determine if a patient is at risk of myocardial damage caused by cardiometabolic disease and/or COVID infection. Many of these tests also reflect the general dysfunction of cellular metabolism that underlies a host of chronic conditions. Vitamin D3 Level: There are so many good reasons to measure a patient's level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) in the blood. Vitamin D3 is important for the prevention and treatment of heart disease and viral infections. It is a simple inverse relationship: if vitamin D is low, risk is higher. Statistically, low vitamin D correlates strongly with COVID risk. Vitamin D also activates many cancer prevention genes; women with high levels of vitamin D3 (60-90 ng/ml) have an 82% lower risk for breast cancer. Most studies indicate that risk of CVD rises when vitamin D levels drop below 30 ng/ml. Optimal levels for protection against CVD are in the range of 60-90 ng/ml. GlycoMark: The GlycoMark test measures blood levels of 1,5-Anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a glucose-like sugar found in many foods. It is an indicator of the average maximum blood glucose level over the previous 14 days. A sharp decrease in circulating 1,5-AG signals that a patient has frequent post-prandial glucose surges and greater risk. According to the company that makes the test, two people with similar A1C levels in the 7-8% range may have very different glucose variations throughout a day. Roughly 40% of people with \"healthy\" A1Cs have persistent glucose spikes, putting them at high risk for cardiometabolic complications. GlycoMark is an adjunct to standard glucose tests. It is a simple well-validated tool for early detection of glucose dysregulation. A reading of 3 ug/ml or lower indicates potential problems; a reading above 10 indicates better glucose regulation. Homocysteine: This is a great test to determine if the body has adequate levels of B vitamins, especially B6, B12 and folic acid. Deficiencies in these vitamins often indicate future cardiovascular and cognitive problems, as well as hormone-related diseases, potential birth defects, and many other health challenges. C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Inflammation is a key driver of CVD, along with other chronic diseases and CRP is a reliable indicator of inflammation. It provides an early warning for heart disease and many other chronic problems. Often triggered by the presence of free radicals and oxidative stress, high CRP is an early warning sign for heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. 8-OHgD test: 8-hydroxy- 2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a byproduct of oxidative damage to guanine bases in DNA, which makes it a good indicator of DNA damage caused by chemical toxins in the air, water or food, as well as various forms of radiation. A high level of 8-OHgD in urine indicates increased oxidative stress, thus providing an early warning of disease. The acceptable or \"normal\" levels on the 8-OHgD urine test are 43.9+/-42.1 ng/mg ng/mg creatinine in males. Galectin-3 (Gal-3): This molecule plays important roles in normal cell adhesion, cell growth, and chemoattraction. However, Gal-3 elevations indicates that something is wrong. High Gal-3 is strongly associated with ventricular remodeling, heart failure, and stroke. It is also associated with some forms of cancer. Gal-3 is over-expressed on cancer cell surfaces, and actually helps them to stick to one another. It also circulates in the blood, indicating that cancers are attempting to metastasize. Because it can signal the possibility of multiple diseases, Gal-3 measurement is not a stand-alone diagnostic test for any particular condition. But it is a useful biomarker of chronic inflammation, tissue fibrosis, and possible neoplasia. From a CVD perspective, serum Gal-3 levels below 18 ng/ml are considered low-risk; readings above 25 ng/ml suggest high risk for heart failure. Oximetry: A simple finger oximeter can provide important signals. If oxygen levels are low, the mitochondria do not produce enough energy and cells are not able to function properly. Most finger oximeters use a 100-point scale: the desired level is from 96 to 100. As oxygen level drops, cellular metabolic problems increase. Vascular damage and vasoconstriction are primary causes of low readings. In some cases, this reflects infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF): VEGF is a signal protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in response to low levels of oxygen. It can also produce a profound increase in vascular permeability and edema. Over- and under-expression of VEGF can both create problems. Too much VEGF can lead to excess vessel growth and excess permeability of capillaries. Too little can lead to a lack of oxygenation in tissues, which can trigger symptoms of chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS). Most studies establish the optimal range of VEGF to be between 31 pg/ml and 86 pg/ml. Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (GGT): This enzyme is found in many organs in the body, with higher concentrations in the liver where it helps to deliver cysteine for intercellular glutathione synthesis. While predominately a marker of liver disease, elevated serum GGT also indicates oxidative stress, often associated with excessive alcohol consumption, heavy metal exposure, heart disease, and diabetes. High GGT can also be associated with increased cancer risk. Typical reference ranges are 15-85 IU/L for men, and 5-55 IU/L for women. Magnesium RBC: Magnesium has many physiological roles. One of the most important is glucose and insulin transport. The level of magnesium in red blood cells is the best indicator of overall magnesium levels in the body. Mg deficiency is associated with diabetes, and a host of cardiometabolic problems. It is also linked to increased cancer risk. The reference range for magnesium RBC tests is 4.26.8 mg/dL. D-dimer: D-dimer is a small protein fragment that results from fibrinolysis. High levels are associated with deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. It is also a biomarker of abnormal clots associated with COVID-19 infection or in response to a COVID vaccine (if the test is done within ten days of diagnosis or injection). A four-fold increase in D-dimer is an indicator of poor prognosis in hospitalized COVID patients. In adult males and non-pregnant females, the threshold is 0.5 ug/ml. Omega 3/6 ratio: This test measures the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in the blood. In broad-stroke terms, omega-3 is anti-inflammatory, while omega 6 is inflammatory. We need both to maintain health, but they need to be in the right balance. Too much omega-6 drives inflammation and raises risk of CVD and other diseases. A good ratio is in the range of 2 to1 or 3 to1, favoring the omega-3s. MRI Plaque View: This relatively new assessment tool shows the actual morphology of atherosclerotic plaques, including multi-contrast identification of the lipid core, calcification, and hemorrhage potential. It indicates maximum carotid wall thickness, normalized wall index, and gives a lot of information about the health of the endothelial lining. It is an accurate way to assess plaque vulnerability to rupture, thus giving a clear picture of thrombosis risk. PULS Cardiac Test: The Protein Unstable Lesion Signature (PULS) Cardiac Test is another relatively new method that aggregates biomarkers of immune system activation and endothelial injury, including IL-16, MCP-3, Eotaxin, and sFas, along with HDL and hemoglobin A1c. It combines these variables into a composite score that predicts the odds that someone will have a heart attack within five years. There is good science to support this method, as summarized in a recent paper by Premyodhin and colleagues in Coronary Artery Disease. But PULS testing is not yet considered standard of care in cardiology. Cardiac surgeon Steven Gundry recently published an abstract looking at the effect of mRNA COVID vaccines on PULS scores. Gundry has been using PULS regularly for 8 years. He ran the PULS tests 2-10 weeks following patients' second doses of mRNA shots, and compared the scores to each patient's pre-vaccine levels. Based on those comparisons, he observed increases in IL-16, sFas, and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), which raised 5-year coronary event risk scores from an average 11% to 25%. Gundry concludes that mRNA vaccines trigger endothelial inflammation. The findings are not entirely surprising given that the purpose of a vaccine is to generate temporary inflammation. The question is whether the observed elevations are dangerous. Gundry's experiment did not include an unvaccinated control group, patients who received a non-mRNA vaccine, or people receiving any other type of conventional non-COVID vaccine. The paper gives no data about duration of the inflammatory surges. Further, there is no information given about PULS score changes during an acute COVID episode, which makes it difficult to gauge the potential vaccine risk Gundry is suggesting against the risks associated with severe COVID. His observations raise important questions that warrant attention. But without these comparators they are not conclusive. Charles K. Bens, PhD, is a nutritionist and educator based in Sarasota, FL.

Reach Dr. Bens at: bensck@gmail.com We are nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, more than ever, it's worth looking into what goes on in the body and how the immune system works in critical situations like COVID-19. The pandemic has certainly put the functioning of the immune system to test, but it has also brought to light the intricate pathways involved in protecting ourselves from viral pathogens. Various organs and cell types\u2014the spleen, lymph nodes, immune cells\u2014play a role in protecting the body against pathogens and toxins, an in repairing damaged tissue. In the context of a viral infection like COVID, the key players are the white blood cells. They travel throughout the body, searching for microbes and foreign particles. The T Cell Response T and B lymphocytes are the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. T cellsare made predominantly in the thymus gland (hence the \"T\") and are involved in cell-mediated immunity. T cells, including the CD4 helper and CD8 helper cells, are responsible for memory-based natural immunity. A healthy T cell response in response to a pathogen like SARS COV2 (a positive T cell test can confirm this) should lead to a natural, protective, and relatively long-lasting immunity. Over 160 million people worldwide have now recovered from COVID-19. Many of them have a strong protective immunity, which can shield them from repeat infection, disease, hospitalization, and even death. Back in May, the World Health Organization released a report stating that within four weeks of infection, 90% to 99% of people who recover from COVID-19 develop detectable neutralizing antibodies, and that this protective response remains strong for at least 8 months after infection. The problem, of course, is that many people do not survive the initial infection. The current estimate is that 4.8 million people worldwide, and nearly 725,000 in the US, have died from COVID-19. But that does not mean we should ignore the role of natural immunity. As healthcare professionals, we should do all that we can to support our patients' innate and adaptive immune systems, so they can respond maximally when faced with the virus. Delta Variant: Outpacing Immune Cells Many people are concerned about the risk posed by the new variants, especially the Delta variant. The big problem with Delta is that it can replicate 2-3 days faster than B and T cells can. In essence, it can outpace the key immune cells, making it much harder for these cells to stop the virus and prevent symptoms or interpersonal transmission. The Delta variant also puts a greater burden on the neutralizing antibodies. The cautious good news is that while this new variant appears to spread faster, it may not necessarily be more aggressive. Viruses are promiscuous by nature; they constantly mutate and evolve. It will not be surprising if we see additional variants emerge in the future. This is all the more reason to focus on bolstering immune system capacity. Natural vs Induced Immunity The protection conferred by natural immunity is equivalent to, or perhaps better than, that of vaccine-induced immunity. But the two are not mutually exclusive. Both vaccine-induced immunity and naturally-occurring post-COVID immunity will play a role in stemming the spread of COVID and reducing its morbidity and mortality. Some people assume that documentation of a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is synonymous with natural immunity, but really, immune status is best determined by an accurate and reliable antibody test. While antibody titers can decrease over time, T cell protective immunity-as detected by a T cell test\u2014potentially confers lifelong protection, a phenomenon acknowledged by NIH Director, Francis Collins back in July 2020. The COVID-19 vaccines induce neutralizing antibodies that circulate in the body, recognize, and bind to the virus, preventing it from entering cells and replicating. This is important, because once the virus enters cells, it is no longer accessible to the antibodies circulating outside the cells, and it's free to replicate and cause damage. An individual's response to the vaccine can be robust or weak, or anywhere in between. Though the scientific consensus and the public health community are almost unanimously supportive of vaccination, the reality is that many people remain resistant to getting the shots. Chastisement is unlikely to change their positions on the issue. Bolstering Protective Mechanisms It isvital that we do all we can to help patients nurture their intrinsic protection mechanisms, regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated. Healthy people have a well-integrated array of robust protective mechanisms, from strong and intact skin and mucosal surfaces, to balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses. But too many people are in survival mode. They're not thriving, and they're not able to effectively protect themselves. They have co-morbidities affecting their lungs, heart, nervous system, blood vessels and other organs. They lack the essential nutrients needed for the body to function well. Co-morbidities often indicate overexposure to \"anti-nutrients\"\u2014chemical compounds that reduce the body's ability to absorb and assimilate essential nutrients\u2014and other stressors that deplete the body's nutrient stores and its metabolic capacities. Let's face it: the immune system protects those who are able to protect themselves. People can minimize their risk of serious illness from SARS-CoV-2 or any virus by ensuring they're getting enough essential nutrients, healthy activity, and sleep. We recommend that people following the Alkaline Way program to fully support and nourish the immune system. This includes: Taking vitamin D3 regularly- especially liquid drops that are assimilated and absorbed easily. This essential neurohormone helps regulate cell division and is important in many systems, especially when combined with vitamin K2. Maintaining a Vitamin D3 level of 50-80 ng/ml is a good goal. Though there are not yet any large intervention trials proving that vitamin D3 is protective against SARS-CoV-2, deficiency is a well-documented epidemiologic risk factor for infection, severe illness, and death. Zinc and Magnesium: From taste and smell to immune and neurohormone balance, zinc and magnesium are essential, yet often deficient nutrients. People at high risk show signs of metabolic acidosis. Urine pH after rest is a good indicator of whether or not someone has enough buffering minerals present to neutralize the day's excess acids from metabolism. Flavonoids like quercetin dihydrate, which function as zinc ionophores. Flavonoids are nature's way to facilitate necessary cellular uptake of zinc and other helpful minerals. Lack of essential nutrients to rebuild damaged tissue, increased exposure to anti-nutrients, lack of deep abdominal breathing, inadequate stretching/walking, and poor sleep are also predisposing factors for myriad illnesses. At its core, sustained health is determined by what people EAT, DRINK, THINK and DO. Let's all consider COVID-19 a wake-up call to invest in personal and social health. Now is the time for people to invest in self-care, personal care and cultivation of healthier habits. Small steps often bring big rewards. Multiple small steps multiply the benefits. Platelets may be tiny\u2014on average they're about 20% of the diameter of red blood cells\u2014but they have huge impact on our health and wellbeing. Beyond their obvious role in blood clotting and wound healing, they are also important players in the immune system. More than we realize, optimal health depends on the platelets doing their jobs appropriately, but not over-doing them. There are as many as 150,000-350,000 platelets per microliter of blood, but since platelets are so small, they make up just a tiny fraction of the blood volume. These splendid multi-functional cell fragments are produced by the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, via a process comprised of an intricate series of remodeling events. A single megakaryocyte can release of thousands of platelets. Like red blood cells, platelets (aka thrombocytes) lack nucleii, and hence they have no nuclear DNA; but they do contain some RNA machinery. The \"Goldilocks\" Zone As with most physiological functions, we want thrombocyte production and function to in the \"Goldilocks\" zone: not too much and not too little. Blood clotting is indeed essential. If it weren't for high-functioning platelets, even relatively minor injuries would be debilitating or life-threatening. But as we see all too often in our practices, clotting in the wrong places at the wrong times\u2014in the coronary arteries, the carotids, or the brain\u2014can be deadly. Clots are not always stable and they don't always stay put. A clot formed in a leg vein can travel through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing an embolism. A thrombus arising in the heart can end up in the brain. These silent migrations can have lethal consequences. In the context of atherosclerosis, we can really see how a physiological healing response can end up causing damage. When there's an endothelial injury, white blood cells and particles of cholesterol-carrying low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and form a gooey pool rich in inflammatory signaling molecules. Eventually, a thin cap forms over the mess. If that cap splits open, the body responds as it would to a cut in the skin: platelets rush to the scene and clotting begins. If the break is small and heals quickly, the episode passes with no harm. But if the rupture is extensive, the resulting clot occludes the artery. If that happens in one or more of the coronary arteries, the patient ends up in the emergency room with a myocardial infarction. When a clot occludes an artery feeding the brain, it causes a stroke. We're taught to prescribe anticoagulant drugs to decrease platelet aggregation, and to interrupt the clotting cascade at one or several of its stages. These can mitigate risk of MI and stroke, but it is equally true that any one of these anticlotting drugs can cause excessive bleeding. We need to be careful and constantly watch for signs of abnormal bleeding, such as bruising and swelling (without physical injury), or blood in the stool. We also need to consider that thrombocytes play other important roles beyond clotting. These include: Tissue & Wound Repair: Adequate and timely repair depends upon healthy, functioning platelets. Different growth factors and other biomolecules necessary for wound healing are provided by platelets (hence the surging interest in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to treat sports injuries and the like). When there is a deficit in repair, inflammation results. In some cases, this is due to platelet inhibition. It may also be due to deficiencies in magnesium or vitamin C, or to use NSAIDs, steroids, aspirin or other drugs that inhibit platelets. Cell Proliferation: Platelets release specific signals that promote mitosis in various tissues of the body. This property of platelets has been harnessed to create therapies for healing from bone-related injuries Immune System Function: Platelets are crucial to the optimum functioning of the immune system, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune defense/repair responses. Innate - Thrombocytes regulate the maturation and activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. They also act as first responders when a virus, bacteria or allergen enters the body. Adaptive- They also modulate the adaptive immune system by aiding in CD4 maturation. These are helper lymphocytes that amplify immune system reactions to pathogens. CD4 cell activation is required for proper T- and B-cell mediated immunity. Physiology Before Pharmacology How can we help our patients optimize their platelet function? I tend to advocate for a \"physiology before pharmacology\" approach. The key is to protect the endothelial lining, and to promote appropriate but not excessive clot formation. Here are five key factors that support healthy platelet function: Ascorbate(Vitamin C): Vitamin C is an antioxidant radical oxidative leukocytes (Raghavan SAV, et al. Thrombosis Research 2003). I recommend using buffered l-ascorbate based on the C cleanse protocol to maximize this benefit. Polyphenols: Plant-derived tissue repair, especially in conjunction with buffered l-ascorbate. They also act as zinc ionophores, meaning that they transport zinc where needed. This is an added plus, because zinc is important for endothelial cell integrity. Magnesium: Adequate magnesium intake can prevent thrombocytopenia while also reducing unnecessary platelet aggregation. Magnesium also raises ATP production in the mitochondria. It protects essential fats during transport, activates enzyme catalysts, decreases metabolic acidosis, and protects the kidneys. I suggest using magnesium with choline citrate for optimum absorption. Checking the 1st morning urine pH is a great way to know if you are getting adequate magnesium. Vitamins D3 and K2: Vitamin D deficiency can increase platelet aggregation and consequently, raise the risk for cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D3 also regulates platelet volume. I suggest taking enough Vitamin D3 to maintain blood levels of between 50-80 ng/ml. Using Vitamin K2 with Vitamin D3 is recommended. Omega 3 Fatty Acids: Omega-3s, especially EPA and DHAhave a positive influence on platelets, in that they reduce unwanted platelet aggregation. For best results, use pure, active EPA/DHA distilled under nitrogen and micellized in softgels. The Omega-3 Index is a simple test that gives a clear picture of someone's Omega-3 status. "}
