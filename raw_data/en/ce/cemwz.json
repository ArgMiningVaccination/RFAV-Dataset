Then Came The Data. ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/strategy-of-targeting-hard-to-treat-patients-held-incredible-promise-for-cutting-costs-then-came-the-data/) The method of finding the most expensive, hard-to-treat patients and better coordinating their care was touted as a popular idea for containing health care costs. A new study offers a harsh reality check on the benefits of such a strategy though. The surprising lack of results offers a cautionary tale about how difficult it is to improve patients' care and reduce costs. [ The Associated Press: Program Meant To Curb Repeat Hospital Stays Fails Big Test ](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/program-meant-curb-repeat-hospital-stays-fails-big-test-n1112691) Researchers thought they had a way to keep hard-to-treat patients from constantly returning to the hospital and racking up big medical bills. Health workers visited homes, went along to doctor appointments, made sure medicines were available and tackled social problems including homelessness, addiction and mental health issues. Readmissions seemed to drop. The program looked so promising that the federal government and the MacArthur Foundation gave big bucks to expand it beyond Camden, New Jersey, where it started. But a more robust study released Wednesday revealed it was a stunning failure on its main goal: Readmission rates did decline, but by the same amount as for a comparison group of similar patients not in the costly program. (1/8) [ The New York Times: These Patients Are Hard To Treat ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/camden-coalition-chronic-illness.html) But a new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that the Camden program did not result in fewer hospital readmissions in the six months after a patient left the hospital. While the program appeared to lower readmissions by nearly 40 percent, the same kind of patients who received regular care saw a nearly identical decline in hospital stays. (Abelson, 1/8) [ The New York Times: Deflating Results Of Major Study Point To Better Ways To Cut Health Care Waste ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/upshot/major-study-health-waste.html) To try to avoid a repeat hospitalization, the program provided an unusually large amount of care to very sick patients after they left the hospital, including from registered nurses, social workers, licensed practical nurses, community health workers and health coaches. In the three months after a hospital stay, an average patient in the program received 7.6 home visits and 8.8 phone calls from staff. In addition, program staff went along on patients' visits to physicians, which averaged 2.5 per person. (Frakt, 1/8) [ Kaiser Health News: Reduce Health Costs By Nurturing The Sickest? A Much-Touted Idea Disappoints ](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/lower-health-care-costs-by-helping-the-sickest-a-much-touted-idea-disappoints/) The results are a blow to Dr. Jeffrey Brenner and the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers, the organization he founded nearly 20 years ago. \"It's my life's work. So, of course, you're upset and sad,\" said Brenner, who now does similar work with health insurance giant UnitedHealthcare. The model of care, pioneered in part by Brenner and profiled in a widely read 2011 article in The New Yorker, has inspired dozens of similar projects across the country and attracted millions in philanthropic funding.

A major study looking at women with employer-provided health insurance found that the average new mom spent $4,500 out-of-pocket to give birth in 2015, the most recent year data are available. That's a 50% increase from 2007, when the typical new mom paid out just over $3,000 of her own money. It's also more than three times the rate of inflation over that time period.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers has been pushing for months to pass legislation protecting patients from getting massive bills when they go to the emergency room and one of their doctors happens to be outside their insurance network.

As such alternatives gain in popularity, some states are starting to take a closer look. [ The New York Times: New York State Investigates Christian Health Cost Sharing Affiliate ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/christian-health-insurance-subpoena.html) New York State officials are investigating a business representing a major Christian group offering an alternative to health insurance, joining several states scrutinizing these cost-sharing programs that provide limited coverage. On Wednesday, New York state insurance regulators issued a subpoena to Aliera, which markets the Christian ministry run by Trinity Healthshare, according to people who have seen the subpoena. More than one million Americans have joined such groups, attracted by prices that are far lower than the cost of traditional insurance policies that must meet strict requirements established by the Affordable Care Act, like guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions.

The health-sharing groups have grown in popularity amid the rising cost of health insurance, though often offer fewer protections and can come with significant limits. As many as 1 million people are in health-care sharing ministries, by some estimates, though reliable numbers are hard to find.

Two other injunctions against the rule have been lifted by other courts, leaving this decision by a federal appeals court in New York as the only nationwide bar to the Trump administration putting the new rule into practice. [ The Associated Press: Appeals Court Keeps Block Of Trump Immigration Rule In Place ](https://apnews.com/e7b6cafe1d334295fc007b6acb251c66) A federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday rejected a motion from the Trump administration that would have allowed it to implement a policy connecting the use of public benefits with whether immigrants could become permanent residents. The ruling from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the administration's motion to lift a temporary national injunction that had been issued by a New York district court in October after lawsuits had been filed against the new policy.

Despite those decisions, however, the injunction from New York, which falls under the 2nd Circuit, continues to apply across the country. The Trump administration's controversial approach to the public charge rule, announced in August, is one of a series of administration measures aimed at curbing legal immigration.

But shares fell nearly 7% to $55, dragging down those of CVS 2%, as investors worried that the pressure on reimbursement rates from insurers was likely to hurt profits further.

The overall cancer death rate fell by nearly 30% from 1991 through 2017. The study wasn't all positive: declines in the death rates from prostate, breast and colon cancer are slowing, despite those cancers being easy to scan for. [ The Associated Press: Cancer Group Finds Biggest One-Year Drop In U.S. Death Rate ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/08/cancer-group-finds-biggest-one-year-drop-in-us-death-rate.html) Researchers on Wednesday reported the largest-ever one-year decline in the U.S. cancer death rate, a drop they credited to advances in lung-tumor treatments. The overall cancer death rate has been falling about 1.5% a year since 1991. It fell 2.2% from 2016 to 2017, according to the new American Cancer Society report. That's the largest drop ever seen in national cancer statistics going back to 1930, said Rebecca Siegel, the lead author. (1/8) [ The New York Times: Cancer Death Rate In U.S. Sees Sharpest One-Year Drop ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/cancer-deaths-decline.html) \"Every year that we see a decline in cancer mortality rate, it's very good news,\" said Rebecca Siegel, director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the organization's report, which was published online in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. Experts attributed the decline to the reduced smoking rates and to advances in lung cancer treatment. New therapies for melanoma of the skin have also helped extend life for many people with metastatic disease, or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.

Gilbert Welch, senior investigator with the Center for Surgery and Public Health, at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the analysis. What's behind the decline? In part, smoking rates have fallen steadily, which means the biggest risk factor for lung cancer has fallen appreciably. New cancer treatments are also playing a role, Siegel says.

The report found an overall drop of 29% as of 2017, which translates into an estimated 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths than what would have occurred if death rates had remained at their peak, according to the report. (Howard, 1/8) [ CBS News: Cancer Death Rate Sees Largest-Ever Single-Year Drop In U.S. ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cancer-death-rate-sees-largest-ever-single-year-drop/) The decline in mortality from melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, was also dramatic, according to the report. The progress comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved new therapies for metastatic disease, or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Notably, death from melanoma decreased in people aged 65 years and older, a group where melanoma rates were increasing prior to 2013. (McNamara, 1/8) [ NBC News: Cancer Death Rates Are Falling. Advances In Lung Cancer Treatment Are Playing A Major Role. ](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-death-rates-are-falling-advances-lung-cancer-treatment-are-n1111706) Another of the biggest advances, experts said, has been the development of immunotherapies such as Keytruda, also known as pembrolizumab. It uses the body's immune system to fight tumors, and it is approved for lung cancer and melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer.

MD Anderson scientist Jim Allison's identification of the brake led to a new class of immunotherapy drugs, most approved in the last decade, which have cured many patients of cancers that have historically meant death sentences.

A new treatment for breast cancer, for example, might work for only the 3% of patients with certain genetic mutations. New guidelines have refined standard chemotherapies so they work better, and new technology has focused radiation beams so they more tightly target tumors rather than healthy tissue.

It doesn't appear to be spreading within humans rapidly, but scientists in the region are cautious even 17 years after the SARS outbreak. [ The New York Times: China Identifies New Virus Causing Pneumonia-Like Illness ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html) Chinese researchers say they have identified a new virus behind an illness that has infected dozens of people across Asia, setting off fears in a region that was struck by a deadly epidemic 17 years ago.

Studies have shown that higher levels of tau protein in the blood is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

Essential to such a system is effective communication. To address patients' needs, primary care physicians often must communicate and exchange information with specialists, hospitals and other care settings, social service providers \u2014 and, of course, the patients themselves.

[ The New York Times: Can We Please Stop Fighting About 'Medicare For All'? ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/opinion/medicare-for-all-democrats.html) With strong support among the Democratic Party's base, \"Medicare for all\" has emerged as a test of progressive bona fides in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.It has also emerged as something of a political morass into which the candidates keep stumbling. Most recently, the businessman Andrew Yang faced scrutiny over his position on the idea of creating a government-run health insurance system that essentially would eliminate private coverage. (Michelle Cottle, 1/8) [ St. Louis Post Dispatch: If Killing Obamacare Is A Good Idea, Why Does The GOP Want To Wait Until After The Election? ](https://www.stltoday.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-if-killing-obamacare-is-a-good-idea-why-does/article_fa448d8b-80ff-5690-8186-2a338a7b6438.html) Republicans want to have it both ways regarding the Affordable Care Act: They want the courts to kill Obamacare \u2014 but not until after the 2020 general election so they can avoid voters' wrath as the reality sets in that millions of Americans have been thrown off their health care coverage. That's why a new push by a coalition of Democratic-led states to get the Supreme Court to settle the question before the election is so important. If the GOP is right about the wisdom of eliminating the ACA, let their politicians defend the effects of that stance in campaigning before November. But maneuvering to evade it as a campaign issue is the coward's way out.

Just before Christmas, the Trump administration gave an early gift to the roughly 113,000 Americans currently awaiting transplanted organs. It proposed two new rules that will make transplants easier. The first proposal, from the Health Resources and Services Administration, would reduce costs for living kidney donors. The National Organ Transplant Act bans commerce in organs, and regulations even restrict the payment of expenses. (Mary Vought, 1/8) [ The New York Times: Without A Vaccine, These Are Your Odds ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html) Vaccines prevent diseases, and being unvaccinated carries a risk. Last year, the World Health Organization ranked vaccine hesitancy, a \"reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines,\" among the top 10 health threats worldwide, alongside Ebola, H.I.V. and drug-resistant infections. To state it bluntly, being unvaccinated can result in illness or death. Vaccines, in contrast, are extremely unlikely to lead to side effects, even minor ones like fainting. (Peter J.

You are, in essence, a prisoner within your own brain. I think that could be torture. Others don't. What I'm referring to here is the plight of a subset of people diagnosed with a condition known as persistent vegetative state who are actually trapped in this way. (Jacob M.

The goal of eradication seemed at least possible when there were only eight cases in 2017, and 12 cases in 2018. Now, the latest data show there have been 128 cases of polio in Pakistan in the past year. Moreover, the global campaign to eradicate polio, which began in 1988, is facing a whole new set of uncertainties. Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the three remaining countries where polio is endemic, and Nigeria had been free of wild poliovirus for three years.

The health of millennials is worse than the Generation Xers that they follow; and a 40% increase in uninsured rates for the youngest Ohioans \u2014 infants to preschoolers \u2014 could have long-term consequences not only for their health but also their brain development and overall well-being. Combined, these developments raise serious questions about the likelihood that trends toward decreased life expectancy can soon be reversed.

Maine slipped five spots in an annual ranking from 16 to 21 while Florida slipped four spots from 29 to 33. The ranking is produced by the United Health Foundation. It includes a number of factors. Florida's slippage was due to worsening rates of diabetes, obesity and a low rate of mental health providers. Obesity is out of control in Florida with rates affecting nearly 1 in 3 adults. As a result, diabetes has increased, too, affecting 1 in 10 adults. There is one major contrast between Maine and Florida, however. Maine does a much better job of providing mental health services to its residents with a ladder of more efficient and effective services.

Lawmakers Must Act ](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article238944693.html) Better pay and working conditions for mental health workers must be a priority issue for Kansas lawmakers in the 2020 session, which begins next week. There are two primary mental health hospitals in Kansas, one in Larned and the other in Osawatomie. In late 2019, the federal government told the state it found deficiencies at an acute care unit in Osawatomie, and ordered it to develop a plan to rectify the problems. The state has submitted a plan, but faces loss of federal Medicare payments in March if the government remains unsatisfied. Even if those immediate challenges are addressed, the 60-bed Adair unit is \"not a therapeutic environment,\" according to Gov. Laura Kelly.

Now, Release Fund For Hurricane Maria Recovery ](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/editorials/article239073343.html) Puerto Rico is now dealing with the aftermath of a powerful 5.8 earthquake and equally powerful aftershocks. Casualties are low, and electrical power is slowly returning. But the quakes are just the latest natural disasters to cripple the U.S. commonwealth. Puerto Rico still is healing from the hit it took two years ago from Hurricane Maria. Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced has declared a state of emergency. President Trump has done the same. That's the very least the Trump administration should do. It would be unconscionable for it to repeat its appalling response to Hurricane Maria's destruction in 2017, when Trump practically mocked islanders' pain and suffering, and recovery efforts became a political football between island leadership and Trump.
