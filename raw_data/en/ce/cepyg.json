An ancient traditional system of medicine, Ayurveda is considered to be the oldest system of health care, with literature going back 5000 years and an oral tradition that is much older. Ayurveda helps the healthy person to maintain health and the diseased person to regain health. Homeopathy originated in 1796 in Germany, and was discovered by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German scientist. Homeopathic medicines are derived from natural and herbal sources. A remedy chosen on the basis of a person's whole being including psychological, emotional and hereditary information, instead of just an individual illness will trigger the self-healing mechanism. The root for the word 'Yoga' comes from the Sanskrit word 'yuj' [pronounced 'yug'], which means 'union' - a union of the Mind, Body and Spirit. It also embodies a union of one's self with the Universal Self, with the Supreme Spirit. This holistic science emphasises that such a union is necessary for a person seeking his or her good health and well-being. Naturopathy is a natural healing technique using the healing powers of nature. The Principle of Naturopathy is that the accumulation of toxins is the root cause of all diseases, hence prevention of such accumulation and elimination of existing toxins is the route to health.
