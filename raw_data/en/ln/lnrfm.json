While there is debate as to what constitutes \"alternative\" or \"conventional\" medicine, integrative medicine generally seeks to combine accepted treatments with those that are not as well-studied. Integrative medicine's goal is to provide medical treatments that consider the whole person. What is Integrative Medicine? Integrative medicine aims to combine medical practices from around the world - both conventional and alternative - into a comprehensive medical practice. An integrative medicine practitioner may prescribe medications but will also be open to alternative treatments. Alternative Medicine or \"CAM\" The field of \"alternative medicine\" encompasses many types of treatment including herbal medicine, acupuncture, and yoga. Another term for this type of medicine is CAM - or complementary and alternative medicine. In 1992, Congress established an Office of Alternative Medicine, which is now called the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/) (NCCIH). This organization promotes training and research for complementary and alternative medicine. Examples of alternative medicine: - Acupuncture - Massage - Tai Chi/Qi Gong - Yoga - Meditation - Herbal Medicine Conventional Medicine Conventional medicine, according to integrative medicine practitioners, is medicine as it practiced by a majority of doctors. However, doctors who practice conventional medicine do not call themselves \"conventional medicine doctors.\" Integrative medicine practitioners find that the way medicine has traditionally been practiced is sometimes too restrictive. That is why they have chosen to separate themselves from the rest of the medical community. To them, modern medicine tends to exclude treatments from Eastern traditions or those that do not have large-scale clinical trials to back them up. In some cases the idea of alternative medicine may be more about patients looking for solutions when previous treatments have failed. Integrative medicine may, for the most part, be the same as what is called conventional medicine. However it offers a different, more personalized experience for patients who may be disillusioned by their experiences with other medical practitioners. Integrative Medicine - CAM and Conventional Medicine Together Integrative physicians find that the category a treatment falls into is not as important as how it can benefit a patient. In most cases, a combination of both alternative and conventional medicine will produce the greatest benefit. Many doctors who do not call themselves integrative physicians already practice a form of \"integrative\" medicine. A healthcare provider may recommend stress-relieving activities, diet changes, and nutritional supplements. They may even recommend acupuncture or massage to relieve stress. Andrew Weil, MD is a physician who helped pioneer the concept of integrative medicine. His website [drweil.com](https://www.drweil.com/) is an excellent resource for health information that includes articles on everything from diet and exercise to dental care. He discusses a wide range of topics on his website and provides a good idea of what is considered integrative medicine. It encompasses all aspects of an individual's health and can include nutrition, medicine, stress-relieving activities, and more. Integrative Medicine and the Compounding Pharmacy Integrative physicians have often used compounding pharmacies to provide patients with treatments that are not commercially available. This particular medical philosophy embraces therapies that have not become widely accepted. For example, there are many medications that are safe and effective but do not have FDA approval. These medications may have been discontinued because they were no longer profitable to manufacture. Integrative medical practitioners can prescribe these medications by using the services of a compounding pharmacy. A compounding pharmacy is a patient-centered type of pharmacy that works well with the philosophy of integrative medicine. A compounding pharmacy makes prescriptions individually for each patient. Patients who have sensitivities to certain inactive ingredients can have medications individually made for them. A compounding pharmacy can make medications that are gluten-free, soy-free, sugar-free, and more. An integrative physician may also consider how to best optimize delivery of a medication to an individual patient. Different delivery forms like troches, creams, or suppositories may be made for medications that are usually only available in oral tablets or capsules. Transdermal delivery is often used for hormone replacement because it results in higher levels of the hormone than with oral administration. Individuals who have illnesses related to mold exposure often seek help from an integrative physician. [CIRS and biotoxin illnesses](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/biotoxin-illness-cirs/) do not have widespread acceptance in the medical community. Some doctors will not treat a patient who believes they have become ill due to exposure to mold in their home or workplace. Doctors who describe themselves as integrative may be more likely to help these patients recover. Most of the treatments used for biotoxin illness are only obtainable from a compounding pharmacy. Compounded Treatments Prescribed by Integrative Physicians Hormone Replacement: [Bioidentical hormone replacement ( [desiccated thyroid](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/compounds/hrt/desiccated-thyroid/), Nature Throid) are frequently dispensed by a compounding pharmacy. Hormones affect all aspects of a person's health. When hormone levels decline, it can lead to dramatic changes in a person's well-being. Low levels of estrogen, progesterone, thyroid and more are supplemented with hormones that behave the same as those naturally produced in the body. Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN): [LDN](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/compounds/gastroenterology/low-dose-naltrexone/) is a lower dose of the FDA-approved drug naltrexone. There are a number of promising, small-scale trials that demonstrate its effectiveness in managing chronic conditions. LDN is prescribed for treating [inflammatory bowel diseases](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/low-dose-naltrexone-inflammatory-bowel-disease/), [skin conditions like psoriasis](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/low-dose-naltrexone-psoriasis/), and chronic pain conditions like arthritis](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/ldn-rheumatoid-arthritis/). Topical Preparations: Creams for dermatological conditions, [pain creams](https://www.parkcompounding.com//4281/compoundcategories/pain-management/), and more are made by a compounding pharmacy.
