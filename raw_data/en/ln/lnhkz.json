She has hands-on experience in immunopharmacology, pharmacology/toxicology, and animal modeling, as well as extensive academic research experience in immunology, vaccines, and immune senescence. Her long-standing interest in the prophylaxis of infectious diseases goes back to her medical school years. Immune senescence and modulation of immune responses in aged animals by cholesterol-lowering drugs was the topic of her Ph.D. work. Her current research is mainly focused on phytodrugs dietary supplements: 1) their safety and efficacy, 2) potentiation of conventional drug toxicity by concomitant use with phytodrugs, 3) use of phytodrugs by special patient populations, and 4) use of phytodrugs as an alternative/complementary treatment to conventional antibiotics. She is a Principal Investigator in several clinical trials examining the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of herbal and other natural products. Additionally, Dr. Enioutina is interested in evaluating intravenous immunoglobulins' efficacy in pediatric patients with neurological disorders. She continues her work aimed at optimizing the treatment of neonatal sepsis.
