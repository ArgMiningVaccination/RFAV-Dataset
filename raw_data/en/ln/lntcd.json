The teamwork and dedication that we have experienced over the last month through challenging decisions and several significant moves is unsurpassed. Thank you for all you have done, and will continue to do on behalf of our patients and for one another. Our inpatient medical and surgical oncology units are now well situated at our Saint Raphael Campus. In addition, our outpatient care from NP 1 has transitioned to our Care Center in Guilford and the majority of outpatient and infusion care from NP 4 and 8 has transitioned to North Haven. Our Old Saybrook Care Center has temporarily merged with Guilford; the Orange Care Center has temporarily merged with Derby; and the Fairfield Care Center has temporarily merged with Trumbull. Our Extended Care Clinic cont inues to be available for patients in need of urgent attention in its new temporary space on EP 1, and a Rapid Evaluation Clinic has launched for Smilow patients who develop COVID -type symptoms to enable testing and triage for care on NP 1. Our leadershi p team will continue to make decisions and modify our plans to ensure we are providing the very best cancer care to our patients, while protecting our patients and their families, and our News Center physicians, nurses, caregivers, and staff. Communication remains key, and we will continue to provide our internal community with updates through Town Halls and our regular emailed COVID Updates. We also want to be sure we're providing information directly to our patients, and earlier this week we hosted our second public Patient and Family Forum. The forum, our internal updates, and additional information for your patients are archived in a new section of our website. www.yalecancercenter.org/covid Virtual Grand Rounds I am grateful to Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, for her leadership in the study of immune response to COVID -19 and for taking the time to launch our virtual Grand Rou nds earlier this month. Dr. Iwasaki's research efforts will undoubtedly bring new insights into the immune system's ability to halt the coronavirus, and potential vaccine development. Dr. Craig Crews followed with an exciting grand rounds presentation on his work on PROTAC - mediated protein degradation earlier this week, and his lab's progress. Many of our grand rounds presentations are archived on our website for your review. Dr. Harlan Krumholz will join us this Tuesday, April 21 at Noon and we will continue on a weekly schedule.

Sharing a few scenes from our week together with all of you! As a New Patient Nurse Coordinator with the Thoracic Oncology Program, one of the primary roles for Cheryl Walsh, RN, is to make sure crucial information is obtained for an effective initial visit. Cheryl also helps newly - referred patients understand what to expect from their appointment. In what is often an emotional and stressful time, Cheryl guides patients through their upcoming appointments to help alleviate their anxiety and connect with them on a psycho -social level, which is a critical component for successful care. For new patients, the diagnosis or second opinion process is an emotio nal experience. Educating patients on the types of additional imaging or testing that may be needed can relieve some of their concerns. Cheryl explains, \"Talking with patients on their level in order to help them understand the process while answering thei r questions, comforts them. It can help them trust that they are, and will be taken care of.\" Upon graduation from nursing school, Cheryl worked as both an inpatient nurse and charge nurse on 9 West, which was a medical oncology/hematology floor. When the construction of Smilow was completed, her unit moved to NP11 and NP12. Cheryl stayed on NP12, Medical Oncology, for five years. During this time, she was also working per diem for the Hospital of Central Connecticut, outpatient oncology, and for Connect icut Hospice's homecare program.

Over the last four years as a Nurse Coordinator, on top of her normal responsibilities, Cheryl has attended the weekly thoracic tumor board and has participated in numerous projects, including the rollout of ERAS and IDEAL initiatives for thoracic surgical patients. She also supports all five oncologists within the department, the chief of thoracic surgery, and two pulmonologists who see patients in Smilow. \"As coordinator, this role is such a good mix of patient contact and team collaboration,\" says Cheryl. \"The Thoracic Oncology team is a great group that emphasizes collaboration and the advancement of care. What is so special about oncology is that we personalize care and support our patients in every way possible. We become their team, almost as if we are an extended family.\" OOTB Thanks!
