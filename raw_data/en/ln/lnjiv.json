Even in this case, by reducing the number of people with symptoms will help to reduce spread of the virus because fewer people will be coughing large quantities of virus on others. However, this possible limitation of the vaccine highlights the importance of continuing to follow public health advice such as hand washing and isolating if unwell, even post vaccination. The spike protein that is made in your body in response vaccine does not travel far and does not reach your nose. Vaccination is recommended before and during pregnancy Women who are trying to become pregnant need not to delay the vaccination nor avoid becoming pregnant. COVID-19 is a potentially very serious disease. Pregnant women and their unborn babies are greater risk of needing hospital care than women who are not pregnant For example, inflammation around the site of the injection is common with COVID-19 vaccination (an ordinary consequence) and is unlikely to be covered. Infections (such as cellulitis or septic arthritis) due to the vaccination, and anaphylaxis resulting in injury, are not ordinary consequences and are likely to be covered. We are familiar with some of the vaccine types, such as the protein subunit candidates, like those used in Hepatitis B and whooping cough vaccines; however, other vaccines are using newer technologies such as mRNA and viral vector vaccines. For further information on the types of vaccines that are being developed, please click [here](https://www.ncirs.org.au/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine-development-landscape). Once Medsafe has reviewed all available data, it makes a recommendation to the NZ Government as to whether a medicine can be granted approval in New Zealand. More comprehensive information on this process is available on the Medsafe [website](https://www.medsafe.govt.nz/COVID-19/vaccine-approval-process.asp). These form part of the information that companies submit during the approval process. The Ministry of Health, in conjunction with The Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC), has made changes to the protocols for drawing-up of reconstituted vaccine doses from the Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine vials. The new preparation instructions include the use of Low Dead Space (LDS) 25-gauge needles for drawing-up and administration of the vaccine. This follows best practice from overseas and the vaccine manufacturer's recommendations. We have a great team of experienced and passionate advisors, educators, facilitators and programme support. Based across New Zealand, we have dedicated regional immunisation advisors and facilitators to support the health care workforce in your local community. On this page you can find a selection of recommended video and webinar content from associated organisations and credible sources, as well as the Immunisation Advisory Centre. On 31 March 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech released top-line data from their phase 3 clinical trial showing 100% efficacy against COVID-19 in teenagers aged 12-15 years old following vaccination with Comirnaty. A robust antibody response and tolerable side effects were consistent with those seen in adults aged 16-25. Women's voices, women's approach and women's thinking should be visible in every level of our society. Too often they're not and the results are frustrating. In the early clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines, pregnant and breastfeeding women were left out of testing for no good reason. We weren't using live attenuated vaccines (a weakened form of the virus) so there weren't likely to be any significant safety concerns in the trials. Because pregnant or breastfeeding women weren't able to participate with full informed consent, it led to insufficient clinical data. GP and Director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre, Dr Nikki Turner, is taking us along on her COVID-19 vaccine journey. Over the next few weeks she will be capturing her experiences from her first vaccine through to her second dose for the Ministry of Health. Her newest diary entries will be added here as they become available. Day 1: First dose The only contraindication for Comirnaty is a history of anaphylaxis to a previous dose of this vaccine or its contents. Find more information on [severe allergic reactions after immunisation here](https://covid.immune.org.nz/responses-after-vaccination), and the [contents of Comirnaty here.](https://covid.immune.org.nz/how-comirnaty-made-and-what-it-contains) Those with a history of immediate allergic response to another product or vaccine can receive this vaccine but are asked to wait to be observed for a little longer after vaccination. These conditions put you at increased risk from COVID-19, and although you may not respond as strongly to the vaccine as someone with a fully functioning immune system, it is safe for you to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and it will provide some protection against COVID-19, particularly against severe, life-threatening disease. This is because it is quite common for the vaccine to cause swelling of the lymph nodes nearest to the injection-site, such as armpit and neck. This occurs most commonly after the second or booster dose. Swollen lymph nodes (medically called lymphadenopathy) is one of the top ten events reported to Medsafe through the CARM reporting system. This is particularly detected by FDG PET/CT scans, in which you are given a contrast medium containing a type of radioactive sugar that is taken up by active cells. When an immune response to a vaccine takes place, the cells in the lymph nodes near the injection site become very active and take up a lot of this sugar. Depending on the type of cancer, you may be able to request the injection on the opposite side to your tumour. If possible, have the vaccination at least 2 weeks before a scheduled scan or as soon as you can afterwards. Do not delay any treatment. [Vaccination alone will not provide full protection. When borders open, NZ will still be managing COVID-19](/news-insights/vaccination-alone-will-not-provide-full-protection-when-borders-open-nz-will-still-be) By Nikki Turner, Immunisation Advisory Centre Clinical Director From next week, unvaccinated staff working at managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities will be [moved to low-risk jobs](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/440111/covid-19-authorities-unable-to-say-how-many-border-workers-unvaccinated), following a case of a worker who missed vaccination appointments and then [tested positive](https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/border-related-case-confirmed-current-case) for COVID-19.
