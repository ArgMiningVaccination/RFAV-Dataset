It displays a single fibrous and rough stem with an alternative leaf structure. The green leaves have a feathery fern like appearance. The flowers consist of bunches of flat-topped panicles made up of numerous small, white flower heads. Each tiny flower resembles daisy. The whole plant is more or less hairy, with white, silky hairs (Alternative Nature, 1997). The flowers bloom from May to August and its best to gather the stem, the leaves and flower heads when in bloom and dry for later herb use. Habitat and Cultivation Achillea millefolium or common yarrow is a hardy perennial wayside and pasture plant originally native to most of Europe and Asia. It is found naturalized in most temperate regions worldwide. For thousands of years it has been respected as a medicinal and ceremonial herb. Yarrow loves dryness and light, prefers full sun and well drained, slightly disturbed soil and is drought tolerant once established. Yarrow blooms throughout the summer and autumn and in temperate climates such as New Zealand, it will carry on flowering with a head or two throughout winter and spring. In good conditions it can grow to a meter in height with lots of white umbrella like flowers (Ellen, 2003). Yarrow is a grassland, field, roadside and garden dweller that readily invades any space allotted to it. It is easily cultivated as it moves quickly from a system of shallow roots as well a multiplying from seed. Yarrow pushes its rhizomes through the roots of other grasses and plants forming a mat; it can become a troublesome weed. It is generally resistant to insects and disease but may suffer from mildew and rust in damp places. It is a good companion plant for other plants as it has the ability to enhance their essential oil content increasing their resistance to troublesome insects while attracting beneficial ones (Alternative Nature, 1997). Record of Botanical and Artistic Observations Drawing One - Erect growing perennial, rhizomatous herb, with a pungent odour and bitter taste. Short non-flowering rosettes form dense mats of lacy leaves and the plant reaches 10-20 inches high. It bears flat topped clusters of small mainly white or creamy/pink flowers and the plant usually displays white silky apprised hairs. - The roots are rhizomes and have a creeping, fairly shallow horizontal growth. While not 'deeply' rooted, it is 'spread out' in its root system. It appears to have strength in its ability to move underground from one area to another covering a lot of territory. The root system seems to focus on 'spreading out' and joining together, rather than moving downward. - The Stems are usually simple, stiff and erect up to 1 meter tall. They are ribbed and striate and downy towards the top. They usually only branch towards the top to form the inflorescence. - The leaves alternate as they ascend the stem from the base of the plant. Each leaf simultaneously decreases in size as it climbs the stem displaying a soft and gentle downward curve or arch. The leaves grayish green aromatic leaves are compound and in their finely divided exquisite feathery quality we encounter a high air element. They are approximately 8-10 cm long and 2 cm wide Drawing Two - Basal leaves grow from the lowest part of the stem, are finely pinnate with a soft feathery appearance - The flowers are several bunches of flat topped panicles consisting of small , white daisy like flower heads arranged in dense flat topped terminal compound corymbs up to 15 cm across, 5cm in diameter. They are composed of 4-6, usually 5 ray florets. The ray florets encircle lots of little disc flowers. The inflorescence is produced in flat topped clusters about 5-8cm in diameter. - The seeds are grey to brown flattened achenes, about 2mm long with narrow, pale, brown wings and no pappus hairs. - Parts used: The aerial parts, leaves, stems and flowers are collected when in flower during the growing season, after the dew has dried, early on a sunny day. Flower stems should be cut back to ground level after flowering and clumps divided every other year. The Three Fold Aspect of Yarrow The three fold nature of yarrow connects with the three fold human-being through its medicinal actions of its floral realm. As previously stated, the metabolic-limb system thrives on warmth and activity; the warmth and regenerative qualities of the yarrow flowers and seeds support the metabolic, digestive and reproductive areas (Pelikan, 1997). The yarrow plant has a note of aromatic bitterness and this quality contained in yarrow strengthens the digestive processes thus supporting liver function, increased bile secretion and improved appetite (Fisher & Painter, 1996). Yarrow is also valuable for the rhythmic system acting as an amphoteric; dilating tightly constricted blood vessels and bringing tone to vessels that are too flaccid. These medicinal qualities are especially helpful for cardiac function and vascular circulation throughout the body (Fisher & Painter). As a strong, well balanced plant, yarrow works to support anabolic and growth processes within the metabolic-limb system towards form and balance. Research and studies (Ellen, 2003) indicate that yarrow seeks to harmonize the spiritual and astral aspects of one's nature with the physical world and practical responsibilities. This is further demonstrated in the structure of the plant when viewing the harmonious relationship between the clustered white bloom at the top of the plant and the light and feathery leaves clustered at the base of the plant Plant Gesture of Yarrow In yarrow I see a well formed and a well balanced plant that feels well grounded. This surprised me really considering its airy nature. The salty qualities carried in the plant helps to bring form and structure to the plant. The sulphurous qualities bring a sense of opening and loosening as they enable the plant to open towards the cosmos (Therkleson, 2009). It stands firm and strong within its sensitivity. It appears to flourish as individual stems and in group clusters. It also grows harmoniously with flowers of a completely different family. It stands tall yet appears delicate with wispy fine leaves and umbrella-like, compact clusters of refined, intricate white blooms. The delicate leaf structures seem to 'feel' the surrounding environment for the entire plant. Although this plant is connected to the metabolic system I think it also carries a dream like, rhythmic quality. Perhaps due to how the airy element forms the plant and the softness of its leaves that 'cluster' around the base of the stem. These are mirrored by the flower 'clusters' that open like stars reaching for the cosmic forces. There is gesture of growth and rest held within this plant as if the two processes work harmoniously, like the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out. In yarrow we encounter plant gestures of stability, balance and airy sensitivity along with the polarities of expansion and compactness of the flower clusters. "}
