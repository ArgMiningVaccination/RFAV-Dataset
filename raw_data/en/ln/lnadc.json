Homeopathy was developed in the late 1700s in Germany based on the principle that \"like cures like\", and that if the body is introduced to highly diluted forms of a substance that in higher concentrations would bring on symptoms, the body will learn to heal itself. What is Herbal Medicine? Plants have been the basis for medicine throughout human history. Herbal medicine involves using parts of the plant for its scent, flavor or therapeutic properties. Herbal medicines are used to support or improve health. What happens during your visit? When you meet with our Doctor of Oriental Medicine, either via telehealth or in person, he will ask you detailed questions about your physical, mental and emotional health. He will then prescribe the remedy that best matches all of your symptoms. Why shouldn't I buy homeopathic and herbal remedies off the shelf? There are several considerations when prescribing a homeopathy or herbal remedy program for you. It takes a skilled practitioner to identify not only the specific remedy but the proper concentration and dosage of that remedy. Furthermore, to keep the maximum effectiveness of the medicine it is critical that it be stored in a manner that is environmentally controlled, which may not always be possible in transit to your local health food store or pharmacy. Following your consultation, you may indeed be able to purchase some of the remedies from your local pharmacy or health food store while others are only available by prescription and will be sent to you by your practitioner.
