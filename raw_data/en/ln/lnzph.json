Many applicants have found rotations helpful in determining whether the program is a good fit for them because rotations provide a more substantial experience than an interview allows for. Clinic-based rotations Medical students spend half of the rotation paired with faculty physicians providing care to their regular panel of patients. The rest of the time, students are matched with residents providing care to same-day or open access patients. Other residents in clinic may also share interesting cases as time allows. Hospital-based rotations While scheduling preference is shown to University of Minnesota medical students, students from other medical schools are welcome to rotate through our program.
