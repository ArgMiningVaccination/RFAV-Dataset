You might be glad to learn that adaptogenic herb shatavari translates to \"curer of a hundred diseases\".1 Shatavari is believed to support reproductive health and the menopause and can even help lift your mood. Could it be for you? Skip to: Shatavari is a herb that's been used for hundreds of years in Indian Ayurvedic medicine. Although it might not look like it, this brown root is a member of the asparagus family. The special thing about shatavari is that it's a natural adaptogen; it changes the way your body and brain respond to stress. Adaptogens help you to \"normalise\" yourself when things get a bit much. They don't cure your symptoms - they simply help you balance out the highs and lows. Shatavari isn't only used for stress and anxiety, though. We can't say we've counted all \"a hundred diseases\", but it's certainly celebrated for a whole range of benefits! Read on to find out the benefits of shatavari... As we mentioned, shatavari is a natural adaptogen, which helps us to feel balanced in moments of stress. It's thought to help regulate serotonin, the hormone that makes us feel happy. While it can't cure something like an anxiety disorder, shatavari is thought to help promote anxiety-reducing hormones. A 2014 study found that shatavari helped rats produce healthy levels of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).2 These are the same hormones that humans use to feel calm - so consider a daily shatavari supplement or a little shatavari powder in your tea if you're struggling to switch off. Certain compounds in shatavari stimulate insulin production, meaning it shows potential when it comes to treating conditions like diabetes.3 Insulin helps your body use sugar (glucose) for energy. People with diabetes may not naturally produce enough insulin, which is why their blood sugar levels can be too high. While you should always follow your GP's advice if you're diabetic, it's exciting to know that there's growing research into a natural remedy. Antioxidants are the powerful compounds that help protect us every day. You'll find them mainly in plant foods - and shatavari is no exception. Antioxidants help protect against free radical damage and oxidative stress. You can't avoid free radicals entirely, but you'll experience greater damage with smoking, UV exposure, and a poorly balanced diet (to name a few). Shatavari contains 3 different antioxidants: asparagamine A, racemosol, and a new antioxidant shatavari root racemofuran.45 Handpicked content: [The benefits of an antioxidant-rich diet](/the-health-hub/food-drink/diets/superfoods/benefits-antioxidant-rich-diet/) Many people look to natural remedies when they begin their [menopause](/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/menopause/) - and shatavari has gained a reputation as a wonder product. In Ayurvedic medicine, shatavari is known as the \"female rejuvenator\" and is believed to help combat heat and dryness - both uncomfortable aspects of the menopause. Many menopause symptoms happen due to low oestrogen. Shatavari contains phytoestrogens, a plant-based, dietary form of oestrogen.6 Because of this, it may help ease menopause symptoms like: as well as helping to balance the hormonal and physical [stress](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/womens-health/menopause/cbt-techniques-to-cope-with-menopause/) during this time.

Plus, its adaptogenic nature can help you de-stress (which might be another reason you're not in the mood). Shatavari has been effective in preventing stress- and NSAID-related gastric ulcers in animals and is commonly used as a remedy for diarrhoea.12 It's been found to increase activity in the enzymes lipase and amylase, which respectively break down fats and carbohydrates for digestion.13 Shatavari supplements come from the root of the plant.
