Celebrities from [Gwyneth Paltrow](https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/gwyneth-paltrow/) to [Carol Vorderman](https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/carol-vorderman/) praise the benefits of a juice cleanse for improving health, but what is one and how on earth do you start a juice cleanse? If you're looking for a way to reboot and recharge, a juice cleanse could be perfect for getting your body - and mind - sharp and ship shape. Juice cleanses can benefit your skin, sleep, and even your immunity. WATCH: Jennifer Aniston makes her favourite breakfast juice Salma Hayek is such an advocate of juicing, she started her own juicing business, Cooler Cleanse. \"After doing a juice cleanse, I'm motivated to eat healthier and not emotionally,\" Salma says. \"It makes me stop, focus and think about what I'm putting into my body. I'm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button.\" Fancy a slice of the juicing action? The good news is, juice cleanses have come a long way from the days when you had to be BFFs with a blender to even get started. Nowadays they come delivered straight to your door, ready-made and tailored to give you the daily nutrients you need. Benefits of a juice cleanse A juice cleanse is typically done to detox the body of toxins like sugar and alcohol, and can give your gut a rest so it works better. People swear by juice cleanses for everything from weight loss to clearer skin, more energy, a stronger immunity and better sleep. It's also a way to flood your body with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals from a range of fruit and vegetables - great if you struggle to get your five-a-day. Cons of a juice cleanse Juice cleanses aren't for everyone. I've tried a few and fared differently, from finding them easy to follow as long as my activity on the day was at a minimum, to not being able to finish them. I found myself craving cucumber, just to crunch something, so definitely ease yourself in with a one day cleanse. Always consult your doctor or a health professional if you are going to embark on one. Juice cleanses can be expensive, and if you've got a hectic schedule, it's best to leave trying one until you're a little less busy. How many days does a juice cleanse last? A juice cleanse typically lasts from one to seven days, depending on the one you choose. Newbies are recommended to try one for one to two days and the more experienced can juice cleanse for seven days. What should you eat after a juice cleanse? Before embarking on a juice cleanse (consult with your doctor first), you probably think you'll be craving pizza and chocolate post-cleanse, but a juice cleanse also affects your metabolism and people find they're less hungry afterwards. But when you do return to solids, keep it light - think steamed vegetables, whole foods such as nuts and a little fruit. Add a green smoothie to your daily diet too (experts suggest first thing in the morning) and try to swap caffeine with hot water and lemon.
