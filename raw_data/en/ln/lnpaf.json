We have a lot of general information about Ayurveda in the [Resources section](https://www.ayurveda.com/resource/general-information/). To find out more about the dietary side of Ayurveda, you can make delicious food in Usha and Vasant Lad's book, [Ayurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing](https://www.ayurveda.com/ayurvedic-press/ayurvedic-cooking-for-self-healing-hardcover/). Another approach would be to attend their [cooking seminar](https://www.ayurveda.com/calendar/)held each February (or March). It's a great way to learn more about Ayurveda, cook a delicious meal and meet the Lads. Of course, we have other weekend seminars that present many aspects of Ayurveda in a fun, supportive environment or Vasant Lad offers a couple of [webinars](https://www.ayurveda.com/webinars/)each year. If you want to delve more deeply, you can come to a summer intensive course. After exploring Ayurveda through these avenues, you may want a career as an Ayurvedic practitioner and our [Education Department](https://www.ayurveda.com/education-overview/)can help you look at what that would be like. So, make some kitchari and experience Ayurveda with your first dish! Caution: A kitchari mono-diet can lead to constipation if taken exclusively for several days, as it is low in fiber. To ensure proper elimination, the following may prove helpful if taken once a day, away from kitchari meals: psyllium husks or seeds with water OR oat bran OR prune juice. "}
