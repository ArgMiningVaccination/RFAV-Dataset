Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination Below are answers to commonly asked questions about COVID-19 vaccination. Getting Your Updated COVID-19 Vaccine(s) Some people can get additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine: - People aged 65 years and older may get a 2nd dose of updated Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 4 or more months after the 1st updated COVID-19 vaccine. - People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may get additional doses of updated Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 2 or more months after the last updated COVID-19 vaccine. [Talk to your healthcare provider about additional updated doses.](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) You are up to date when you have received all COVID-19 vaccine dose(s) recommended for you by CDC. People are best protected when they [\"stay up to date\" with COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html): \"Fully vaccinated\" is not the same as having the best protection that staying up to date provides. You were \"fully vaccinated\" when you had completed only a primary series based on your age, health status, and vaccine type. Thus, you can be \"fully vaccinated\" and not have completed all vaccine doses recommended for you, which is called \"up to date\". Currently, only Novavax has a recommendation for a primary series. Yes. [COVID-19 vaccines are working well](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html) to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. However, public health experts are seeing [ reduced protection over time](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-11-19/06-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf) against mild and moderate disease, especially among certain populations, which is why vaccination recommendations are updated. People who first received a Novavax or J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine are recommended to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna). You may get a Novavax booster if you are unable or unwilling to receive an updated PfizerBioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and you meet the following requirements: - You are 18 years of age or older - You completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series at least 6 months ago - You have not gotten any other booster dose Additional information for how everyone can [stay up to date](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). Scientists are monitoring how long COVID-19 vaccine protection lasts. [Recent data](/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7205e1.htm) show that 1 dose of the updated COVID-19 vaccine better protects you against more serious illness, hospitalization, and death. People who have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine in recent months are better protected against severe illness from COVID-19 than those who have not gotten it. CDC recommends everyone [stay up to date](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with COVID-19 vaccines for their age group: To find a COVID-19 vaccination location near you, search [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/), text your ZIP code to 438829 (for English), or 882862 (for Spanish), or call 1-800-232-0233. Then, call or visit the vaccine provider's website to make an appointment. An employer may require that their workers be vaccinated. Check directly with your employer to see if they have any vaccination requirements or rules that apply to you. Your provider cannot give you a dose of vaccine that does not follow its specific vaccine product guidelines and requirements. All COVID-19 vaccine providers in the United States must be enrolled in the [CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program.](/vaccines/covid-19/provider-enrollment.html) To participate in this program, vaccine providers sign an [agreement](/vaccines/covid-19/provider-enrollment.html) that states they will only administer COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with program requirements and recommendations including those of [CDC](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html), the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html) (ACIP), and the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) (FDA). Your provider can refer to the CDC [Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) for specific information on administration of COVID-19 vaccines. These guidelines are based on safety and efficacy data and are updated as new information becomes available. Getting Children and Teens Vaccinated The COVID-19 vaccines for children have the same active ingredients as the vaccines given to adults. However, children receive a smaller and more age-appropriate dose that is right for them. The smaller doses were rigorously tested and found to create the needed immune response for each age group. Making it important for your child to get the vaccine made for their age group. COVID-19 can make children and teens very sick and sometimes requires treatment in a hospital. Getting eligible [children and teens vaccinated against COVID-19](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) can help keep them from getting really sick if they do get COVID-19, including protecting them from short and long-term complications and hospitalization. Vaccinating children can also help keep them in school or daycare and safely participating in sports, playdates, and other group activities. The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks. CDC recommends everyone stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines for their age group: Parents and caregivers should get their child vaccinated as soon as possible. Getting vaccinated provides the best protection against serious illness if a child gets infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, if your child has recently had COVID-19, they still need to stay up to date with their vaccines, but you may consider delaying the next vaccine dose (whether a primary dose or booster) by 3 months from: - when your symptoms started. - Or, if they had no symptoms, when they first received a positive test. Reinfection is less likely in the weeks to months after infection. However, certain factors could be reasons to get a vaccine sooner rather than later, such as: - personal risk of severe disease, - or risk of disease in a loved one or close contact, - local [COVID-19 hospital admission level](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html), - and the most common [COVID-19 variant](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/)currently causing illness. There is no federal legal requirement for a parent, guardian, or caregiver to consent for COVID-19 or any other vaccination. However, depending on each state or local law, this does not mean that consent is not required for select age groups. State or local laws and policies, as well as vaccine provider policies, around minor consent for vaccination have existed for a long time and will also apply to COVID-19 vaccination of children. Safety No. [COVID-19 vaccines](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html) that are currently available do not use the live virus that causes COVID-19. These vaccines work by using a harmless piece of spike protein from the virus causing COVID-19 to teach the body how to fight the virus that causes it. The body then gets rid of the harmless spike protein within a few days after vaccination. Adults and children may have [some side effects](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) from a COVID-19 vaccine, including pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. [Serious side effects are rare](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html) but may occur. Yes. Updated COVID-19 vaccines use the same ingredients (formulation) as the original COVID-19 vaccines. The updated vaccines are called \"updated\" because they protect against both the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5. Two COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, have developed updated COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine ingredients vary by manufacturer. None of the vaccines contain eggs, gelatin, latex, or preservatives. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals, such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys. They are also free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, and nanowire semiconductors. None of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized or approved in the United States contain any live virus. To learn more about the ingredients in authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines, see Although COVID-19 vaccines were developed quickly, research and development on vaccines like these have been underway for decades. All vaccine development steps were taken to ensure COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, including: - Clinical Trials - All vaccines in the United States must go through [three phases of clinical trials](/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html)to ensure they are [safe and effective](/mmwr/covid19_vaccine_safety.html). The phases overlapped to speed up the process, but all phases were completed. - Authorization or Approval - Before vaccines are available to people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews data from clinical trials. FDA has determined [COVID-19 vaccines](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)meet FDA's standards and has granted those vaccines [Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization)or full FDA approval. - Tracking Safety Using Vaccine Monitoring Systems - Like every other vaccine approved for use in the United States, COVID-19 vaccines continue to be monitored for safety and effectiveness. Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. CDC and FDA continue to provide updated information on the safety of U.S. authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccines using data from several [monitoring systems](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-systems.html). Learn more about developing COVID-19 vaccines. Yes, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for [people who are pregnant](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html), breastfeeding, or trying to get pregnant now, as well as people who [might become pregnant in the future](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html). People with COVID-19 during pregnancy are more likely to deliver a [preterm](/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm) (earlier than 37 weeks) or stillborn infant and may also be more likely to have other pregnancy complications. COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy helps: - Prevent severe illness and death in [people who are pregnant](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html) [Protect babies younger than 6 months old](/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm)from hospitalization caused by COVID-19 Learn more about vaccination considerations and the [safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html#anchor_1628692520287) for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. If you are pregnant and have received a COVID-19 vaccine, we encourage you to enroll in [v-safe](/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/v-safe/index.html), CDC's smartphone-based system that provides personalized health check-ins after vaccination. A [v-safe pregnancy registry](/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/v-safe/covid-preg-reg.html) has been established to gather information on the health of pregnant people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Results from recent research studies show that people who menstruate may observe small, temporary changes in menstruation after COVID-19 vaccination, including: - Longer duration of menstrual periods - Shorter intervals between periods - Heavier bleeding than usual Despite these temporary changes in menstruation, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility problems. Learn more about [COVID-19 vaccination for people who would like to have a baby](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/planning-for-pregnancy.html). Preparing for Your Vaccine You should get a COVID-19 vaccine even if you already had COVID-19. [Getting a COVID-19 vaccine](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html) after you recover from COVID-19 infection provides added protection against COVID-19. You may consider delaying your vaccine by 3 months from when your symptoms started or, if you had no symptoms, when you received a positive test. People who already had COVID-19 and do not get vaccinated after their recovery are [more likely to get COVID-19 again](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289) than those who get vaccinated after their recovery. Learn more about the [benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html). No. You should wait to be vaccinated until after you complete your isolation period. People who have symptoms will end isolation at a different time than people who do not have symptoms. This also applies to people who have been vaccinated but get COVID-19 before getting any additional or booster doses. Additionally, you may consider delaying your next vaccine by 3 months from when your symptoms started or, if you had no symptoms, when you received a positive test. People who have had a known COVID-19 exposure should not seek vaccination until their [quarantine period](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html) has ended to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and others during the vaccination visit. This recommendation to wait also applies to people with a known COVID-19 exposure who have received their first dose and need additional doses. Learn more about how to [stay up to date](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with your COVID-19 vaccines. Yes, depending on your age, you can choose which [type of COVID-19 vaccine](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html) to get. Learn more about which vaccine is available by age and how to [stay up to date](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with your COVID-19 vaccination. There is no recommended waiting period between getting a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines. You can [get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#timing-spacing-interchangeability), including a [flu vaccine](/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2021-2022.htm#Getting-a-Flu-Vaccine-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic), at the same visit. Experience with other vaccines has shown that the way our bodies develop protection, known as an immune response, and possible [side effects](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) after getting vaccinated are generally the same when given alone or with other vaccines. COVID-19 vaccination significantly lowers your risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death if you get infected. Compared to people who are [up to date](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with their COVID-19 vaccinations, unvaccinated people are [more likely to get COVID-19](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status), much more likely to be [hospitalized with COVID-19](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination), and much more likely to [die from COVID-19](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status). Like all vaccines, COVID-19 vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection. People who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations may still get a COVID-19 infection after vaccination. However, staying up to date with your COVID-19 vaccinations means that you are less likely to have a breakthrough infection and, if you do get sick, you are less likely to get severely ill or die. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination also means you are less likely to spread the disease to others and increases your protection against new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. After Your Vaccine If you have lost your [CDC COVID-19 Vaccination card](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect.html) or don't have a copy of it, contact your vaccination provider directly to request a new vaccination card. They may be able to reissue a CDC COVID-19 Vaccination card. - If you cannot contact your vaccination provider directly or your vaccination provider cannot reissue a CDC COVID-19 Vaccination card, contact your state health department's [immunization information system (IIS)](/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state). Your state's IIS cannot issue you a vaccination card, but they can provide a digital or paper copy of [your full vaccination record](/vaccines/hcp/admin/immuniz-records.html), including your COVID-19 vaccinations. - If you need another COVID-19 vaccine dose and are unable to get a copy of your vaccination card or vaccination record, talk to a vaccination provider to learn about your possible options. - Some vaccination providers and health departments may offer you access to a QR code or digital copy of your CDC COVID-19 Vaccination card in addition to giving you a physical card. Contact your vaccination provider or [local health department](/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html)to learn if you can get a digital copy of your card. CDC does not provide the white CDC COVID-19 Vaccination card to people and does not maintain vaccination records. CDC distributes the white CDC COVID-19 Vaccination cards to vaccination providers and only a vaccination provider can give you this card. The white CDC COVID-19 vaccination cards are only issued to people vaccinated in the United States. However, there are several ways you can update your records with vaccines you received while outside the United States. Learn more about [Vaccination Received Outside the United States](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#vaccination-received-outside-US). [CDC does not keep vaccination records or determine how vaccination records are used. To update your records with vaccines you received while outside of the United States, you may:] - Contact the immunization information system (IIS) in your state. You can find state IIS information on the [CDC website.](/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state) - Contact your healthcare provider or your local or state immunization program through your [state's health department.](/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) The white CDC COVID-19 vaccination cards are only issued to people vaccinated in the United States.

Learn more about [Vaccination Received Outside the United States](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#vaccination-received-outside-US). If you have received all recommended doses of a COVID-19 vaccine that has been authorized or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or is listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO), then you are considered to be [fully vaccinated](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html). This currently includes the following vaccines: - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine - FDA-authorized, (labeled as COMIRNATY in European Union), 2 doses, for adolescents 12 -15 years old - Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) COVID-19 Vaccine - FDA-approved, 2 doses, for persons 16 years and older - Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine - FDA-authorized, 2 doses, for persons 18 years and older - Johnson and Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine - FDA-authorized, (labeled as Janssen-Cilag in European Union), 1 dose, for persons 18 years and older - AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine - WHO-listed, (labeled as COVISHIELD in Canada and others, labeled as AstraZeneca/SKBio in Republic of Korea), 2 doses, for persons 18 years and older - Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 Vaccine - WHO-listed, 2 doses, for persons 18 years and older - Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 Vaccine - WHO-listed, 2 doses, for persons 18 years and older If you received a COVID-19 vaccine that is not authorized or approved by FDA or listed for emergency use by WHO, you may start over with an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. Please note that no data are available on the safety or effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination after receiving a non-FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. Wait at least 28 days after you received the last dose of the non-FDA-authorized or approved vaccine before receiving an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. Visit the [clinical considerations webpage](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#vaccinated-part-clinical-trail) for more information. While COVID-19 vaccines were developed rapidly, all steps were taken to make sure they are safe and effective: - Approach to Development - Scientists have been working for many years to develop vaccines against viruses like the one that causes COVID-19. This knowledge helped speed up the initial development of the current COVID-19 vaccines. - Clinical Trials - All vaccines in the United States must go through [three phases of clinical trials](/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html)to make sure they are safe and effective. During the development of COVID-19 vaccines, phases overlapped to speed up the process, but all phases were completed. - Authorization or Approval - Before vaccines are available to people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses the findings from clinical trials. FDA determined that [three COVID-19 vaccines](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)met FDA's safety and effectiveness standards and granted those vaccines [Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization). This allowed the vaccines to be quickly distributed to control the pandemic. Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) COVID-19 vaccine has now been [FDA approved](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/qa-comirnaty-covid-19-vaccine-mrna)for people ages 16 years and older. Read more about [the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive FDA approval](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine). - Manufacturing and Distribution - The U.S. government has invested substantial resources to manufacture and distribute COVID-19 vaccines. This allowed vaccine distribution to begin as soon as FDA authorized each vaccine. - Tracking Safety Using Vaccine Monitoring Systems - COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring has been the most intense and comprehensive in U.S. history. Hundreds of millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. Through several [monitoring systems](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-systems.html), CDC and FDA continue to provide updated information on the [safety of these vaccines](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html). Learn more about [developing COVID-19 vaccines](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/reporting-systems.html). You can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, including a flu vaccine, at the same visit. Experience with other vaccines has shown that the way our bodies develop protection, known as an immune response, and possible side effects after getting vaccinated are generally the same when given alone or with other vaccines. Learn more about [the timing of other vaccines](/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html#Coadministration). Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 because: - Research has not yet shown how long you are protected from getting COVID-19 again after you recover from COVID-19. - Vaccination helps protect you even if you've already had COVID-19. Evidence is emerging that people get better protection by being fully vaccinated compared with having had COVID-19. [One study](/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289) showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than 2 times as likely than fully vaccinated people to get COVID-19 again. If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure what treatments you received or if you have more questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. If you or your child has a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults or children ( [MIS-A](/mis/mis-a.html) or [MIS-C](/mis/index.html)), consider delaying vaccination until you or your child have recovered from being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS-A or MIS-C. Learn more about the [clinical considerations](/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#CoV-19-vaccination) for people with a history of multisystem MIS-C or MIS-A. Experts are still learning more about how long vaccines protect against COVID-19. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. Related pages: No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the [criteria](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html) for discontinuing isolation; those without symptoms should also wait until they [meet the criteria](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html) before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine. People who have had a known COVID-19 exposure should not seek vaccination until their quarantine period has ended to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and others during the vaccination visit. This recommendation also applies to people with a known COVID-19 exposure who have received their first dose of an mRNA vaccine but not their second. Related pages: Vaccine ingredients vary by manufacturer. None of the vaccines contain eggs, gelatin, latex, or preservatives. All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals such as iron, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth alloys. They are also free from manufactured products such as microelectronics, electrodes, carbon nanotubes, or nanowire semiconductors. To learn more about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see We don't know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems should [receive an additional primary dose](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after the initial 2 doses. Learn more about [population immunity](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html). Related pages: If you need a new vaccination card, contact the vaccination provider site where you received your vaccine. Your provider should give you a new card with up-to-date information about the vaccinations you have received. If the location where you received your COVID-19 vaccine is no longer operating, contact your state or local health department's [immunization information system (IIS)](/vaccines/programs/iis/contacts-locate-records.html#state) for assistance. CDC does not maintain vaccination records or determine how vaccination records are used, and CDC does not provide the CDC-labeled, white COVID-19 vaccination record card to people. These cards are distributed to vaccination providers by state and local health departments. Please [contact your state or local health department](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/hd-search/index.html) if you have additional questions about vaccination cards or vaccination records. Related page: Yes. All currently authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines are [safe](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html) and [effective](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness.html), and CDC does not recommend one vaccine over another. The most important decision is to get a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible. Widespread vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic. People should be aware that a risk of a rare condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been reported following vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelet counts. This problem is rare, and most reports were in women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of any age, this problem is even more rare. There are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna). Learn more about [your COVID-19 vaccination](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/your-vaccination.html), including how to find a vaccination location, what to expect at your appointment, and more. Related page: After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, take these steps to protect yourself and others: - In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings. - If you are in an area with [high numbers of COVID-19 cases](/covid-data-tracker/#county-view), consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and when you are in [close contact](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact)with others who are not fully vaccinated. - If you have a condition or taking medications that weaken your immune system, you may not be fully protected even if you are fully vaccinated. You should continue to take all [precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including wearing a well-fitted mask](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html), until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider. - If you are fully vaccinated, to maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area [of substantial or high transmission](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view). People with underlying medical conditions can receive a COVID-19 vaccine as long as they have not had [an ](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) [immediate or severe allergic reaction](/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine.
