Mahmoudi, Resident, Bronx Lebanon Hospital Brian Ghilchrist, Attending, Bronx Lebanon Hospital Lin Lin Kin, Bronx Lebanon Hospital Case Title: Staphyloccocus Infection Mimicking Clinical Anaphyl axis. Summary and Lessons Learned: : A 2-year-old previously healthy boy was brought t o the Emergency Department with history of sudden o nset of worsening generalized rash associated with swelling of eyelids and lips of 3 hours duration. The rash was described as erythematous with intense itchiness. His past medic al history was significant for inguino-scrotal orc hidopexy surgery done 5 days prior to this presentation. He did not have any past history of allergies, nor any new ex posures to food, medications, etc. On presentation, his vital signs was within normal parameters and he was afebrile On physical exam, he was not in distress but appeared fussy. He did h ave a generalized urticarial rash covering his tru nk and extremities. Also, significant edema of his eyelids and lips we re noted. Wheezing was appreciated bilaterally. Sit e of surgery was mildly indurated and seems tender to palpation, no erythema, no discharges, rest of abdominal exam is unremarkable. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkab le. In the ED he was managed with subcutaneous ep inephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV diphenhydramine for clinical anaphylaxis. His facial angioedema quickly improve d; his rash significantly improved but persisted. Results: His initial complete blood count and basic metabolic panel were within normal limits with C-r eactive protein of 19.86 (normal <5). Chest X-ray was unremarkable. He was admitted to the pediatric floor for observatio n. Within 4 hours of admission he had fever of 39\u00b0C. Wound culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, surgical intervention d one, and the patient was started on IV clindamycin. Within 4-5 h ours the rash and fever completely resolved and he improved clinically. Lessons Learned: In this case we found that localiz ed staphylococcus aureus infection was masquerading as an anaphylactic reaction. Identifying the cause of ana phylactic reaction at times can be challenging. We hypothesize that Staphylococcus infection may mimic anaphylaxis by c ausing mediator release from mast cells via its -t oxin. In vitro studies have identified -toxin as a potent induce r of mast cell degranulation and suggest a mechanis tic link between S. aureus colonization and allergic skin disease Provi ders should suspect an infectious when the cause of clinical anaphylaxis is suspected. Patient Presentation and Testing: Previous research has shown that Staphylococcus a ureus toxin, specifically toxin can help mediate release of mast cells. The patient was a 2-year old boy who develo ped anaphylactic like reaction to a unsuspected sta phylococcus aureus infection. We present a case of suspected an aphylaxis that was found to be due to underlying St aph infection resulting from a previous orchidopexy . Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: After the allergy team was consulted a thorough phy sical examination revealed draining pus after manip ulating the surgical site. Wound culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, surgical intervention done, and the patient was started on IV clindamycin. Within 4-5 hours the rash and fever co mpletely resolved and he improved clinically. The p atient did well and was discharged accordingly.

Summary and Lessons Learned: A 25 year-old female with a history of Type II here ditary angioedema (HAE) and dual kidney-pancreas tr ansplant presented with antibody mediated rejection of her t ransplanted kidney requiring plasmapheresis. Sever al previous HAE attacks had been successfully treated with prompt a dministration of C1 inhibitor concentrate, although one late administration of C1 inhibitor resulted in intubati on for laryngeal swelling. Her mother has a histor y of hereditary angioedema. Physical examination revealed normal v ital signs and no significant swelling. Laboratory evaluation revealed a C4 level of 4 mg/dL and C1 inhibitor lev el of 20 showed diffuse glome rular and peritubular capillaritis consistent with acute anti body-mediated rejection. The patient received 1000 units of C1 inhibitor concentrate immediately after each of fiv e episodes of plasmapheresis without precipitation of HAE attack. Discussion: Plasmapheresis is a known precipitant of HAE attack s. Use of prophylactic medication in patients with HAE requiring plasmapheresis has not been previously reported. A fter careful review of the literature and discussio n with the patient, we concluded that our team had two options: 1) to p erform plasmapheresis and closely observe the patie nt, treating with C1 inhibitor concentrate at the first sign of swelling, or 2) to treat prophylactically with C1 i nhibitor after each round of plasmapheresis. In the end, we opted to t reat the patient prophylactically with C1 inhibitor concentrate because historically, the severity of her attacks h ad been life-threatening. For patients with HAE, a rare disease, much remains unknown regarding care recommendations in specific complex medical situations. As advances in medical care co ntinue, the appropriate care of patients with HAE w ill continue to evolve. For the first time, we report successful a dministration of prophylactic C1 inhibitor concentr ate in a patient with HAE requiring plasmapheresis for antibody mediated organ rejection. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 25 year-old woman with a history o f HAE and kidney/pancreas transplant who was hospit alized for antibody mediated graft rejection. Treatment of an tibody mediated graft rejection involves immunoglob ulin administration and plasmapheresis. The treating tr ansplant team was concerned that plasmapheresis ld dramatically patient's C1 inhibitor level , precipitating an angioedema attack. The patient, originally from Mexico, has a history of type 1 diabetes causing end stage renal disease. She has lived in the United States for the past 5 years. She received k idney/pancreas transplant in August, 2016. The patient was diagnosed with Type II HAE in 2014. The initial episode that suggested HAE involved l ip and mucosa swelling. Diagnosis was suggested by a family hist ory of HAE in her mother. Laboratory evaluation re the following: C4, 8; C1 inhibitor level 30, C1 inhibit or function, 3%. Since the time of her diagnosis, s he continues to have approximately 3 episodes of angioedema per year. T ypical episodes involve swelling of her lip and ton gue. Triggers of HAE attacks include both trauma and stress. The pa tient was placed on C1 inhibitor concentrate as nee ded for attacks, which was stored at the local emergency department initially and later administered at home. Treatmen t of attacks with C1 inhibitor concentrate, when administered pr omptly, almost uniformly resulted in swift resoluti on of symptoms. One attack, however, involved late administration o f C1 inhibitor concentrate, and the patient develop ed life- threatening airway swelling requiring airway intuba tion. Recent laboratory evaluation revealed renal failure and positive donor specific antibodies. Kidney bi opsy showed diffuse glomerular and peritubular capillaritis consistent with acute antibody-mediated rejection. In determining a treatment plan, we reviewed the me dical literature and discussed with the patient the following options: 1) perform plasmapheresis and closely moni tor the patient, administering C1 inhibitor concent rate in the event of an attack, or 2) prophylactically treat the pati ent with C1 inhibitor concentrate following each ro und of plasmapheresis. Since the patient's history includ ed a life-threatening episode of angioedema, we opt ed to treat prophylactically with C1 inhibitor concentrate. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient tolerated five rounds of plasmapheresis well, receiving C1 inhibitor concentrate immediate ly after each episode of plasmapheresis. She remained asymptomat ic, with no swelling or tingling or her lips or oro pharynx. Upon discharge, she continues to have C1 inhibitor conce ntrate ready for administration as needed at home. We remain hopeful that her renal graft remains free from reje ction.

We report a case of red pep per anaphylaxis with mugwort-mustard syndrome which might be caused by cross-reactivity between mugwort and red pepper is discussed. A 58-year-old female with a medical hist ory of pollinosis (birch, timothy, orchard grass, a nd mugwort), mugwort-mustard syndrome, and chronic urticaria vis ited our hospital and complained about her allergic symptoms. She has suffered from nasal obstruction for years d ue to the smell of red pepper. She reported some hi stories of allergic symptoms and anaphylaxis every time she consumed mu stard and red pepper. She was brought to the emerge ncy department every time she ate red pepper owing to n asal obstruction, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomitin g, and general itchy rash. These symptoms developed starting withi n 15-120 min from the ingestion of red pepper. She has never experienced allergic symptoms with other foods and after eliminating red pepper and mustard by herself . We performed serum allergen-specific IgE, skin prick, and basophil activation tests as well as oral food challenge with red pepper. The results revealed that the anaphylaxis w as caused by red pepper allergy accompanied with mu gwort- mustard syndrome. We suggested that the anaphylaxis in this case was caused by cross-reactivity vulgaris (mugwort) and Solanaceae family pepper). More investigations on the cro ss-reactivity between mugwort and other foods are necessary. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient was a 58-year-old female who owns a sto re for Japanese-style pickles called Tsukemono. She had a medical history of pollinosis (birch, timothy, orchard gras s, and mugwort), mugwort-mustard syndrome, and chro nic urticaria. She visited our hospital and complained of her alle rgic symptoms. She has suffered from nasal obstruct ion for years due to the smell of red pepper. She reported some histo ries of allergic symptoms and anaphylaxis every tim e she consumed mustard, lotus with mustard, Japanese-style pickles with red pepper, and jellyfish with red pepper. Sh e has never experienced allergic symptoms with other foods and after eliminating red pepper and mustard by herself . Hence, we performed serum allergen-specific IgE test includin g pollen and food sensitization, skin prick, and ba sophil activation tests and the oral food challenge with red pepper. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Her serum allergen-specific IgE test was elevated i n birch, timothy, orchard grass, and mugwort. The r esults of the skin prick and basophil activation tests were positive f or mustard, but were negative for red pepper. We pe rformed the oral food challenge with red pepper to determine the red pepper allergy. After ingesting 0.2 g of red peppe r, she complained of abdominal pain and was immediately administered H1 antihistamine. The results revealed that anaphyl axis was caused by red pepper allergy with mugwort-mustard s yndrome. We suggested that the anaphylaxis in this case was caused by the cross-reactivity between Artemisia vu lgaris (mugwort) and Solanaceae family (Capsicum an nuum: hot pepper). We instructed her to avoid red pepper and mustard and prescribed self-injectable epinephrine for anaphylaxis. After our visit, she has not experienced allergic s ymptoms.

University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT Case Title: Seminal Fluid Hypersensitivity Summary and Lessons Learned: A 37-year old woman presented with vaginal irritati on, burning, and itching following unprotected sexu al intercourse with her husband. Condom use or coitus interruptus prevented symptoms. Cutaneous skin prick testing us ing her husband's semen produced a 7mm wheal, confirming Ig E-mediated seminal fluid hypersensitivity. Allergen avoidance through abstinence, coitus interruptus, or condom u se was unfeasible, as she wanted to conceive. Proph ylactic oral antihistamine provided no perceivable benefit. Five milliliters of 6% cromolyn applied intravaginally prior to sexual intercourse successfully prevented symptoms, allowi ng the patient to engage in asymptomatic unprotecte d coitus. Symptoms of seminal fluid hypersensitivity caused b y IgE-mediated sensitization to seminal plasma prot eins range from post-coital vaginal pruritus to anaphylaxis. This c ondition makes conception challenging and causes si gnificant psychological stress. Allergen avoidance through ab stinence or condom use is the mainstay of treatment . In this case, we demonstrate that in patients with localized vagi nal symptoms for whom abstinence or condom use is i mpractical, prophylactic topical cromolyn preparations can prev ent vaginal pruritus. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 37-year-old G0P0 woman with sickle cell anemia, a llergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and mild, persistent a sthma presented to UNC Allergy/Immunology clinic reporting recurrent v aginal itching, irritation, and burning after unpro tected sexual intercourse with her husband. Symptoms started 30 s econds after ejaculation. She denied systemic cutan eous rash, hives, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dizziness. On two occasions, she developed cough post-coitus rel ieved with inhaled albuterol. Condom use or coitus interruptus prevent ed symptoms. Vaginal irritation improved with unpr otected sexual intercourse daily or every-other-day, but rebounded with abstinence of one week or longer. She denied food, medication, or latex allergies. She and her husband had no histories of STIs. As the couple desired a pregnancy, condom use and coitus interruptus during sexual intercours e was undesirable. Her husband provided a fresh semen sample that was allowed to liquefy for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. The upper layer of sample, containing the seminal p lasma proteins, was used for skin prick testing, pr oducing a 7mm wheal. wheals, respectively. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Skin prick testing confirmed IgE-mediated seminal f luid hypersensitivity. Given the patient's desire t o conceive, allergen avoidance was impractical. Oral cetirizine 10mg, 45 minutes prior to intercourse did not prevent local symptoms. Pretreatment with 5mL of 6% cromolyn in VersaBase\u00ae, a proprietary compounding base by Professional Com pounding Centers of America (Houston, TX), applied intravagi nally 15 minutes before intercourse successfully pr evented symptoms with unprotected coitus. She and her husba nd are actively pursuing pregnancy. Submission Number: 89 Poster Number: 5 Keyword: Anaphylaxis Primary Author Name: Helen T.

Marshall, MD, An Nguyen, MD, Serge De Gol ovine, MD, David Engler, MD Case Title: Acquired Angioedema Secondary To Myeloma With Exace rbations Due To Fresh Frozen Plasma Summary and Lessons Learned: We present a case of acquired angioedema that empha sizes the importance of increased clinical suspicio n and a broad diagnostic workup beyond C1 esterase inhibitor (C1I NH) studies, and the for paradoxical exac erbations with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). This case will open disc ussion for diagnosing acquired angioedema as well a s management of this disease process and other associated pathologi es. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient is a 53-year-old man with obesity, mitral v alve prolapse, and acquired angioedema. He had been experiencing worsening recurrent abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting since age 49 and was tentatively diagnosed with angioedema at an outside institution. At that time, his complement studies were reduced or at the lowe r limit of normal: C4 was 16 levels of C2, C3, and a normal CH50. He had no family hist ory of angioedema or autoimmune disease. He was initially tried on recombinant human C1INH but was changed to C1INH concentrate from human plasma due to poor response to the former. He subsequently began developing epi sodes of hand and foot angioedema. A reve aled severe mitral regurgitation, and mitral surgery was attempted with C1INH concentrate and FFP prophylaxi s, but during induction the patient developed sever e laryngeal edema that was refractory to additional C1INH conce ntrate and FFP; he remained intubated for four days and developed a pulmonary embolus. Three weeks later he experienc ed hematochezia on anticoagulation, and after isola ted administration of prophylactic C1INH concentrate an d FFP prior to endoscopy he again suddenly develope d severe refractory laryngeal edema and remained intubated f or four days. He was advised complete avoidance of FFP in the future and instead receive human prothrombin comple x concentrate if needed for coagulation. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Due to difficulty controlling his angioedema and an association with malignancy, further work up was p ursued in our clinic. Kappa and lambda free light chains were fou nd to be elevated and serum protein electrophoresis showed an M- spike. A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated plasma cel l population of 20%. Patient was started on dexamet hasone by hematology. Patient was pretreated with human C1INH concentrate and icatibant before and after surgery . He successfully received surgery for mitral valve repl acement and was extubated without event. He continu es to be managed on C1INH concentrate from human plasma and icatibant for rescue therapy.

Here, we report a case of a young man who presented with anaphylaxis to this ve getable. A 35 year old man presented to the emergency depart ment with diffuse hives after eating drumstick vege table. He had generalized hives, angioedema, shortness of breath and was hypotensive. He was given epinephrine injec tion and oral antihistamine and referred to allergy clinic. There , skin testing to drumstick vegetable was negative. A food challenge was then done in clinic, during which he developed anaphylaxis to drumstick vegetable. Drumstick vegetable is commonly ingested in Southea st Asian countries, including India, from which thi s patient originates. This plant is thought to have anti-infl ammatory and anti-oxidant benefits, hence its high intake in this region. It is normally eaten after being saut\u00e9ed or boiled, and is generally not ingested raw. Despite its com mon place in Southeast Asian diets, this is the first reported c ase of anaphylaxis to drumstick vegetable. Whilst t rue allergy to the drumstick vegetable may not be common, it is import ant to note that anaphylaxis in some individuals to this vegetable may be possible and should remain in the differenti al. Other plants in the same genus as drumstick veg etable are not ingested in typical diets, though plants in the sam e order (brassicales) include papaya, capers, which have been documented as causing anaphylaxis in certain patien ts. Perhaps a similar protein in all these related plants is the causative agent. Further investigation is necessary to know which protein from the drumstick vegetable caused anaphylaxis in our patient, and if that protein is present in these related plants. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 35 year old male was referred to the allergy clin ic for further work up after presenting to ED with anaphylaxis. Two weeks prior, patient presented to ED with diffu se hives and shortness of breath. He had just eaten lunch at his home, drumstick vegetable stew - which included sau t\u00e9ed drumstick vegetable mixed in various Indian he rbs and spices. Within the next half hour, he developed generalized hives, lip and tongue swelling, nausea, throat tig htness, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness, prompting him to go to the ED. At presentation to ED, he was hypotensi ve to 88/33, HR 114. Vitals and urticaria improved after epinephrin e injection 0.3mg and antihistamines. He recalls he had drumstick vegetable once prior to this episode, roughly one year ago, after which he developed mild hives on his body that self resolved. Interestingly , drumstick vegetable is only sold for one month of every year in the region where this patient resides, thus, his intake is infrequent. His PMH includes vitiligo and hyperlipidemia. No hx of eczema, rhinitis, asthma. No family hx of aller gic conditions. He is on no medications. A complete physical exam was unremarkable. No eczem a or hives noted. To assess if the patient had an allergy to and deve loped anaphylaxis to drumstick vegetable, the decis ion was made to pursue skin testing. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our patient underwent epicutaneous testing via pric k technique for raw and cooked drumstick vegetable, both were negative (0mm), histamine was 4mm. Because his hist ory was heavily suggestive of anaphylaxis, the deci sion was made to pursue an oral challenge in clinic. He was slowl y given progressively increasing increments of drum stick vegetable and closely observed. He tolerated up to the last and l argest dose of his food challenge, which was 6gm dr umstick vegetable, after which he quickly developed diffuse hives, mil d angioedema and nausea. His blood pressure dropped 20 systolic points. Epinephrine injection 0.3mg, cetirizine and prednisone 30mg po were given promptly. His hives resolved and his blood pressure improved. His response to the food c hallenge was suggestive of anaphylaxis to drumstick vegetable. Because the patient developed anaphylaxis to drumst ick vegetable in clinic during the oral challenge, he will have to be very careful to avoid exposure to drumstick vegetab le going forward. His treatment plan will also incl ude carrying an epipen for accidental ingestion. The patient had pl ans to follow up to get protein testing done to fur ther assess is reaction to drumstick vegetable, though he never fo llowed up to have this lab work done.

Ono, N Odajima, Case Title: Exercise-induced anaphylaxis with hyperleukotrieneu ria in the challenge tests Summary and Lessons Learned: We experienced a case of exercise-induced anaphylax is which was diagnosed by the exercise challenge te st. The production of leukotrienes (LTs) is known to be inv olved in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced anaph ylaxis. In case, even phase after cold stimula tion test, urinary LTE4 was elevated. The m easurement of urinary LTE4 during day-by-day challenge test was i mportant for accurate diagnosis of exercise-induced anaphylaxis. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 12-year-old girl presented symptoms of acute flus hing, cyanosis, eye lids swelling and dyspnea after an endurance run, swimming and an intake of cold drink. She did not h ave any history of food allergy. And also, specific IgE and skin prick test were also negative for any suspected causal fo od. Based on her symptomatic episode, we performed two-day challenge tests. On the first day, cold water intak e test did not induce any symptom. After the test, plasma histamine level did not show significant change, but urinary LTE4 was clearly elevated (pre 295, post 400pg/mg cr.). On the second day, exercise challenge test (strongest load 80watt by ergometer) induced acute flushing, cyano sis, eye lid swelling, dyspnea and hypotension. After challenge test, plasma histamine (pre 0.7, post 81ng/mL) and urinary LTE4 were elevated (pre 579, post 846 pg/mg cr). Her serum tryptase level was measured once dur ing the asymptomatic period, and was within normal range. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: We diagnosed her as exercise-induced anaphylaxis. W e restricted her strong range exercise and prescrib ed adrenaline autoinjector. Twelve years have passed safely, and now she is working as a teacher for handicapped chi ldren.

Department of All ergy, \"Sotiria\" General Hospital, Athens, Greece Case Title: Anaphylaxis caused by omega-5-gliadin initially dia gnosed as idiopathic anaphylaxis. Summary and Lessons Learned: We herein report the case of a 59-year-old man who experienced two episodes of wheat dependent exercis e induced anaphylaxis, initially diagnosed as idiopathic anap hylaxis. The first episode took place in July 2016. The pati ent woke up in the morning and drove for an hour to his resort. While driving, he ate a piece of cheese and ham pie. Upon his arrival, he walked some meters to the garden a nd started feeling generalized pruritus and dizziness. He lost conscio usness for five minutes and recovered by himself. H e was carried to hospital where his vital signs were normal. A month after the first episode he visited an aller gist. His physical exam was non contributory. Skin prick tests to aeroallergens and prick to prick tests to the ingre dients of the pie were negative. Tryptase levels we re within normal limits and skin biopsy was negative for mastocytosi s. An endocrinology workup to rule out pheochromocy toma and carcinoid tumours was also carried out and was nega tive. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic ana phylaxis and was prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector. He was asymptomatic for eight months. The second episode took place in March 2017 at his resort. That morning he had a cup of milk and two s lices of toast for breakfast and started working in the garden. Two ho urs later he experienced generalized pruritus and u rticaria and fell unconscious. His wife had to administer two epineph rine auto-injectors before he regained consciousnes s. After the second episode of anaphylaxis it was deci ded to start treatment with omalizumab. Two months later he experienced an episode of generalized urticaria whi le working in the garden. He could not recall what he had eaten before. The patient visited our department in June 2017. We performed skin prick tests to a panel of common ae roallergens and food allergens. The test to gliadin was pecific IgE in serum (Immunocap Phadia) to omega-5- gliadin was also positive. The patient was advised to avoid wheat an d has been asymptomatic ever since. Cases diagnosed with idiopathic anaphylaxis may act ually be cases in which the culprit allergen has no t been identified. Detailed history and extensive workup may contribut e to the successful management of these patients. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient's physical exam at his first visit to o ur department was unyielding. His personal and fami ly history of atopy was negative. He had a history of atrial fibrillati on and had been on flecainide 100 mg BID and aspiri n 100 mg at noon for four years. He was really worried about his conditi on, as he had experienced two near death reactions and he did not know what had caused them. He had stopped treatment with omalizumab a month ago. We tried to identify any possible factor that could have been the cause of anaphylaxis or might have c ontributed to its occurrence. The patient denied having taken any oth er drug except from flecainide the mornings he expe rienced the anaphylactic reactions. He also denied having been stung by an insect. He had eaten cheese and ham pie bought from the same bakery, as well as toast and milk, several times after the reactions, without any problem. He had been in good health before the reactions at all times. The only common factor we identified in all occasio ns was mild to moderate exercise while walking or w orking in the garden. So, we concluded that exercise could be a c o-factor for the occurrence of anaphylaxis. In this case, food dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) coul d be the diagnosis. Gliadin and LTP are allergens a ssociated with FDEIA in our region. The skin prick test to gliadin was positive (8mm), while the test to peach (LTP) was negative. We also performed skin prick tests to common aeroaller gens and food allergens, including wheat, which wer e negative as well. Specific IgE in serum (Immunocap Phadia) to o mega-5-gliadin was positive (14.00 kUA/l), sp ecific IgEs to all LTPs tested (wheat, peach, hazelnut, peanut) were n egative. Specific IgEs to soya's allergen component s were also performed and were negative. Total IgE was 510.8 kU /l. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our diagnosis was wheat dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). Taking into consideration the severity of the anaph ylactic reactions the patient had experienced, he w as advised to avoid wheat. He also restarted treatment with omali zumab. He was prescribed an epinephrine auto-inject or and given an action plan for the management of anaphylaxis. T he patient has been asymptomatic ever since and his quality of life has significantly improved, as now he is fully info rmed about his condition.

Since our patient was not respons ive to traditional treatment regimens of first-gene ration antihistamines, second-generation antihistamines, a nd a was made to t ry anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab. What makes this patient u nique is his exquisite sensitivity to omalizumab. While on omalizumab several years prior for the treatment of difficult-to-control severe-persistent asthma, he developed severe arthralgias, joint swelling, and tendonitis, after each omalizumab injection. Understanding his hyper sensitivity, and being out of treatment options for his idiopathic a naphylaxis, we titrated the dosage of omalizumab to the highest dose tolerated without the manifestation of side effects . A lower-than-standard dose of omalizumab 75mg (6 cc) subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, has proved ad equate to control both his idiopathic anaphylaxis a nd 2. Bell MC, Jackson DJ. Prevention of anaphylaxis related to mast cell activation syndrome with omali zumab. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2012;108(5):383. Patient Presentation and Testing: Our patient is a 48-year-old Caucasian male, with a long history of solar urticaria, moderate-persiste nt asthma (without aspirin sensitivity), allergic rhinitis, and chroni c rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. He presented f or an urgent visit because of acute hives, tongue tingling, facial flushing, a nd lip edema. This initial episode occurred while eating lunch, which included chicken kebabs, hummus, rice with spices, and mint tea -- items which he had consumed without problems in the past. Our initial thought was that a hidden fo od ingredient caused the reaction. With daily fexo fenadine and a 5- day burst of prednisone, the symptoms resolved. Fo od allergy testing (including chicken, hummus, rice , and mint) did not reveal any specific food sensitivity. He staye d symptom free for the next four months until the s udden onset of symptoms: itchy palms and feet, progressing within several hours to whole body itching, facial flushin g, facial edema, throat swelling, and vomiting. There was no exposu re to any specific food, environmental, or chemical around the time of this reaction. Symptoms waxed and waned over th e next few days, despite self-management with multi ple doses of diphenhydramine and fexofenadine. His tryptase lev el was found to be 20.8 ng/mL. Over the next sever al weeks, this patient's symptoms proved difficult to control. Ev en with high-dose oral steroids, he developed sever e respiratory difficulty, requiring 2-days of inpatient hospital care without intubation. After hospitalization wit h IV solumedrol and IV famotidine, his outpatient anaphylactic symptoms we re controlled with a daily regimen of 180mg prednisone required a 1-month long taper. Baseline tryptase levels were normal, ranging from 2.3 to 7.0 ng/mL. Additional labs were obtained, i ncluding peripheral blood for cKIT D816V mutation analysis (negative), and 24-hour urine for 5-HIAA, metanephrines, and ca techolamines (all negative). The patient continued to have recu rrent episodes of symptoms including facial flushin g and lip edema, requiring short courses of oral prednisone. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: After ruling out chronic idiopathic urticaria, mast ocytosis, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid syndrome, the idiopathic anaphylaxis vs. idiopathic mast cell act ivation syndrome was made. Despite maximal treatme nt with first generation antihistamines, second generation antihi stamines, and leukotriene inhibitors, the patient s till had partial flares of anaphylactic symptoms including facial fl ushing and lip edema requiring multiple courses of oral prednisone. Thus, we decided to treat his condition with anti-I gE therapy. In view of his prior history of side e ffects associated with omalizumab treatment for moderate-persistent asthma (severe arthralgias, joint swelling, and tendoniti s in his finger joints), we started a graded challenge with omalizu mab, monitoring both for side-effects and for contr ol of his idiopathic anaphylaxis symptoms. The schedule included a star ting dose of omalizumab 75mg (6cc, or one-half the lowest recommended dose for asthma or chronic idiopathic u rticaria) subcutaneous injection, and subsequent in crease dose every 2-weeks to 112.5mg, 150mg, 187.5mg, 225m g, etc. The patient was unable to tolerate the 112 .5mg dose, but did not have any significant side-effects with the 75mg dose. Fortunately, we were able to obtain good control of his anaphylactic episodes and solar urticaria with omalizumab at 75mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks. For patients who have intolerable side-effects from omalizumab, this medication should not be abandone d in the treatment of idiopathic anaphylaxis or solar urtica ria. As demonstrated in our patient by effective t reatment with a 75mg dose of omalizumab, a graded challenge (increa sing the dose every 2-weeks) should be attempted.

The patient had already received IVIG and failed to hav e longstanding neurologic improvement. As a result, his medical team, which included Hematology and Neurology, dete rmined that the ideal therapy for his disease proce ss would be plasmapheresis, using 5% HSA, a commonly used collo id. He developed respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous symptoms within 30 minutes of initiation of his fir st plasmapheresis with 5% HSA infusion. The reactio n was effectively treated with antihistamines and epinephrine, though he did require subsequent transfer and monitoring in the intensive care unit. No other triggers were identified for th e reaction. He was skin tested to several formulati ons of HSA, with negative skin prick but positive intradermal tests and had objective symptoms consistent with a system ic immediate hypersensitivity reaction to intradermally placed H SA. He was also skin tested to fresh frozen plasma (FFP), another possible replacement fluid, with positive intraderm al skin test results. Given the clinical presentati on and results of skin testing, administration of HSA or FFP through desen sitization was considered too high risk in this pat ient with low reserve, poor sensory perception and poor motor cap acity; he therefore received IVIG and steroids as t he alternative, but not preferred treatment. HSA is a commonly used colloid and reactions are extremely rare. However, this case demonstrates that colloids should be considered in the differential list of possible triggers in hyper sensitivity reactions. Furthermore, there may be utility in skin testing t o determine safety of future administration. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 10-year-old male who presented with extremity wea kness was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome an d treated with two courses of IVIG with initial improvement. However, his symptoms were ultimately refractory an d there was concern for chronic inflammatory demyelinating poly neuropathy. His past medical history is notable for wheezing and allergic rhinitis, but he had no known drug or food allergies. Given his comorbid conditions including obesity and hypertension, steroids were deferred and the decisi on was made to proceed with 5 days of plasmapheresi s with albumin as the replacement fluid. After receiving the first bottle of albumin (250 mL ), 10% of the full infusion dose, and less than 30 minutes after initiation of plasmapheresis, he developed throat c learing and nasal congestion followed by acute vomi ting, difficulty breathing, and diffuse rash. He was also noted to b e hypoxic (pulse oximeter 86%) and wheezing with po or air movement. He was given diphenhydramine and placed o n 4L supplemental oxygen without improvement in hyp oxia. Though rash improved, he continued to have respirat ory distress and albuterol and epinephrine were adm inistered. Blood pressures remained stable. He was transferred to the ICU for further care, where his symptoms qu ickly resolved following epinephrine administration. Detailed revi ew of history for other possible triggers, includin g food, latex, and drugs, was unrevealing. This was his first time rec eiving albumin infusion. There are limited cases reporting hypersensitivity reactions to albumin, with ahaptoglobinemia and IgA deficiency thought to be underlying in several cases. Haptoglo bin and IgA level were normal in our patient. It is also thought that caprylate, which is added during commercial product ion of human serum albumin to prevent protein aggre gates, which can be immunogenic, can elicit reactions. The album in administered to this patient contained sodium ca prylate. Tryptase was drawn 50 minutes after onset of reacti on and was normal (7.5 ug/L). Immune mechanism was not confirmed by in vitro IgE testing. Though skin testing is not validated for albumin, w e proceeded to skin test to determine the safety of future administration given the severity of his reaction a nd the limited treatment options. We skin tested to three undiluted formulations of 5% HSA: the lot number to which the patient reacted, a different lot number from the s ame manufacturer, and a different manufacturer. All for mulations contained caprylate; a caprylate free for mulation was not available despite attempts from our institution's p harmacy to obtain it. Skin prick testing was negati ve, but intradermal testing was positive for all 5% HSA formulations. F urthermore, 20 minutes after placement of intraderm al testing, the patient developed throat clearing, cough, and nasal congestion that was a clear change from his baseli ne and concerning for a systemic reaction. Lungs were clear with some transmitted upper airway sounds. Benadryl was admi nistered and symptoms improved within a few minutes. The family reported that these symptoms were similar to those he had at onset of his reaction to plasmapheresis. FFP was suggested as an alternative replacement flu id, with some promising features: the manufacturing steps used to make HSA preparations that leads to protein aggrega tes are not done in the production of FFP preparati ons. In addition, FFP does not contain caprylate. Skin prick and intr adermal testing to undiluted FFP from one donor was also performed and was positive at the intradermal level. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: In this case, the trigger for the patient's reactio n was suspected to be HSA based on timing of the re action. HSA is not considered highly immunogenic, but protein aggregat es and addition of caprylate can increase its immun ogenicity. Though in vitro testing for specific IgE to albumin was not performed, positive skin test and objectiv e symptoms to skin testing suggested that the mechanism was mast cell mediated, and we favor anaphylaxis given that HSA i s not known to be an indirect mast cell degranulator. Given the im mediate onset of objective symptoms after intraderm al skin test, it was decided that attempting to desensitize to album in would be remarkably high risk and the recommenda tion was made to strictly avoid any future administration of albumin. We also considered this patient sensitize d to FFP and offered desensitization, but recognized that this w as extremely high risk given his neurologic status and poor reserve and concern that any potential reactions may be cat astrophic. After discussion with the Neurology team about the risks and benefits of desensitization, they elected to pr oceed with another course of IVIG and initiating st eroids, with some improvement in symptoms. He is currently undergoing a prednisone taper while receiving inpatient rehab ilitation services. Should the need for plasmapheresis be pre ssing in the future, we will reconsider desensitiza tion to FFP. Submission Number: Montazeri, MD FRCPC Primary Institution: Western University, Department of Allergy and Immu nology, London, Ontario, Canada Additional Authors: Samira Jeimy, Godfrey Lam, MD FRCPC David William Moote, MD FRCPC Western University, Department of Allergy and Immun ology, London, Ontario, Canada Case Title: Anaphylaxis with corn pollen aeroallergen exposure Summary and Lessons Learned: Anaphylaxis to aeroallergens is exceedingly rare. I n 1984, Spitalny et al. described a phenomenon term ed \"Alpine Slide anaphylaxis\", where five patients developed grass a eroallergen anaphylaxis presumably due to skin abra sions sustained during sledding. Since then, six other cases of sy stemic symptoms due to aeroallergen exposure have b een described, with grass pollen (Ram\u00f3n et al. 2017, Haluk Akar et al. 2015, Tsunoda et al. 2003, Miesen et al. 2001) , the ornamental indoor green plant Tradescantia (Albifloxia) (Wuthr ich & Johansson, 1997), and horse allergen (Cavkayt ar et al. 2014) as suspected sensitizations. We present the case of a 29-year-old agricultural s ales consultant who developed anaphylaxis after exp osure to the aeroallergen corn pollen. The patient was walking t hrough a cornfield in July while pollen-containing tassels were in bloom. He was not physically exerting himself on th is walk, and he had no recent ingestion of alcohol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Within minutes of his walk , he developed diffuse urticaria and facial angioed ema with associated respiratory distress. No cardiovascular or gastrointestinal symptoms were noted. The patien t drove himself to his nearest emergency department, where he recei ved two doses of epinephrine and oral diphenhydrami ne. His symptoms completely recovered. Based on his clinical history, we performed epicuta neous testing with environmental aeroallergens, inc luding corn pollen. Our patient had skin prick IgE-reactivity t o corn and grass pollen. His anaphylactic episode i n the cornfield is thought to have been due to exposure to a high conc entration of corn pollen. Unlike the individuals de scribed in the \"Alpine Slide Anaphylaxis\" case report, our patient had no known cutaneous injuries; however, he may h ave had minor abrasions while walking in a cornfield in a short-s leeved shirt, which acted as portals of entry for t he aeroallergen. Our case demonstrates a rare case of anaphylaxis to an aeroallergen and highlights the importance of c onsidering aeroallergens as triggers for anaphylaxis. To our k nowledge, this is the first reported case of anaphy laxis triggered by corn pollen exposure. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 29-year-old agricultural sales consultant with a history of hypothyroidism on thyroid replacement th erapy was referred to us for assessment of allergies. He repo rted rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms between spring an d fall seasons, and two episodes of systemic reactions. The first e pisode occurred when patient was walking through a cornfield in July 2016, with development of diffuse urticaria and fac ial angioedema with associated respiratory distress within minutes of his walk. There were no features on clinical histor y to suspect exercise or non-steroidal anti-inflamm atory associated reactions. Additionally, he is able to consume swee t corn. The patient was treated with epinephrine at his local emergency department, with resolution of his sympto ms. The patient reported one other episode of urticaria , facial and extremity angioedema, and respiratory distress due to the sensation of upper airway obstruction one and a half years earlier. This episode also required eme rgency department treatment with epinephrine. Possible tri ggers included ibuprofen (two 400 mg liquid gels ta ken within an hour of the reaction), or Belgian chocolate or alco hol, both of which were consumed the night before. Our patient's clinical history was suggestive of an aphylaxis given cutaneous and respiratory organ inv olvement; we therefore performed epicutaneous testing for aeroal lergens including corn. Skin prick testing indicate d positive responses for corn pollen (wheal 10 mm, erythema 40 mm) and grass (two preparations used: ALK, wheal 8 mm, erythema 20 9 for ragweed (0.73 kU/L; normal <0.35). Ragweed was test ed, despite negative skin tests, due to the symptom s in fall. Testing for corn pollen was not available at our in stitution. Serum specific IgE for hazelnut, commonl y found in Belgian chocolates, was weakly positive (0.38 kU/L; normal <0.35). Based on the recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis, we also evaluated for potential mast cell dysfunction. Our patient's serum tryptase was normal at 5.3 ug/L. As the patient's second reaction was suspicious for ibuprofen allergy, we performed a graded oral chal lenge with ibuprofen. The initial dose was 40 mg, this was fol lowed by 360 mg. Within 1 hour of the final dose, t he patient developed diffuse urticaria. He was treated with 20 mg of cetirizine with resolution of the urticaria within two and a half hours. No epinephrine was administered. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Based on his clinical history and investigations, t he patient was diagnosed with allergy to corn, gras s and ragweed pollens. The episode of anaphylaxis in the cornfiel d is thought to have been due to exposure to a high concentration of corn pollen, an aeroallergen. The exact mechanism o f aeroallergen entrance is unclear since the patien t was not aware of any cutaneous injuries. However, he may have ina dvertently sustained abrasions that acted as portal s of entry. He was prescribed epinephrine autoinjectors. For his seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis with grass and ragweed sensitization, he was started on grass and ragweed subcutaneous immunotherapy. We hope to see some cro ss-reactivity with corn pollen since the two are re lated. We were not able to find reports of corn pollen subcut aneous immunotherapy. Our patient's second episode of systemic reaction w as likely due to ibuprofen, based on the positive o ral challenge. As well, the delay in symptom onset and weakly positiv e serum specific IgE for hazelnut makes this an unl ikely culprit. He was advised to carry an epinephrine autoinjector an d avoid ibuprofen, other NSAIDs, and hazelnuts (pen ding an oral challenge).

We report the case of a 32-year-old man with season al allergic rhinitis and mild asthma who experience d weakness, diffuse pruritic rash, abdominal pain and vomiting immediately after the ingestion of wood blewit mush rooms (Lepista nuda). Methods: Allergy skin prick tests (SPTs) were perfo rmed with 8 common molds and a commercial mushroom extract derived from Agaricus Campestris (Alk, Abello Pharm , Mississauga, Canada). SPTs were also performed to 7 different fresh mushroom species (including Lepista nuda) in both cooked and raw forms. Agaricus bisporus IgE Uppsala, S weden). Commercial sIgE to other mushroom species w ere not available. Results: Among molds tested, SPTs were slightly pos itive to Cladosporium, Aspergillus fumigatus and to mixed Aspergillus species. A negative SPT was obtained wi th the commercial mushroom extract. The SPTs to bot h raw and cooked Lepista nuda produced respectively a strongl y positive 20 mm and 15 mm wheal, while all other s pecies tested were negative. Four controls had negative SPTs to L epista Nuda. The patient tolerated other mushrooms including White Button (Agaricus bisporus) and Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) mushrooms, and had a negative open food cha llenge to King Trumpet (Pleurotes Eryngii) mushroom. Agaricus bis porus sIgE were negative. Conclusions: We believe that this is the first repo rted case of anaphylaxis to wood blewit mushroom (L epista nuda). The patient was able to tolerate other mushrooms, sugge sting no clinical cross-reactivity with other speci es. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 32 year-old Caucasian man referred to the allergy clinic of Notre-Dame Hospital for a suspected mushroom allergy. He was known for mild intermitten t asthma and allergic rhinitis with positive skin t ests to birch, ragweed, timothy, dust mites, cats, dogs, and horse s. The patient had no other health problems other t han a childhood penicillin allergy. In June 2015, a few minutes after eating salmon wit h eggs and mushrooms at a restaurant (the patient c ould not recall the exact species), he developed abdominal pain and weakness, followed by multiple episodes of vomitin g which lasted all night. He consulted a few days later with persi stent abdominal pain and was treated with a proton pump inhibitor. Six months later, while eating pasta with wood blew it mushrooms (Lepista nuda), he immediately experie nced weakness, abdominal pain, pharyngeal itching, diffu se pruritic rash as well as hand and feet edema. An hour later, he started vomiting. He was admitted at Sacr\u00e9-Coeur ho spital and was treated with prednisone and benadryl . He subsequently underwent upper GI endoscopy, and abdo minal ultrasound, which were normal. Unfortunately tryptase was not dosed during this presentation. SPTs were performed to a commercial extract of mush room derived from Agaricus Campestris (Alk, Abello Pharm, Mississauga, Canada) as well as 7 different species of fresh mushrooms in both cooked and raw forms: rcial to other mushroom species were not available. Since cross-reaction between molds and mushrooms we re previously reported, skin prick tests (SPTs) wer e also performed to extracts of Alternaria, Aspergillus fu migatus, Canada) Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Among molds tested, skin prick tests (SPTs) were sl ightly positive to Cladosporium, Aspergillus fumiga tus and to mixed Aspergillus species. A negative SPT was obtained wi th the commercial mushroom extract. The SPTs to bot h raw and cooked Lepista nuda produced respectively a strongl y positive 20 mm and 15 mm wheal, while all other s pecies tested were negative. Four controls had negative SPTs to r aw Lepista Nuda. The patient tolerated other mushro oms including White Button (Agaricus bisporus) and Shiitake (Lent inula edodes) mushrooms, and had a negative open fo od challenge to King Trumpet (Pleurotes Eryngii) mushroom. Agari cus bisporus sIgE were negative. Basal tryptase lev el was normal. We believe that this is the first reported case of anaphylaxis to wood blewit mushroom (Lepista nuda). The patient was able to tolerate other mushrooms, suggesting no cli nical cross-reactivity with other species. The pati ent was told to avoid Lepista nuda mushroom and provided with a por table epinephrine auto-injector. Submission Number: 180 Poster Number: 13 Keyword: Author Name: Hanadys Ale, MD.

Weston, Fl Case Title: Anaphylaxis due to Polyether Compounds in Medicatio ns and Oral Hygiene Products Summary and Lessons Learned: A 33-year-old female with a history of allergic rhi nitis presented for evaluation of anaphylactic reac tions to multiple medications and mouthwash. After an extensive worku p to determine the specific cause of these seemingl y unrelated anaphylactic reactions, it was hypothesized that th e patient was reacting to one or more of the compon ents common to incremental intradermal skin testing demonstrated immediate hypersensitivity to polyeth er compounds (polyethylene glycol 3350, polysorbate 80, and polo xamer 407). She was advised to assiduously read pro duct labels in order to avoid further inadvertent exposure to thes e compounds and has not needed to use her epinephri ne autoinjector since. Polyether compounds are common ingredients used in a wide variety of oral hygiene products, cosmetics, and as solvents in liquid and capsule formulations of medi cations. As they are frequently present in multiple items, caution may be necessary as these may be an underrecognized pre cipitating factor in allergic reactions. Polyether compounds are often listed as either excipients or inactive ingre dients making it very difficult for investigators t o decipher the specific cause of a reaction, and for patients to avoid thes e substances once identified. This case exhibits th e importance of obtaining a thorough history when approaching a pat ient with multiple episodes of anaphylaxis without a clear etiology, and specifically highlights the importance of consi dering additives and excipients as possible causes of severe, life- threatening allergic reactions. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of allergic rhinitis who presented for evaluation o f multiple medication allergies. Five years prior she was treated for foo t pain with an injection of bupivacaine and methylp rednisolone. She developed immediate onset of swelling, nausea, emes is, hypotension, and blurry vision. She was treated for anaphylaxis at an outside hospital and was instructed to avoid both medications in the future. One year prior, after taking polyethylene glycol 33 50 in preparation for a colonoscopy, she developed immediate-onset hives, facial swelling, sneezing and difficulty swa llowing. One week later she took a dose of bisacody l and developed an urticarial rash and facial swelling. The patient was advised to avoid laxatives. While w aiting for confirmatory testing, she contacted the office with complaints of a similar reaction following use of a mouthwash. Initial work up consisted of testing for bupivacain e, and methylprednisolone while strategies were dev eloped to test for polyethylene glycol, bisacodyl and mouth wash compo nents. Allergy skin testing to various anesthetics, including bupivacaine, was negative. Allergy skin testing to various corticosteroids including triamcinolone, de xamethasone, methylprednisolone sodium succinate solution, and m ethylprednisolone acetate were carried out and find ings were significant for a strongly positive result only to methylprednisolone acetate. Due to the strong posit ivity to methylprednisolone acetate skin testing but negativ e testing to methylprednisolone sodium succinate so lution, it was concluded that patient was likely reacting to one o r more of the excipient components in methylprednis olone acetate. These consisted of polyethylene glycol 3350, polyso 80, and benzyl alcohol. Reviews of the ingred ients of the mouthwash she reacted to indicated that it containe d poloxamer 407. The latter compound is composed of two polyethylene glycol blocks. Polyethylene glycol 335 0 and bisacodyl both contain the ingredient polyeth ylene glycol. An 3350, polysorbate 80, poloxamer 407, and benzy l alcohol. Maximum non-irritant concentrations were obtained f or polyethylene glycol 3350, polysorbate 80, poloxa mer 407, and benzyl alcohol from the literature and validated on healthy controls. After obtaining informed consent , we performed sequential and incremental intradermal skin testing with these compounds. A positive reaction was defi ned as a wheal measuring greater than 5 mm in diameter. Testing sh owed the following results (expressed as wheal/flar e in millimeters): were 11/50 and 0/0, respectivel y. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with anaphylaxis to polye ther compounds, which was confirmed with positive i ntradermal testing to polyethylene glycol 3350, polysorbate 80 , and poloxamer 407. Although previous studies have shown IgE- mediated hypersensitivity to occur with polyethylen e glycol, hypersensitivity to a broad range of poly ether compounds has not been previously reported. Further research , using the testing protocols identified herein, is needed to determine the extent of cross reactivity between po lyether compounds. These results emphasize the impo rtance of physician awareness of the potential for polyether compounds to cause immediate hypersensitivity react ions, including severe reactions such as anaphylaxis. This is espec ially important because these compounds are frequen tly listed as inactive ingredients and are, therefore, more diffi cult to identify as constituents of medications and hygiene products. Patients with this diagnosis need to be counseled o n the importance of carrying an epinephrine autoinj ector at all times and to practice meticulous label reading. Submission Number: 189 Poster Number: 14 Keyword: Anaphylaxis Primary Author Name: Anh Dao, MD Primary Author Institution: University of Cincinnati Additional Authors: David Bernstein, MD Case Title: Protracted Anaphylaxis - an Occupational Hazard? Summary and Lessons Learned: Laboratory animal allergy (LAA) is an occupational hazard for individuals working in research settings . Up to 44% of workers have reported a LAA; typically, workers bec ome sensitized to rodent allergens and experience o ccupational rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and/or contact urticari a. Here, we describe a case of protracted anaphylax is to murine blood after an accidental needle stick. The patient did n ot receive epinephrine until almost 30 minutes afte r the incident, ultimately requiring multiple doses of epinephrine injection for protracted anaphylaxis. This case emphasizes two important lessons in an aphylaxis. First, it is important to recognize occu pational risk scenarios for anaphylaxis. Secondly, in such scenar ios, it is essential to be prepared to treat accide ntal anaphylaxis expeditiously with epinephrine. A recent survey of animal care laboratories found that 8% of facilitie s reported at least one episode of anaphylaxis to a rodent bite, sugges ting these reactions are not uncommon. (Stave et. a l.) Given the high rate of allergic sensitization to mammalian protein s in animal workers, it is imperative that these w orkers recognize the potential risk of anaphylaxis from systemic exposur e to animal allergens via a bite or needle stick. L aboratory animal workers should be counseled on potential risks of d eveloping LAA, advised on proper needle handling, a nd educated on recognition of symptoms of anaphylaxis. An epinephr ine autoinjector should be prescribed to animal han dlers with LAA symptoms. Although anaphylaxis to lab animal allerg ens is a rare event, research institutions should c onsider implementing action plans for treating such reactio ns with epinephrine within the first 10 minutes aft er onset. 1.

Journal of Occupational a nd Environmental Medicine, 59(8), 728-738. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 31-year-old female worked in a laboratory with mi ce for 10 years. Initially, she developed pruritus and swelling with direct skin contact as well as dyspnea when cleanin g cages. Symptoms resolved after she was moved to other duties. On the day of the incident, she was drawing mouse bloo d when her hand was accidentally pierced by an unca pped needle of syringe containing mouse blood; the needle went through her hand. Immediately, her fingers swelled followed by diffuse pruritus, periorbital edema and dyspnea. An initial dose of epinephrine was given more than 25 minutes after the needle stick. She was transferred to the emergency room where she presented with a blood pressure of 8 1/51 and wheezing. She was given intravenous fluids (IVF), a lbuterol and diphenhydramine with improvement in BP to 101/45 and resolution of wheezing. Three hours later, she deve loped dyspnea, emesis, fatigue and hives on the bac k so was given a second dose of epinephrine as well as famotidine, p romethazine, prednisone and IVF with amelioration o f all symptoms except hives. During the night, she had persistent hives and wheezing and received a third dose of Epi nephrine 0.3mg intramuscularly and diphenhydramine. She was admitt ed and observed for 24 hours without further sympto ms and discharged home. At follow-up, mouse epithelium se rum specific IgE was 23.20 kU/L (normal < 0.10 kU/L ). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient recovered from the anaphylaxis episode afte r 3 doses of epinephrine were given. We suspect the course was protracted due to delayed administration of the ini tial epinephrine dose. Shortly after discharge, she followed up with the Allergy/Immunology clinic where mice avoidance was further discussed. However, changing employment was not a feasible option, therefore, it was recommended that she work in different capacity without handling mu rine blood. She was given an epinephrine autoinjector with instruct ions on carrying the epinephrine injector work a nd educated on recognizing anaphylaxis. Submission Number: 197 Keyword: Kobayaa Dandellion allergy centre Case Title: Anaphylaxis following recurring exposure to cold wa ter Summary and Lessons Learned: Known history of cold induced urticaria. Recurring exposure for 30 minutes to cold water while swimm ing in a lake, whenever the urticaria sets in, the patient will wo uld come out of the lake and warm up. Eventually, h e collapsed and had systemic reaction following recurring cold expo sures. Patients with cold urticaria need to be cautioned a bout recurring exposure to cold within close tempor al intervals as this could precipitate anaphylactic symptoms. Patient Presentation and Testing: 24 year old male who lives in Ontario Canada has hi story of recurrent hives when he goes outside in th e cold during the winter months for the past few winters. However, on Canada day, July 1st, he was at a lake swimming and the water was cold and he kept going i n and out because he was breaking out with hives within 1-2 m inutes of exposure to the cold water so he would co me out to warm up, when he feels better in 5 minutes he will jump back into the cold water. After 30 minutes of recurring exposure to cold water and recurring hives, he felt dizzy and nauseous and he lost consciousness for a brief period of time. He was hypotensive and that he needed oxygen treatment. He regained consciousness without epinep hrine ans was treated with oral diphenhydramine. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: In the allergy clinic he had a positive ice cube te st. He was counseled about cold induced urticaria a nd the risk of anaphylaxis. He was prescribed an Epinephrine autoi njector and underwent teaching of when and how to u se it.

Asghar. Pasha M.D. (Albany Medical College) Case Title: Early Use of Omalizumab in Idiopathic Anaphylaxis Summary and Lessons Learned: Our patient is a 49 year old woman with a past medi cal history of asthma who was referred for evaluati on of multiple anaphylactic episodes, of unknown etiology. She in itially described developing urticaria and angioede ma with no identifiable trigger, which responded to diphenhydr amine. In the year prior to evaluation her symptoms progressed, and she developed episodes of hypotension, syncope and respiratory distress, requiring multiple doses of s ubcutaneous epinephrine. Given the severity of her reactions, s he was started immediately on omalizumab, and had n o further reactions. Idiopathic anaphylaxis can lead to seve re, sometimes fatal reactions, and early recognitio n is imperative to treatment. We describe a case of severe recurrent i diopathic anaphylaxis that responded to omalizumab, and should be considered as initial therapy, especially in severe reactions or as a steroid sparing agent. Patient Presentation and Testing: We describe a 49 year old female, with mild persist ent asthma and no history of venom hypersensitivity , who presented for initial evaluation of recurrent anaphylaxis. H er family history was unremarkable with no reported angioedema or anaphylaxis. She described approximately 12 episode s over the past two years; initially she developed urticaria and angioedema which responded to diphenhydramine. In the year prior to our evaluation, her reactions bec ame more severe including one episode in which she developed laryngoedema and hypotension requiring intramuscul ar (I.M.) epinephrine. In her most recent episode she had a s yncopal event, was hypotensive, and had respiratory distress. She was evaluated and treated in an emergency room, req uiring 3 doses of I.M. epinephrine. A serum tryptas e was measured, and found to be elevated at 22.6 ug/L (no rmal 2.2-13.2 ug/L). At the time of our evaluation , patient was quite distressed and anxious. She reported that he r quality of life was negatively impacted by her fe ar of having another reaction. A thorough history didn't reveal any ide ntifiable triggers to her reactions, such as foods or medications. A baseline serum tryptase was obtained, and was found to be normal (3.7 ug/L). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The finding of elevated tryptase during an episode, with normalization during asymptomatic periods was highly suggestive of an anaphylactic episode. She was init ially antihistamines, incl uding cetirizine 10mg and ranitidine 150 mg both twice a day. Given the severity of her reactions we discussed the risks an d benefits of prednisone, a potential treatment option for idiopa thic anaphylaxis; however, she did not want to init iate therapy with prednisone due to long term side effects. Although , no randomized control trials have been done with omalizumab as treatment for idiopathic anaphylaxis, case reports have demonstrated resolution of symptoms in severe or refractory cases. Treatment with omalizumab was discussed wit h the patient, and she was initiated on monthly inj ections. She has had no further anaphylactic episodes, since startin g omalizumab eleven months ago. Furthermore, she h as noted significant improvement in her quality of life. Oma lizumab is usually reserved for refractory cases bu t our case report suggests that earlier initiation leads to rapid sym ptom resolution and quality of life. Furthermore, it can be used as a steroid sparing agent in those with risk factors.

Here we present a case of an all ergic reaction to coconut milk and subsequent anaphylactic reaction d uring the oral food challenge to fresh coconut but not sweetened coconut flakes. Physicians should be aware that tol erance of sweetened coconut flakes, a common ingred ient in desserts, does not imply global coconut tolerance. Patient Presentation and Testing: This is an 18-year-old woman with a history of mult iple tree nut allergies, asthma, and contact dermat itis who was believed to be coconut tolerant based on tolerance of sweetened coconut flakes but developed anaphylax is with coconut milk and fresh coconut. She presented for evaluation of an allergic reactio n (immediate onset oral pruritus and bronchospasm) to \"bubble tea\" which amongst other ingredients contained coconut m ilk. She was believed to be coconut tolerant based on her ability to eat sweetened coconut flakes. She does not have pollen allergies. Serum coconut specific IgE was 1. 14 KU/L. She underwent serial oral food challenges with fresh co conut meat, desiccated coconut, sweetened coconut f lakes. During the oral challenge to fresh coconut she deve loped mild oropharyngeal pruritus with 5 g of cocon ut. At a cumulative dose of 10g she developed abdominal disc omfort, nausea and bronchospasm with peak flow decr easing from 350 L/min pre-challenge to 250 L/min. Symptoms resolved with Epinephrine. Subsequently, a challenge was performed using sweet ened coconut flakes, which she tolerated without sy mptoms (cumulative dose 2 servings, 30g). Similar appearin g unsweetened desiccated coconut (pure desiccated c oconut) also caused symptoms upon challenge. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Here we report an IgE mediated anaphylaxis to fresh coconut but tolerance to sweetened coconut flakes. Sweetened coconut flakes contain desiccated coconut processed with sugar, propylene glycol and preservatives. An tigens responsible for anaphylaxis in this patient appear to be susceptible to processing. Given tolerance an d negative oral food challenge to sweetened coconut flakes, this patient was advised to continue to eat sweetened coconut f lakes but to avoid fresh and desiccated coconut with a prescript ion for an EpiPen.

Summary and Lessons Learned: Anaphylaxis as defined by the World Health Organiza tion is a severe life threatening generalized or sy stemic hypersensitivity reaction with sudden onset. The p revalence of anaphylaxis is best estimated at about 2%. Urticaria and angioedema are the most common presenting symptom b ut lack of cutaneous symptoms has been noted in a s eries of fatal reactions. The patient presented to our clinic for eye redn ess after getting hit with a soft ball to the face. He had no loss of consciousness, vomiting or changes in mental status . He denied changes in vision or eye pain initiall y. He was not given medications prior to arrival. His eye then became red with pain and photophobia. On presentation he was noted to have left eye conjunctivitis with a subconjunctival hemorrhage. His vital signs were stable. His neu rological exam was unremarkable as was the rest of the exam. He was ad ministered two tetracaine and two fluorescein eye d rops in order to examine for a corneal abrasion. No corneal abra sion was noted and discharge paperwork was being re viewed. Within fifteen minutes the child vomited twice and became pale. No noted headache, shortness of breat h, wheezing, oral swelling, or rash. His heart rate remained st able, but his blood pressure had decreased. He als o stated he felt anxious. The rest of his vital signs remained stab le. He was promptly administered epinephrine. His color returned, anxiousness resolved, and vital signs returned to n ormal within ten minutes. He was then given predni sone, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron. He was monitored after injection of epinephrine. No further compli cations were noted. He was discharged from our care. No further issues noted on follow up call the next day. His parents were told to avoid fluorescein and tetracaine eye drops for t he child. Our patient experienced anaphylaxis to either tet racaine or fluorescein eye drops under our care. A patient having anaphylaxis to fluorescein eye drops has been repor ted. Severe allergic reactions to local anesthetic s are also rare. Prompt recognition allowed for safe resolution of s ymptoms without further intervention. In any medic al setting, early diagnosis of anaphylaxis is critical. If there is concern for anaphylaxis, even if in doubt, it is ge nerally safe to administer a dose of epinephrine. Patient Presentation and Testing: This is a case report of a 10-year-old child seen f or an eye injury in the urgent care clinic to a uni versity-affiliated children's hospital. Presentation: The patient presented to our clinic for eye redness after getting hit with a soft ball to the face. He had no loss of consciousness, vomiting or changes in menta l status. He denied changes in vision or eye pain initially. He was not given medications prior to arrival. His eye th en became red with some irritation and photophobia. On presentation he was noted to have left eye conjunctivitis with a subconjunctival hemorrhage. His vital signs were stable. His neurological exam was unremarkable as was the rest of the exam. He was administered two tetracaine and two fluorescein eye drops in order to examine for a cor neal abrasion or foreign body in the eye given the photophobia and pain. This would have changed management of the pa tient. No corneal abrasion or foreign body was note d and discharge paperwork was being reviewed. Within fif teen minutes the child vomited twice and became pal e. He denied a headache or trouble breathing. On exam there was no shortness of breath, wheezing, oral swelling, o r rash. His heart rate remained stable at about 80 bpm, but his systo lic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 20 mm Hg on recheck. He also stated he felt anxious. The rest of his vi tal signs remained stable, including respiratory ra te,and oxygen saturation. He was moved to an observation room vi a bed, put on cardiopulmonary monitoring, and had a n IV placed. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: He was promptly administered epinephrine 0.3 mg int ramuscularly. Having suffered an acute head injury , an intracranial bleed was on the differential but was less likely at this time given the lack of neurolog ical findings such as a headache. Given the lack of cutaneous symptoms, ot her diagnosis were considered, but the risk of with holding epinephrine was greater than administering it while other diagnosis were entertained. In anaphylaxis earlier symptom presentation is thought to correlate with more seve re reactions. His color returned, anxiousness reso lved, and vital signs returned to normal within ten minutes. He wa s then given prednisone, diphenhydramine, and ondan setron. He was monitored after injection of epinephrine for a period of about 8 hours. No further complications were noted. He was discharged from our care. No further issues no ted on follow up call the next day. His parents we re told to avoid fluorescein and tetracaine eye drops for the child.Submission Medical Center Additional Authors: Golda Hudes, MD, PhD Montefiore Medical Center Case Title: Anaphylaxis to Soy Milk in a Patient Not Allergic t o Soy Summary and Lessons Learned: Introduction: Soy Allergies are typically found dur ing childhood and are often transient. Newly diagno sed cases of soy allergies in adulthood are rare and are occasionall y misdiagnosed. We present a case of anaphylaxis t o soy milk in a patient not allergic to soy. Methods: Case report Results: A 65 year-old female with a history of sea sonal allergic rhinitis developed generalized hives , severe itching, wheezing, dry cough and difficulty breathing severa l minutes after consuming her breakfast, which incl uded coffee, pancakes, chocolate pudding and soy milk. The anap hylactic reaction resulted in hospitalization, and she was referred for allergy evaluation. Our evaluation revealed po sitive skin testing to pollen, dust mite, roach, mo use, rat, peanut, and hazelnut but not to soy or wheat. Laboratory evalu ation found low allergen-specific Immunoglobulin E (ssIgE) to a number of food allergens such as peanut, sesame see d and hazelnut but not to soy, coffee or wheat. Ho wever, fresh food testing on the patient with Silk Vanilla soy m ilk was highly positive but was negative when perfo rmed on a non- allergic control subject. Fresh food testing on th e patient with boiled soybeans was negative. We pe rformed open oral challenges with both fresh soybeans and the soy mil k. She experienced no adverse events consuming the fresh soybeans however, within minutes after ingesting on e drop of the soy milk, she developed urticaria, sn eezing, itchy nose and oral pruritus. To further determine the respons ible allergen, the list of ingredients was review, which included: vitamins and minerals, sea salt, natural flavor, so ybean, vanilla extract and gellan gum. Since the p atient consumes soybeans and vanilla without any reaction we evalua ted her for gellan gum allergy: both fresh food tes ting and an open oral challenge with gellan gum were negative. The patient experienced a true anaphylaxis after ingest ing the soy milk documented with a subsequent open oral challenge bu t did not experience similar reactions to fresh soy beans or the other ingredients. The allergens responsible for h er reaction can possibly include the unknown flavor s or contamination of the soy milk during processing. Conclusion: Anaphylaxis to soy milk in some cases c an be attributed to hidden ingredients or methods o f processing packaged foods. Thorough allergy evaluation is nec essary in cases of anaphylaxis to processed foods i n order to determine the responsible allergen, avoid mislabeli ng an allergy and to provide proper clinical care. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 65 year-old female with a history of seasonal all ergic rhinitis developed generalized hives, severe itching, wheezing, dry cough and difficulty breathing several minutes after consuming her breakfast, which included coffe e, pancakes, chocolate pudding and soy milk. The anaphylactic r eaction resulted in hospitalization, and she was re ferred for allergy evaluation. Our evaluation revealed positive skin testing to pollen, dust mite, roach, mouse, rat, pe anut, and hazelnut but not to soy or wheat. Laboratory evaluation fou nd low allergen-specific Immunoglobulin E (ssIgE) t o a number of food allergens such as peanut, sesame seed and haze lnut but not to soy, coffee or wheat. However, fre sh food testing on the patient with Silk Vanilla soy milk was highl y positive but was negative when performed on a non -allergic control subject. Fresh food testing on the patient with bo iled soybeans was negative. We performed open oral challenges with both fresh soybeans and the soy milk. She experien ced no adverse events consuming the fresh soybeans however, within minutes after ingesting one drop of the soy milk, she developed urticaria, sneezing, itchy nose and oral pruritus. To further determine the responsible allergen, the list of ingredients was review, which included: vit amins and minerals, sea salt, natural flavor, soybean, vanilla extract and gellan gum. Since the patient consumes soybean s and vanilla without any reaction we evaluated her for gellan gu m allergy: both fresh food testing and an open oral challenge with gellan gum were negative. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient experienced a true anaphylaxis after in gesting the soy milk documented with a subsequent o pen oral challenge but did not experience similar reactions to fresh soybeans or the other ingredients. The al lergens responsible for her reaction can possibly include the unknown f lavors or contamination of the soy milk during proc essing. Submission Number: 264 Poster Number: 20 Keyword: Anaphylaxis Primary Author Name: Erin L. Reigh, MD, MS Primary Author Institution: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Case Title: Anaphylaxis due to Consumption of Dust Mite-Contami nated Beignet Mix Summary and Lessons Learned: A 29 year old female with a past medical history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, oral allergy syndrome, and prior aeroallergen immunotherapy presented to the allergy clinic after an episode of anaphylaxis. Immediately prior to th e reaction she had consumed prepackaged beignet mix as well as cof fee with chicory root, items she had brought home a fter a trip to New Orleans, LA. Due to her history of oral allergy syndrome, anaphylaxis to chicory was considered du e to its cross- reactivity with birch, but testing to birch pollen and the chicory coffee were negative. She had toler ated the individual components of the beignet mix such as wheat and mil k since the episode without a reaction, so a contam inant such as dust mite or cockroach was suspected. Skin testing was positive to the beignet mix and to dust mites. Microscopy was then performed and confirmed the presence of large quantities of dust mites in the prepackaged beignet mix. Her anaphylaxis was attributed to ingestion of dust mit es in contaminated, prepackaged baked goods. She wa s counseled to avoid prepackaged baking products and her case was reported to the FDA for a food safety investigation . It is important to consider contaminants in prepackaged foods as a cause of anaphylaxis in patients with a history of environmental allergies, particularly when the patient is tolerat ing the listed ingredients individually. Cases of f ood contamination should be reported to the FDA to protect other pati ents from similar reactions. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient was a 29 year old female with a past me dical history of mild persistent asthma, allergic r hinitis, oral allergy syndrome, and prior aeroallergen immunotherapy with incomplete resolution of symptoms who presented to the allergy clinic after an episode of anaphylaxis. The patient reported that she had recently traveled to New Orleans, LA, and brought home containers of coffee with chicory root and instant beignet mix, a type of pas try that contains wheat, barley, milk, and yeast. T wenty minutes after consuming these at home for the first time, she dev eloped nausea and vomiting, followed by wheezing, h ives, angioedema, and sore throat. She went to the emerge ncy room where she was treated for anaphylaxis succ essfully with epinephrine and diphenhydramine. At the time of the allergy evaluation, the patient reported that she had eaten wheat, milk, barley, ye ast, and coffee in other forms since the reaction without incident, bu t had avoided chicory, which was not a usual part o f her diet. Due to her history of oral allergy syndrome with cherries and apples, I was suspicious for a severe oral alle rgy syndrome reaction to chicory, which has reported cross-react ivity with birch pollen. I also considered that she could have been reacting to a contaminant in the mix, such as dust mite or cockroach allergen, rather than the mix its elf. Skin prick testing was performed to food cross-reactive pollen s, dust mites, cockroach, mouse, directly to the co ffee with chicory and directly to the beignet mix. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Despite having symptoms consistent with oral allerg y syndrome, the patient had negative birch skin tes ting, likely due to her prior history of allergy shots. She also had ne gative testing to the coffee with chicory, ruling t his out as the trigger. She had a large wheal and flare reaction to D. pter onyssinus and D. farinae, and was also positive to the beignet mix with a wheal and flare noted to be about half the s ize of the recorded dust mite reactions. The cockro ach and mouse tests were mildly positive but notably smaller than the wheal and flare triggered by the beignet mix. These results were felt to be consistent with an anaphylactic reaction to dust mite contamination in the beignet mix. I t hen examined the beignet mix under 10x light microscopy and found co pious evidence of dust mite contamination including live mites, dead mites in various stages of degradation, and fe cal matter (photos and video obtained). Due to the severity of the patient's reaction and t he risk such a contamination would pose to others w ith this allergy, her case was reported to the FDA with her permissio n and the boxed goods are currently under investiga tion. The patient was advised that this is rare but possible risk when consuming prepackaged products. Because i t is difficult to predict which of these products is contaminated, an d it has been reported in a wide range of baking mi xes, she was advised to avoid prepackaged baked goods and recomm ended to carry an epinephrine autoinjector. She has not had additional episodes since this incident.

Case Title: ATOPIC DERMATITIS WITH ANAPHYLAXIS CAUSED BY CORN Summary and Lessons Learned: Food allergies may trigger atopic dermatitis in 30% of cases, but this occurs infrequently for corn al lergies. The aim of this case report was to describe the cli nical and diagnostic features of a patient admitted to the outpatient clinic in Brazil with atopic dermatitis who develop ed anaphylaxis. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 2-year-old girl born in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil, w as referred to the allergy outpatient clinic for cu taneous xerosis and erythematous and pruriginous micropapules in the fl exural regions that began 1 year earlier. She had c oncurrent nasal itching and improvement of the atopic dermatitis. A skin-prick test performed for inhalant allergens w as positive for dust mites. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: She was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis and allerg ic Treatment with topical corticosteroids , antihistamines, and skin hydration resulted in a partial response a nd relapses with secondary infections. At 3 years o f age, she presented with anaphylaxis after inhaling steam from cooking corn but improved after appropriate treatment. Subs equently, it was discovered that her grandmother frequently fed her industrialized corn-based salted snacks. Exclusion of corn and its derivatives was recommended. Reevaluation 2 months later showed gradual. The patient is currently 10 y ears old and remains in complete remission of atopic dermatitis, presenting only symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Tre atment with nasal topical corticosteroids was reinstated and exc was continued. Conclusion: To manage atopic dermatitis, in additio n to the usual treatment, it would be ideal to iden tify and exclude the causal factor. This may change the history of t he disease and avoid serious clinical presentations such as anaphylaxis. Submission Number: 8 Poster Number: 22 Keyword: Asthma Primary Author Name: Thu Thu Aung, M.D Primary Author Institution: Tulane University Medical Center Additional Authors: Laurianne G. Wild, M.D Tulane University Medical Center Case Exercise-Induced bronchoconstriction Summary and Lessons Learned: Introduction: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is manifested by the acute onset of bronchoco nstriction during or shortly after exercise. The term is often confus ed with exercise-induced asthma, as poorly controll ed asthma can be triggered by exercise. The underlying mechanism of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is different f rom asthma in that air surface liquid osmolarity changes due to c old air and hyperventilation cause mediators to be released from the airway epithelial cells which subsequently act as t he primary stimulus for airway bronchoconstriction. Case: 33 year-old female Veteran presented with sho rtness of breath, chest tightness and cough trigger ed by cardiovascular exercise such as running, particular ly in the setting of physical training. Her spirome try showed normal airflow with moderate restriction and normal diffus ion capacity. ImmunoCap testing was positive for g rasses (Timothy, Johnson, Bermuda and Bahia). She was previously ins tructed to use Fluticasone/Salmeterol 500/50 1 puff twice daily and to use albuterol as needed. Since she had significa nt history of bronchoconstriction with exercise, sh e was recommended to warm up and use albuterol 15-20 minu tes before exercise. Since her spirometry was norma l, methacholine challenge test was performed. Her PD(2 0)MCH was >32 mg/ml which indicates normal airway r eactivity to methacholine. Exercise challenge testing was perfo rmed to assess for exercise-induced bronchoconstric tion. There was an 18% drop in FEV1 during the first five minutes o f the exercise challenge, ie, positive exercise cha llenge. Conclusion: EIB can occur in both presence or absen ce of asthma. It is more prevalent in athletes. Man agement includes short-acting beta-2 agonists and warming-up 15-30 m inutes before exercise. patients who are not re sponsive to SABA, long-acting beta agonists with inhaled cortic osteroids can be used for inflammation. Combination therapy that includes a LABA should not be used in normal or nea r-normal baseline lung function (ie, FEV1 >80% of p redicted value) because regular use of SABA and LABAs can cause tol erance, reduce bronchoprotection and bronchodilatio n. We recommended that our patient stop taking Fluticason e/Salmeterol and use SABA and warming-up techniques before exercise. A diagnosis of EIB should be confirmed by demonstration of airways obstruction and reversibi lity with standardized exercise challenge testing in associat ion with a history consistent with EIB. Self-report ed symptoms are not adequate and it could lead to underdiagnosis. Patient Presentation and Testing: At the time of initial encounter, patient presented with chief complaint of shortness of breath, tight ness of chest and cough which were triggered by cardiovascular exerci se such as running especially in physical training. She is a Veteran female who has to do physical training four to five times a week.Her history sounded like bronchoconst riction induced by exercise.She was using Fluticasone/Salmeterol 50 0/50 1 puff twice daily and albuterol puffs as need ed. Spirometry was performed to check her lung function which show ed normal airflow with moderate restriction and nor mal diffusion capacity. Methacholine challenge test was performed to exclude a diagnosis of asthma which indicates n ormal airway reactivity to methacholine. As the next step, exerc ise challenge testing was performed to assess for e xercise-induced bronchoconstriction. There was an 18% drop in FEV1 during the first five minutes of the exercise chall enge, ie, positive exercise challenge. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Exercised-induced bronchoconstriction was diagnosed and warming- up 15-30 minutes before exercise. For patients who are not responsive to SABA, long-acting beta agonis ts with inhaled corticosteroids can be used for inflammation. Howev er, regular use of SABA and LABA can cause toleranc e, reduce bronchoprotection and bronchodilation. LABA should not be used in normal or near-normal lung function. We recommended that our patient stop taking Fluticason e/Salmeterol and use short-acting beta-2 agonists a nd warming up 15-20minutes before exercise. A diagnosis of EIB sh ould be confirmed by demonstration of airways obstr uction and reversibility with standardized exercise challenge testing in association with a history consistent wi th EIB. Self-reported symptoms are not adequate and it could lead to unde rdiagnosis. Submission Number: 19 Poster Number: 23 Guidelines: Yes, I understand and agree to comply with the gui delines above.

Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized anti-IgE mono clonal antibody which blocks the binding of IgE to its high affinity receptors, know n to strongly suppress Th2-related inflammation. Om alizumab also significantly improves disease control, with a pron ounced reduction in the rate of asthma-related emer gency medical consultations, an important benefit for patients wi th moderate-to-severe uncontrolled allergic asthma. However, the potential side effects of this medication have not been well described to date. From March 2009\u2014when omalizumab was introduced in J apan\u2014to December 2016, a total of 241 patients with severe asthma have been treated with this medication in th e Allergy and Respiratory Department of Sagamihara National Hospital (Kanagawa, Japan). The median duration of the treatment was 13 months (interquartile range, 5 -37 months). During this period, we observed the development of a Th1-related disease, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) , in a patient with severe asthma. Asthma co-morbid PMR cases, which are characterized by a predominant Th1 immune response, are rare. Ou r case suggests the possibility that omalizumab might supp ress Th2-related immune response and promote Th1-re lated immune response. However, the development of the di sease after omalizumab administration might have al so been a temporal coincidence. Although omalizumab is an important medication in t he treatment of severe asthma, physicians should pa y attention to the development of Th1-related diseases in patients treated with this drug. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 51-year-old Japanese woman, with asthma onset whe n she was 4 years old, received fluticasone/formote rol, montelukast and theophylline with salbutamol, as ne eded. Her medical history included asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and appendicitis. Her mother and two siblings had a llergic rhinitis, but no family members had Th1-rel ated diseases. Although she was fully adherent to the treatment, h er symptoms remained uncontrolled. Omalizumab was i nitiated in February 2012 (IgE level of 92.2 IU/mL [normal rang e 0-173 IU/mL]). In March 2016, she described a mor ning stiffness in the shoulders, hip and neck girdle over a period of an hour. We suspected musculoskeletal diseases. Th e X-ray imaging was normal, 10,330/L (referen factor (8 IU/mL, reference range: 0-14) levels were within normal range. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: According to the classification criteria of the Eur opean League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/ American C ollege of Rheumatology (ACR), the woman was diagnosed with PM R. In May 2016, omalizumab was stopped because of potential drug-induced adverse effects, and symptom s were rapidly controlled after two days of treatme nt with prednisolone (15 mg/day). Twelve months later, as t he inflammatory symptoms improved, prednisolone was gradually tapered.

Included in this phe notype are patients with pansinusitis with recurren t nasal polyposis. Since it was first introduced in 1980 desensitizing with aspirin is an effective treatment for either nasal polyposis or asthma. Historically, these have been performed in intensive care units and/or outpatient clinics pen ding on an individual's risk. Here, we present a home desensit ization protocol on a patient who previously failed desensitization in a medical short-stay unit. Patient Presentation and Testing: 43 year old Nepalese man who was referred by his ot olaryngologist in 2014 for management of recurrent nasal polyposis and poorly controlled asthma. He had unde rgone functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in 2010, 2012 and 2014 for his nasal disease. He required frequent E R visits for his asthma. Reproducibly, aspirin led to severe rhinorrhea, congestion and shortness of breath. His maintenance treatment was intranasal fluticasone, inhaled budesonide/fortmoterol, and oral montelukast. He wa s scheduled for a 1-day aspirin desensitization pro tocol in a medical short stay setting. He developed congestio n, sneezing and a decrease in peak flow after consu ming 81mg and the desensitization was stopped. He returned 1 mont h later to complete a 2-day desensitization protoco l successfully. Subsequently, the patient did very well on Aspirin 325 mg twice daily for over 1.5 years. Unexpectedly , he was unable to refill his medications and did not take aspirin for 3 days, and subsequently developed significant upp er and lower respiratory symptoms which included congestion, rhi norrhea, cough and wheeze. At this point given his successful prior desensitization we recommended a home protocol, whi ch included: restarting all his maintenance medica tions and commencement of a 2-week course of prednisone 20mg; after 2 days of prednisone he was to start a 7-day aspirin desensitization protocol. On day 1: 40 mg, day 2: 8 1 mg, day 3: 162 mg, day 4: 243 mg, day 5: 325mg, d ay 6: 325mg, day 7: 325 mg twice daily. He successfully completed re introduction of aspirin and has remained symptom fr ee. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Here we present a case of a patient with classic AE RD with refractory nasal polyposis and poorly contr 7-day home aspirin desensitization prot ocol. This conservative approach may be considered for patients who have previously completed a monitored aspirin d esensitization protocol with more severe symptoms a nd need reintroduction of aspirin due to missed dosages.

The program is delivered in surrounding schools based on healthcare usage and socioeconomic need. For the s chool year 2015-16 HKE partnered with 14 schools in the St Louis Metropolitan area. Children are examined while at school without care givers present on the mobile he alth unit by a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner with expertise in asth ma management. The PNPs collaborated with Washingt on University Pulmonary/Allergy physicians to develop the program and meets regularly to evaluate outcomes. An IRB approved database is utilized to collect data for evaluation purposes. A wide range of children are cared for by HKEA. S ocial and economic barriers are not easily measured with current methods. A further review of data on a group of 2- 3 children randomly selected from each school was c ompleted. Charts were reviewed for 29 children with 140 visit s included 45% male, 97% Black, and with 86% Medica id, 10% private, and 3% other insurance. Ages ranged from 6 to 14 ye ars old with 17% Intermittent, 27% Mild Persistent, and 24% Severe Persistent. Based on recent history 34% were consi dered lower risk and 65% considered high risk. Obe sity was noted in 21% and allergies were reported in 46% of the child ren. The average number of visits in this group wa s 4.83 during the school year. This included visits on the van and ph one calls with care givers . 20% of the visits with HKEA children had active symptoms requiring albuterol and 6% requirin g oral steroids. Patient Presentation and Testing: School aged children with the diagnoses of asthma w ere enrolled in the Healthy Kids Express Asthma pro gram. Each child is seen without parents in order to decrease the barriers to the care givers. Spirometry is pre formed as able while on the mobile unit. Investigation into each child' s medication history is done with the state databas e or calls to pharmacies. Phone calls to the Primary Care Provide r is done to help coordinate the care. A treatment plan is developed by including the care givers input. This is done to increase the likelihood of adherence. Children ar e given extensive education as they are often responsible for their o wn care at home. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Socioeconomic disparities need to be considered whe n caring for school aged children with asthma. HKEA found at 43% of visits the children where adherent to the plan, partial adherence was noted in 50% and non-adherenc e noted in 39% of visits. Poor refill history was found in 44%, w hile 9% never picked up the prescribed medications. Interactions with the child while on the van without their care giver s gave a unique opportunity to assess the reasons b ehind this. Medicine confusion was apparent in 24% of the visit s and 24% had no medicine at home even after a visi t on the van. While 41% noted no barriers, 28% were noted to have none or poor parental supervision with taking thei r medicine correctly. Encouraging increased supervision by ca re givers could be beneficial with possible improve d asthma control.

Prior to this patient , we had another patient who had presented similarly but had differe nt objective findings. However, in both cases, the y had a suboptimal response to maximal inhaler therapy. Further truncated insp iratory and expiratory flow volume loop in one patient while in the other patient the flow volume loop was relativ ely preserved. Laryngoscopy and CT neck revealed a diagnosis of su bglottic stenosis in both cases. Both cases had sy mptom improvement after balloon dilation, and they were a ble to discontinue their inhaler therapies. We ret rospectively examined the flow volume loops over several years a nd found some subtle changes. In one case, the cla ssic pattern of marked truncation of the inspiratory and expiratory loops was noted, but not in the other. These case s not only highlight the relative differences in solely using the flow volume loop for diagnosis but also point o ut the heterogeneity seen even in the presence of having subglottic sten osis. The two cases emphasize the importance of being aware of asthma mimickers and of interpreting the flow volum e loops in context of therapy unresponsive asthma. In addition, the cases highlight some subtle changes in flow vol ume loops associated with subglottic stenosis that we do not routinely look for, which can be helpful in making this diagnosis. Patient Presentation and Testing: Our patient is a 64-year-old female with past medic al history significant for seasonal allergies, asth ma, and endometrial carcinoma status post total hysterectomy who presen ted for evaluation of non-productive cough with int ermittent associated wheezing and dyspnea. Cough had been pr esent for the past 9-10 years and occurred througho ut the day, though not at night. Steam relieved the cough; the patient could not identify any exacerbating factor s. She had previously been evaluated by pulmonology, cardiolog y, and gastroenterology. About two years ago, the pulmonologist diagnosed her with asthma, and she was prescribed a n ICS/LABA and a SABA inhaler. She did not feel th ese were very helpful so only used them a few times monthly. The patient had never smoked. She was living in a tr ailer with two dogs. Her physical exam was unremarkable. On ausc ultation, lungs were clear without wheezing . Her spirometry was normal without airflow obstruction. She brought wi th her a report from a CT chest performed the prior year that showed a stable benign appearing pulmonary nodule a nd stable bibasilar atelectasis. We first decided to reexamine her diagnosis of asthma, given that her symptoms did no t improve with inhalers and her spirometry was norm al. We had a suspicion for vocal cord dysfunction given that ste am was helpful in alleviating her symptoms. Thus, we ordered a methacholine challenge with laryngoscopy. She was unable to complete the methacholine challenge test due to wheezing and cough. On laryngoscopy, visualization of her vocal cords was suboptimal due to obscurati on from the epiglottis, though it was felt she had vocal cord d ysfunction. Additionally, she was noted to have po ssible subglottic stenosis with a narrow posterior pharynx seen below the vocal cords. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Based on the laryngoscopy findings, we ordered a CT neck to better evaluate possible subglottic stenos is. We also ordered lab work, including an autoimmune screen an d inflammatory markers, to assess for an underlying autoimmune disorder. The CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of s ubglottic stenosis; she had circumferential narrowi ng at the level of the inferior cricoid ring. Inflammatory markers, A NA, C-ANCA, P-ANCA, and anti-dsDNA were all within normal limits. Since we could not find any underlying etiology for the stenosis, we classified hers as idiopathic. S he was referred for bronchoscopy, during which balloon dilation was per formed. Steroids were injected locally during the bronchoscopy to reduce fibrosis. The patient reported her symptoms improved within a few days of the procedure. She continued to have some cough, though decreased, but no longer ha d associated shortness of breath. She reported ver y occasional wheeze. She discontinued her inhalers completely. Interestingly, although she technically had normal spirometry at her initial visit, there were some subtle changes seen in her spirometry after bronchoscopy with dilation. After dilation, her peak expiratory flow was increased, and the expirat ory flow loop was peaked, rather than rounded as it had been previously. This prompted us to compare a prior fl ow volume loops from two years before her initial v isit with us. The flow volume loops from two years prior also demonst rated an increased peak expiratory flow with a well -defined peak as opposed to a more rounded plateau, which she had demonstrated on spirometry at her first visit to o ur clinic.

However, the natural history of asthma in transgender patien ts has not been well documented. Despite legal and physical changes in transgender patients, medical issues including a ppropriate assessments may arise related to their b iological sex. The natural history of asthma in transgender patients m ay also be different from other male and female cis -gender patients due to a combination of factors including the use o f hormonal therapy. A male-to-female transgender pa tient presented to our clinic for assessment and management of asth ma. PFTs analyzed in context of male gender designa tion were found to better represent the patient's true pulmon ary function. As such, we concluded that it is prud ent to consider factors that may affect assessments such as PFT, to best classify asthma severity. A greater understan ding of the progression of asthma, best assessments, and effect s of hormonal therapy in transgender patients is de served and will ultimately improve asthma management in this popula tion. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 70-year-old male-to-female transgender patient re ceiving hormonal therapy since the 1990's presented to Allergy Clinic for evaluation of asthma. She is an ex-smoke r who also has a past medical history of allergic r hinitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her asthma was diagnosed 6 years prior based on symptoms of ch est-tightness, shortness of breath, and cough with exercise. Albut erol was utilized daily prior to exercise and there was no reported nocturnal awakening. She was using fluticasone prop ionate/salmeterol combined inhaler as a daily contr oller medication and daily loratidine for allergic rhinit is. Initial pulmonary function test (PFT) analyzed in the context of female gender designation revealed FEV1/FVC 71% and FEV1 2 .99L (114%). Upon confirmation of gender reassignme nt and estradiol hormone therapy, PFT was repeated and ana lyzed in the context of male gender designation. Th e FEV1/FVC was 67% and FEV1 2.90 L (98%), which better reflect ed the patient's true pulmonary function. Spirometr y also demonstrated increased curvilinearity of expiratory flow volume loop with evidence of moderate baselin e obstruction and no significant post-bronchodilator change. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Based on the findings from PFT and the patient's hi story, she was started on daily fluticasone propion ate nasal spray for allergic rhinitis in addition to pantoprazole for G ERD. Daily tiotropium bromide was also added as a c ontroller medication due to the patient's history of smoking and lack of response to bronchodilator therapy on s pirometry. At follow up visit in 3 months, she reported resolutio n of chronic post-nasal drip associated with allerg ic rhinitis as well as all reflux symptoms. She also noted major improveme nt in her asthma symptoms. PFTs were obtained and a nalyzed in the context of male gender designation. FEV1 and FE V1/FVC were stable compared to the previous visit b ut there was improvement of previously noted obstruction based o n the expiratory flow volume loop.

Fluticasone is primarily metabolized through CYP3 A4, can inactivate CYP3A5, and is not well metabolized via CYP3A5 or C YP3A7 unlike most other inhaled corticosteroids. Al though the incidence of adrenal suppression due to inhaled cor ticosteroids is very low, heritable traits in CYP3A enzymes can contribute significantly to clinical risk. Low-cost testing assessing for genetic variants associated with xenobiotic metabolism phenotypes is now widely commercially av ailable and may have clinical application in person alized selection of inhaled corticosteroid for best efficacy and lea st risk of metabolic interaction in isolation and w ith other medications. This single family case series reinforces recommend ations to assess growth velocity in all pediatric p atients taking even low to moderate dose inhaled corticosteroids. Patient Presentation and Testing: The academic allergy clinic had been longitudinally following a 5 year old female (patient A) with mil d-moderate persistent asthma and allergic rhinitis and her 8 y ear old sibling (patient B) with high risk moderate persistent asthma and non-allergic rhinitis. Both siblings were start ed on fluticasone MDI 110mcg 2 puffs twice daily fo r 3 years prior to events. Patient A presented with altered mental sta tus, and was admitted to PICU for vomiting with deh ydration, severe hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis ultimately dia gnosed as due to acute viral gastroenteritis. Follo wing a prodrome consistent with a URI, she was readmitted 9 months later with repetitive vomiting, diagnosed with meta bolic acidosis and ketotic hypoglycemia. She had negative screenin g testing for cyclical vomiting syndrome, maple syr up urine disease, celiac disease and Cornelia De Lange syndrome. Pati ent B developed a lobar pneumonia with an unexpecte dly protracted course. Mother noted her children did no t outgrow their clothing for the past 2 years, prom pting inspection of the growth curve which demonstrated marked growt h velocity reduction of both siblings. Both sibling s were ultimately diagnosed via ACTH stimulation tests to demonstrate adrenal insufficiency secondary to exog enous corticosteroid. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Treatment plans were co-developed with endocrinolog y consultants given medical indications to continue inhaled corticosteroids. Resumption of normal growth veloci ty, objective resolution of adrenal insufficiency, and stable asthma control were maintained for 4 years after initiatio n of equipotent doses of ciclesonide, inferring e is underway.

Keyword: Asthma Primary Author Name: Esozia Boletus Summary and Lessons Learned: Boletus edulis is an infrequent cause of occupation al respiratory allergy (OA). We present 3 food-proc essing factory workers who developed rhinitis and asthma symptoms preparing dried vegetable-based dishes. Patients we re male, aged between 36 and 50 years, and referred symptoms after B. edulis manipulation (sieving machine and \"cut in julienne\" vegetables mixers use). Protective measur es prior to diagnosis included jumpsuits and a full mask with 3M FFP, without filter. One patient had been previously dia gnosed of OA due to B. edulis and advised to use a full mask (3M 6800 model including a 6000-series 3M filter), but did n ot comply. Patient Presentation and Testing: Allergy work-up included skin prick tests (common i nhalants and foods, prick-prick with all the vegeta bles used (samples of 51 dehydrated vegetables, seeds, mushroom [bolet us, champignon]) and specific IgE determinations, i f available. Respiratory assessment, performed within work perio d, included rhinomanometry (all the patients), meth acoline tests (2 patients), NIOX, and forced spirometry determina tions. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: All patients had positive skin tests with dehydrate d B. edulis (mushroom and powder). Two tested posit ive to A. fumigatus and 1 to A. alternata and to champignon. Skin tests with the other vegetables were negative. Specific IgE to Alternaria was positive in a patient. Two patients had nose obstruction confirmed by rhin omanometry and a positive methacholine test. A pati ent had an obstructive pattern in the spirometry. After the diagnosis of occupational rhinitis and as thma due to B. edulis, patients were told to avoid its exposure, changing their position in the same workplace. As a n alternative, filter containing protective masks w ere recommended. First choice was a full mask 3M 6800 model includin g a 6000-series 3M filter. Despite clinical efficac y, patients did not use it continuously due to heat and communication i mpairment with the other co-workers. Further avoida nce included another mask (3M Versaflo TR-300MR with positive pr essure and full helmet). Besides, patients have bee n advised to continue treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. Patients who use the mask continuously and comply w ith inhaled treatment have been are asymptomatic, w ith normal lung function and reduced NIOX levels. However, the patient who used the mask and inhaled treatment ju st with the direct manipulation of Boletus has weekly symptoms and an impaired lung function. As relevant points, we present 3 workers affected b y an uncommon food allergen and the complexities of occupational allergy management. Recommendations should go beyon d avoidance since for many workers finding another different job may not be feasible. Submission Number: 51 Poster Number: 30 Keyword: Autoimmunity Primary Author Name: Shrestha Institution: Health System Additional Authors: Philip Wexler, MD Case Title: Swollen lips, gut and glands- Acquired angioedema s is a rare disorder (1 in 500, 000), which is clinically difficult to differentiate from heredita ry angioedema (HE). This differentiation is however critical as the former is commonly associated with underlying lymphoprolif erative disorders (malignancy of B-lymphocytes or p lasma cells). Case Description: 62-year-old male with recent history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis presented to the emerg ency department with recurrent periumbilical abdominal pain with lip swe lling, this being his third presentation in the pas t month. He reported having self-resolving abdominal pain along with ank le and feet swelling infrequently since the past 1 year. He denied any skin rash, pruritus, shortness of breath or choking sensation. He had no prior history of allergy to a ny food or medications and family history was unremarkable for similar symptoms. CT scan of abdomen showed worsen ing edema along bowel loops with moderately enlarged mesenter ic, pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes and edematous w alls of sigmoid colon and rectum compared to prior CT. This finding was thought to be related to colitis previ ously. Right inguinal lymph node biopsy was performed. He was di scharged on amoxicillin-clavulanate and oral vancom ycin for possible diverticulitis refractory diff coli tis. His biopsy revealed inhibitor, C4 and were low at 4, <3 an d <50 respectively. Patient was diagnosed with acquired a ngioedema and started on C1 esterase inhibitor ever y 3-4 days and icatibant for breakthrough anaphylaxis attacks. Bon e marrow biopsy was consistent with CLL. He has rec eived 5 cycles of R-CVP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) and is on Ibrutinib at present wit h no recurrence of symptoms. Discussion: AAE with C1-INH deficiency should be considered in patients with late onset of angioedema without urti caria in absence of family history of angioedema. A C1-INH deficienc y with a negative family history and low C1q is dia gnostic of this condition. All patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency should be evaluated for underlying B cel l lymphoproliferative disorder and perhaps evaluated annually if no disorder identified. Management incl udes therapies targeting bradykinin activity, such as C1 inhibitor concentrate, tranexamic acid, androgens and icatib ant. Treatment of underlying malignancy may result in complete resolu tion. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient was seen at Allergy clinic for a post hospi tal follow up (admission for swelling of lips with abdominal pain and recent diagnosis of CLL). Result of C1 esterase in hibitor, C4 and C1q levels sent during hospital sta y were all low suggestive of Hereditary vs. Acquired angioedema. P atient also had been started on R-CVP regimen for C LL. The result of the test was critical in his diagnosis since he did not have any significant family history of angioed ema, which did not correlate to the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema . Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: On my next follow up with the patient, it was 11 mo nths since he was started on C1 esterase inhibitor for acquired angioedema secondary to underlying Non Hodgkin lymp homa. Patient was doing very well with the treatmen t and did not have recurrence of swelling of lips and hands s ince being started on this therapy. He did report c old induced pruritus with angioedema in his last visit (2 months back) w hich resolved with warming up. He was being continu ed on chemotherapy for Lymphoma. He had been compliant on C1 esterase inhibitor 1000 units IV every monday and thursday, and was on Icatibant 30 mg/3 ml for treat ment for attack of angioedema. He was being conside red on discontinuing the treatment if cancer was to be in remission (after discussion with Hematology-oncolog y) as this diagnosis was secondary to his malignancy and would resolve with the resolution of cancer.

Case Title: Case of Schnitzler Syndrome That Responded to Tocil izumab Summary and Lessons Learned: Schnitzler syndrome is a rare, underdiagnosed, chro nic auto-inflammatory disease characterized by an u rticarial skin rash and monoclonal IgM component and at least two of the following signs: fever, joint or bone pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and elevated ac ute phase reactants. Twenty percent of patients dev elop lymphoproliferative disorders including Waldenstrom disease and lymphoma. IL-1 is usually elevated and anakinra (IL-1 antagonist) a successful treatment. Tocili zumab (an IL-6 antagonist) has been described as su ccessful therapy in 3 patients in Belgium who failed anakinra therapy. We present a patient with Schnitzler syndrome and isolated elevated IL-6 who responded to tocilizumab. Our case suggest s that tocilizumab may be efficacious therapy in pa tients with isolated elevated IL-6 in Schnitzler syndrome. Patient Presentation and Testing: We describe a 69 year old female who experienced mo nthly episodes of facial swelling and a non-pruriti c, erythematous rash, accompanied by high fever, nausea, headache a nd joint pain over 1 year. The predominantly right- sided facial swelling was sometimes accompanied by mild swelling of the upper airway, visualized on laryngoscopy. D uring episodes, the patient was found to have an elevated white cel l count, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and se dimentation rate that would resolve after episodes. The facial swell ing was initially attributed to facial cellulitis f or which she completed several courses of antibiotics and numerous sinus s urgeries without resolution of symptoms. Odontogeni c and neurologic causes of infection were also ruled out. A daily antihistamine did not alleviate symptoms. The patient noted some temporary improvement in symptoms with prednis one. Previous medical history was significant for b reast cancer and uterine cancer in remission and Hashimoto's thy roiditis. Rheumatoid factor was elevated C1-Q levels and tryptase leve ls were normal, arguing against mast cell activatio n syndrome or hereditary angioedema. Complement C2 (less than 1.3 mg/dL) and C4 (10mg/dL) levels were slightly low. The patient had normal immunoglobulin levels and normal IL-2 (l ess than 38 pg/ml), TNF- of 2 pg/ml, IL-1 of 3.9 pg/ml isolated elevated IL-6 of 30.08 pg/ml which remaine d elevated range: 0.31- 5 pg/ml). Considering eosinophilic causes, IL-5 level checked during an attack was found to be normal. T he patient also had a monoclonal IgM component. Sjogren-SSA and SSB , Smith, dsDNA, mitochondrial and actin antibodies were negative. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with Schnitzler syndrome, per Strasbourg diagnostic criteria. Isolated eleva ted IL-6 made tocilizumab an appropriate choice of therapy and re sulted in resolution of symptoms.

Walter MD PhD Case Title: Recurrent disseminated MAC in patient with antibodi es targeting interferon gamma (IFN-g) Summary and Lessons Learned: Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a disease that is caused by nontuberculous mycobacterial organism s such as M. avium and M. intracellulare and transmission is via inhalation and ingestion. Historically, it has bee n associated with immunocompromised individuals (i.e. CD4+ T cells <5 0) and presents as disseminated disease. Infections among immunocompetent patients with MAC is more localized such as pneumonia or lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is made by clinical and microbiologic criteria. Treatment usua lly consists of multi-agent antimicrobials tailored by susceptibility testing. The IL-12/23 and IFN-g axis activates T an d innate cells for clearance of mycobacteria. Mende lian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Diseases includes inherited immuno deficiencies that are linked to defects in this pat hway, however most of these patients present with mycobacterial d isease early in life. Late onset recurrent mycobact erial disease may indicate an acquired form of immunodeficiency, espe cially in a susceptible population of East Asian fe males. In our case, the patient developed neutralizing anti-IFN-g antib odies that impaired the IL-12/23 and IFN-g axis and clearance of mycobacterium. Elimination of B cell generating pat hogenic antibodies resulted in clearing the IL-12/2 3 and IFN-g pathway and resolution of severe mycobacterial infe ction. This may eventually alter a patient's treatm ent options to include anti-CD20 therapy such as Rituximab. Patient Presentation and Testing: We present a unique case of a patient who had recur rent disseminated MAC secondary to immune dysregula tion. Patient is 43-year-old Thai female with history of biopsy confirmed Kikuchi Fujimoto disease who initi ally presented with dyspnea. She was found to have a pericardial tampon ade and pulmonary right hilar mass. She underwent p ericardial window with fluid positive for MAC. Lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for bronchopneumonia also grew MAC. Patient was started on a multi-antimicrobial r egimen narrowed upon sensitivities and eventually d ischarged. Her clinical course was complicated by septic shock, fe ver, lymphadenopathy, worsening right hilar granulo ma and recurrent disseminated MAC few months after an asymptomatic s tage with negative cultures and completion of first course of therapy. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Given patient's Thai ethnicity and recurrence of di sseminated MAC against appropriate antibiotic regim en, a concern was raised for acquired immunodeficiency in the for m of anti-interferon-gamma (IFN-g) antibodies. Test ing of patient's serum revealed high titer anti-IFN-g antibodies (17 520 MFI to STAT1 phosphorylation in normal monocytes. the source of pathogenic anti-cytokine antibodies , patient received B cell depletion with anti-CD20 therapy wh ich greatly improved her symptoms and she has remai ned in remission for the past 8 months.

Very early onset IBD (VEOIBD), occurring before age 6, occurs in approxi mately 15% of pediatric IBD patients. While convent ional IBD is due to polygenic disorders, there are increasing report s showing monogenic diseases, such as primary immun odeficiencies (PID), to be causative of VEOIBD. These conditions can be difficult to identify and treat. Since IBD i s often the first clinical manifestation of the associated PID, prompt recogni tion is essential to initiate appropriate therapy. We illustrate this with a case of VEOIBD in a patient with LPS-respons ive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency. A 6 yo girl with nonallergic rhinitis, asthma and P ID due to LRBA deficiency diagnosed by genetic anal ysis and flow cytometry was admitted with abdominal pain, diarrhe a and hematochezia with 20 stools per day. She repo rted similar intermittent, self-resolving episodes for the past 2 years. EGD and colonoscopy histopathology was con sistent with severe colitis, and she was diagnosed with ulcerati ve colitis. Initial therapies including oral cortic osteroids, mesalamine and infliximab were ineffective. With collaboration from her immunologist, she transitioned to abatace pt and hydroxychloroquine and achieved improved clinical r esponse with decreased diarrhea and resolution of h ematochezia. LRBA deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by a CVID-like phenotype, immune dys regulation and autoimmunity such as IBD, endocrinopathi es CTLA4 results in decreased CTLA4 levels and dysregulated follicular helper T cell responses. With knowledge of this molecular cascade , CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) and chloroquine have emerged as effective treatments for the immune dysregulation associated with LRBA deficiency. Additionally, early HSCT in p atients with severe presentations of LRBA deficiency demonstrate s curative potential. Children with VEOIBD are at high risk for underlyin g PID. Recognition of predictors such as early-onse t disease, severe IBD, extra-intestinal complications, and parental c onsanguinity are important as these conditions have high morbidity and mortality and may not respond to traditional im munosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Time ly diagnosis of these monogenic diseases can identify unconventi onal biological treatment options to target specifi c pathogenic pathways and potentially offer cure through HSCT. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 6 yo girl with nonallergic rhinitis, asthma and P ID due to LRBA deficiency diagnosed by genetic anal ysis and flow cytometry was admitted with abdominal pain, diarrhe a and hematochezia with 20 stools per day. She repo rted similar intermittent, self-resolving episodes for the past 2 years. Being aware that LRBA deficiency is charac terized by a CVID- like phenotype with immune IBD. EGD and colono scopy histopathology was consistent with severe colitis, and she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with VEOIBD, specifically ulcerative colitis, based on EGD and colonoscopy h istopathology consistent with severe colitis. Initial therapies f rom her gastroenterologist including oral corticost eroids, mesalamine and infliximab were ineffective. Children with VEOI BD may not respond to traditional immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. With collaboration from her immunologist, she transitioned to abatacept an d hydroxychloroquine based on knowledge of LRBA olecular regulates responses. CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) and chloroquine have emerged a s effective treatments for the immune dysregulation associated with LRBA deficiency.

In a significant number of cases, autoimmu nity has been associated with the development of urticaria and an gioedema. In our case, autoimmune thyroid disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, appears to have played a major role in this patient's disease, given resolution of hives associated with improvement in serology following thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient, a 32-year-old woman with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis on replacement therapy pres ented to our clinic with recurrent urticaria for the past severa l months. Her symptoms started five days after star ting antibiotics for an episode of colitis. Initially considered a drug allergy, she was treated with diphenhydramine with improvement in her symptoms. A few days later, she developed angioedem a of her lips and was given prednisone and diphenhy dramine with improvement. She then again developed lip angi oedema and diffuse urticaria after stopping the pre dnisone. Her urticaria would wax and wane over 24 hours. She sa w an outside Allergist and was started on fexofenad ine 180 mg three times daily, ranitidine 150 mg three times da ily, loratadine 10 mg twice a day and hydroxyzine 5 0 mg at night. Despite this aggressive antihistamine regimen, her urticaria recurred, and she was initiated on daily prednisone at high doses. At doses below 15 mg of prednisone, however, she experienced recurrence of urticaria. She was t ried on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice day with no improve ment. She developed significant and intolerable sid e effects of prednisone with a 20-pound weight gain and severe m ood swings, despite incomplete control of her urtic aria. She was then referred to the University of Colorado Allergy /Immunology clinic for further management. The patient's initial laboratory data showed normal blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Her thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.77 mIU/L), and thyroglobulin antibodies 3 IU/mL (normal <4 IU/mL) on her daily maintenance levothyroxine of 175 mcg. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: To control her chronic urticaria, she was started o n cyclosporine 150 mg twice day. Her urticaria impr oved, but she experienced intolerable side effects of peripheral neuropathy and hair loss and, in addition, a few mo nths into her course, her hives recurred. Given her history of Ha shimoto's thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, we increa sed her levothyroxine to a suppressive dose of up to 300 mc g. Her TSH dropped to 0.02 mIU/L (0.34-5.60 mIU/L). She experienced some mild tremors but otherwise tolerat ed the increased dose well, with remission of her u rticaria. Omalizumab 300 mg every 28 days was added in an att empt to lower the levothyroxine dose and hives were well controlled on the combination of omalizumab and sup pressive levothyroxine for about two years Her goit er gradually enlarged, and her thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobu lin antibodies reached a peak of 4690 U/mL and 6 IU /mL, respectively. She developed a flare of her hives al ong with complaints of thyroid enlargement and tend erness. She was found to have a multinodular thyroid gland on ultra sound and underwent total thyroidectomy. Since her thyroidectomy, her TSH is 0.43 mIU/L and thyroid peroxidase antibo dy level has dropped precipitously to 300 U/mL alon g with resolution of her hives. Omalizumab has been stoppe d and she is now on only replacement doses of levot hyroxine with no recurrence of her urticaria or angioedema 9 mont hs post thyroidectomy. The course of this patient s trongly suggests that Hashimoto's thyroiditis was a significant caus al factor of her chronic urticaria and angioedema.

Department of Oral Path ology, School of Dentistry, Dental Science Research Institute, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of K is a chronic immune-mediated ora l mucosal disease frequently involving buccal mucos a, tongue, and gingiva. The etiology is not fully understood, but the mechanism is believed that inflammatory cytokin es of keratinocytes play a major role in T lymphocyte-associated immune responses. Oral candidiasis is the most common opp ortunistic fungal infection in the oral cavity, mainly caused by Candida albicans. Candida albicans is present in around half of the population as one of the normal oral microbiota. Ho wever, it often causes opportunistic infections in the oral and pharyngeal areas and even systemically in immunocom promised patients. We report an unusual case of the patient with both oral lichen planus and acute oropharyngeal can didal infection, which may be challenging for clini cians to diagnose and treat. Although the clinical features were comp lex at the initial visit, the diagnosis of oral lic hen planus, one of immune-mediated mucosal diseases, could be predicte d based on the histopathologic exam using IHC stain ing and it was further supported by the treatment results to t he corticosteroid therapy. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 66-year-old woman visited our clinic complaining of thrush and pain in the whole mouth and throat wh ich had begun 1-2 weeks ago. She had hypertension that had been m anaged from a private hospital with medication for 10 years. Chronic gastritis was diagnosed one month ago and h ad been treated with medication thereafter. Clinica l examination revealed many shallow ulcers in various sizes and i rregular forms with sloughing whitish pseudomembran e in their boundaries on the lower lip, buccal mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue, soft palate and uvula. Fung al infection of oral and throat mucosa or an immune-mediated mucosal dis ease such as pemphigus was suspected, therefore, fu ngal culture specifically for candidal on complements and immunoglobulins w ere used for differential diagnosis. Fungus was not detected in cytopathology, however, fungal organisms were ident ified in histopathologic exam with Hematoxylin and Eosin staining and they were confirmed with both and methenamine silver fungal culture tes t. Besides, IHC staining demonstrated deposits of I gG, IgA, C3, C1q and fibrinogen in oral epithelium of the specimen. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Diagnosis was acute oral candidiasis and a comorbid immune-mediated mucosal disease such as vulgaris. Antifungal therapy nystatin initially and systemic fluconazole subse quently was very effective in healing multiple oral ulcerous lesions . Interestingly, three weeks after the initiation o f the antifungal therapy, whitish patterns suggesting oral lichen pl anus were noted on the sites where ulcerous lesions had been present and healing. The newly found lesions were managed w ith topical and systemic corticosteroids with great improvement in signs and symptoms. Submission Number: 200 Poster Number: 36 Keyword: Autoimmunity Primary Author Name: Jennifer Simonaire, DO Primary Author Institution: Virginia Commonwealth University Additional Authors: Nicholas Klaiber, MD Lawrence Schwartz, MD, PhD Case Title: Periodic inflammation without fever associated with pathogenic familial NLRP3 variant R262W Summary and Lessons Learned: The protein NLRP3 plays a key role in regulation of the inflammatory process. Gain of function mutati ons of NLRP3 lead to cryoporin-associated periodic fever syndromes (C APS), including Muckle-Wells Syndrome, Familial Col d Autoinflammatory Syndrome and Neonatal Onset Multis ystem Inflammatory Disease. The patient described in this case exhibited painful neutrophilic dermatosis that occu rred with regular chronicity and progressive cornea l dystrophy without loss of visual acuity. Whole exome sequenc ing revealed a pathogenic mutation in the NLRP3 gen e. Two of the patient's three children exhibited a similar rash s tarting at two years of age. Whole exome sequencin g of family members revealed the NLRP3 variant in all affected but no unaffected family members. This case highli ghts the need to consider inflammasome mutations in cases of periodi c inflammation without fever leading to the selecti on of appropriate therapeutic interventions. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 26 year-old Caucasian female presented with the c hief complaint of a periodic, urticarial rash. She reported that the rash began when she was 15 years old and started oc curring almost every day. It was not pruritic but instead very painful, rated at 6 out of 10 in intensity. The pa tient stated that the rash was raised, or flat, sli ghtly red in appearance with irregular borders. It would almost always app ear in the afternoon, first on her legs then progre ssively spreading in an ascending fashion to involve her abdomen and upp er extremities by the time she went to bed, but typ ically sparing her face and lasting less than twelve hours. The ra sh was not triggered by cold. A punch biopsy from t he rash that had been collected several years prior to her presentat ion showed neutrophilic infiltration of the dermis. Her CRP values had been mildly elevated on previous occasions. Th e frequency of her rash had decreased slightly sinc e starting on montelukast several months before presentation. Ot her than the dermatosis, her medical history was si gnificant only for corneal dystrophy diagnosed several years after the onset of her rash. She reported that her sons aged two and five also had started to exhibit a similar periodic rash . The rest of her immediate family members: father , mother, daughter and husband did not have any similar symptoms. Phy sical exam was significant for corneal surface irre gularity. The patient had no skin lesions during her initial visi t but a photo of her rash portrayed a mildly erythe matous, macular rash on her abdomen. Labs were notable for a CRP of 1.2 (NL <0.3) and ESR of 23 (NL<20), as well as a norm al CBC with differential, CMP and AH50. She had previously tes ted negative for HAV, HBV, HCV, SS-A Ab, SS-B Ab, a nd Anti-FcER rase Patient Outcomes: The patient's symptoms failed to respond to high do se antihistamines, glucocorticoids, or colchicine. Monteleukast reduced the frequency but not the severity of her r ash to three to four times per week from daily. Zile uton did not further reduce either the frequency or severity of the dermatosis. Examination of one of the patient's affected sons demonstrated a similar blanching, erythematous, mac ular rash on bilateral upper and lower extremities. Due to high suspicion for an inflammasome perturbation rooted i n an autosomal dominant mutation, whole exome seque ncing of the patient, one of her affected sons and her husba nd was obtained. This revealed the presence of a N LRP3 R262W mutation in the patient and her affected son, which has previously been linked to cases of Mukle-Wells Syndrome. An ophthalmology exam performed on the patient's affec ted children revealed mild corneal dystrophy. With this diagnosis, the patient and her two sons are now seeking treatm ent with an IL-1 neutralizing therapy which we expe ct to greatly improve the patient's and her sons' cutaneous and c orneal symptoms.

Autoimmune, infectious, and malignancy evaluations were undiagn ostic. Lymph node pathology showed Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), a clonal expansion of Langerhans cells. LCH cells are immunophenotypically and genetically simi lar to myeloid dendritic cells and distinct from epidermal Langerh ans cells. It remains controversial whether LCH dev elops from malignant transformation or an inflammatory reactio n. There is an association between viral illnesses and LCH; we wonder whether recent Coxsackie virus infection con tributed. LCH occurs more frequently in patients yo unger than 10 years old. Adults often present with pulmonary lesi ons. This patient had multi-organ involvement and s ignificant inflammatory component; LCH should be considered in addition to autoinflammatory syndromes and HLH des pite its rarity. Patient Presentation and Testing: A previously healthy 21-year-old man presented with 2 weeks of daily fevers responsive to antipyretics , lymphadenopathy, rash, and anterior uveitis. His fe vers typically returned 4-6 hours after antipyretic administration without periodicity. He had no infectious exposures , travel abroad, tick bites, or contributory family history. Initial labs showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and eosinophilia, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodul es. Infectious evaluation revealed only low-titer C oxsackie virus antibodies to serotypes B2-6 suggesting recent infe ction. Rheumatologic evaluation was non-specific, t he exceptions being elevated CRP and positive ANA. Peripheral blo od flow cytometry showed no aberrant lymphocyte immunophenotype; IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were norm al. Imaging did not reveal additional lesions. Diff erential diagnosis included autoinflammatory condition, HLH, lymphoproliferative disorder, and malignancy. Per Eurofever Classification Criteria, he warranted testing for T RAPS although we had low suspicion for this; TNFRSF 1A analysis revealed no mutation. Normal ferritin and the absen ce of peripheral blood cytopenias and splenomegaly made HLH less likely. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Lymph node tissue showed proliferation of mononucle ar cells consistent with Langerhans cells. This wit h his clinical history was consistent with Langerhans cell histioc ytosis. PET CT and prednisolone induction therapy due to multi -organ involvement and is currently doing well. Next, he w ill undergo reassessment of his disease to determin e whether further or alternative treatment is necessary.

Bacharier, M.D., FAAAAI, Maleewan Kitcha roensakkul, M.D. Division of Allergy, Immunology and Pulmonary Medic ine, Department of Pediatrics, Washington Universit y in St Louis School of Medicine Case Title: Clinical Course and Treatment of Angioedema in Syst emic Lupus Erythematous Patients, A Case Series Summary and Lessons Learned: Brief summary of cases and outcome: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the development of autoantibodies to self-antigens. Acquired angioedema secondary to autoantibodies against C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is a known c omplication of SLE. However, the causes of angioede ma in SLE are multifactorial, including concomitant complement de ficiency and/or medication exposure. The clinical c ourse and treatment of angioedema in SLE has rarely been repo rted, particularly in children. Here we describe th e clinical presentation, laboratory studies and treatment of a ngioedema in 3 pediatric and 1 adult SLE patients. Of these four patients, three were female and all w ere Caucasian. One patient was diagnosed with hered itary angioedema (HAE) type I at 4 years of age; she late r developed other systemic manifestations including urticaria and was diagnosed with SLE at 9 years of age. One patient d eveloped angioedema at the time of SLE diagnosis at 17 years of age. The other two patients had their first episode of a ngioedema during SLE flares at 13 and 18 years of a ge. They were also exposed to medications that could potentially trigg er angioedema. All patients had elevated autoantibo dies to C1-INH and/or C1q during their angioedema episodes. Two pa tients had life-threatening airway edema requiring emergent intubation. In two of three patients with isolated acquired angioedema, given their clinical deteriora tion while receiving intravenous steroids, ecallantide was administered with symptomatic improvement. Lessons learned and its relevance: Angioedema in SL E can occur either at diagnosis or during the disea se course. In addition to acquired angioedema from autoantibodies to C1-INH, other etiologies of angioedema should b e considered. Ecallantide is a potential treatment option of acut e angioedema in steroid-refractory patients. To our knowledge, there is limited literature regarding the use of ecallant ide in acquired angioedema and no prior case report s in the pediatric population. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient 1: A 13-year-old Caucasian female with SLE and Graves' disease who was recently restarted on p rednisone 20 mg/day and azathioprine for SLE flares presented wi th a periorbital/malar rash and eyelid, lip, and to ngue swelling shortly after receiving intravenous acyclovir for p complement C3 and C4 positive anti-dsDNA antibody, and normal C1q with negative anti-C1q antibody. She had a normal serum C1-INH antigen and activity level with an elevated anti-C1INH antibody 43.7% (reference range 0.89-36.1%). Patient 2: A 18-year-old Caucasian female who was a dmitted for a SLE flare, central line infection, an d septic shock. After resolution of the infection, she was treated with p ulse intravenous methylprednisolone and rituximab. One week later, she developed acute facial, tongue, neck, and throa t swelling requiring emergent intubation. She had n o rashes. She had been on chronic treatment with lisinopril and recei ved gadolinium the day prior to the onset of sympto ms. Laboratory evaluation included serum tryptase 13.8 ng/ml (refe rence range < 11.5), and C4 levels, positive anti-dsDNA antibody, low C1q with negative anti-C1q antibody. She had an elevated serum C1-INH antigen with a nor mal activity level and positive anti-C1INH antibody 190.6%. Patient 3: A 18-year-old Caucasian male with newly- diagnosed SLE and lupus nephritis who developed lip , tongue, and throat swelling requiring intubation one day after admission. His only medication prior to the onset w as prednisone 1 mg/kg/day. Laboratory evaluation included normal se rum tryptase, low C3 and C4 levels, positive anti-d sDNA positive anti-C1q antibody 8.1% ference range 0.0-7.0%). He had a normal serum C1-I NH antigen and activity level with an elevated and anti-C1INH anti body 84.2%. Patient 4: A 13-year-old Caucasian female diagnosed with hereditary angioedema (HAE) type I at 4 years of age, developed photosensitivity, arthritis, leukopenia w ith positive anti-nuclear antibody and anti-Smith a ntibody at 9 years of age. She was treated with C1-INH or ecallantide as needed for angioedema and hydroxychloroquine for SLE. Since September 2016, she had increased episodes of angio edema occurring every 1-3 months despite receiving prophylactic C1-INH. In November 2016, she developed chronic urt icaria with no evidence of vasculitis on biopsy. Fu rther workup demonstrated a negative chronic urticaria index and anti-IgE receptor antibodies. In February 2017, sh e was started on azathioprine for serositis and elevated inflammator y markers. Her C4 and C1q levels were persistently low and she had an elevated anti-C1q antibody 26.2%. Anti-C1INH res ults are pending. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient 1: Her symptoms and laboratory studies supp orted evidence of a SLE flare with hypocomplementem ia and positive autoantibodies including anti-C1INH antibo dy. However, her history of immediate swelling foll owing intravenous acyclovir administration raised concern for a drug-induced reaction. Acyclovir was discont inued and a desensitization procedure was recommended if acyclo vir was required. Due to progressive airway swellin g despite 2 doses of 0.3 mg intramuscular epinephrine and 40 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone, one dose of eca llantide 30 mg was given subcutaneously with resolution of swellin g in 24 hours. Her steroid dose was increased and s he was given one dose of rituximab for treatment of her SLE. She con tinued to follow with outside rheumatologists. Patient 2: The etiology is likely multifactorial in this patient, as she had a SLE flare with positive anti-C1INH antibody and history of ACEI and gadolinium exposure. Lisinopril was immediately discontinued. Her SLE was aggressi vely treated with high dose steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and intr avenous immunoglobulin. She received gadolinium aga in 2 weeks later for brain imaging with no recurrence of the s welling. She was extubated after 3 days and dischar ged home on prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and mycophenolate m ofetil. She had no recurrence of angioedema at her 6-month followup. Patient 3: He most likely had an isolated acquired angioedema episode from anti-C1INH antibodies. He h ad no history of exposure to common culprit drugs, infection, and a negative HAE workup. Given his low C4 level, he was treated with one dose of C1INH while awaiting C1INH activity lev el results with no response. Due to persistent swel ling while receiving intravenous methylprednisolone, he was gi ven 30 mg SC ecallantide 2 doses with improvement a nd he was extubated 2 days later. He continues on prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and monthly intravenous cyclop hosphamide for treatment of with nephritis. He no recu rrence of angioedema at his 4-month followup. Patient 4: There are reports of autoimmunity in pat ients with HAE. However, this patient may also have C1q deficiency that increased her risk for developing SLE given he r persistently low C1q despite normal C3 level. For SLE management, she continues on azathioprine 200 mg once daily and hydroxychloroquine. If she continues to have frequ ent episodes of angioedema and has an elevated anti-C1INH antibody (results pending), rituximab may be considered as a n option in her treatment. Submission Number: 272 Poster Number: 39 Keyword: Autoimmunity Primary Author Name: Connie Lin Primary Author Institution: UCLA Additional Authors: Maria Garcia-Lloret, MD, UCLA Case Title: Long-term Anakinra Therapy in a Schnitzler Syndrome Patient Summary and Lessons Learned: Background: Schnitzler syndrome is a rare disorder characterize d by hallmark features of urticaria, IgM or IgG mon oclonal gammopathy, bone pain, and fevers. It is a late-ons et acquired autoinflammatory syndrome seen in adult s only, with about 300 cases reported worldwide. The successful use of anakinra for refractory symptoms was first d escribed in 2005. We describe the clinical course of a Schnitzl er syndrome patient on high-dose anakinra for 11 ye ars. Case Presentation: In 2002, a 50-year-old man presented with an eight- year history of severe urticaria and lymphadenopath y. Extensive prior evaluation revealed an IgM monoclonal gammopa thy of unknown significance. Previous workup also i ncluded numerous bone marrow and lymph node biopsies, lymph node resections, and PET scans without evidence of lymphoma. The patient saw multiple allergists with complaints of daily diffuse, pruritic, face-sparing urticaria with each lesion lasting 12-16 hours. He also had chronic bon e pain, lymphadenopathy, and intermittent fevers. M ultiple anti- histamines, aspirin, and failed to and only prednisone 30mg daily was effe ctive. Labs were significant for IgM of 783 mg/dL and anemia of 7-8 g/dL. The patient was diagnosed with Schnitzler Syndrome based on his constellation of symptoms. He was trie d on etanercept, cyclosporine, rituximab, thalidomide, a lpha-interferon, and hydroxychloroquine without suc cess. In 2006, he was started on anakinra with dramatic improvement i n his urticaria and bone pain. Currently, the patie nt's symptoms have remained in remission for 11 years with high-d ose anakinra. However, symptoms recur if medication is stopped for 48 hours. Anemia has improved to 12-13 g/dL in the intervening years. During his initial 6 years of an akinra therapy, his IgM level plateaued; however, since then it has ste adily increased to mg/dL. IgG has slowly downt remarkable long-term effectiveness of anakinra in Schnitzler Syndrome indicates that IL-1 plays an important role in this autoinflammatory disease. However, our patient 's rising IgM points toward a progressing lymphopro liferative disorder. In 2015, somatic mosaicism of NLRP3 mutat ion was noted in the lineage of two IgG var iant Schnitzler syndrome patients; however a germline NLRP3 mutatio n has not been found in Schnitzler syndrome, and th e two cases were considered variants of cryopyrin-associated pe riodic syndrome (CAPS). Despite a well-described ph enotype, a unifying genetic cause and pathogenesis linking the monoclonal gammopathy with the autoinflammatory co mponent has yet to be described. Perhaps with better unders tanding of the underlying mechanism, a curative the rapy can be identified that addresses all aspects of Schnitzler 's syndrome. Patient Presentation and Testing: No lab tests were necessary for diagnosis at time o f initial presentation, as the patient's history wa s classic for Schnitzler syndrome. However we followed the trend of his anem ia, IgM, and IgG during long-term therapy with anak inra. CBC with differential and complete chemistry panel were also followed, which did not show negative effects on long-term anakinra. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient presented with severe urticaria refract ory to anti-histamines, along with a history of IgM monoclonal gammopathy, bone pain, and intermittent fevers. The se symptoms are hallmark features of Schnitzler syn drome; thus, he was diagnosed based on clinical history. Anakinr a was selected as he had failed a number of anti-hi stamines and immunosuppressants, and one case report in 2005 det ailed a Schnitzler syndrome patient successfully tr eated with anakinra. His long-term response to anakinra confir ms the diagnosis. Submission Number: 284 Keyword: Autoimmunity Primary Author Name: Thota University Additional Authors: Jennifer Monroy MD,Washington University of St.Loui s Case Title: Elevated IgE as a manifestation of underlying Lymph oma Summary and Lessons Learned: Elevated Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are commonly associated with atopic conditions (eczema, asthma) , parasitic infections, immunodeficiency disorders (Hyper IgE s yndrome, Omenn's syndrome), HIV infection and T cel l lymphoma. Patients with elevated IgE levels are often referre d to Allergy and Immunology clinic for evaluation o f either underlying allergy or immunodeficiency. Significant IgE elevat ions are reported to be rarely associated with Hodg kin's lymphoma. But there have been no reported associations with n on-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). We present to you a pa tient who had skin rash and elevated IgE levels eventually di agnosed with mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymp homa is an aggressive form of NHL. These patients often requir e hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and maint enance chemotherapy to improve the chances of remission. H ence earlier diagnosis is crucial in evaluating suc h patients. Patient initially presented to our clinic with pers istent pruritic rash. He had no history of atopic d ermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, recurrent infections or periodon tal disease. There was no history of foreign travel or symptoms suggestive of parasitic infections. Skin prick test to environmental allergies was negative. His IgE l evels were markedly elevated.HIV testing and immunodeficiency workup wa s negative. He failed to respond to steroid therapy for rash. Punch biopsy of the rash was consistent with non-Ho dgkin's lymphoma (mantle cell lymphoma) which was a gain confirmed by lymph node biopsy. He had two cycles o f chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell tra nsplantation. His IgE levels normalized post treatment. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient is a 49 year old Caucasian male presented t o the Allergy clinic for evaluation of Chronic Urti caria, which initially started about a year ago. It was a pruritic rash in volving arms, legs and back. He was evaluated by an allergist at that time and found to have negative skin prick testing to environmental allergens. He was prescribed oral antihistamines and topical steroids which helped initially but rec urred few months later, with much worse symptoms. H e did not have adequate response to oral or topical steroids and a ntihistamines. His primary care doctor noted elevat ed IgE levels and referred to our clinic for further management. His past medical history was significant for thyroid ca ncer with subsequent thyroidectomy and radioactive ablation, 20 years prior. Family history was significant for ovarian cancer in sister, colon cancer in mother and brain tumor in m aternal aunt. At the time of presentation he also had a voilaceou s rash on hip which was present for 2 months along with pink raised blanchable rash on back, and numerous flesh papules on torso and extremities. Rest of his physical exa mination was normal. Skin prick test to environmental aeroallerg ens was negative. CBC and comprehensive metabolic p anel were within normal limits. IgE level was more than 50,00 0IU (Reference range 0-250 IU). Rests of Immunoglob ulins (IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE) were within normal limits. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Due to atypical presentation of rash and non-respon siveness to steroids we referred the patient to a D ermatologist for skin biopsy. Punch biopsy revealed over expression of cyclin D1 diagnostic of mantle cell lymphoma. CT chest and abdomen revealed generalized lymphadenopathy. Lymph node and bone marrow biopsy were again consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. He was evaluated by an oncolo gist and underwent 2 cycles of chemotherapy with R- CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrist ine and prednisone) followed by autologous stem cel l transplantation which is the standard therapy for m antle cell lymphoma. Patient is currently on Rituxi mab maintenance therapy to improve the remission rates. Repeat IgE levels one year after the treatment were 250IU/L (R eference range 0-250 IU). Underlying malignancy should be considered in patie nts with otherwise unexplained marked elevations of Immunoglobulin E.

This auto-inflammatory disea se is a de-novo mutation of IKBKG IK the NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO) is a master regulatory protein of NF-kB (nucle ar factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells). NF-kB is a protein complex that has been long consi dered a pro- inflammatory signaling pathway, larger based on the activation of NF-kB by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alph a (TNF-alpha). He is one of only 3 people in the w orld thought to have this specific gene mutation. Clinically he present ed with recurrent, granulomatous panniculitis, peri odic fevers, joint swelling, and uveitis. This case is relevant to th e practice of allergy/immunology as it sheds light on a new, more rare genetic mutation that may cause pro-inflammatory di sease. The case's relation to NF-kB signaling and its associated cytokines may be useful in therapeutic application, especially as his symptoms have been well-controll ed now on an anti-TNF-alpha biologic agent. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient initially presented to an outside insti tution with recurrent, granulomatous panniculitis s tarting around one month of age. Since then, he has developed other s ymptoms such as periodic fevers, rashes, joint swel ling and uveitis. Of note, a brain MRI was obtained due to large head circumference which showed some cortical atrophy. Subsequent MRIs have been stable. His initial workup was sign ificant for mildly elevated inflammatory markers on ly. Rheumatological panel has always been negative. He underwent genetic testing for periodic fever syndr ome which was all negative. In September of 2014, he was seen at the NIH and underwent various genetic testing for CANDLE, PFS, and whole exam sequencing. He was initially placed on steroids with moderate improvement of symptoms. Me thotrexate was eventually added with great response. Various biologics were tried including anakinra, tocilizuma b, entanercept, infliximab. He was referred to our institution in May of 2016 after his previous rheumatologist/immun ologist had moved away. He was on steroids, methotrexate, and infliximab at the time. His exact diagnosis of NEM O Deleted exon5 auto inflammatory Syndrome (NDAS) was made during a subsequent visit to the NIH while he receiving car e at our institution. He was switched over to adalimumab wi th optimal control of symptoms. Of note, while he was at his previous institution, he was found to have protection of only 1/14 pneuom ococcal serotypes despite pneumovax. He was diagnosed with specific antibody deficiency. While at our institution, he eventually began to have low levels of IgG, IgA, IgM and was diagnos ed with hypogammaglobinemia. He will be starting I VIG. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: He was eventually diagnosed with NEMO Deleted exon5 auto inflammatory Syndrome (NDAS) through whole ge nome sequencing obtained at the NIH. Prior to this form al diagnosis, he had been treated as a systemic JIA patient with steroids, methotrexate, and infliximab with good co ntrol of his symptoms. He was started on this re gimen largely due to his symptoms of joint swelling, uveitis, and per iodic fevers. His infliximab was later switched to adalimumab. Given what we understand about NF-kb -related disease and its pro-inflammatory affect, an anti-TNF-alpha age nt is especially useful. He is currently followed by ophthalmology with no current signs or symptoms of uveitis. At his most recent visit, he had sustained low IgG, IgM, and IgA. Clinically however, he had not rece ntly had recurrent infections. We prescribed IVIG in order to replace his immunoglobulins and avoid recurrent infections in the future.

We report a case of a 9-year-old girl with ANCA- negative MPA who initially presents respiratory sym ptom. At first, she was diagnosed with atypical pne umonia based on her clinical symptoms and finding in chest x-ray, a nd interstitial lung disease was additionally suspe cted in chest computed tomography. Dyspnea was relapsed after ini tial improvement from oral corticosteroid therapy. From lung biopsy under the video assisted thoracoscopic surge ry, she was finally diagnosed as MPA. Interestingly , ANCA was negative in the repeated blood tests. Oral cyclopho sphamide with prednisolone administered as the init ial treatment led her to remission and low dose prednisolone and azat hioprine were administered as the maintenance treat ment. The treatment response is good, so her clinical symptom s, pulmonary functions, and radiologic findings hav e been much improved. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 9-year-old girl had cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, a nd dyspnea for 16 days and was given initial diagno sis of upper respiratory infection. However the symptoms did not improve after cold medications, even dyspnea was a ggravated from 6 days ago. Chest X-ray showed peribronchial h azy infiltration in both lung, and she felt dyspnea and fatigue from activity. Chest CT scan done after admission reveal ed diffuse bronchocentric ground glass opacity and consolidations in bilateral lungs that was suspected of atypical pneu monia probably. Initial Percutaneous pulse oxymeter indicated 92% at the time of admission, and 88% at the 3rd admission day without oxygen supplement. BAL was done at 4th hospital day, that showed 42% of macrophage, and culture stu dies for viruese, fungi, and bacteria were all negative.Ther e was no effect of antibiotics. Initial improvement after oral corticosteroid, her symptoms aggravated again. So l ung biopsy was performed, and microscopic polyangii tis was confirmed. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patients with microscopic polyangiitis often showed relapse after corticosteroid only treatment.

In particular, it is widely used in endemic countries for Schistosomiasi s to decrease the number of people infected and, co nsequently, the spread of the disease. Although Praziquantel has so me known adverse effects, it is regarded as safe ge nerally for global use. Therefore, Praziquantel is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is estimated that about one hundred million people take Praziquantel throug hout the world every year, but a search of the lite rature showed that only five cases of anaphylactic reaction have been attributed to Praziquantel. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) characterized by acute onset of n umerous sterile, non-follicular pinhead sized pustu les, is a rare and severe cutaneous reaction usually triggered by drug s. Patients who develop AGEP occasionally require t reatment in an intensive care unit because it can progress to mult iple organ dysfunction. We present the first case o f AGEP due to Praziquantel as the literature is concerned. A 30-y ear-old previously healthy Japanese man was admitte d to the hospital complaining of a high fever and pruritic generalize d maculopapular erythematous eruption affecting the face, neck, trunk and upper arm. The day before admission, he t ook Praziquantel to for the treatment of Diphyllobo thriasis. Over the next three days, he developed pinhead sized, no n-follicular pustules mainly in the intertriginous area on a diffuse erythematous background. Laboratory tests showed le ukocytosis. Skin biopsy showed spongiform subcornea l eosinophils and lymphocytes. The non-follicular pustules spontaneously resolved without a systemic corticosteroid and proceeded to desquamate. Based o n the clinical course, laboratory findings and histopathological f eatures, he was diagnosed with AGEP due to Praziqua ntel. He was discharged from the hospital on day 12 after he too k Praziquantel, because all cutaneous lesions compl etely resolved and he became afebrile. In conclusion, Praziquantel causes not only mild adverse reactions but also se vere ones such as an anaphylactic reaction or AGEP. It is so rare tha t doctors and field workers may overlook them espec ially in developing countries, but they should be aware of these reacti ons. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 30-year-old previously healthy Japanese man, who works as a chef on a luxury cruise ship, presented to the hospital in order to be prescribed anthelminthics. He was asymp tomatic but eggs of Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense w ere found in his stool when he was examined by an annual detecti on survey for parasitic infection by his company. H e habitually had ingested fish such as salmon cooked by Sous-vide. H e had no previous drug allergy and no personal or f amily history of skin disease. He was prescribed Praziquantel (Biltr icide\u00ae) 600 mg per day for one day. On the day afte r he took Praziquantel, he presented with a pruritic generali zed maculopapular erythematous eruption affecting t he face, neck, trunk and upper arm with no mucosal involvement and urticarial lesions. He had a temperature of 39.2 . He was urgently hospitalized, and he began to take Acetami nophen 2,400 mg per day, Fexofenadine Hydrochloride 120 mg per day and Loxoprofen sodium 60 mg per day. Laboratory exams on the day of admission showed the following results : C- reactive protein 109.6 mg/l, white virus, Human Herpesvirus-6, Hepatitis B virus, H epatitis C virus) and for diseases (Systemic lupus erythem atosus, Dermatomyositis, ANCA-associated vasculitis ) were negative. Over three days, he developed pi nhead sized, non-follicular pustules mainly in the intertriginous area on a diffusely erythematous background. Results of blood and pustules cultures were negative. Histopat hological examination from consisting of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocy tes. There were no eggs and segments of the Diphyll obothrium in stool samples which were collected before and after taking Praziquantel. Capsule endoscopy was also ne gative. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Approximately 8 days after he took Praziquantel, th e non-follicular pustules spontaneously resolved wi thout additional treatment e.g. a systemic corticosteroid and were f ollowed by desquamation. He was discharged from the hospital on day 12 after he took Praziquantel, because all cuta neous lesions completely resolved and he became afe brile. He satisfied all the following five criteria which hav e been suggested for the definition of AGEP: 1) sev eral dozens of small, mostly non follicular pustules arising on a widespr ead edematous erythema; 2) Typical histopathologica l changes; 3) > 38\u00b0C; 4) blood neutrophil counts above 7\u00d710 9/L; and 5) acute evolution with spontaneous resolu tion of pustules in less than 15 days. In addition, according to an AGEP validation score which was developed to confir m the diagnosis by the EuroSCAR group, he scored 12, which indicated a definitive diagnosis of AGEP. There has been no re currence of the eruption for 6 months.

Lockey, MD University of South Florida Case Title: A Successful Case Of Pomalidomide Administration In Patient With Alleged Lenalidomide Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Summary and Lessons Learned: It was hypothesized that he would be at high risk f or recurrence of SJS since lenalidomide and pomalid omide are closely related. Therefore, the protocol was designed to mi nimize this chance. Success was achieved and the p atient is now on treatment. There is no evidence in the literature to indicate that cross-reactivity exists between th ese two medications; however, since they share similar molecular structu re, it made sense to treat him as indicated to mini mize any chance of recurrence of SJS. SJS is perceived not to be ame nable to desensitization; however, in this case, th e possibility exists that the protocol utilized successfully desensitize d him enabling him to receive pomalidomide. The pr otocol may be useful in future situations in which a medication i s absolutely necessary for the welfare of the patie nt in spite of the fact that a related medication allegedly caused SJS. Us e of this protocol may have desensitized him agains t recurrence of SJS. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 32 yr male with multiple myeloma developed biopsy proven Stevens-Johnson syndrome other treatments were indicated that the immunomodulatory thali domide derivative. Both pomalidomide and lenalidomide are derived by adding an amino group to the fourth carb on of the phthaloyl ring of thalidomide. Pomalidomide differ s from lenalidomide in that it has an additional ca rbonyl group in the phthaloyl ring. There is no documented allergenic cross-reactivity between lenalidomide and pomalidom ide. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The etiology of this patient's SJS is unknown. How ever, it was attributed to lenalidomide. SJS develo ped 10 days following its administration and resolved following discontinuation. The patient, family, consultants, and oncologists m et and discussed the risk/benefit of prescribing po malidomide via a \"desensitization\" protocol (Table 1). Pomalidomide was given orally as an outpatient; he was observed for one hour thereafter. On first week, he received 3 doses (Mon day 0.00025mg, Wednesday 0.00125mg, Friday 0.0025mg ). The second week, 2 doses (Tuesday 0.0125mg, Friday 0.02 5mg). The third week, 3 doses (Monday 0.125mg, Wedn esday 0.25mg, Friday 0.5mg). The fourth week, 2 doses (Tu esday 0.75mg, Friday 1mg). The fifth week, 3 doses (Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 1mg each). By week six, he to lerated 1mg daily. No changes in laboratory data we re noted. He took prednisone 15 mg TID daily and diphenhydramine 50 mg PO as needed throughout the escalation doses . Prednisone was discontinued after completing the pr otocol.

Lockey, MD Case Title: Cardiac transplantation and reaction to heparin Summary and Lessons Learned: A 70-year old male with cardiomyopathy underwent de sensitization to heparin prior to cardiac transplan t. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 70-year-old male with cardiomyopathy was referred for desensitization to porcine heparin. Twenty min utes after a heparin drip for atrial fibrillation, he developed an intolerable sensation of \"pins and needles\" on h is head, torso, and upper extremities, became flushed, and experienced generalized erythema. Diphenhydramine, 12.5mg, IV, was administered. The systemic allergic reaction (SAR) lasted 30 minutes. He was removed from the cardiac transplant list due to the heparin reaction. Alternatives to hepari n (ancrod, nafamostat, and bivalirudin) were not ac ceptable to the transplant team. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The consultants diagnosed the patient with a SAR to heparin. However, there are no absolute criteria, in this case, to differentiate a SAR from an idiosyncratic reaction. He underwent heparin administration using a modif ied desensitization protocol(1) in the intensive care u nit over four days (hours 0-12, 0.5 units/h; hours 12-24, 1.5 units/h; hours hour prior to discontinuation of the heparin drip, hepar in 5000 units was administered subcutaneously (subQ). Nausea, dizzin ess, and flushing occurred two hours later. The hep arin was reduced to 1000 units, followed by 3000 units 6 hou rs later, and 5000 units the following morning, all subQ. He was maintained on heparin 5000 units subQ every 12 hour s. His cardiac transplant status was upgraded and he successfully underwent cardiac transplantation. 1) Dave S, Park MA.

Approximately 2-3 weeks after starting isoniazid, she developed hyperglycemia. Her PCP add ed insulin degludec to her DM2 regimen and within 2 -3 days, she developed urticuria and facial angioedema. Isoniazi d and insulin digludec were stopped, and she receiv ed steroids and oral antihistamines with resolution of symptoms. The allergy work up included skin testing with ison iazid in the patient and a healthy subject. Skin te sting was negative in both the patient and control subject. We then perfo rmed a graded dose challenge with isoniazid. Patien t tolerated the procedure with no adverse reactions. She was instr ucted to resume a 300 mg daily dose of isoniazid an d is currently doing well. Of note, no standardized non-irritating concentrati ons are reported for isoniazid. Here, we present a protocol for skin testing and graded dose challenge to isoniazid. Thi s is relevant to the practice of allergy since the number of anti- tuberculosis drugs are limited, and there is often a need to reintroduce anti-TB drugs after an advers e drug reaction. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 59-year-old Nepalese woman with diabetes mellitus , type 2 (DM2) and recent diagnosis of latent tuber culosis (TB) was referred to Allergy Clinic for evaluation of urticu ria and angioedema after starting latent TB treatme nt. The patient was diagnosed by Interferon- release assay (IGRA) test ing and started on isoniazid. Approximately 2-3 wee ks after starting isoniazid, she developed hyperglycemia. Her PCP add ed insulin degludec to her DM2 regimen. Within 2-3 days, she developed urticuria and facial angioedema. She pres ented to the ED where isoniazid was stopped, and sh e was treated with steroids and loratidine. In addition, insulin degludec was switched to insulin glargine, which sh e is now tolerating well. Her Infectious Disease provider started rifam pin as an alternative treatment for latent TB at 11 days from the initial reaction. Within 3 days, the patient had recurrence of her facial angioedema without urticuria. Rifamp in was stopped and she received a 7 day course of prednisone and l oratidine with resolution of her symptoms. The allergy work up was performed within two months of the onset of symptoms and included skin testing (prick testing and intradermal testing, all concentrations in dupl icate) with isoniazid in the patient and a healthy control subject. A 300 mg tablet of isoniazid was diluted in sterile water . Skin prick testing was performed with 1:10 diluti on (30 mg/ml) and full dose, while intradermal testing was performed at 1:100 dilution (3mg/ml). Skin testing was negati ve in the patient and the control subject. Both patient and control r eported mild irritation to the intradermal test. We then performed a graded dose challenge with ison iazid at doses of 3 mg, 30 mg, and 150 mg at 30 min ute intervals, followed by another 150 mg dose and observation for 2 additional hours. Patient tolerated the procedur e without adverse reactions. She was instructed to resume a 300 mg daily dose of isoniazid and is currently doi ng well. Since no standardized skin testing exist for isonia zid, we performed skin testing at different dilutio ns (prick testing, 1:10 and full dose and intradermal testing, 1:100 diluti on in duplicates) to rule out false positives due t o drug irritation. We confirmed these results in a healthy subject who ha s never received isoniazid. Because of the unavaila bility of optimal negative predictive values, we also performed a gra ded dose challenge to confirm tolerance. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The pathogenesis of angioedema and urticuria is not clear. It is possible that the patient had an IgE mediated reaction, but we do not think it was caused by isoniazid as s he was able to tolerate isoniazid upon recurrent ex posure through incremental challenge. Hypersensitivity reactions t o insulin digludec, including angioedema and urticu ria, were reported in 0.9% in the initial clinical trials, and it is p ossible that the patient had an IgE mediated reacti on to insulin digludec. We did not perform skin testing to confirm this suspic ion as the patient was already tolerating an altern ative long acting insulin. Further, the patient developed angioedema after being switched to rifampin. There are a few c ase reports of rifampin induced angioedema, although the pathogene sis is still unclear. Finally, the etiology of the urticuria and angioedema may be idiopathic. However, patient has no prior history of urticuria and angioedema, but t his does not rule it out completely. Of note, a serum tryptase d rawn at around 2 months from initial reaction was n egative and makes a mast cell disorder unlikely. The recommended regimen by WHO for latent TB consis ts of number of anti-tuberculosis drugs are limited, ther e is often a need to reintroduce anti-TB drugs afte r an adverse drug reaction. In addition, our patient has concomitant diabetes; a diagnosis that is currently the number one opportunistic condition associated with reactivation TB nowadays. Here, we were able to reintroduce isoniazid in a patient with latent TB after demonstrating tolerance. The patient was d irected to resume her daily dose of isoniazid 300 m g daily per recommendations by the Infectious Disease provider. She is tolerating isoniazid at a phone call follow up 4 weeks later.

Summary and Lessons Learned: A 54 year old male with a history of chronic obstru ctive pulmonary disease (COPD) and steroid hypersen an acute COPD exacerbation. He previ ously experienced immediate and delayed reactions t o prednisone and methylprednisone, but tolerated inhaled mometas one and budesonide. He was unable to undergo diagno stic testing due poor lung function and acute dyspnea. U sing Coopman's classification of corticosteroids, h e was successfully challenged to a different corticosteroid class: int ramuscular triamcinolone acetonide. He tolerated th is medication with improvement in symptoms. This case demonstrates tha t using the classification of corticosteroids can b e a helpful tool in considering alternate options for those with cortic osteroid allergies. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient was a 54 year old Caucasian male with a history of COPD requiring oxygen therapy and multi ple drug allergies including corticosteroid hypersensitivity who presented with an acute COPD exacerbation. His maintenance COPD regimen included mometasone/formoterol 200/5 m cg 2 puffs twice daily, tiotropium 1 inhalation dai ly, and albuterol as needed. He tolerated inhaled budesonid e 1mg/ml twice daily without adverse effect. Howeve r, he had immediate and delayed reactions to multiple systemi c corticosteroids making treatment of acute exacerb ations challenging. Oral methylprednisolone resulted in im mediate diffuse erythroderma. Intravenous methylpre dnisolone caused immediate onset of pruritus, blisters, and t hroat swelling. Oral prednisone caused delayed join t swelling and pain. Oral hydrocortisone resulted in diffuse pruri tus and delayed lip blisters, which were directly o bserved in clinic. Despite the adverse reactions, he remarked on signi ficant improvement in lung symptoms with corticoste roids. His lung function was deemed too poor (forced expiratory vol ume in one second of 33%) to undergo skin testing t o corticosteroids. Patch testing had been planned for the future, however when he presented with acute d yspnea and hypoxia, a more immediate plan was required. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This patient presented with a therapeutic dilemma a s he tolerated inhaled corticosteroids but develope d reactions to oral and intravenous corticosteroids. He was admitt ed to the hospital for further evaluation. Accordin g to the Coopman's classification for corticosteroids, the p atient reacted to multiple agents in Class A, but h ad tolerated budesonide and mometasone from Classes B and D1, re spectively. Therefore, the decision was made to cha llenge him to intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide (Class B). He was challenged to 20mg daily but developed isolate d lip blisters. He noted significant improvement in his dyspnea so his dose was decreased to 10mg daily which he tolerate d for a 5 day course. Triamcinolone acetonide was tolerated via s elf-administration at home for future exacerbations .

We describe a case of desensitization to anti-tuberculosis drugs in a patient with Steven s Johnson syndrome using a specifically designed premedication, comedi cation and desensitization protocol. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 6-year-old male patient presented with the follow ing history: His 9-year-old sister died due to Ste ven Johnson syndrome secondary to antituberculosis drugs used t o treat military tuberculosis. The patient had a di agnosis of lymph node tuberculosis determined in October 2015 by lym ph node biopsy. He began treatment with isoniazid and rifampicin and presented 15 days later with an adverse reactio n consisting of erythematous dermal lesions that ev olved to blistered lesions affecting 30% of the skin surface , including oral mucosa and a positive Nicholsky si gn. He required hospitalization in the intensive care unit and rec eived systemic corticosteroids, intensive fluid t herapy, and assessment and management by our Clinical Immunology and Alle rgy service. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Demonstrating the absence of associated immunodef iciency (negative or normal ELISA test for HIV, imm unoglobulins, blood count, cultures and PCR for Cytomegalovirus) and with the need to treat for lymph node tubercul osis and the lack of acceptable alternatives, it was decided to initi ate desensitization to isoniazid and rifampin with a slow oral desensitization scheme accompanied by premedication and co-medication. This protocol was begun 4 weeks after hospital discharge, which was 6 weeks after the ons et of symptoms. He had no reactions during the dese nsitization period. Subsequent to the desensitization, monthly monitori ng with history and physical examination was conti nued for the first 3 months and then bimonthly until maintenance treatment was completed for one year. He manifeste d no clinical adverse reactions during this year of treatment. He patic Function Tests, urianalysis, blood chemistry (Glucose, urea, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol and triglyceride s) were evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatmen t and were normal. Desensitization has been considered to be absolutel y contraindicated in Stevens Johnson Syndrome and T oxic Epidermal Necrolysis. However given the need for antitubercu losis treatment and the absence of first-line treat ment alternatives in this patient, it was necessary to propose a new desensitization scheme for rifampicin and isoniazid . . Selection of the specific desensitization protocol will depend on the conditions of the patient, the c omorbidities present and the type of adverse reaction presented. There is no consensus on the value of premedication or co-medication during desensitization. Consider ing that the adverse reactions associated with antituberculosis drugs are mainly delayed, we chose systemic steroi ds, antihistamines (H1 and H2) and antileukotrienes for pre-medication and co-medication. . In conclusion, the slow desensitization scheme for antituberculosis drugs in a patient who had present ed with Stevens Johnson Syndrome after receiving those drugs was ef fective, using the described protocol and with con tinuous hospital monitoring for the first 10 days.. Such an approach should still be used very cautiously and only when a viable treatment alternative is not available, after a careful ass essment of the risk and benefit of the treatment, a nd after through discussion with the patient (and parent if a child) and informed consent obtained.

Hypersensitivity reactions to GnRH analogues are ex tremely rare. A 6 year old girl developed an immedi ate-type hypersensitivity reaction to intramuscular Triptore lin Acetate (Decapeptyl) prescribed for central pre cocious puberty. As no viable alternatives were available, a novel 5-st ep desensitization protocol was designed which allo wed her to continue receiving treatment safely. Skin prick and intradermal tests performed at the 6 th dose of Triptorelin Acetate after starting desen sitization showed equivocal findings. The undiluted drug form was als o found to be non-irritating in healthy controls. A basophil activation test (BAT) performed at the 12th dose of Triptoreli n Acetate after starting desensitization showed fai lure of normal upregulation of basophil activation markers CD63 an d CD203c under Triptorelin and anti-IgE stimulation , but normal responses to anti-IgE in the control - evidence of basophil anergy induced by desensitization. Limitat ions include the lack of pre-desensitization skin prick, intradermal tests and basophil activation tests due to logisti cal limitations and the family's personal preferences. We thus demonstrate here that desensitization to Tr iptorelin Acetate can be safely performed with this standardized protocol under appropriate allergy specialist super vision and monitoring, allowing the patient to cont inue receiving first- line optimal therapy. We also demonstrate the utili ty of BAT in monitoring response to desensitization . To our knowledge, this is the first report of induction of basophil anergy in drug desensitization, shedding further light on one of the mechanisms involved in successful immunother apy. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient first presented at age 5 years and 4 mo nths with bilateral breast buds and, after evaluati on, was diagnosed with central precocious puberty. She was started on monthly depot injections of Triptorelin, a GnRH an alogue, to arrest further progression into advanced puberty. She received intramuscular (IM) Triptorelin Embonat e (Diphereline) as her first dose but was switched to IM Triptorelin Acetate (Decapeptyl) in the second month as she exp erienced excessive injection site pain after the IM Triptorelin Embonate dose, which is a known side effect. After her third dose of IM Triptorelin Acetate, the patie nt developed generalized urticaria an hour after the injection, which resolved with one dose of an oral anti-histam ine. There was otherwise no angioedema or systemic involvement and vital signs were stable throughout. The clinical h istory and temporal relation of reaction to the Triptorelin Ac etate injection was suggestive of an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to Triptorelin Acetate. A subsequent open drug challenge to IM Triptorelin Acetate was also p ositive. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: As there are no alternative GnRH analogues availabl e in Singapore, where this patient lives, a referra l was made to an allergy specialist and a 5-step desensitization reg imen to Triptorelin Acetate was designed to allow h er to continue receiving optimal medical therapy safely. The patie nt received half her usual dose of IM Triptorelin A cetate with oral Prednisolone and oral Cetirizine the night before a nd 30 minutes before her Decapeptyl dose at the fir st visit. She was monitored uneventfully for 4 hours in the outpatien t Day Therapy Centre located within our tertiary ho spital. She was discharged well, with an Epipen Junior, anaphylaxis action plan and oral Cetirizine as standby medicat ions as a precautionary measure. The second step was performed a month later at the next planned dose, with the same pre-medications, b ut with the full dose of IM Decapeptyl. Subsequent monthly inje ctions of Triptorelin Acetate were administered wit h tapering pre- medications (until only oral Cetirizine given 30 mi nutes before the planned injection remained) withou t any immediate reactions. She reported episodes of mild, intermit tent urticaria without systemic involvement occurri ng 2 - 3 weeks after each injection, consistent with interval reac tions which are attributable to the delayed release of the depot, which were easily managed with antihistamines. The intens ity and frequency of urticaria decreased with each step of the desensitization protocol and resolved completely fr om her 8th Triptorelin Acetate injection onwards. S he now continues to receive monthly IM Triptorelin Acetate doses wit h oral Cetirizine as the single pre-medication, 30 minutes before each injection without reactions. Skin prick (SPT) and intradermal tests (IDT) were p erformed on the day of the 6th Triptorelin Acetate injection after starting desensitization. The family's preferences and logistical constraints did not allow us to perf orm skin tests between Triptorelin Acetate doses or before desensi tization. Undiluted Decapeptyl solution was used fo r SPT and IDT with appropriate positive and negative controls. Co nstant agitation of the reconstituted solution was performed to prevent crystallization. The undiluted drug concent ration was found to be non-irritating on two health y control subjects. The patient's SPT and IDT was result of waning IgE res ponse to Triptorelin Acetate with progressive desen sitization. A Basophil Activation Test (BAT) was performed prio r to the 12th Triptorelin Acetate injection after i nitiation of her desensitization protocol, with Triptorelin peptide [(D-Trp6), anti-human IgE an tibody (G7-18; BD Biosciences, San Jose, California) as a positive co ntrol. The basophil activation markers CD63 and CD2 03c both remained at baseline levels in both the patient and healthy control. The patient's basophils failed to upregula te CD63 and CD203c in the presence of anti-human IgE, whereas this nor mal response was maintained in the healthy control. This suggested a state of basophil anergy in the patient which cor related with the clinical picture of successful des ensitization. This is the first reported desensitization regime f or a patient with hypersensitivity to a GnRH analog ue - Triptorelin Acetate. Hypersensitivity reactions to GnRH analogu es, though rare, can nevertheless be potentially li fe-threatening. Switching to an alternative GnRH analogue still car ries a small risk of cross-reactivity. This novel d esensitization protocol allowed for the continued safe use of Triptorelin A cetate, an essential medical therapy for idiopathic central precocious puberty, in a setting where no alternative therapeu tic options were available. There are currently no validated SPT and IDT protoc ols for Triptorelin Acetate. We demonstrated that u ndiluted Triptorelin Acetate was non-irritating for the diag nostic evaluation of Triptorelin hypersensitivity r eactions. BAT analysis also demonstrated that basophil anergy was induced by the successful desensitization proc ess. Thyagarajan et al. had previously demonstrated that peanut oral immunotherapy was able to induce basophil anergy, a state of basophil suppression which is pathway-specific but not antigen specific. The proposed mechanism for th e effector cell anergy likely involves repeated allergen stimulatio n suppressing signalling pathways downstream of the IgE receptor FceRI, resulting in downregulation of basophil resp onses. The slow sustained release of Triptorelin Acetate, through its depot form administered intramuscularly , also likely augmented the efficacy and safety of the desensitiz ation process compared to drugs administered orally or intravenously which are quickly absorbed and attain high blood concentrations soon after administratio n. Limitations include the lack of pre-desensitization skin prick, intradermal tests and basophil activat ion tests due to logistic limitations and the family's personal pref erences. We demonstrate here that desensitization to Triptor elin can be safely performed with this standardized protocol under appropriate allergy specialist supervision and moni toring; the utility of BAT in monitoring response t o desensitization and to our knowledge, the first report of induction of basophil anergy in drug desensitization, sheddi ng light on one of the mechanisms involved in successful immunotherapy .

Because Diphtheria/tetanus va ccines are prepared in a medium derived from cow's milk, some experts proposed that intolerance to the vaccines m ay be due to the presence of residual casein. In ac cordance with the 2012 Adverse Reaction to Vaccines Practice Paramete r, we attempted to identify the culprit antigen. Ou r patient had a history of bloody stools after ingestion of milk du ring infancy with positive prick skin testing and i mmunocap to milk, but outgrew his milk allergy over time. We attempted to determine the culprit antigen in the DTaP administ ered for his fourth dose on the date of reaction, but were unabl e to obtain the lot number and specific manufacture r brand. At present, there is limited information and guidan ce regarding the best approach to challenge for our patients with adverse events following immunization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient who underwent skin testing to DTaP and Tdap and success ful vaccination. This case highlights the fact that by following 2012 Practice Parameter protocol, patients who have prev iously not tolerated vaccination to DTaP can be ski n tested to and safely receive Tdap vaccine. Patient Presentation and Testing: We evaluated an 11-year-old male for an adverse rea ction following simultaneous vaccination with DTaP and MMR. His mother reported a history of urticaria, emesis, res piratory distress and lethargy within one hour afte r his vaccinations. Medical records from the primary care provider and the emergency department documented urticaria, naus ea and abdominal pain without emesis and no respiratory sy mptoms, which resolved after administration of epin ephrine. The patient had already received 4 doses of DTaP vaccin e in the first 2 years of life without incident. Af ter his adverse reaction, he was skin tested to MMR and latex which were both negative. He has also received the influ enza vaccine without reaction since the skin testing was done an d negative. We performed skin testing to DTaP and T dap in accordance with the 2012 Practice Parameter guideli nes. We planned a cautious challenge to Tdap if the skin testing was negative or desensitization if the skin test to Tda p was positive. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Prick skin testing was negative to DTaP and Tdap fi rst using a 1:10 dilution and then full-strength wi th appropriate positive and negative controls. Intradermal testing was performed to both vaccines diluted 1:100 with a positive result to DTaP 8 mm wheal and negative result to Tdap. Tda p was administered as a cautious challenge without difficulty. We recommended that this child receive Tdap for future doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccin ation. Following the Practice Parameter protocol we were able to saf ely skin test and administer Tdap vaccine for a pat ient who had not tolerated vaccination with DTaP. Due to anxiety fo llowing his reaction the family was hesitant to pro ceed with the recommendation schedule, we were able to provide th e subsequent vaccines.

Supporting laboratory studi es, patient presentation, history, and histology ma y delineate these two distinct entities. However, there is great over lap including patient presentation and histologic s taining of liver biopsies, which may present a diagnostic quandary t o the etiology of liver injury. We present a 69-yea r-old woman with multiple co-morbidities, including rheumatoid splenectomy secondary t o idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and prior history of brea st and renal cancer, who came to the emergency room with acute onset fever, nausea, and malaise. Prior to admissio n, she had a history of recurrent streptococcal pne umonia infections, for which she was started on prophylactic oral peni cillin and followed closely in an outpatient settin g. On presentation, her initial labs revealed elevated transaminases an d accompanying leukocytosis meeting SIRS criteria. She was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam) for a presumed pneumon ia v. ESBL UTI, but despite the addition of these antibiotics, there was no improvement in labs or symptomatology . Her inpatient stay was also notable for new onset eosinophilia, w hich coincided with piperacillin-tazobactam adminis tration and worsened in the setting of antibiotic transitions t o ceftriaxone and, later, levofloxacin. With other infectious etiologies ruled out, all antibiotics withheld, and an MRCP an d liver ultrasound showing no gross evidence of bil e outflow obstruction in the face of a stagnantly elevated al kaline phosphatase, she underwent a liver biopsy. T he biopsy showed evidence of inflammatory infiltrates concerning for either PBC or DILI. With autoantibodies consistent with PBC, this patient was eventually started on ursodeoxycholate and her alkaline phosphatase returned toward normal . This coupled with the cessation of antibiotics seemed to hasten the improvement of her liver injury. Diagnostic tes ting including liver enzymes and biopsy may provide insight to the under lying etiology, but in this case the stains would l ook similar with eosinophlic infiltrates. It becomes a diagnostic qu andary to evaluate a patient for drug-induced injur y when underlying liver pathology is present. Great care and effort m ust be shown to separate the two pathologies for ev entual symptom remission. This case serves as a reminder that Occa m's razor does not always apply. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 69-year-old woman with multiple co -morbidities who presented to the Tulane University emergency room with fever, tachycardia, and a one-day history of malaise and significant nausea. The patient's h istory is notable for multiple co-morbidities including hypothyro Rheumatoid Arthritis with lung involvement, a history of breas t and kidney cancer, ITP s/p splenectomy, and a his tory of multiple admissions due to pneumococcal sepsis. She is follo wed by multiple subspecialist in the outpatient set ting, including an infectious disease physician who started her on Pen icillin VK prophylaxis after a recent hospitalizati on for community acquired pneumonia, she had been faithfully taking this antibiotic daily for one month prior to presen tation. Additionally, she had chronically been on multiple medications associated with DILI including aspirin, atorvastatin, and diltazem. Upon initial assessment by our consult service the patient had been hospitalized for 6 days, during wh ich she was under the care of the primary Internal Medicine service, as well as additional consulting services including gastroenterology and infectious disease. We were initially consulted due to the patient's increasing peripheral eosinop hilia and a possible drug rash concerning for Drug Reaction with Eoisnop hilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). Her absolute e osinophil count (AEC) had increased to 1000 from an admit val ue of 0. Notably, she has had multiple previously d ocumented episodes of eosinophilia, all in the setting of ant ibiotics that were given on her many admissions for varying infectious sources varying from ESBL+ Proteus UTI to a strepto coccal pneumonia resulting in sepsis and an intensi ve care stay. At the time of our initial consultation the patient wa s notable to be itchy with no visible rash; her wor kup for PBC had already been started by our GI colleagues. While th e patient's RegiSCAR score was only 2, making DRESS unlikely, her overall clinical picture however was not entirely c onsistent with PBC. The patient's family history, social history, and e nvironmental history were noncontributory. Her init ial physical evaluation was also not notable for any rash consis tent with DRESS. The lab values at the time of eval uation were notable for AST-118 U/L, ALT of 108 U/L, continued leukocytosis of these on WBC 15.6. The patient' s IGAM were within normal limits, as were her bilirubin levels. Her creatinine and anemia were stable prior lab st udies. At the time of initial consult her anti-mitochondrial Abs had resu lted positive at a value of 1 : 111.9 U (ref <1:40) had resulted and were positive. Her LFTs on admission were as follows: So we encountered a patient with improving LFTs being treated for a presumptive PBC in the setting of worsening eosinop hila. The picture of elevated liver function tests in the setting of fever, malaise, and pruritus as well as improvement on ursodeoxycholate point toward a diagnosis of PBC, p articularly in the setting of positive anti-mitocho ndrial antibodies. However, worsening eosinophilia as well as a patien t reported rash with antibiotic administration demo nstrates that DILI could not be ruled out. At the time of initial asse ssment, we advised to avoid Penicillin containing a gents and to follow the liver biopsy in order to identify the etiology of her liver injury. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Throughout her admission, the patient had a broad d ifferential for the etiology of her liver injury; t he primary teams leading diagnoses included infection, autoimmune he patitis, and DILI. However, in the setting of five days of antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam, Meropenem, Ceftr iaxone, and Levofloxacin with persistent leukocytos is with no identifiable source of infection and continued lab evidence of liver injury, the focus shifted to prim arily an autoimmune process v. DILI. To help clarify her diagnosis, she underwent a liver biopsy that demonstrated a patte rn consistent with drug induced liver injury - moderate-severe portal and mild lobular infiltration of lymphocytes, neutr ophils, and eosinophils. A diagnosis of DILI seemed most likely , but our GI colleagues and pathologist also believ ed that an early onset, underlying PBC was also present, which was r einforced by her profoundly elevated AMA. While PBC may cause an eosinophilia, the sudden inc rease in her AEC after administration of piperacill in-tazobactam and continued elevation when transitioned to ceftri axone when combined with the pathology findings of scattered portal and lobular mixed inflammation with focal ch olangitis and minimal fibrosis were most consistent with DILI. This case demonstrates two overlapping pathologies, DILI in the setting of undiagnosed PBC. With eventual r esolution of symptoms and continued improvement of LFTs and eosi nophilia the patient was discharged to follow with us in clinic, where she was found to be in good health and at her functional and clinical baseline. Her labs were no ted to be resolving toward normal with AST 27 U/L , ALT 24 U/ K, AlkPhos 181 U/L, and GGT 87 U/L. We continue to support her diagnosis of PBC with a elevated AMA titer of 1:320 a month after admission. While the patient had imp roved, it was advised that utilization of unrelated cephalosporin s may be appropriate for antibiotic use, but they s hould be done in a controlled environment and not in the setting of cu rrent liver pathology. She continued to take her ur sodeoxycholate and was later seen by GI who advised she should tak e it indefinitely, or until her AMA sero-converts t o negative. She has since had a humoral immune evaluation that showed p neumococcal antibody protection to 8/23 tested sero types and has undergone a liver biopsy with pathology report pending. The patient's clinical improvement highlig hts the importance of discovering this diagnosis prior to i rreversible damage and liver failure due to hepaton ecrosis.

Case Title: Clindamycin Desensitization in a Pediatric Patient Summary and Lessons Learned: Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic with broad spectrum antimicrobial coverage and is commonly use d as an alternative to penicillins and cephalosporins. Hype rsensitivity to clindamycin is rare and published g uidance about management of clindamycin hypersensitivity is limit ed. We present an 8-year-old girl with recurrent di stal w as suggestive of hypersensitivity to clindamycin and was referred fo r allergy evaluation. Work up revealed positive int radermal skin testing to clindamycin at a concentration of 15 mg/ ml (7 mm wheal, 20 mm flare) and clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity during a graded oral challenge, co nsistent with a diagnosis of clindamycin hypersensi tivity. Despite this, oral clindamycin was determined to be the optimal a ntibiotic for her incompletely treated MSSA osteomy elitis, the decision was made to pursue clindamycin desensitiza tion. Patient underwent a 9-step rapid oral desensi tization protocol to clindamycin. She successfully completed the dese nsitization. Following her rapid oral desensitizat ion, she tolerated a full therapeutic course of clindamycin with oral pr e-medications. Our experience provides a platform f or future rapid oral desensitization of pediatric and adult patient s. Patient Presentation and Testing: An 8-year-old girl presented with recurrent distal humeral osteomyelitis. She was empirically treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and vancomycin. After bone culture s grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), her antimicrobial therapy was changed to IV cefazolin. Eight days later, the patient developed a diffuse u rticarial rash, vaginal itching, labial swelling, and hand and foot swelling. Cefazolin was discontinued; her symptoms improved but did not resolve completely. The following day, the pat ient was started on oral clindamycin. One hour afte r the first dose, she developed subjective throat tightness and worse ning urticarial rash. Clindamycin was discontinued immediately. Over the next 48 hours, she developed waxing and wa ning lip swelling, urticarial rash, joint pain, and extremity swelling. Seventy-two hours after clindamycin was discontinue d, her symptoms improved. Antimicrobial therapy wit h doxycycline was then started. Four days later, she developed na usea, emesis, and maculopapular rash. Doxycycline w as discontinued, and the patient was referred for urge nt allergy evaluation. Due to treatment with antihistamines for the rash a nd pruritus, skin testing could not be performed im mediately. Clindamycin was the preferred oral agent, but clini cal history alone was insufficient to establish hyp ersensitivity versus persistent symptoms unrelated to clindamycin treatm ent. Thus, the patient underwent a three-step grade d, oral challenge to clindamycin. She tolerated the first d ose (1/100th of the full therapeutic dose [FTD]), b ut, after the second dose (1/10th FTD), she developed diffuse urticaria consistent with clindamycin hypersensitivity. She w as treated with cetirizine and her urticaria resolved. After compl eting the treatment course of clindamycin, the pati ent later underwent clindamycin skin testing. Skin prick testing was ne gative, but intradermal testing was positive at a c oncentration of 15 mg/ml (7 mm wheal, 20 mm flare), consistent with cl indamycin hypersensitivity. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was determined to have clindamycin hype rsensitivity. Alternative oral antibiotic therapie s were considered; however, given past hypersensitivity reactions to c efazolin and Bactrim, oral clindamycin was determin ed to be the optimal antibiotic. Due to the urgent need to resta rt therapy, the decision was made to pursue rapid c lindamycin desensitization. We performed a 9-step rapid oral d esensitization to clindamycin. The goal dose was 30 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours (300 mg/dose). Cetirizine 10 mg was given orally one hour prior to desensitizati on. The patient tolerated the desensitization and received multiple doses of clindamycin under inpatient observation. Following discharge, the patient developed intermittent urtic arial rash and throat tightness after taking a dose of clindamycin. She was readmitted for adjustments to her premedication regimen and subsequently tolerated clindamycin wit hout symptoms with the following premedication regimen: cetirizine 10 mg every 8 hours (1 hour before each dose), montelukast 5 mg daily (1 hour before the evening d ose), and ranitidine 60 mg every 12 hours (4 hours before the afternoon dose, and 1 hour before the evening dose) . She was discharged home and completed four weeks of oral clindamycin without further symptoms after adjustme nt of her premedication regimen. Her treatment cou rse of clindamycin led to resolution of her MSSA osteomyel itis. Submission Number: 160 Poster Number: 53 Keyword: Drug Allergy Primary Author Name: Danilo Gois Goncalves, MD.

Case Title: Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis Cessation After Menopause Summary and Lessons Learned: Case Description: A 50-year-old female presented wi th pruritic diffuse erythematous papules since 37 y ears of age, with a cyclical worsening from 5 days before menstruatio n until 2 days after its ending. She also reported concomitant diffuse arthralgia and some episodes of periorbital edema. First, she was submitted to an intradermal test wit h medroxyprogesterone acetate, which was positive at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL after 6 hours of its application. Then, a cutaneous biopsy was performed, whose histo pathology showed iltration with melanophages collagen hyalinization, with negative direct dimmunofluorescence. A single-blind ed oral challenge test with desogestrel 75 mcg was positive after 6.5 hours, with the appearance of pruritic d iffuse erythematous thick papules and plaques. The patient was instructed to avoid progestogen-based contrace ptives and underwent remission of the disease after menopause, at age 50. Discussion: Autoimmune Progesterone Der matitis (APD) is a hypersensitivity reaction to endogenous or exogenous progesterone characterized by the appe arance of cutaneous lesions at times of increased serum proge sterone levels, usually in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The clinical picture is variable and the histopatho logy is usually non-specific, although the most com monly described finding in the literature is a perivascular inflamm atory infiltrate present in 72% of the cases. Other histologic findings are: a non-specific or interstitial inflammatory in cases; eosinophilic component in 41% of patients; a neutrophilic component associated with a pred ominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in 21% of cases. F inal Comments: Although histopathology in APD is usually nonspecif ic, some patterns have already been identified. The re may be an association between the histological pattern and th e clinical vignette. Thus, cutaneous biopsy is an i mportant tool for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of APD, bedsides an intradermal test with medroxyprogester one acetate or an oral challenge test with desogestrel may help co nfirm the diagnosis. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 50-year-old married female presented with pruriti c diffuse non-scaly erythematous papules since 37 y ears of age, with a cyclical worsening from 5 days before menstruatio n until 2 days after its ending. She also reported concomitant metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal arthralgia and some episodes of periorbital edema. She thought loratadine and prednisone improved her symptoms. She denied ot her complaints. She had no history of drug addictio n and her mother had rheumatoid arthritis. It was hypothesize d that the increase of progesterone levels, during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, could induce urticarial les ions in this patient. Complementary evaluation show ed no new findings initially. Assessment of C reactive protein, erythr ocyte sedimentation rate, complete blood factor, anti-cyclic citr ullinated peptides, anti-thyroperoxydase and antinu clear antibodies did not show abnormalities. Then, during an asympto matic period, she was submitted to an intradermal t est with medroxyprogesterone acetate, cutaneous biopsy and a n oral challenge with desogestrel to assess the hyp othesis of hormonal urticaria. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with Autoimmune Progester one Dermatitis, as her intradermal test with medroxyprogesterone acetate was positive at the con centration of 0.5 mg/mL after 6 hours of its applic ation. Twenty healthy volunteers tested negative. Then, a cutaneo us biopsy was performed, whose histopathology showe d perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration with me lanophages and collagen hyalinization, with ne gative direct immunofluorescence. A single-blinded oral challenge test with desogestrel 75 mcg was positive after 6. 5 hours, with the appearance of pruritic diffuse erythematous thick p apules and plaques. Autoimmune Progesterone Dermati tis (APD) is a hypersensitivity reaction to endogenous or exogenou s progesterone characterized by the appearance of c utaneous lesions at times of increased serum progesterone le vels, usually in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The clinical picture is variable and the histopathology is usual ly non-specific, although the most commonly describ ed finding in the literature is a perivascular inflammatory infiltrat e present in 72% of the cases. Other histologic fin dings are: a non- specific or interstitial inflammatory in of cases; an eosinophilic component in 41% of patients; and a neutrophilic component associated with a predominan tly lymphocytic infiltrate in 21% of cases (1). The diagnosis of APD is based on the association of cyclical or progeste rone-induced symptoms, a progesterone hypersensitiv ity test and response to inhibiting ovulation (2). The patient w as instructed to avoid progestogen-based contracept ives and take an anti-histamine (loratadine) when symptomatic. She u nderwent remission of the disease after menopause, at age 50. Although histopathology in APD is usually nonspecif ic, some patterns have already been identified. The re may be an association between the histological pattern and th e clinical vignette.

Gierer, DO FAAAAI, University of Kans as Medical Center Case Title: Insulin Induced Angioedema in a Type I Diabetic: Al lergy vs Adverse Effect Summary and Lessons Learned: In rare instances, patients on insulin therapy have been reported to develop peripheral or generalized edema. Few cases have been reported in the literature, with ma ny affected patients being children and newly diagn osed with diabetes. Additional risk factors include underweig ht patients, insulin na\u00efve patients, and patients r eceiving intensification of insulin therapy. The mechanism f or insulin-induced edema is unknown, but is thought to be a consequence of altered sodium handling in the kidne y related to alterations in renin and aldosterone p hysiology. Symptoms of insulin induced edema have been effecti vely managed with diuresis. IgE mediated reactions to insulin are less common with the introduction of human insulin products, however few cases continue to be reported . Since the presentation of insulin-induced edema may in rare i nstances be related to IgE mediated reactions, we p resent a case discussing the utility of IgE mediated allergy test ing in an adult with suspected insulin-induced edem a. Patient Presentation and Testing: We present a 37 year old female with known type 1 d iabetes, who had recurrent angioedema involving her face and extremities, within 24-48 hours after bolus doses o f insulin lasting for 5-7 days. The swelling was re producible with exposure and resolved with diuretics. Percutaneous testing with QuinTip and intradermal using non-diluted 100 units/mL insulin lispro, insulin hu recombinant, insulin aspart, insulin glargine a nd insulin detemir with negative (saline) and positive (histamine) con trols. Testing with these agents was thought to be an effective strategy to rule out IgE mediated reaction to the a bove insulin products, and would provide evidence t o re-introduce insulin for the management of her condition. Skin t esting was negative to all the above products with adequate controls. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Skin testing was negative, which was consistent wit h a non-IgE mediated drug reaction. Her reaction wa s similar to the insulin induced edema described in the literature, making this diagnosis more likely. Due to the delay ed nature of her reactions, an in-office challenge was not completed . She was agreeable to resuming her insulin pump at a very low dose with consideration of increasing her dose over time , along with low dose thiazide diuretic to minimize edema. This case emphasizes the utility of IgE mediated allergy test ing to rule out true hypersensitivity prior to resu ming insulin in patients with suspected insulin-induced edema and h ighlights this important differential diagnosis in patients with insulin reactions. Submission Number: 174 Poster Number: 55 Keyword: Drug Allergy Primary Author Name: Hayley Chester Primary Author Institution: Mount Sinai St. Luke's-Roosevelt Additional Authors: Avinash Singh, MBBS, Learned: A 71-year-old female developed a generalized pustul ar eruption on an erythematous background within th ree days of initiating metoprolol tartrate; it progressed rapid ly to involve the face, torso and limbs with sparin g of her palms, soles, oral mucosa and conjunctiva. Based on clinical find ings, and supported by a punch biopsy, a diagnosis of Acute Generalised Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) was mad e, secondary to metoprolol tartrate. The rash rapidly desquamated upon discontinuation o f metoprolol tartrate; after a thorough infectious work up and review of her medication exposures, we concluded th at metoprolol tartrate was likely the offending age nt. All other medications had been administered for more then fiv e weeks before the development of AGEP. AGEP is a rare, acute cutaneous reaction characteri zed by the development of numerous non-follicular s terile pustules with edematous erythema. by antibiotics, antifungals, antimalarials or diltiazem; symptom onset is a few hours to days after administ ration of the offending agent. Unlike Steven-Johnso n syndrome, mucosal involvement is rare and if present, is rest ricted to lip erosions. Other symptoms include feve r and peripheral blood neutrophilia. It is thought to be mediated by drug-specific CD4+ T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells , and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. As these patients present with a generalizes rash i n the setting of fever and leukocytosis AGEP can ea sily be confused with a systemic infection. This can delay diagnosis and appropriate management. AGEP is readily treata ble, by simply discontinuing the offending agent and supporting pa tient, with topical steroids sometimes offered for symptomatic relief. Although AGEP it has been described as an a dverse reaction to numerous drugs, AGEP secondary t o beta blockers has not been widely reported. We describe a case of biopsy proven AGEP likely secondary to metoprolol tartrate. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 71-year old female with a history of deafness due to Paget's disease of the bone who was admitted to the ICU for pneumococcal meningitis secondary to a left ear inf ection. She completed a one month course of intrave vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, with vancom ycin and ampicillin discontinued more than 1 month prior to the development of AGEP. She was also initially treated with ciprofloxacin ear-drops, which were discontin ued four weeks prior to the onset of AGEP, topical miconazole to t he groin and levetiracetam which she continued to r eceive throughout her hospital stay. On day fifty-five of her hospita lization she developed generalized erythema on her face, chest, back, abdomen, arms and legs, many areas with pinpoint pa pules without blistering; there were multiple tiny pustules on her face and shoulders. Her palms and soles, as well as her mucosa and conjunctiva were spared. She had mi ld xerosis and scaling on her bilateral lower extremities. She was febrile to 103.2F with laboratory tests significan t for leukocytosis acidosis to 4.9mmol/L. The blood cultur es, urine culture and chest x-ray were all repeated and retur ned normal. Metoprolol tartrate was started three d ays prior to the development of the rash and was her only new medica tion. Dermatology was consulted and the patient rec eived a punch biopsy; the pathology was notable for scatter ed neutrophils with subcorneal pustules within the epidermis and with rare eos inophils within the dermis. These findings were con sistent with a diagnosis of AGEP. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was ultimately diagnosed with AGEP base d on the morphology of the rash as well as the resu lts of the pathology specimen. The causative agent was likely metoprolol tartrate, based on the time course of th e rash in relation to the new administration of this agent in the prec eding days. Although the patient was also on ceftri axone and levetiracetam when the rash developed, she had cont inuously tolerated these medications for over seven weeks. However, given the association of AGEP to antibioti c exposure both ceftriaxone and metoprolol tartrate were discontinued and she was started on IV hydration an d topical hydrocortisone ointment with complete res olution within ten days.

Zafra MD, Medical College of Wisconsin Case Title: Sebelipase Desensitization: A Case Report Summary and Lessons Learned: 28 years old female with a past medical history of lysosomal lipase deficiency, intermittent asthma, a llergic rhinitis and depression presenting with history of systemic adve rse reactions to the Sebelipase infusions (enzyme r eplacement therapy). Sebelipase alfa is a recombinant form of lysosomal acid lipase enzyme that normally in body catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides to free cholesterol, glycerol and free fatty acids. Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been re ported with sebelipase. Depending on the type and severity of allergic reactions, it is usually treated with slow er infusion rate, premedication with antihistamine or corticosteroids, temporary interruption in infusions to discontinuin g the infusions if the reactions are severe. The patient's drug reaction was confirmed as an IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction with a positive intradermal test (1:100 dilution). She underwent successful rapid dr ug desensitization in the ICU after pre-medication with H1 and H2 receptor antihistamine. She will be transitioned to the infusion clinic for the sebelipase infusions u sing the same protocol. If patient continues to have systemic rea ctions to the infusions, then we will consider addi ng corticosteroids to the pretreatment. Another option is to start her on omalizumab prior to her infusions. Desensitization to Sebelipase alfa has never been r eported. Because of the high incidence of hypersen sitivity reactions (20%) , treatment by drug desensitization utilizing our protocol can be considered for patients with history of anaphylactic reaction to Sebelipase or other enzyme replacement therapies. Patient Presentation and Testing: 28 years old female with history of lysosomal lipas e deficiency diagnosed with liver biopsy in Novembe r 2013 after persistently elevated ALT. She was started on sebel ipase infusions (100 mg over 1 hour) in November of 2016. Treatment was delayed due to pregnancy. Patient was getting the infusions every 2 weeks and was tolera ting them till May 2017. In May 2017, 3 mins after starting her infusion she developed bilateral palm itching followed immediat ely with hives and throat swelling. Infusion was stopped and she was t reated with diphenhydramine and steroids. She continued the infusions after getting pre-medic ated with diphenhydramine and any symptoms of itchi ng during the infusions were treated by stopping the infusion and giving patient steroid and diphenhydramine. She wo uld then continue and finish her infusion. On July 13th, 2017 she got pre medicated with stero ids the night before the infusion and diphenhydrami ne 30 mins before the infusion. She still developed hives with lip swelling and chest tightness. Infusion was sto pped and she was treated with more steroids and diphenhydramine. Patient had skin prick testing and intradermal test ing for sebelipase on Aug 9th, 2017. She was positi ve on intradermal testing (1:100) with appropriate controls. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient showed sensitization to Sebelipase on intra dermal (1:100) testing. She was admitted for rapid drug desensitization in Aug 9th, 2017 over 8 hours. She was pre-medicated 2 0 mins before the infusion with 25 mg IV diphenhydramine and 50 m g IV Ranitidine and following protocol was followed for desensitization and infusion with a target dose of 100 mg. Bag 1: (1:10,000 dilution) 0.01% of final dose = 0. 01 mg in NS 100 ml over 1 hour. Bag 2: (1: 1,000 dilution) 0.1% of final dose = 0.1 mg in NS 100 ml over 1 hour. Bag 3: (1:100 dilution) 1% of final dose = 1 mg in NS 100 ml over 1 hour. Bag 4: (1:10 dilution) 10% of final dose = 10 mg in NS 100 ml over 1 hour. Bag 5: 90% of final dose = 88 mg in NS 500 ml over 4 hours. She developed itching around her ears bilaterally a nd facial flushing which was treated with diphenhyd ramine and she tolerated and finished the infusion on a slower rat e. She was again admitted and treated with Zyrtec 20 mg PO once and famotidine 20 mg IV once 30 mins befor e the desensitization and infusion. Same protocol was use d as of 8-9-2017 and patient tolerated the infusion with no problems. Patient is now planned to follow the protocol every two weeks for her infusions. If she continues to h ave allergic reactions, then we will consider adding corticoster oids to the pretreatment. Another option is to star t her on omalizumab prior to her infusions.

She had been treated with nitrogen mustard, photochemotherapy (PUVA), and met hotrexate with good control. In 2012 the patient was switche d to brentuximab due to liver toxicity. Three week s after her first lifetime infusion of brentuximab, she presented wit h facial burning and eye swelling. On the second i nfusion, the patient developed facial swelling, and rash without mucosal involvement or blistering one week post tr eatment, which resolved with steroids. Her third infusion of brent uximab was reduced to 40% of the target dose and st eroids given as pretreatment. Despite these modifications, the pati ent developed severe delayed rash with hand and foo t peeling, without mucosal or oral involvement. Her symptoms r esolved after several weeks with H1 blockade and st eroids. Brentuximab was discontinued. She was evaluated 2 years later due to disease prog ression and had negative skin testing to brentuxima b. Desensitization was recommended given the unknown p redictive value of brentuximab skin testing and the patient had no other available treatment options. The patient r eceived a standard 3 bag 12 step desensitization pr otocol at 50% of target dose and developed a delayed fever and rash with eosinophilia (1940 total) and lower extremity swelling which resolved with steroids. The allergy and oncology t eams agreed with desensitization at 25% of the targ et dose with 3 bag 12 step protocol. During the protocol, the patient developed a single hive and a delayed mild pruritic rash on her legs, without eosinophilia, or mucosal involvement. Symp toms resolved with steroids. With each additional d esensitization, her dose was gradually increased until the full tar get dose was reached (12th desensitization). To date the patient continues to receive brentuxima b desensitization at full dose every 8 weeks, using a down-graded 2 bag 8 step desensitization protocol. Cetirizine and famotine are given prior to each infusion, without the need of post steroid usage, and has not developed eosinophilia o r delayed rash. A total of 27 protocols have been administered since 2014 and her CT scan continues to show no disease p rogression with her ability to remain on first line therapy. Patient Presentation and Testing: When I initially meet the patient, she had received her first brentuximab desensitization. Unfortunate ly, a severe rash had appeared several days after her treatment, alon g with lab results showing the patient had a signif icant elevated eosinophila count to almost 2000. This made the des ensitization team pause and question how we could c ontinue using this medication. When speaking with the patient she expressed worry and sadness and requested that we do not give up on her since no one else would provide this treatme nt. She basically had no alternative therapies for her underlying lymphoma. We continued treatment with extreme cauti on with the patient's understanding of our limitati ons if her symptoms worsen for fear of causing DRESS. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis was shown with lab results and the pr esence of a significant rash associated to brentuxi mab. To understand the need to treat the patient with basel ine skin lesions in the setting of having cutaneous T cell lymphoma, presenting with a delayed type 4 reaction, without a true understanding of the mechanism that was resp onsible for the rash was difficult moving forward and continuing tr eatment with this medication. We monitored her rash and eosinophils closely when re-initiating brentuximab. Providing the offending medication at a lowered do se via a 12 step desensitization protocol proved to be a success. Ev ery 8 weeks the patient flys to our center for trea tment. She is extremely grateful that we did not give up on her a nd voices this often. This was a difficult case goi ng against the standard of avoidance of this medication for fear o f DRESS. This patient received first line therapy, actually with this case the only therapy option that keeps her alive.

Case Title: Cutaneous vasculitis and exanthema: A late hypersen Summary and Lessons Learned: Case Description: A 27-year-old female used oral di menhydrinate and, after 14 days, developed a maculo papular rash that was slightly painful with areas of palpable pu rpura, affecting almost the entire abdomen and limb s. She also reported headache, nausea and fever. The complement ary evaluation revealed a high C-reactive protein o f 7 mg/dL, without other laboratory abnormalities (complete bl ood count; renal and anti nuclear antibody keratinocyte nuclei of the epidermis. The patien t was treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for one m onth. She was weaned gradually from prednisone after 2 months wit h complete regression of symptoms. An intradermal t est was performed with 0.03 mL of 0.1 mg/mL dimenhydrinate, which was negative after 20 minutes and after 6 ho urs, but positive only after 48 hours. Ten healthy volunteer s tested negative. Discussion: Dimenhydrinate is an H1 antihistamine ethanolamine, whose allergic reactions are rare. Th e reported delayed hypersensitivity reaction was sh own to be of mixed mechanism according to Gell and Coombs's clas sification, as the initial condition was characteri zed by exanthema and late intradermal test was positive only after 4 8h (type IV reaction) and skin biopsy was compatibl e with cutaneous vasculitis and immune complex deposition (type III reaction). There are no similar citations or standa rdization of cutaneous tests with dimenhydrinate in the literatu re. Final Comments: The evaluation of allergic reac tions to drugs is of great importance for etiological diagnosis. We desc ribe a case of exanthema and cutaneous vasculitis a s an adverse reaction to dimenhydrinate. Thus, intradermal testi ng may be a form of etiological confirmation in typ e III or IV hypersensitivity reactions to this drug. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 27-year-old single female patient was previously healthy, except for motion sickness and the use of 50 mg of oral dimenhydrinate 2 weeks before. She presented with a disseminated maculopapular rash, evolving with pur puric lesions on the trunk and limbs. She also reported headache, nausea and fever at admission. She denied addictio ns and had no previous history of drug reactions. Family history was not relevant to the case. The skin lesions did not improve with the administration of intravenous diphenhydramine. The diagnostic hypothesis of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to dimenhydrinate was raised. Thus, the patient was su bmitted to skin biopsy and laboratory tests and was administered oral corticosteroids. The patient was monitored dai ly by telephone and in weekly visits until total im provement of the clinical symptoms and total resolution in about one month. After the end of symptoms, an intradermal t est was performed with dimenhydrinate. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with a delayed hypersensi tivity reaction to dimenhydrinate, namely exanthema and vasculitis. Diagnostic skin tests were performed 3 months after the onset of the disease, after using prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for a month, gradually weaned over 2 mont hs. An intradermal test was performed with 0.03 mL of 0.1 mg/mL dimenhydrinate, which was negative after 20 m inutes and 6 hours, but positive after 48 hours. Th e complementary evaluation revealed a high C-reactive protein of 7 mg/dL, without other laboratory abnor antinuclear antibody of epidermis. The patient was treated with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for one month. Ten healthy volunteers tested negat ive. It was possible to establish an initial standardization fo r skin tests with dimenhydrinate in order to evalua te late hypersensitivity reactions. The patient evolved wit hout sequelae and her condition hasn't recurred. Sh e was oriented to exclude dimenhydrinate and to use other antiemetics . Dimenhydrinate is an H1 antihistamine ethanolamin e, whose allergic reactions are rare. The reported delayed h ypersensitivity reaction was shown to be of mixed m echanism, according to Gell and Coombs's classification, as t he initial condition was characterized by exanthema and late intradermal test was positive only after 48h (type IV reaction) and skin biopsy was compatible with cu taneous vasculitis and immune complex deposition (type III reaction). Therefore, intradermal testing may be a form of eti ological confirmation in type III or IV hypersensitivity rea ctions to dimenhydrinate.

This is a commonly prescribed antibiotic in the immunosuppressed pedia tric population. We describe the case of a 11-year old boy with cystic fibrosis who developed hemolysis on the 10th day of Piperacillin-Tazobactam during an admission for a pulmonary exacerbation. His hemoglobin dropped to 41 g/L and eventually improved after discontinuation of Pipera cillin- Tazobactam and administration of several red blood cell transfusions. The report serves to emphasize t he importance of recognizing DIIHA early in the course of hemolysis to avoid potential red blood transfusions in the im munosuppressed population. Physicians should be familiar with the most common medications associated with DIIHA as ce ssation of the medication may prevent life-threatening hemolysis. Patient Presentation and Testing: We present a boy with cystic fibrosis a nd pancreatic insufficiency who was admitted with ymptoms characteristic of a pulmonary exacerbation. In hosp ital, he received Piperacillin-Tazobactam IV, Cipro floxacin IV and Colistin. On Day 10 of admission, his hemoglobin dr opped significantly, reaching a nadir of 41g/L late r that day. He was treated with packed red blood cell transfusions on Day 10, 13, and 15. He was started on a 4-day cours e of Prednisone (2mg/kg/day) on Day 13, followed by subsequent wean ing. He continued to have fluctuating hemolysis dur ing this time, hemoglobin reaching a high of 78 g/L and 83 g/L on Day 10 and 13, post-transfusion. He did not have sy stemic symptoms in keeping with an anaphylactic reaction. Piperacil lin-Tazobactam was discontinued on Day 15 of admiss ion. He was switched over to Meropenem and continued with Cipro floxacin and Colistin. Following discontinuation of Piperacillin- Tazobactam, his hemoglobin increased to normal leve ls and he had no further hemolytic episodes during admission. Drug dependent antibodies studies were sent to a sp ecialized reference laboratory in Wisconsin on Day 18 which were reported positive to Zosyn (Piperacillin-Tazobactam dependent red cell antibodies in serum) and negati ve to Colistimethate dependent antibodies. Clinical suspicion of DIIHA and immediate cessatio n of the medication can be lifesaving. DIIHA typica lly presents as a hemolytic anemia occurring 6 days after initial dru g exposure. The severity of hemolysis can range fr om mild anemia to fatal hemolysis. The diagnosis requires a high inde x of suspicion and should be considered in any pati ent with unexplained hemolysis after drug administration. On ce a drug has induced a hemolytic episode, future a dministration of the agent is generally contraindicated. Our patient developed hemolysis on Day 10 after starting Piper acillin- Tazobactam. The direct Coombs test was positive and Piperacillin-Tazobactam dependent red cell antibod ies were present in serum. There was resolution following di scontinuation of Piperacillin-Tazobactam on Day 15, five days from onset of hemolysis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Diagnosis of DIIHA to Piperacillin-Tazobactam was m ade following positive results to drug dependent an tibodies to Piperacillin-Tazobactam and a positive direct Coomb s test. Our patient was advised to wear a Medic-Ale rt bracelet bearing \"DIIHA to Pip-Tazo\" and avoidance of Piper acillin-Tazobactam. The mechanisms and risk factors for the development of DIIHA are not well understood. It has not been proven as to why some patients develop antibodies against certai n medications, thus making hemolytic reactions diff icult to predict. Furthermore, it is not clear why only a subset of p atients with drug-induced red blood cell antibodies experience severe hemolytic reactions. There may also be a concern wi th other medications known to be cross-reactive wit h the drug in question. Recognition of DIIHA requires clinical vi gilance and close communication with blood banks ex perienced with the appropriate testing procedures, specifically dr ug dependent antibody studies. Further, many of the tests needed for an accurate diagnosis are performed only at special ized immuno-hematology reference laboratories thus requiring coordination between institutions to perform a comp lete work-up. This case report illustrates the importance of reco gnizing clinical signs of DIIHA and serologic testi ng diagnostic confirmation and prevention of possible life-threat ening hemolysis. Physicians should have a high inde x of suspicion for DIIHA in patients with unexplained hemolytic anemia who are taking medications, even those on long-ter m medications with no previous history.

Immun e mediated reactions are some of the rarest side ef fects of LMWH, among which, both immediate and delayed-type reactions were reported using the subcutaneous inje ctions. Delayed type hypersensitivity included circumscribe maculopapular exanthema, and acute generalized exanthema pustulosis. Few cases of imme diate type systemic reactions including anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with heparins and hep arinoids including enoxaparin, where an IgE mediate d mechanism has been proposed to be underlying cause proven by skin testing. Enoxaparin induced immediat e type hypersensitivity has been rarely reported and the e xact incidence is unclear. We present a case of a sixty nine year old male wit h type two Diabetes on hemodialysis who developed a ngioedema of the periorbital area, face, tongue, oral mucosa and larynx in less than twelve hours of receiving the first dose of subcutaneous enoxaparin requiring emergent intubati on and mechanical ventilation. Patient did not deve lop any skin rash, urticaria or hypotension. Patient had no prev ious history of angioedema and had no known drug al lergies. Patient had a right upper extremity DVT from complication o f a line placement for which he received therapeuti c dose of enoxaparin, 1mg/kg scheduled to be given every twel ve hours. Once intubated, patient was treated with intravenous antihistamines including diphenhydramine 25 mg ever y eight hours, famotidine 40 mg every twelve hours and prednisone 60 mg every day for the angioedema. Pati ent improved gradually but remained ventilator depe ndent after four days, at the time his discharge to a long term acute care facility (LTAC). Patient had no known personal or family history of anaphylaxis or angioedema. Bradykinin-induced angio edema was unlikely an angiotensin-conve rting enzyme inhibitor or Angiotensin including tryptase, C4, C1-INH and function, and C1 Q were all within normal limits making hereditary o r acquired angioedema unlikely. Patient had elevated CRP and E SR which was attributed to a possible pneumonia app arent on chest x-ray. The patient had no known account of re ceiving enoxaparin in the past and the onset of sym ptom of receiving this medication raised suspicion as the p robable cause of the angioedema. Due to patient hav ing end stage renal disease, the enoxaparin dosing raises concern for possible higher than anticipated level prompti ng to such severe angioedema resulting in respiratory failure. Patient Presentation and Testing: Presentation: A sixty nine year old African America n male presented to the hospital from a nursing hom e after found to have profound hypoglycemia and altered mental statu s. Pt had history of Insulin dependent type 2 Diabe tes Mellitus, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, Cer ebrovascular Accident with permanent lower extremit y contracture and seizure disorder. Pt required a central venous access one day two of admission which was attempted on his right arm but due to complications from the line placemen t, patient was found to have a deep venous thrombos is in this arm. Pt was subsequently scheduled to be given therapeut ic dose of Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every twelve hours. Pt developed angioedema involving his face, lips, t ongue, oral mucosa, and larynx in less than twelve hours after receiving the first dose of Enoxaparin requiring em ergent intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pt ha d no sign of anaphylaxis or other systemic reactions. Patient ha d no previous history of angioedema and had no know n allergies to any medications. He also had no known family histor y of angioedema. All other possible medication admi nistration, duration and onset of symptom as the cause of this angioedema were ruled out. Pt was also receiving L evetiracetam, which was continued as a prior to admission medicat ion. He was not being given any antibiotics. Testing: Patient had a negative tryptase level and workup for hereditary or acquired causes of angioed ema were ruled out including C4, C1-INH and C1-INH function, and C 1q were within normal limits. Interestingly, patien t had an elevated CRP level of 13.7 mg/dL and an ESR of 130 mm/hr, wi th concern for possible hospital acquired pneumonia . His complete blood count showed minimal leukocytosis without eos inophilia. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient appeared to have severe swelling of the per iorbital area, face, lips, tongue, and larynx. He h ad no urticaria, flushing, or hypotension. Pt was not on any angiote nsin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which ruled out the bradykinin-induced angioedema. After the initial ai rway management of acute angioedema related respira tory failure, patient was being given scheduled intravenous antih istamines including diphenhydramine 25 mg every eig ht hours, famitidine 40 mg every twelve hours and prednisone 60 mg every day. Patient's periorbital and facial s welling improved significantly but he required continuous mechanical for the next four days until getting transferred t o a long term acute care (LTAC) facility. Enoxaparin was immediately st opped after the first dose and Dilantin 100 mg ever y eight hours was substituted for Levetiracetam to rule out a potenti al culprit causing the angioedema. He was also star ted on empiric antibiotic coverage for possible hospital acquired pneumonia on day two of intubation. Pt continued to recover from his angioedema at the time of discharge, four days afte r initiating mechanical ventilation. A concern was raised regarding the appropriate use and dosing of the Enoxaparin du e to patient having ESRD on hemodialysis, potential ly augmenting the onset and severity of the angioedema. A follow up appointment with an allergist was recommended bu t unfortunately patient was not seen in follow up at our clinic. We believe this patient would have been benefited by conducting a skin test to confirm the most suspecte d diagnosis of Enoxaparin induced angioedema but du e to the patient's condition, this could not have been compl eted, posing a potential limitation in confirming t he diagnosis.

Enoxaparin induced skin lesions ma y vary from allergic reactions such as local erythema or e czema to urticaria or bullous hemorrhagic dermatos is[1,2]. We present a case of delayed hypersensitivity react ion due to subcutaneous sodium enoxaparin in a 65 y ear-old female patient, who presented, in the fifth day of treatm ent, well delineated eczematous plaques at the inj ection sites. It is important to diagnose hypersensitivity react ion induced by enoxaparin and to avoid using it in such cases. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 65-year-old female patient, presented in the Derm atology Department searching for a diagnose.She was previous hospitalised for a hip fracture and treated with s ubcutaneous sodium enoxaparin for five days. Her medical history revealed that the patient is di agnosed with osteoporosis, but refuses undergoing m edication treatment and has a 20 years history of arterial h ypertension under medication with Indapamidum . At the time of initial encounter, no history of al lergies. Laboratory examination: analysis within n ormal limits. A bone density study showed osteoporosis. Physical examination revealed well delineated eczem atous plaques at the injection sites [Pictures A; B ]. Skin prick tests were positive to enoxaparin undilu ted and using series of dilutions (1:100, 1:1.000, 1:10.000); dilutions were obtained using enoxaparin and aqua without fur ther additives. Lower concentrations with positive results proved a true allergic reaction, exluding false positive r esults [3]. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was included in a clinical follow-up re gistry and is going under regular 6 months surveill ance program. One very important lesson is learned from this case , relevant not only to the practice of allergy/imm unology: strict avoidance of all heparins is mandatory in such case s as presented. *Written informed consent for the publication of po tentially identifiable personal details of patient (gender, age, illness, location) was obtained. **In relation to this presentation, I declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

He tolera ted gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance\u00ae) during sev en previous MRIs. with gadobenate c onfirmed IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. GBCA avoid ance was alternative non-gadoli nium contrast agent and desensitization to GBCAs wa s unfeasible. Skin prick to macrocyclic agents , gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem\u00ae) and gadobutrol (G adavist\u00ae), were negative. The patient subsequently tolerated MRI br ain with intravenous gadoterate. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to GBCAs are r are. Linear ionic GBCAs, especially gadobenate, ar e more frequently associated with anaphylaxis than macrocyclic GBCAs. In patients with recurrent hypersensitivity reacti ons to GBCAs who cannot avoid them, there may be negative predictive value in immediate hypersensitivity skin testing, improving chances of selecting safe alternative GBCAs for future imag ing. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 26-year-old male with a left frontal lobe anaplas tic astrocytoma, status post resection followed by chemoradiation, and undergoing maintenance chemotherapy presented w ith diffuse urticaria and oropharyngeal pruritus an d throat tightness 30 seconds after intravenous gadobenate i nfusion during his ninth routine surveillance brain MRI, despite oral diphenhydramine and prednisone pretreatment. He req uired surveillance brain MRIs every 2 months and ha d tolerated seven previous MRIs with gadobenate.

Summary and Lessons Learned: We present the security results in the use of omali zumab in our hospital between October'04 to August' 16, in which 86 patients were treated and 6054 doses of omalizumab were administered. In our study, we not only analyze the anaphylactic reactions produced by omalizumab but also those pro duced by its excipients, particularly by polysorbate. Omalizumab was well tolerated in our hospital until July'16, when a patient with severe bronchial asth ma, was administered the first dose of omalizumab. After 30 minutes, the patient started with dry mouth feelin g, dizziness, nausea and an episode of vomiting, followed by dysp nea and coughing spells. Also, he presented a cutan eous V-neck erythema and edema of pharyngeal pillars was observ ed. Therefore, treatment for anaphylaxis was administer ed. After 4 hours, significant clinical improvement and hemodynamic stability was observed. Consequently, o malizumab was removed and the allergy study was per formed. The aim of this study is to highlight the security in the use of omalizumab by comparing the data obta ined in our study with the one published by the Omalizumab Joint Task Force(OJTF). For the allergy evaluation, skin prick test(SPT) an d intradermal test(IDT) with omalizumab in its comm ercial form and polysorbate were performed. IDT was positive for bo th. The patient started a new biological therapy with r eslizumab as it does not have polysorbate within it s excipients, being well tolerated and her asthma improved. Conclusions: -In our hospital, the incidence of omalizumab-induc ed anaphylaxis is 0.016%. -We report a probable caused by polysorbate, an excipient in omalizumab. -Polysorbate a very ubiquitous excipient, partic ularly used for injecton preparations, which would explain this reaction with the first dose of omalizumab. -Reslizumab is a good choice, among the biological treatments, for asthmatic patients allergic to poly sorbate. Patient Presentation and Testing: Our patient is a 49-year-old woman with a severe pe rsistent allergic asthma. She had had a prior react ion with an influenza vaccine without any atopic family history . The allergy study was performed taking into account the publications registered until now, SPT and IDT were performed with omalizumab and polysorbate: SPT was negative f or both, but IDT was positive for omalizumab at a c oncentration of 1/1000 and for polysorbate at 1/100. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: According to the medical history, the prior reactio n with an influenza vaccine and the skin test resul ts, we suggest a probable anaphylactic reaction caused by polysorbat e. As Reslizumab doesn\u00b4t have polysorbate on its excip ients, we started this therapy and our patient\u00b4s as thma significantly improved.

In rare cases, however, contrast reactio ns can present with delayed, immune-mediated sympto ms. We present a young woman who developed a delayed acnei form drug eruption following diagnostic cerebral an giography with iodinated contrast. With a successful readmini stration strategy, she underwent subsequent interve ntional her intracranial aneurysms. Case presentation: A 23-year-old woman with chronic migraines presented for evaluation of acute headac he of different character from her usual migraines. She underwent d iagnostic imaging with noncontrast CT head, then co ntrast- enhanced cerebral angiography which multip le intracranial aneurysms. She received iohexol con trast without premedications, despite having a history of erythema and red pruritic pinpoint papules followi ng iodinated contrast on two prior occasions. Five hours later, she developed diffuse pruritic erythema then hundre ds of pinpoint red pustules on her face, chest and back. Skin biopsies revealed perifollicular pustules with a mixed infl ammatory cell infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinoph ils, which suggested an acneiform drug eruption. He r clinical presentation and histologic findings were consisten t with iododerma, a rare drug eruption due to iodin e itself. She required subsequent repair of her intracranial aneu rysms and re-exposure to iohexol contrast. This was readministration strategy using is rare in present times owin g to the decline in popularity of topical iodine-co ntaining antiseptics. It is now reported to occur with exposure to iodina ted contrast media. Its proposed mechanisms include a T cell- mediated process, with risk factors including repea ted iodine exposure and delayed clearance of iodine .

She received iohexol contrast without prem edications, despite having a history of diffuse erythema and re d pruritic pinpoint papules following iodinated con trast on two prior occasions. Five hours later, she developed diffuse pruritic erythema then hundreds of pinpoint red pus tules on her face, chest and back. Skin biopsies revealed perifollicul ar pustules with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltra te of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils, which suggested an acn eiform drug eruption. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Although a diagnosis of acute generalized exanthema tous pustulosis was considered, her histologic find ings did not support this. The perifollicular distribution of pu stules revealed on histology favored an acneiform d rug eruption, and clinical history suggested a diagnosis of iododerma . The mixed inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils is also consistent with iododerma. Her cutaneous involvement responded remarkably well wit h treatment using a regimen of triamcinolone wet wraps, doxycyc line, and topical clindamycin. The clearance of her rash was maintained despite re-exposure to iohexol contrast for repair of her intracranial aneurysms. This was achieved using a readministration strategy with diphenhydramine, cetirizine, famotidine, montelukas t, and prednisone. Further follow up is planned in the fut ure, including investigation into predisposing fact ors which may be associated with her multiple vascular aneurysms.

Options include dietary restricti on which is helpful in about twenty five percent of cases or systemic ster oids which cannot be used long term due to side eff ects. Over time, we ultimately utilized a combination of milk avoida nce along with a novel approach to topical steroids targeting our patient's stomach and upper duodenum. This regimen and targeted therapy significantly reduced her clin ical symptoms and objective findings. Patient Presentation and Testing: We describe a six year old female with a history of mild atopic dermatitis and IgE mediated food aller gy to egg (ingested baked eggs) who presented to our Gastroenterology d ivision in November 2014 at four years of age with intermittent vomiting, thought to be related to constipation whi ch initially improved with polyethylene glycol. In December 2014, following influenza, she was seen in our emergency department with altered consciousness prompting lab oratory studies which revealed marked iron deficiency anemi a (8 g/dL), low total protein (4.3 g/dL), hypoalbum hypereosinophilia (3850). She underwent endo scopy/sigmoidoscopy in March 2015 while on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), revealing > 50 eosinophils/hpf in esophagus and dense eosinophilic infiltrate of her stomach. A video capsule endoscopy revealed multiple aphthous lesion s and small ulcerations throughout the jejunum and proximal ileum. In March 2015, she was seen in our Allergy d ivision while still having mild intermittent sympto ms. The decision made to remove milk from her diet. A repeat EGD in June 2015 revealed normalization of esophageal biop sy (8 eos/hpf), but both biopsies of the antrum and duodenum had ma rkedly increased eosinophils. Laboratory studies re mained abnormal. Her AEC at that time remained high at 280 0 with an albumin of 3.0 g/dL and a total protein o f 4.6 g/dL. She self-restricted peanut and was trialed on monteluka st. Her symptoms improved and her family wished to monitor her clinically, but growth became concern. A repeat EGD in September 2016 showed persistently elevated eos inophils in the antrum and her AEC rose to 4740. Elemental diet and systemic steroids were not acceptable options to t he family. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Despite therapy with a PPI, targeted food eliminati on and montelukast, our patient continued to have i ntermittent vomiting, new growth concerns and abnormal laborato ry studies. Due to the extent of her underlying dis ease and desire to avoid elemental diet as well as systemic steroid s, a unique use of multi-phasic swallowed steroid a dministration was trialed. As such the patient was instructed to take three capsules of budesonide (Entocort \u00ae) 3mg dail y alternating between ingestion of one capsule opened/two capsule s crushed and two capsules opened/one capsule crush ed (as the patient could not swallow the whole capsule). With this approach, it was thought that the delivery of different Entocort\u00ae forms would vary and their effects would target dif ferent mucosal areas. The crushed capsule would tar get the stomach earlier and more directly by bypassing the time and pH dependent release of the medication. The opened capsule would release medication more immediately into the upper intestine. A repeat EGD in January 2017 showed reso lution of eosinophilia in the stomach and duodenum. Her AEC d ecreased to 1030 and her albumin increased to 4.0 g /dL. By creating a regimen that maximized steroid effect on the mucosa involved, not only was improvement on t issue infiltrate and peripheral eosinophilia seen but clinically the patient experienced cessation of vomiting, abdomin al pain and she exhibited improved weight gain.

Her CBC had an absolu te eosinophil count of 11,500, and she was ultimately diagnosed w ith very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VE OIBD). As opposed to traditional inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD), patients who present with symptoms before 6 y ears of age are more likely to possess monogenic defects. Peripher al blood eosinophilia in association with VEOIBD ha s been described in children older than 4.5 years, and local eosinop hilic inflammatory infiltrates are known to occur i n conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease. Additionally, eosino philia is well described in certain immune disorder s. However, reports of peripheral eosinophilia in infants with IBD are scarce. Herein we describe a patient with peripheral eosinophilia and VEOIBD possessing a heterozygous c .442G>C (p.E148Q) variant in the MEFV. No additiona l variants were found in MEFV or 206 other genes associated wi th immunodeficiency. Homozygous and compound hetero zygous with VEOIBD a ssociated with familial Mediterranean fever (includ ing an individual with eosinophilic colitis). However, thi s variant is found in many asymptomatic individuals and is considered very low penetrance. In the case presented, the va riant may be disease-modifying rather than causativ e. Ultimately, this case highlights that peripheral eosinophilia m ay be associated with infantile VEOIBD and that cer tain genetic variants may result in atypical presentations. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 5 week old female presented with daily hematochez ia for 2 weeks. Her history was significant for a prenatal ultrasound showing an intraabdominal mass. Explora tory laparotomy on day 2 of life revealed an area o f intestinal ischemia at the ileocecal junction, thought to be d ue to volvulus. Seventy-two centimeters of small b owel were resected, and an end-to-end anastomosis was created . She slowly returned to breast milk supplemented with soy-based formula. A CBC with differential at that time was normal. Ten days after discharge, she began to hav e about 10 loose stools per day streaked with bright red blood. She was placed on an amino acid-based formula by her g astroenterologist due to concern for milk protein allergy. She contin ued to have multiple loose, bloody stools each day. A repeat CBC from gastroenterology clinic showed a total WBC cou nt of 35.3 x 10e9/L and an absolute eosinophil coun t (AEC) of 11,500, and she was admitted for further evaluation . Bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry showed no signs of malignant disease. An elevated CD4 count of 6,572 c ells/mm3 was noted, and T-cell clonality testing re vealed a monoclonal population of T-cells with a prominent p eak in the T beta 1 region. Fluorescence in situ h ybridization (FISH) assays for translocation associated with myeloid hy pereosinophilic syndrome were negative, as was eval uation for parasites. IgE level was normal, and C-reactive pr otein was undetectable. She underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy in rectum and sigmoid colon macroscopically consistent with i nflammatory bowel disease. There were no signs ind icating loss of anastomotic integrity. Biopsies revealed focal agg regates of eosinophils in the duodenum with preserv ed villous architecture. In colon, dense eosinophilic inf iltration of the lamina propria was noted along h reactive crypt epithelium. Esophageal biopsies were normal. Stool studies demonstrated an elevated fecal calprotecti n. Given her age and clinical findings, she was diagnosed with VEOIB D. A focused sequencing panel targeting 207 genes associated with immunodeficiency revealed a heterozygous variant in MEFV (C.442G>C; p.E148Q). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our patient was worked up for hypereosinophilia and hematochezia which led to the diagnosis of very ea rly onset inflammatory bowel disease with an inflammatory gen e panel demonstrating a mutation of the MEFV gene. Multi-system evaluation for end organ damage in the setti ng of peripheral eosinophilia was negative apart fr om gastrointestinal involvement (and sparing the esoph agus). Once malignancy was ruled out, the patient w as started on IV methylprednisolone. Her dose was 1mg/kg/day initial ly, but was increased to 2mg/kg/day when her AEC pl ateaued around 6,000. At this dose, her AEC decreased furt her, though she continued to have frequent bloody s tools ultimately requiring a transfusion. The patient was transitio ned to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 2 weeks while continuing on corticosteroids, and sulfasalazine and omeprazole w ere started. Hematochezia gradually resolved while on TPN. After 14 days, she restarted oral feeds with an amino aci d-based formula. No significant recurrence of her hematochezia was noted. She was discharged on an oral prednisolone taper with daily sulfasalazine and omeprazole and c lose outpatient follow-up.

The pat ient had been recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and psych osis, which were both presumed to be steroid-i nduced and were treated with calcium/cholecalciferol and olanza pine (10mg daily), respectively. Furthermore, she had poor compliance with asthma treatment, due to her altered mental status, resulting in acute asth ma exacerbations. Following a thorough clinical, imaging and lab oratory diagnostic testing, for the exclusion of secondary and clonal causes of peripheral blood hypereosinophilia a nd the confirmation of bronchial asthma diagn osis, prednisolone administration was discontinued, by gradual red uction of dosage over a period of 6 weeks, and mepolizumab treatment (100mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks) was initiated. A marked reduction (wit h normalization) of eosinophils blood count was observed (272/ L as compared to 1833/L) within two weeks aft er the first mepolizumab injection, and remained within the n ormal range during a treatment period of 3 m onths. Asthma symptoms remained well-controlled as well -with no acute exacerbations- throughout the same t ime period. No mepolizumab-associated side effects were noted. LESSONS LEARNED: Mepolizumab was both effective and well-tolerated as a second-line corticoste roid-sparing agent in our patient, leading to adequate cont rol of asthma symptoms and resolution of i diopathic hypereosinophilia. Patients with steroid-refracto ry asthma (or steroid-induced complications, as in our reported case) and other eosinophilic-related comorbidit ies may represent excellent candidates for me polizumab treatment. Patient Presentation and Testing: PATIENT PRESENTATION: At the time of her initia l presentation to our department, the patient had acute exacerbations of asthma, and steroid-induced psych osis and osteoporosis, resulting from chronic co rticosteroid treatment for idiopathic hypereosinophilia. TESTING: Clinical history and physical examinat ion and thorough diagnostic testing (i.e. detail ed imaging and laboratory studies, including, but not limited to, the following: serological studies and serum trypta se levels, chest x-ray, thoracic and abdominal CT, electrocardiogram and ec hocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic studies, in vitro and in vivo allergy t esting) for the exclusion of secondary and c lonal causes of peripheral blood hypereosinophilia and evaluati on of pulmonary function/asthma status were pe rformed. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Following detailed diagnostic evaluation/testing of our patient, the diagnosis of idiopathic hypereo sinophilia was confirmed. Prednisolone administration was disco ntinued, by gradual reduction of dosage over a period of 6 weeks, and mepolizumab treatment (100mg by subcut aneous injection every 4 weeks) was initiated. A marked reduction (with normalization) of eosinophils b lood count was observed (272/L as compared to 1833/L) within two weeks after the first mepolizumab injectio n, and remained within the normal range during a treatment and follow-up period of 3 months. Throughout the same time period, asthma symptoms remained well -controlled and no mepolizumab-associated side effects were not ed.

EGPA rarely presents with acute pol yneuropathy resembling Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS ). A 51-year- old female patient with a history of asthma, was di agnosed as GBS subtype according to neurologic symp toms and the results of nerve conduction study. Although treatme nt of GBS, painful motor weakness persisted. Her bl ood test had marked eosinophilia, positive response to anti-neut rophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Considering the hist ory of asthma, sinusitis and blood test results, we suspected EGPA -associated polyneuropathy and started steroid trea tment. Her symptoms and eosinophilia improved rapidly. We iden tified a case of EGPA with acute polyneuropathy mim ic GBS. These should be differentiated because of different treatment strategies. Early diagnosis and prompt t reatment help to achieve a good outcome. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 51-year-old female patient with a history of asth ma, suddenly developed bilateral lower extremity pa resthesia that progressed to asymmetric ascending paralysis within 10 days of onset. Nerve conduction study results w ere compatible with acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy, consist ent with a GBS subtype. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: A clinical and a neurophysiological diagnosis of GB S was made, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobuli ns were administered. However, the patient's painful motor weakness persisted. Furthermore, she had newly deve loped skin lesions on her back, face, and arms. Her blood test revealed marked eosinophilia (>60%). In addition, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) were radiographic image showed bilate ral maxillary sinusitis. Considering the history of asthma, we su spected EGPA-associated polyneuropathy and started steroid treatment. The patient's strength and eosinophilia improved rapidly and dramatically.

DeShazo, MD University of Mississippi Medical Center Case Title: A Masquerading Case of Eosinophilia Summary and Lessons Learned: This case describes a 22yo Caucasian female with a history of mild asthma transferred to our facility for concern for worsening rash with peripheral eosinophilia. Our al lergy service was consulted for concern for a possi ble drug reaction. She was previously treated with Vancomycin and ceft riazone and several weeks into course developed per ipheral eosinophilia and rash concerning for hypersensitivi ty reaction. She was transitioned to alternative an tibiotic with continued progression of rash and edema to face, tr unk, and extremities as well as mild increase in cr eatinine. Transaminases remained normal. The clinical diagnos is of DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and sy stemic symptoms) was confirmed using European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) scori ng system with a score of 7(>6 is defined as definite DRESS). She continued to have progression of non-painful, pruritic rash and an extensive evaluation for sepsis was Bron choscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage revealed eo sinophils without other abnormalities. She developed respirat ory failure and was subsequently intubated. A repea t bronchoscopy with biopsy showed histopathologic findings consist ent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis. This patien t's history demonstrates the necessity of an extraordinarily la rge differential diagnosis in patients with eosinop hilia and clinical symptoms. On the basis of our experience with this patient and a single other report with similar find ings, we suggest that patients with pulmonary symptoms associated wi th DRESS may have a pulmonary vasculitic syndrome i nduced by eosinophil activation from the drug hypersensitivit y reaction associated with DRESS. Patient Presentation and Testing: On initial presentation, patient had recently been treated with multiple courses of different antibiot ics and developed diffuse erythematous rash and edema with eosinophil ia and elevated creatinine above baseline. We obtai ned previous outside hospital records for detailed medication ad ministration history to determine temporal relation of symptoms starting 2-3 weeks after change in antibiotic. We m onitored eosinophil count as well as hepatic panel for systemic symptoms which is standard of care for DRESS. Pulmo nology made the decision to repeat bronchoscopy for tissue biopsy following respiratory failure which identifi ed pathologic diagnosis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The clinical course was consistent with DRESS but h er respiratory failure appears related to a second condition, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, the diagnosis of whi ch would have been missed without lung biopsy. Trea tment with systemic corticosteroids resulted in rapid improvem ent in eosinophilia, rash and respiratory status. R epeat imaging demonstrated resolution of previous consolidation. She was discharged on a long steroid taper and upon follow-up three months later, continued to show improvement w ith no further rash or other systemic symptoms.

Case Title: Eosinophilic Esophagitis after Oral Immunotherapy: have all patients improved? Summary and Lessons Learned: WCL, male, 9 yo, presented confirmed cow milk aller gy (CMA) since 7 months old with classical IgE medi ated features including anaphylaxis. At six years old the patient persisted with allergic symptoms and a desensitiza tion protocol was proposed. Before beginning the process, an esophago gastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed with normal results. After three months of protocol, recurrent vomiting and nausea occurred which demanded reduction of dai ly milk intake. As patient did not improve, a new EGD was performed and clear signals of EoE were observed (macroscopi cally and microscopically). Desensitization was stopped and p roper clinical treatment was initiated (corticoster oids and proton pump inhibitors - PPI). Despite an initial improvem ent (new EGD without eosinophils at microscopy), af ter other 3 months patient presented signs of EoE. Other food e xclusions were proposed - soy and egg -, a new EGD was performed at 8 weeks showing rare eosinophils in the proximal esophagus and 25 eosinophils/hpf in the distal eso phagus. We performed impedance and pH testing with normal resu lts. Although EoE is a referred complication in IOT prot ocols, the majority of patients presented reversibl e disease. It is important to be alert to a more persistent disease and consider if it there is a causal relation betwe en IOT and EoE or if severe food allergies consist a risk factor for thi s disease. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient referred to our service at the age of 2 and presented confirmed CMA, with history of hives and vomiting at 7 months old after contact with infant formula. His p arents avoided cow milk protein from the diet but a ccidental exposures occurred occasionally reproducing symptom s. IgE to casein was 56 KU/L, beta-lactoglobulin 20 KU/L and alpha-lactalbumin 17 KU/L. His past medical history was significant for allergic rhinitis and asthma. At 6 years old he persisted with CMA, therefore we proposed oral immu notherapy (IOT). Before beginning the process, an EGD was performed with normal results. After 3 months, the patient started vomiting once a day everyday, deman ding reduction of daily milk intake. We conducted an EGD since evi dence suggested gastric complications due to IOT. N ew EGD showed linear furrows and strictures, with 20 eosinophil/h pf, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. Diagnosis, and Patient Outcomes: Patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and was advised to completely discontinue his OIT, we prescribed PPI and swallowed glucocorticoid (Budesonide 1000 m cg / day) for 12 weeks. Repeated EGD appeared norma l macroscopically and microscopically with non-specif ic esophagitis without eosinophils. We suspended dr ug treatment and maintained dairy-free diet. After 3 months, EGD was repeated, again showing esophagus with longitu dinal mucosa, in distal Due to relapse of EoE we reintroduced swallowed glucocorticoid for another 6 months. Patient was asymptomatic in this period and we gradually reduced swallowed glucocorticoid, 200mcg per week, until complete suspension. After 3 months without the use of swallowed glucocorticoid, a new EGD showed l inear furrows and fibrin specks throughout the esop hagus, with eosinophils/hpf in proximal esophagus and 50 eo sinophils/hpf in the distal. The patient was advise d to continued avoiding cow milk and started a trial of a soy and egg-free diet. New EGD was repeated 8 weeks later a nd showed rare eosinophils in the proximal esophagus and 25 eosino phils/hpf in the distal esophagus. We conducted an impedance and a pH testing with normal results.

Lobo, MD (Yale University School of Medi cine) Case Title: Resolution of Eosinophilia with Ibrutinib for Chron ic Lymphocytic Leukemia Summary and Lessons Learned: A 61-year-old gentleman with history of headaches a nd emphysema presented with scalp pruritus followin g botulinum toxin injections for headaches and was found to hav e eosinophilia (13%; normal (N): 0-5%) and N: Infectious disease evaluation for eosinophi lia, including stool ova and parasites, hepatitis B and C (HBV and HCV), HIV, TB, and strongyloides, were all negative. All ergy testing by ImmunoCAP showed no significant amount of IgE again st individual environmental allergens. Screening fo r autoimmune conditions, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis wit h polyangiitis with ANCA and compliment levels, was normal. FIP1L1- PDGFRA mutation testing was negative. C-kit was nor mal, suggesting no intrinsic issues with mast cells . Peripheral blood flow cytometry demonstrated a monoclonal B cell lym phoproliferative disease. Imaging at the time of pr esentation was only notable for a non-enlarged spleen with small i ll-defined hypodensities. His clinical presentation was thought to be consistent with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Th erapy was not initiated. After one year of observat ion, he developed night sweats, fatigue, and cervical lymphadenopathy . A PET scan demonstrated new hypermetabolic bilate ral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and lymph node and bone marrow biopsies were consistent with chro nic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). He was started on ibrut inib for CLL. His constitutional symptoms resolved, and eosinophilia and elevated IgE have declined significantly since starting therapy. When evaluating a new patient, it is important to m aintain a broad differential diagnosis based upon a patient's history and physical exam. Flow cytometry is an important p art of the work-up for eosinophilia. A clonal B-cel l population and CLL are rare causes of elevated eosinophil and IgE levels that must be considered when evaluating pati ents with a severe eosinophilia of unknown etiology. The resolution of his eosinophilia and elevated IgE after starting t herapy with ibrutinib suggests that they were part of a B-cell-induced Th 2 response. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient was a 61-year-old male with history of emphysema and headaches who presented for evaluatio n of elevated IgE (15,513 975; N : 15-500 cells/microliter). The patient began to receive bot ulinum toxin injections in his scalp every 3 months in the year preceding his evaluation for his eosinophilia for s evere chronic migraine headaches. While receiving b otulinum toxin therapy, he developed pruritic papules on his scalp at the injection sites. His injections were stoppe d, but his symptoms persisted. He was evaluated by dermatology and trea ted with antihistamines and topical clindamycin, wh ich failed to control his symptoms. Initial testing identified eo sinophilia and elevated IgE level, and he was refer red to an allergy and immunology clinic. He did not have any symptoms apa rt from scalp pruritus at his first clinic visit. His laboratory evaluation included rechecking his I gE and CBC, which confirmed persistently elevated l evels. As the underlying etiology remained unclear from his histo ry and physical exam, a broad laboratory work-up wa s undertaken to identify the cause of his eosinophilia. In order to determine if there was an infectious etiology behi nd his condition, HIV, HBV, difficile, and strongyloides IgG wer e checked, and all tests returned negative. ImmunoCAP testing was perf ormed and was unrevealing for any allergic disease. His immune system was evaluated by IgG subclasses, IgM, IgA, F IP1L1-PDGFRA mutation, and C-kit mutation testing, which were all normal. An ANA, ANCA, C3, and C4 levels were checke d to determine the presence of an autoimmune condit ion, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Howe ver, all his studies returned normal. A peripheral blood flow cytometry was performed and identified a monoclonal B cell population. T-cell gene rearrangement studi es were performed and did not identify any monoclonal T-cel l populations. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient underwent a thorough evaluation of his immune system, as well as investigation for fungal and parasitic causes of his symptoms and laboratory abnormalities . No atopic disease was identified. The only abnorm ality identified was a monoclonal B cell population on flow cytometr y. The patient was referred to hematology for evaluati on of his B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. As t he patient had no significant symptoms, he was initially observed. Ho wever, he developed night sweats, fatigue, and cerv ical lymphadenopathy over the following year. A PET scan was performed and demonstrated new hypermetabolic bilateral cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and l ymph node and bone marrow biopsies were consistent with CLL. Ibrutinib therapy was initiated for treatment of hi s CLL. The patient's constitutional symptoms and eosinophi lia resolved with ibrutinib therapy, while his IgE level significantly decreased. He continues to be followed by hematolog y and receives ibrutinib 420 mg daily. The patient' s response to therapy suggests that his B cell CLL was the source of Th2 cytokines that caused his eosinophilia and massive production of non-specific IgE. Lymphoproliferative disorders must be included in the differential diagnosis of e osinophilia of unknown etiology.

Patients with CEP typic ally present with gradual onset of cough and progre ssive shortness of breath over several months. Our patient presented w ith a 4-month history of cough and respiratory symp toms and had peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) e osinophilia. Chest radiographs revealed extensive i nfiltrations. Her CEP diagnosis was made after other causes of eosino philic lung disease were excluded. She had a relaps e when oral steroids were discontinued. Mepolizumab treatment l ed to excellent clinical response. We learned several lessons: Firstly, it is importan t to broaden differential diagnoses to include comm on and uncommon conditions. Secondly, CEP should be considered in the different ial diagnosis of patients presenting with thick cas t sputum production. Thirdly, we learned about challenges in the treatme nt of CEP. Lastly, mepolizumab can be considered an adjunct th erapy in CEP patients who have frequent relapses or are steroid- dependent Patient Presentation and Testing: A 20-year-old female with history of asthma, enviro nmental allergies, and eosinophilic esophagitis pre sented with productive cough and progressive shortness of breat h for 4 months. Expectorated sputum whitish- yellowish casts. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronch odilator failed to improve symptoms or FEV1. White blood cell count (25,000/mm3), absolute eosinophil count (10,750/mm3 [43%]), and IgE level (1,122 IU/mL) were CT, there were opacities, predomin antly in the upper lobes. Pathologic examination the casts retrieved during bronchoscopy revealed dense eosino phils and numerous Charcot-Leyden crystals. Blood, sputum, BAL, and stool specimens were negative for microorganism s. Extensive evaluation, including bone marrow exam ination, was used to determine the cause of eosinophilia. The di agnosis of CEP was made following negative evaluati on for environmental or drug allergies, infections, parasi tic infestations, hypereosinophilic syndrome, polyangiitis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Initiation of empiric treatment with antibiotic, an thelminthic agent, and inhaled and systemic cortico steroids markedly improved respiratory symptoms. Relapse occurred whe n prednisone was stopped. Prednisone was restarted and continued for 6 months; her lowest AEC was 1,224/mm 3. Ten months after the initial presentation, chest CT identified a new area of impaction in the bronchus with distal b ronchiectasis. Mucinous plugs made of eosinophilic materials persisted in the bronchi. Within one month of start ing mepolizumab injections, her spirometry paramete rs improved and she no longer experienced cough or expectorated thick casts. Over the next year of mepolizumab tre atment, her respiratory symptoms remained stable, with no exace rbation or prednisone use. Submission Number: 244 Mepoliz umab Summary and Lessons Learned: Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) is characterized b y prolonged eosinophilia leading to damage of vario us organs. The two variants of HES are myeloproliferative and lymp hocytic hypereosinophilic syndrome (L-HES). L-HES i s by detection of a T-cell clone typically associated wi th increased expression of IL-5 responsible for pro duction eosinophilia and the toxic effects of their products. The standa rd of therapy is corticosteroids but studies sugges t that the L-HES is inherently less susceptible to respond to steroids which raises the need for emphasis on targeted ther apy such as IL-5 inhibitors. We present a case of successful treatme nt of L-HES with Mepolizumab. Treatment of the L-H ES with mepolizumab should be strongly considered to provid e an effective targeted, steroid-sparing treatment that aims at reducing the morbidity from long-term steroid use i n HES. Patient Presentation and Testing: An otherwise healthy 65 year old male, with a past medical history of childhood asthma, presented to t he ER with episodes of shortness of breath and cough. He was t reated for asthma exacerbation and was discharged. Patient subsequently presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever, found to have a SpO2 of 90. Work up revealed an absolute eosinophil count o f 15,000, and bilateral consolidation on chest x-ra y. He was treated for bacterial pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. Fu rther work up of eosinophilia was negative , elevated tryptase, stool for ova/parasites, and Strongyloide s. Patient was found to have a T cell clone and a n egative FIP1L1- PDGFR alpha by FISH leading to the diagnosis of lym phocytic variant of HES. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient had ongoing symptoms of shortness of breath and cough for which he required maintenance doses of prednisone. He was then trialed on mepolizumab with which he showed marked clinical improvement. The p atient was able to be tapered off of steroids in three months time.

It presents with a constellation of upper gastrointest inal symptoms and is diagnosed with demonstration o f > 15 eosinophils/high powered field (hpf) on esophageal biopsy. Resolution of EoE presents a larger challe nge for clinicians given the lack of standardization of pathology repo rting. We present a case of EoE in which despite pr esence of > 20 eosinophils/hpf the patient reported marked improve ments and standardization of pathology reporting wo uld have beneficial for tracking the patient's clinical cond ition. Patient Presentation and Testing: 47 year old man from Colombia who presented initial ly to the allergy clinic for evaluation of food all ergies following an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed white pla ques in the upper and middle third of esophagus; an d tissue biopsy from both sites showed > 25 eosinophils/hpf with eo sinophilic micro-abscesses. Allergy skin testing a nd immunocaps were negative. He was started on omeprazole twice d aily and due to patient preference, only a 3-food e limination diet of dairy, soy and nuts. After 7 weeks of eliminati on diet, repeat endoscopy showed endoscopic improve ment, but ongoing tissue infiltration of eosinophils with > 2 5 eosinophils/hpf. Given the persistence of tissue eosinophil infiltration, oral viscous budesonide (OVB) was add ed to his 3-food elimination diet. This resulted i n significant improvement of patient symptoms. Repeat endoscopy a gain revealed normal appearing esophagus, but the t issue infiltration with > 20 Eosinophils/hpf persisted. E osinophil micro abscesses were now rare. At this po int we reviewed the pathology from the three endoscopies. We found that biopsies from the first endoscopy had 180 eosinoph ils/hpf, the second 78 eosinophils/hpf and the third 22 eosinoph ils/hpf. We inferred that the 3-food elimination di et had 56% reduction in tissue eosinophil infiltration, and OV B resulted in a further 31% reduction. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This case brings to light the need for standardizat ion of reporting eosinophils in initial and subsequ ent endoscopic reports. Our patient despite having persistence of eosinophils had clinical improvement and resolution of plaques on the gross appearance of the esophagus. We propose all p athology reports for patients with EoE include an a bsolute number of eosinophils/hpf versus the currently reporting c utoff of > 15. This method of reporting would help better define the pathologic improvement along with the clinical as t herapies are being adjusted and added. Submission Number: 50 Poster Number: 76 Keyword: Food Allergy Primary Author Name: Melanie Conway, MD, FRCPC Primary Author Institution: The Hospital for Sick Children / The University of Toronto Additional Authors: Douglas Mack, MD, FRCPC Case Title: Pomegranate anaphylaxis in a Canadian adolescent Summary and Lessons Learned: RATIONALE: Pomegranate comes from the tree Punica granatum. Ig E-mediated allergy to pomegranate is very rare, tho ugh has been reported in Mediterranean countries. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first case of pomegr anate allergy in North America. Additionally, it is the first case t o date of pomegranate allergy in the absence of all ergy to other fruits, peanuts and/or tree nuts. METHODS: Skin prick testing to inhalant aeroallergens and pr ick-by-prick testing to fresh pomegranate was perfo rmed. RESULTS: A 15-year-old Canadian girl was referred to our all ergy clinic following an anaphylactic reaction to p omegranate. She had eaten pomegranate several times in the past with no reaction. However, on that particular morning, she ate a whole pomegranate on its own. Twenty minutes later, she r eported an itchy throat. Within minutes, her sympto ms escalated to include diffuse urticaria, difficulty breathing, wheezing and significant abdominal discomfort. Since that incident, the patient avoided pomegranat e; however, she continued to eat nuts and other fre sh fruits with no concerns, including peaches. She denied any history of oral allergy syndrome. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Skin prick testing was positive for f resh pomegranate at 7x7mm and to alternaria, trees, grass, weed mix, ragweed and cat. The patient was diagnosed with a pomegranate allerg y. Strict avoidance was recommended and she was pre scribed an epinephrine autoinjector. CONCLUSIONS: There are approximately fifteen cases of pomegranat e allergy in the medical literature, and all occurr ed in Mediterranean countries, including Spain, Italy and Turkey. The reason for this geographic pattern is unclear, though it may be because pomegranate is widely cultivated in the Mediterranean. Like our patient, many of these patients had a history of pollen allergy. However, unlike our pati ent, each of these patients had additional food all ergy or oral allergy syndrome with other fruits, most notably peaches, p eanuts and/or tree nuts. Based on immunoblotting st udies in which pomegranate extract is incubated with patient sera, several protein allergens have been identified. Th is includes: one of 29 kDA, two lipid transfer proteins (LTP), and path ogenesis-related protein 4 (PR-4). In most cases, t he LTP was implicated for the cross-reactivity between pomegra nate and other fruits, nuts and pollens. Unfortunat ely, we did not have the means to perform immunoblotting on our pat ient, but should further cases arise in North Ameri ca, this would be worthwhile to pursue. In conclusion, pomegranate allergy can occur outsid e of the Mediterranean and can occur in the absence of other food allergies. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 15-year-old Canadian girl was referred to our all ergy clinic in Burlington, Ontario, following an an aphylactic reaction to pomegranate. This patient was previously healthy, e xcept for a history of seasonal allergies in the sp ring and summer. She had eaten pomegranate several times in the past with no reaction. However, on that particular morn ing, she ate a whole pomegranate on its own. Twenty minutes later, she reported an itchy throat. Within minutes, her symptoms escalated to include diffuse urticaria, difficulty breathing, wheezing and significant abdominal disco mfort. She took an antihistamine, which helped to improve her symptoms , and was then seen in the emergency department but epinephrine was not administered. Since that incident, the patient avoided pomegranat e; however, she continued to eat peanuts, tree nuts and other fresh fruits with no concerns, including peaches. She den ied any history of oral allergy syndrome. Her physi cal examination was unremarkable. We performed prick-by-prick testi ng to fresh pomegranate, which was positive at 7x7m m. Given her history of seasonal allergies and known cross-react ivity between pomegranate and pollens, we also perf ormed prick testing for inhalant aeroallergens, which were posi tive for alternaria, trees, grass, weed mix, ragwee d and cat. Unfortunately, there is no specific IgE test availa ble for pomegranate and therefore, this could not b e ordered. We purposely did not perform skin prick testing to other fruits, peanuts or tree nuts, because she was eating these foods regularly with no symptoms. We felt that performing additional skin prick testing to those foods could result in false positive results, perhaps leading to inappropriate avoidance of foods that she was clinically tolerati ng. As this patient was seen in a community clinic, unfortunately, we d id not have the means to perform immunoblotting stu dies to determine which specific protein allergen she had r eacted to within the pomegranate. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with a pomegranate allerg y based on a clear history of anaphylaxis to pomegr anate in the absence of confounding factors, given that she had not eaten any other foods that day. The diagnosis w as confirmed via positive prick-by-prick testing to fresh pomegranat e, as described above. She was also diagnosed with perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis to alternaria, trees, gr ass, ragweed and cat. For the pomegranate allergy, we advised strict avoi dance of pomegranate. We also prescribed an epineph rine autoinjector and counselled the patient regarding i ndications and proper use. For her allergic rhiniti s, allergen immunotherapy was offered but the patient declined. Instead, we discussed allergen avoidance measures and prescribed an intranasal steroid spray, antihistami ne eye drops and an oral antihistamine. The patient continues to avoid pomegranate and has been clinically well since our last clinic visit.

PATRICIA L\u00d3PEZ- DE LOS SANTOS, MD, RAM\u00d3N Y CAJAL UN IVERSITY HOSPITAL. Case induced urticaria with pa nallergen sensitization (Lipid transfer protein) an d alcohol cofactors. Summary and Lessons Learned: Exercise induced anaphylaxis is a potentially fatal clinical syndrome in which anaphylaxis is triggere d by mild to vigorous exercise. When food is involved as a cofactor, the condition is called food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). Mild physical activity can trigger severe systemic reactions and some patients experience mil d-moderate systemic allergic reactions with exercise, dependen t on food ingestion. These milder reactions have be en recently reported as food dependent exercise-induced urticar ia, both associated with lipid transfer protein (LT P) and with wheat. Diagnosis is highly dependent on a thorough clinica l history including a detailed description of all f ood ingested before and after the physical activity that trigered the a naphylactic reaction and the use a combination of s kin prick tests, prick to prick tests to allergens chosen according to the clinical history and in vitro tests. Challenge tests are needed to provide a definite di agnosis but false-negative results can occur and fo od-exercise challenges fail to confirm diagnosis in up to 30% o f patients. False negative can be explained by the unpredictabi lity of FDEIA, as it can occur during exercise of d ifferent intensities and other cofactors include stress, drugs (anti-inf lammatories), menstruation and weather. To report the case of a 32-year-old female with a p revious diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome with nut , hazelnut, peanut, kiwi and pineapple. Palpebral bilateral and lips an gioedema with unpeeled apple. She didn't have rhini tis or asthma. The first episode was 3 months ago, urticaria sympt oms develop mostly within 10 minutes from the onset of physical activity. The patient noticed pruritus in ears, on the scalp, she developed generalized urticaria, and experienced palpebral bilateral angioedema and flushing face. N o respiratory nor gastrointestinal symptoms. She di dn\u00b4t require medical attention. The symptoms resolved 2 hours la ter. She had eaten 4 hours beforehand bread with meat, b eer and nachos with guacamole. She had menstruation in that moment. No infections. No co-administration of drug s. No stress. Then, she ate these foods without exe rcise and she didn't have symptoms. 2 days later, during physical activity (running) sh e had the same symptoms. She had eaten 2 hours befo rehand milk with toast with butter and strawberry jam. She didn\u00b4t re quire medical attention. Then, she ate these foods without exercise and she didn\u00b4t have symptoms. And she had practiced exercise without problems wit hout food intake. The outcome of this case is food-dependent exercise -induced urticaria with panallergen sensitization ( LTP) and alcohol cofactors at the first episode but not in the secon d. Patient Presentation and Testing: To report the case of a 32- year- old female with a previous diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome with n ut, hazelnut, peanut, kiwi and pineapple. Palpebral bilateral and lips angioedema with unpeeled apple. She didn\u00b4t ha ve rhinitis or asthma. She didn\u00b4t have other medical or surgical history. She doesn\u00b4t take any usual treatment. She has had two episodes of exercise- induced urtic aria with concomitant food and alcohol intake: The first episode was 3 months ago, 4 hours after h ad eaten bread with meat, one beer and nachos with guacamole. She had menstruation in that moment. The second time she ate 2 hours beforehand milk wit h toast with butter and strawberry jam. She didn\u00b4t drink alcohol in this episode. Tests performed in that time: - Skin prick tests were positive against house dust mite, pollen (plane and cynodon) and Lipid Transfe r Protein (LTP). - Skin prick test were positive against mix of nuts , chestnut, peanut, hazelnut, almond, peach, apple, kiwi, lentil, rice, prick by prick of strawberry jam and prick by prick of guacamole. - Skin prick testing were negative for fungus, cat and dog dander, other pollen, profilin, polcalcin. - Skin prick testing was negative for other commerc ial food extracts. - Routine blood test without alterations. Total IgE : 51 KU/l. Tryptase 1,96 KU/l. - Specific- IgE (sIgE) were positive for nut, kiwi, strawberry, peanut, rice, almond, hazelnut, Cor a8 , Ara h9, Jug r3 and pru p3 and were negative for Tri a19, Tri a14. - Exercise test was negative without eating any foo d. We have performed all these tests because it is nec essary to know foods to which she have allergy and to know if the patient had exercise- induced anaphylaxis. We didn\u00b4t do an oral challenge with the suspected f ood followed by physical exercise because the patie nt didn\u00b4t consent the test and false- negative results can occur. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis is exercise- induced urticaria with l ipid transfer protein (LTP) and alcohol cofactors. The patient had food- dependent exercise- induced u rticaria because she didn\u00b4t suffer all the symptoms of anaphylaxis and she didn\u00b4t have cholinergic urticaria because t here are involved LTP and alcohol cofactors with sk in tests positive and in the first time alcohol such a cofactor. She usually exercises and she didn\u00b4t have any sympt oms. On the other hand, when she ate strawberry, guacamo le, beer, bread with meat, nachos and milk she didn \u00b4t have symptoms. The treatment that we recommended was: - Take rosaceae fruits peeled (peech, apple, pear, plum, grape,etc). To avoid packaged juices and jams . Continue taking foods that hasn\u00b4t produced problems so far. - Forbidden ingestion of peanut, hazelnut, nut, kiw i, pineapple. Continue taking pineapple in syrup as before. - Approximately 2 hours prior to exercise avoid cof actors which can precipitate urticaria or anaphylax is such as: alcohol, NSAIDs and foods containing LTP like rosaceae fruit s. - In case of pruritus, hives, difficult to breath, difficult to swallow, etc Adrenalin autoinjector 30 0 mcg will be given (according to indications explained by the doctor), and then go to emergency department or hospital em ergency. - Prednisone 30 mg in case of pruritus or eyelid ed ema or palpebral angioedema after accidental ingest ion of nuts or fruits containing LTP. The patient didn\u00b4t have any problem following these recomendations and she didn\u00b4t have a new episode b y now. It is important to avoid cofactors such as NSAIDs, alcohol conssumption, foods containing LTP and infe ctious disease when she exercise.

Identific ation of offending foods can be difficult when an infant is exposed to multiple foods during complementary feeding introd uction. This can impact growth, development, and quality of life. He re we present a 5 month old who developed chronic F PIES, potentially to multiple foods. We describe difficul ties in identifying potential food triggers, discus s strategies for further food introduction to optimize nutrition during this critical time of growth and development, and focus on feasibility. Patient Presentation and Testing: We present an 8-month-old previously healthy frater nal twin term female with history of gastroesophage al reflux that developed chronic FPIES, potentially to multiple fo ods, and failure to thrive. Symptoms included vomit ing, lethargy, floppiness, grey skin, dry heaving, and diarrhea fo r 12 hours after ingesting peaches at 5 months, pea s at 5 months, and chicken broth/avocado/multi-vitamin at 7 months. Af ter each episode, they resumed exclusive breast fee ding. The mother had reintroduced milk intermittently into he r diet, which had previously been held to assist wi th infant reflux management. Her weight decreased from the 65th percentile at 4 months to the 18th percentile at 8 months. Skin tes ting was positive to egg and negative to milk, wheat, corn, soy, pean ut, cod, shrimp, oat, walnut, cashew, and almond. T otal IgE was 7.8 kU/L and specific IgE was negative to beef, casein, chicken, egg, milk, oat, pea, pork, soy, peach, an d rice. Extensive infectious and gastrointestinal evaluations were un revealing. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The mother was extremely concerned about the potent ial of multiple food triggers and was reluctant to proceed with further complementary solid food introduction. The child remained exclusively breastfed. We performed in-office single oral food challenges (OFC) to various solid foods, recommending avoidanc e of other solid foods until the infant passed an OFC. We prioritize d OFCs to foods that would provide appropriate nutr ition to a growing infant. She now tolerates many foods withholding th e possible offending foods only. Fortunately we identified many safe foods, allowing recovery from her failure to thrive and potentiall y preventing associated neurodevelopmental delays. We must consi der nutritional value of foods when considering sel ection for OFCs, especially with failure to thrive. The decisi on to exclusively breast feed with maternal avoidan ce of soy and dairy allowed us to slowly reintroduce foods individually in order to improve nutritional status rapidly.

The DBPCFC occurred after 2.5 years of daily dosing with peanut/placebo oral immunotherapy (OIT) as a part of a clinical trial. A cumulative dose of 200mg peanut protein e licited the following symptoms: change in affect, g eneralized pruritus, and one episode of vomiting. He required one dose of epinephrine 0.15mg IM and one dose of o ral antihistamine to treat his symptoms. He was safely discharged several hours later after a return to b aseline. Three weeks after the DBPCFC, the research team was notified by the child's parents that he had develo ped a food aversion. According to his parents, the child would only eat yogurt, and he reported that he was \"scar ed to eat.\" Prior to initiating the DBPCFC, the subject weighed 17.2kg, was 103cm tall (BMI 16.2, 72.6 percentile weight fo r age). Four months after the DBPCFC, he had a total weight loss of 2kg from his pre-challenge weight, weighing 15. 2 kg (24.2 percentile weight for age). He lost 11.6% of his bo dy weight and had BMI of 14.3 kg/m2, down from a BM I of 16.2 kg/m2. The child started weekly occupational therap y (OT) for his food aversion. Seven months after th e DBPCFC, the parents reported some improvement with the OT, as t he child had successfully reintroduced certain food s into his diet but continued to refuse to eat at school, camp, or other situations where his parents were not with hi m. The child was randomized to peanut/placebo OIT at 1 6 months of age, weighing in the 64th percentile fo r age at that time. His OIT treatment course was unremarkable, in cluding the positive entry DBPCFC. There were no si gns of anxiety or psychological concerns prior to conducting the D BPCFC 2.5 years into the study. Therefore, in this case it would have been difficult to determine any risk factors in thi s child for developing feeding aversion after the 2 .5 year DBPCFC. This case demonstrates the importance of assessing and closely following the psychological well-being of children after an oral food challenge. This is especially importan t in younger children, who have difficulty rational izing the outcomes of food challenges, and who may transfer the negative experience of a positive food challenge to all eati ng situations. Patient Presentation and Testing: The child in this case had no previous medical hist ory aside from peanut allergy. He lived in a single family home with his parents, and no siblings. He first ingested peanut on at 13 months old, resulting in generalized urtic aria. He practiced avoidance of peanut prior to entering the clinical trial at the age of 16 months. At the entry food ch allenge for this study, a cumulative peanut protein dose of 75mg resulted i n angioedema and rhinorrhea, requiring treatment of 0.15mg epinephrine and one dose of an oral antihistamine. At randomization for this trial, he weighed 11.9kg (64.8 percentile weight for age). It is unknown whether he was randomized the active treatment arm or to the placebo arm in the duration of the trial. The 2.5 years of his study participation were unrem arkable, as he had minimal adverse events, no insta nces of accidental peanut ingestion, and no subjective or o bjective reactions to the daily-dosed study product . Throughout the study, peanut-specific IgE remains blinded; at the exit food challenge, he had a positive skin prick t est to peanut with a mean wheal diameter of 24.5mm. After the 2.5 years of daily study drug, each participant is to undergo a DBPCFC to peanut, and to undergo a third DBPCFC to peanut aft er a period of avoidance. As previously described, this child underwent the p ost-treatment DBPCFC at the age of 3 years 11 month s, and developed a feeding aversion thereafter. He did hav e a 2kg (11.6%) decrease in body weight over 4 mont hs due to this poor oral intake due to fear of eating. When the st udy center was made aware of this case, the child h ad already been evaluated by his pediatrician, and referrals had be en made. He was active in feeding aversion therapy. The family initially opted out of counseling to see if the fee ding therapy was sufficient to improve his feeding anxieties. This child was closely monitored by the food allerg y research team. An initial plan was created to hav e routine phone calls with the family to monitor the child's progre ss. The food allergy research team ensured that the child was receiving appropriate psychological and physical care. No tes ts were necessary for this subject; the history alo ne was adequate to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The child was diagnosed by his pediatrician with no n-organic oral aversion. This diagnosis was likely related to the oral food challenge. Due to complex nature of this problem, multidiscipl inary management was necessary. The intervention fr om the perspective of a food allergy center was the decisi on to withdraw this subject from the trial, and abs taining from further food challenges or oral immunotherapy. Continuing O IT in this child could risk impeding his recovery f rom the oral aversion. Post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) has not been well-studied in patients with food allergies, but this case represents a child with possible PTSD after a food challenge. This child experienced a threat to his well-being, and a characteristic of individuals with PTSD is avoidance of the situation s that trigger memories of the event (Kelsay, 2003) . In this case, the avoidance of the stressful stimuli resulted in food aversion, weight loss, and a drop of two curves on the growth chart. Despite the child's progress in OT for feeding, per forming a post-avoidance food challenge in this chi ld may either provoke the previous anxieties surrounding food, or create additional stressors that could result in i ncreased avoidance of the catalyst stimuli, food. This child remains in weekly feeding therapies, and continues to improve. His most recently reported w eight (4 year 5 months old) was 17.6kg and his height was 105.8cm ( BMI 15.7; 60.6 percentile weight for age). This imp rovement further reaffirms the decision not to administer a third DBPCFC or continue OIT therapy with this chil d. The food allergy team has used this case as a cautionary tale and pr ompted the pursuit of resources to share with othe r children who may have similar experiences. References Kelsay, K. (2003).

Summary and Lessons Learned: Kounis Syndrome encompasses a variety of cardiovasc ular signs and symptoms associated with mast cell a ctivation in the setting of allergic or hypersensitivity and ana phylactic or anaphylactoid insults. It can manifes t as coronary coronary or in-stent thrombosis, and acu te myocardial infarction with plaque rupture. Vari ous medications as well as foods such as fish, shellfish, mushroom, and rice pudding have been implicated as causal ag ents. We present the case of what we believe to be the first documen ted case of Kounis Syndrome manifesting as coronary vasospasm as the result of an allergy to banana. This case high lights the importance of considering allergic cause s of angina in a patient with known atopy and an otherwise normal ca rdiovascular workup. Patient Presentation and Testing: The 56 year-old woman initially presented with dail y, intermittent, substernal angina exacerbated by e xertion and cool temperatures. Her angina was only relieved with su blingual nitroglycerin, which she was using up to 1 0 times daily. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, contr ast allergy as well as multiple medication allergie s, as well as a distant history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated successfully with radiation therapy. She has a family history s ignificant for atopy, asthma, and coronary artery disease. Initia l cardiac workup included negative troponin levels and normal electrocardiograms. Coronary catheterization revea led normal coronaries. She was diagnosed as havin g variant angina with vasospasm, and was started on a trial of calci um-channel blockers, without relief. Given her his tory of atopy, tryptase levels were checked which were found to be persistently elevated over the next year while her anginal symptoms persisted. She was referred to an allergi st, and allergy-specific IgE testing for banana and latex were found to be significantly elevated after the patient reporte d perioral itching and tingling with banana ingesti on. She had been eating multiple bananas daily as part of a heart-he althy diet. Upon discontinuing bananas from her di et, her chest pain improved dramatically both in severity and frequenc y. Several tryptase levels taken after the discont inuation of bananas have been within normal range. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This was found to be a case of Kounis Syndrome Type I with allergy-induced coronary vasospasm due to b anana. Her symptoms and quality of life have improved signific antly since withholding the offending agent, and at her last visit she was not requiring any regular use of nitroglycerin. She is to undergo formal skin testing as part of her full allergic workup.

Summary and Lessons Learned: The early introduction of peanut in high-risk patie nts who are not allergic to peanut can significantl y reduce development of peanut allergy. Here we describe two cases in which peanut was initially tolerated and subsequently avoided after serum IgE testing was performed, like ly leading to the development of a peanut allergy. OW presented at 5 months of age for food all ergy evaluation. He had eczema and a family history of peanut allergy in his brother and mother. He had never ingested pe anut and had a negative skin prick test (SPT) to pe anut. At 7 months, he passed an oral food challenge (OFC) to p eanut and incorporated it in his diet at least 2-3 times per week. Four months later, the family revealed they had cut peanut from OW's diet for the previous 2 months af ter his pediatrician sent a panel of IgE testing as part of a work-up for eczema. He instructed them to avoid peanut after noting a sIgE of 75 kUA/L. Our repeat peanut sIgE level wa s 62.3 kUA/L. MB presented at 17 months of age with a hist ory of egg allergy, mild eczema, and no prior peanu t ingestions. Her initial SPT was 6 mm and peanut sIgE 5.47 kUA/L. Co mponent testing revealed sensitization to only Ara h 3 (0.17 kUA/L) and 9 (1.87 kUA/L). Six months later, she passed an OFC to peanut. After a month of regular consumpt ion, her pediatrician sent \"routine lab testing\", including a panel of food allergens, which demonstrated a pea nut sIgE of 52.4 kUA/L. Her mother asked if it was safe to continue peanut ingestion, and we recommended continuing reg ular consumption. Six months later, her mother reported she had cut peanut from the diet due to fear of a r eaction. Our repeat peanut sIgE was 54.6 kUA/L with a sIgE to Ar a h 2 of 24.6 kUA/L. Given the markedly elevated peanut sIgE leve ls and extended periods of avoidance, we felt that it was not safe to reintroduce peanut to either patient. These cases r epresent the danger in performing panels of IgE tes ting in patients who are tolerating peanut and the potential misinte rpretation of results. As noted in the LEAP study, patients consuming peanut may develop increased sIgE levels to peanut despite tolerating this food. Healthcare profession als should not obtain peanut sIgE levels in patients tolerating pe anut, as this can lead to unnecessary avoidance, an d the possibility of developing a peanut allergy. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient OW had a history of eczema and had never in gested peanut due to concern for food allergy. His mother and brother both had an allergy to peanut and were avoi ding it. To determine if he had sensitization, he w as initially skin tested to peanut and found to be negative. Given th at he never ingested peanut and had a negative skin prick test (SPT), and that the family was nervous about home introduc tion, we proceeded with a physician supervised oral food challenge (OFC) to peanut which he passed. He stopp ed incorporating peanut in his diet after the peanu t sIgE was noted to be elevated on a serum allergy panel sent by his pediatrician. Similarly, patient MB had a history of eczema, along with egg allergy, and was avoiding peanut. Based on favorable SPT and peanut sIgE, she underwent an OF C to peanut and passed, and began tolerating peanut her diet. S imilarly to OW, MB had a serum food allergy panel s ent by her pediatrician. Her family cut this food from the die t after seeing the elevated sIgE level to peanut, d espite guidance to continue regular peanut consumption. In both patien ts, follow up testing confirmed markedly elevated s IgE levels to peanut, well above the 95% predictive values for re activity to peanut, and given the periods of avoida nce we were not comfortable attempting reintroduction of this food. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: In both cases, we encounter patients who passed phy sician supervised oral food challenges to peanut an d were tolerating peanut products in the diet at home. How ever, peanut sIgE levels were obtained by their pri mary doctors and were noted to be elevated. After testing, peanut wa s cut from the diet (one due to the recommendations of the pediatrician, the other due to parental fear of an allergic reaction after seeing the peanut sIgE leve l) even though the patients were tolerating peanut without any allergi c symptoms. As months passed without exposure to pe anut and a persistently elevated peanut sIgE, the likelihood o f clinical reactivity to peanut became increasingly high. We now classify these patients as peanut allergic. Though we did not challenge the patients to confirm this, the risk of a reaction is extremely high, with elevated peanut sIgE levels > 50 kUA/L in both cases. They now must strictly a void peanut, and are at risk for potentially severe allergic reactio ns if this food is accidentally ingested.

Recently, it has been reported that vaccines containing both bovine calf serum and gelatin in th eir ingredient list are capable of inducing immedia te hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis in alpha-gal allergic adult patient s, due to their parenteral route of administration. Binding and depletion of alpha-gal specific IgE antibodies was demonstrated in these vaccines, though such reactio ns may hypothetically be due to coexisting gelatin specifi c IgE. Importantly, multiple vaccines utilized duri ng the routine series of pediatric immunizations potentially contain alph a-gal due to the presence of bovine calf serum or g elatin. Here, we report a case of vaccine-induced anaphylaxis associ ated with alpha-gal allergy in a child. Case description The patient is a 5 year old male with a history of alpha-gal allergy who presented one week after an a llergic reaction upon receipt of MMR (Merck), Varicella (Merck), and TDAP/IPV(GSK) vaccines. Five minutes after receiv ing the vaccines, he developed shortness of breath, wheezing, dissemi nated urticaria, and angioedema of the face and oro pharynx, warranting a visit to the emergency room where he r eceived epinephrine, diphenhydramine, prednisone an d famotidine with relief of symptoms within ten minutes. He was diagnosed with alpha-gal allergy 8 months prior to presentation (alpha-gal sIgE of 8.19 kU/L) after several episode s of hives and facial angioedema on exposure to mam malian meat, following a tick bite, and was avoiding mammalian m eat at the time of his vaccine reaction. He had no history of egg, latex, dairy, or gelatin allergy. We repeated his s IgE titers, demonstrating an increase in the galact ose--1,3-galactose sIgE level to 26.9 kU/L, a beef sIgE level of 14 kU /L, a lamb/mutton sIgE level of 5.54 kU/L, and a po rk sIgE level of 11.2 kU/L (Reference range for all being <0.35 kU/L). Conclusion Of the administered vaccines, MMR has already been demonstrated to bind and deplete sIgE to alpha-gal. All three vaccines contain bovine calf serum, which has not b een ruled out as a potential source of alpha-gal co ntamination, and two (MMR and Varicella) contain gelatin. Although p orcine and bovine gelatin sensitivity has been desc ribed in children with red meat allergy in vitro, this is the first c ase of vaccine-induced anaphylaxis in a pediatric p atient that implicates alpha-gal allergy as a possible mechanism. Importan tly, this is a single case and most patients with a lpha-gal tolerate vaccination uneventfully. Patient Presentation and Testing: A five year old with a history of alpha-gal allergy diagnosed 8 months prior to presentation came to o ur office after having an allergic reaction upon receiving his rout ine 4-6 year vaccines of MMR (Merck), Varicella (Me rck), and TDAP/IPV(GSK). Five minutes after administration o f the above vaccines he had shortness of breath, wh eezing,, disseminated urticaria and angioedema of the face a nd oropharynx after which he went to the Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department he received 1 dose of e pinephrine, diphenhydramine and famotidine with rel ief of symptoms within an hour. At the time of administrat ion of the vaccines, he was avoiding all red meat b ut had no food restrictions otherwise and was tolerating egg, late x and gelatin containing products. The diagnosis of alpha-gal allergy was made 8 months prior to this clinic visit after he was having recurrent hives and facial angioedema following a tick bite. His alpha-gal sIgE at the time of diagnosis w as 8.19 kU/L. Since then he had been strictly avoid ing mammalian meat, with uneventful consumption of dairy and gelatin, a nd had not had any recurrence of symptoms until he was exposed to the vaccine. His repeat titres in our office showed galactose--1,3-galactose sIgE level to 26.9 kU/L, a beef sIgE level 14 kU/L, a lamb/mutton sIgE level of 5.54 kU/L, and a pork sIgE level of 11.2 kU/L (Reference range fo r all being <0.35 kU/L). As mentioned above, there was an increase in his alpha gal sIgE titres post vaccination despite avoiding red meat and tick bites. On review of the vaccine ingredients, both MMR (Mer k) and Varicella (Merk) contain high amounts of gel atin (14,500 g per 0.5 ml dose and 12,500 g per 0.5ml dose respec tively). MMR, Varicella, and TDaP/IPV combination v bovine calf serum. While patients with alph a-gal allergy may also be sensitized to gelatin, ou r patient was tolerating gelatin containing foods with no symptom s. There is literature on safe administration of hi gh gelatin containing vaccines in an adult with alpha-gal alle rgy. A recent study also demonstrated that pre-incu bation of patient sera with MMR depleted alpha-gal sIgE greater than did gelatin alone. This raised the possibility of t hese bovine or porcine derived products being a potential source o f antigen in this patient with preexisting alpha-ga l allergy. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: We gave our patient a provisional diagnosis of vacc ine-induced anaphylaxis due to his preexisting alph a-gal allergy, based on his clinical history, changes in specific IgE to alpha-gal despite complete avoidance, and re view of the recent literature. It is unclear to what degree the patien t will need to receive a modified immunization sche dule going forward, but we advised continued avoidance of tick bites an d mammalian meat. We will be monitoring the patien t's alpha-gal sIgE concentrations yearly and would do pre-testing with graded challenge to any vaccines containing m ammalian products, prior to administration. In follow up of the patient's original reaction, we plan to perform vaccine skin testing in this patie nt using the vaccines he received, at both full strength skin prick and d iluted intradermal concentrations. We plan to measu re specific IgE to bovine and porcine gelatin from the patient's plasm a, to confirm whether or not he is gelatin sensitiz ed, despite not having any reported reactions. We further plan to utilize ex vivo studies to interrogate the patient' s sIgE to alpha-gal's ability to bind the vaccines he received, and other s which contain either bovine calf serum, gelatin, both, or neither. We intend to review publicly available reports of vacc ine anaphylaxis to identify any other cases which m ight fit criteria for preexisting alpha-gal allergy.

In 201 5, he referred approximately 200 lone star tick bit es with local symptoms. This case is compatible with a pattern of a specific IgE against Alpha-Gal oligosaccharide ( Galactose-Alpha- 1,3-Galactose). These antibodies are associated wit h urticaria and angioedema or anaphylaxis beginning 3 to 5 hours after the intake of red meat or non-primate mammali an food products and they are produced after lone s tar tick bite sensitization. In Brazil was demonstrated the prese nce of the Alpha-Gal Epitope in the saliva of the A mblyomma Sculptum ticks. The tick bite could lead to the pro duction of antibodies against Alpha-Gal and the pre sences of late symptoms after the ingestion of non-primate mammali an food products. The late reaction differs from th e classic pattern of IgE mediated symptoms which generally ha s an early presentation (up to 2 hours), being impo rtant to considered this hypothesis in late reaction cases, however with a clinical pattern of type 1 hypersens itivity. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 37-year-old male patient was referred to our serv ice presenting recurrent episodes of generalized ur ticaria and tongue angioedema after 4 hours intake of red meat. He als o has allergic rhinitis, he denies other diseases o r use of frequent medications. The patient works in a farm where he h as contact with equine, caprine and swine animals. In 2015, he referred approximately 200 lone star tick bites wit h local symptoms. In June 2016, five hours after in gestion of bovine meat developed generalized urticaria. In August 201 6, four hours after ingestion of red meat in barbeq ue shown urticaria. In April 2017, 4 hours after ingestion o f bovine meat developed urticaria, tongue and feet angioedema. Swine and bovine meat specific IgE were positive (3 .7 and 5.6 kU/L respectively) and Alpha-Gal specifi c IgE was 3.65 kU/L. A prick to prick test was performed with raw bovine meat, and the result was 9x6 mm with a hista mine of 5x6mm and a negative control of 0 mm. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This case is compatible with a pattern of a specifi c IgE against Alpha-Gal oligosaccharide (Galactose- Alpha-1,3- ticaria and angioedema or anaphylaxis beginning 3 t o 5 hours after the intake of red meat or non-primate mammalian foo d products and they are produced after lone star ti ck bite sensitization. It's important to know that between the episodes, t he patient referred to consume read meat without an y reactions, nevertheless the patient realized that the quantity and the steak doneness were associated with better food tolerance. (Smaller quantities and well-done meat were better tolerated). We suggest to the patient to follow an action plan to prevent fatal reactions, that include medication s, doses and the suggestion of eating lean meat in small quantity.

Case Reintroduction in a Patient with Alpha-Gal All ergy Summary and Lessons Learned: We present a case of successful red meat reintroduc tion in a patient with alpha-gal allergy. Alpha-gal , IgE-mediated delayed-onset hypersensitivity reacti ons. It is introduced into humans via tick bites, where some d evelop sensitivity to these shared sugar epitopes o n red meat. Some food allergies can be \"outgrown.\" This appears to b e the case in this patient. A lack of booster effec t from repeated tick bites as well as red meat avoidance may have played a role in diminishing alpha-gal IgE and possibilit y of allergic reactions to red meat exposure. There are food-spec ific IgE levels for predicting symptomatic food all ergy to some foods. Such levels have not been established for re d meat allergy but they likely exist. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 56-year-old woman presented to a drug allergy cli nic for evaluation of a possible allergic reaction to acetaminophen. On two occasions after taking acetaminophen, patien t developed pruritic hives after four hours. During the second episode, she also experienced vomiting, pruritic mo uth, and sensation of throat closure. Her past medi cal history is non- contributory. Since her reactions were non-immediat e, patient was questioned regarding food ingestion. She recalled that on both occasions she had consumed red meat. P atient also mentioned a tick bite in New York state prior to these episodes with a long-lasting local reaction. Theref ore, serum alpha-gal IgE was checked and found to b e elevated to 46 kU/L. Total serum IgE was 264.1 IU/mL. Graded oral challenge to 850mg acetaminophen in the clinic was negative. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient was diagnosed with alpha-gal allergy. On th ree-year follow-up, she had been avoiding red meat and had not experienced any additional reactions. However, the patient wished to reintroduce meat into her diet. A lpha-gal was 3.5 kU/L and total IgE 60.8 IU/mL. She underwent graded oral challenge to red meat; she remained asymptoma tic throughout the challenge and was observed for a tot al of five hours. The patient began ingesting modes t amounts of meat, without any reaction. Alpha-gal measured 1.6 kU/L on eight-month follow-up. One year later, she presented after one episode of burning sensation of palms and feet after eating a large amount of beef. This reaction occurred after a week of increased exercise activity and sun exposur e. She denied additional tick bites. Alpha-gal meas ured 3.14 kU/L at this time with total IgE 57 IU/mL. Patient resumed red meat consumption after this episode and has not had any additional allergic reactions to date.

Hernandez, MD University of North Caro lina at Chapel Hill Timothy P. Moran, MD, PhD University of North Caro lina at Chapel Hill Case Title: Peanut-triggered food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome presenting in late childhood. Summary and Lessons Learned: Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE mediated food allergy characterized b y delayed severe, repetitive vomiting and diarrhea. FPIES can be tri ggered by a variety of foods and typically presents during infancy. We report a rare case of a 4 year-old female who was r eferred for possible IgE-mediated food allergy, but instead was found to have peanut-induced FPIES. This case supports p rior observations that FPIES can present later in c hildhood, even to previously tolerated foods. Furthermore, we demon strate the importance for clinical staff to be trai ned in the recognition and management of both IgE- and non-IgE -mediated reactions during an oral food challenge. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a healthy child with no atopic histo ry. Several weeks prior to presentation, she had e aten peanut butter on two occasions, followed by the development of se vere vomiting 2 hours afterwards without cutaneous, respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms. During one of the episode s the child had a concurrent viral illness. Prior to these episodes, the child had eaten peanuts without any symptoms. She had negative peanut skin prick testing and in v itro IgE testing. Given negative testing and the low likelihood of ne w-onset peanut allergy at this age, her symptoms we re attributed to a viral syndrome. Given the suspicious history, th e patient underwent a graded oral food challenge to peanut, with a two hour monitoring period after conclusion of the challenge. The child consumed a full serving of pea nut over a 60- minute period without incident. Ninety minutes afte r challenge, the child developed emesis. The emesis recurred, prompting administration of intramuscular epinephri ne. The patient continued to vomit and subsequentl y developed watery diarrhea and drooling. Administration of a s econd dose of epinephrine was ineffective. The chil d was then given ondansetron 4 mg sublingually, and the vomiting res olved. Vital signs revealed no hypotension, and th e patient was able to tolerate oral rehydration. She was observe d for another 150 minutes after return to baseline. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Evidence supporting a diagnosis of peanut-induced F PIES includes the sudden onset of repetitive vomiti ng and diarrhea two hours after food ingestion; lack of response to antihistamines and epinephrine; improvement with o ndansetron; and reproducibility of reaction after peanut ingest ion. The family was educated on peanut avoidance, natural history, and clinical symptoms of FPIES. Given the low leve l of awareness that emergency clinicians have regar ding acute treatment of FPIES, the family was provided with an emergency action letter for management of future e pisodes.

Altman, MD - University of Washington Case Title: A Case of Adult-Onset Food Protein Induced Enteroco litis Syndrome (FPIES) to Cashew and Lessons is a non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal food h ypersensitivity reaction that is traditionally cons idered to be a pediatric disease. Symptoms can lead to shock and r equire hospitalization. FPIES is considered to be r are in adults, especially new-onset to a previously tolerated food . There is one published case report of a 53-year-o ld man with reproducible gastrointestinal symptoms to shellfish and another retrospective report of thirty-one adu lts with reproducible food-specific gastrointestinal reactio ns. In both publications, the patients had negative food-specific IgE testing. We present a case of FPIES in an adult con firmed by graded food challenge to cashew, which th e patient had previously tolerated. This case demonstrates that a n FPIES-like syndrome can develop in adulthood and should be a diagnostic consideration in patients with severe ga strointestinal symptoms after ingestion of a specif ic food, including one previously tolerated. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 68 year-old otherwise healthy man presented to th e University of Washington Allergy and Immunology c linic for evaluation of possible reactions to cashews. Over an 18 month period, he had had 4 episodes of sudden -onset severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea/vomiting, and hy potension. The most severe episode had led to synco pe and acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization and treatme nt with epinephrine and IV fluids. The patient had associated each episode with the consumption of cashews approximate ly 40-60 minutes earlier. He had previously consume d cashews on a regular basis but was now avoiding them. Worku p included skin prick testing and serum IgE to tree nuts, which were both negative, random tryptase level of 5.3 ng /ml, and total IgE level of 40 kU/L. At the patient 's request and after informed consent, he underwent a graded food challe nge to cashews in clinic. At 3 hours, after consumi ng 6.5 cashews, he developed abdominal pain, emesis, and hypotensio n to 70/40. He was treated with 2 rounds of IM epin ephrine, IV odansetron, IV fluids and glucocorticoids. At 8 hou rs he developed grossly bloody diarrhea. He did not have any skin manifestations of pruritis, hives, rash, nor did he have respiratory involvement, such as difficulty b reathing or swallowing, stridor, wheezing, or swelling of lips or tongue. Labs were notable for leukocytosis (WBC = 21.4 x103/mm3) with eosinophilia (AEC = 1.5 x103/mm3), and normal tryptase (3.4 ng/ml). Our diagnosis was FPIES relat ed to cashew consumption and our recommendation was that he stri ctly avoid all foods containing cashews. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: We believe this to be the oldest patient reported w ith a new-onset, non-IgE mediated gastrointestinal food hypersensitivity reaction consistent with FPIES and the first report of cashew causing this in an adul t. This case demonstrates that an FPIES-like syndrome can develo p in adulthood and should be a diagnostic considera tion in patients with severe gastrointestinal symptoms after ingesti on of a specific food, including one previously tol erated.

Belecanech, M.D., The Asthma Center Case Title: Hypogammaglobulinemia Secondary to Multiple Myeloma with Amyloidosis Summary and Lessons Learned: We report a case of hypogammaglobulinemia secondary to multiple myeloma with light-chain (AL) amyloido sis. A 58- year-old white male non-smoker presented with a 5-y ear history of shortness of breath and lower extrem ity myalgias, but no history of recurrent sinopulmonary infection s. Initial PFT evaluation showed an obstructive pat tern (FEV1 2.62 L, 67% of predicted). He demonstrated historical rever sibility but his dyspnea failed to symptomatically improve with anti- asthmatic therapy and prednisone. Chest CT revealed mild diffuse cardiomegaly and a small pericardial effusion. BNP was elevated. Marginally elevated D-dimer was noted , but V/Q scan was normal. Echo significan t cardiomyopathy and left ventricular diastolic dysfu to respond to diuretics and ionot ropic agents. Reduced globulin level (1.4 g/dL) noted after d eveloping community-acquired pneumonia, atrial fibr illation, and recurrent constipation. Evaluation immunoglobuli ns light chain analysis revealed pan-hypogammag lobulinemia and Bence-Jones proteinuria. Further cardiac and he matologic testing was done. Cardiac catheterization showed no evidence of significant coronary artery disease. Bo ne marrow biopsy showed lambda-restricted plasma ce ll dyscrasia, and fibroadipose tissue Congo red stain was positiv e for amyloidosis. Skeletal survey was negative. He began chemotherapy for multiple myeloma, but his dyspnea persisted. He was subsequently separately hospitali zed for pneumonia and thoracentesis for a large transudativ e pleural effusion. Upon review of this case report, practicing allergi sts and immunologists should: 1. recognize that dyspnea not responsive to anti-as thmatic therapy, despite improvement in FEV1, shoul d prompt further cardiac and pulmonary evaluation. 2. recognize that reduced serum globulin levels sho uld prompt further B and T cell evaluation for immunodeficiency. 3. recognize hypogammaglobulinemia as an uncommon b ut significant complication of multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. 4. appreciate the multitude of clinical findings, i mmunologic abnormalities, and complications associa ted with multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. 5. understand the appropriate tests used for the di agnoses of multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. 6. understand the role of immunoglobulin replacemen t in the treatment of secondary hypogammaglobulinem ia from multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. Patient Presentation and Testing: At the time of the initial encounter, a 58-year-old male non-smoker patient presented with a 5-year hi story of shortness of breath and lower extremity myalgias. The patient had no prior history of recurrent sinusitis, pneum onia, bronchitis, COPD, or asthma. He had undiagnosed chronic bilater al calf pain for the prior 15 years with negative m uscle biopsies. Prior catheterization revealed no significant coron ary disease. Methacholine challenge was done to eva luate his dyspnea and obstructive PFT. Initial spirometry 2.62 L, 67% of predicted. Methacholine challeng e was negative. His PFT improved after prednisone therapy (FEV1 3.3 1 L, 26% reversibility), but his dyspnea did not. F urther pulmonary and cardiac testing was done to evaluate his dyspne a. Chest CT showed mild diffuse cardiomegaly, a sma ll pericardial effusion, and a small left pleural effusion. V/Q sc an was negative, despite a marginally elevated D-di mer level. A sleep study demonstrated obstructive sleep apnea, and CPA P therapy was initiated. Cardiac symptoms were inve stigated using EKG, echo, and cardiac catheterization. EKG w as initially normal, but months later showed atrial fibrillation. Echo showed significant cardiomyopathy, EF 38%, and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Catheterization ruled out significant coronary artery disease and showed mild elevation of right ventricular, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, minimally elevated left and right sided filling pressures, and normal pulmo nary artery pressure. A reduced serum globulin prompted a B and T cell evaluation for immunodeficiency. Normal alb umin, IgG 384 mg/dL, IgA 51 mg/dL, IgM 41 mg/dL were noted. A NA and ANCA were negative. CD19+ lymphocytes were normal at at were normal Before receiving the Pneumovax vaccination, 23/23 pneumococcal antibodies were low (less than /mL). After the Pneumovax vaccination, 7/14 pneumoc occal antibodies low. Urinalysis showed normal prote in levels (39.5 mg/dL), which ruled out nephrotic s yndrome. However, monoclonal lambda light chain Bence-Jones proteinuria was present on spot urine electrophores is. Free kappa and lambda light chains were elevated at 28.1 mg/L and 680.0 mg/L, respectively, on spot urine electro phoresis. Serum IEP and SPEP were normal. It was initially thought that the patient had non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, b ut in the context of his hypogammaglobulinemia development of chr onic constipation, atrial ones with amyloid rdiomyopathy considered diagnostically. Conseq uently, bone marrow biopsy and fibroadipose tissue Congo red sta in were performed, which were diagnostic for lambda -restricted plasma cell dyscrasia and AL amyloidosis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This patient, presenting with dyspnea and history o f obstructive lung disease, was ultimately diagnose d with presumptive amyloid cardiomyopathy associated with multiple myeloma. Laboratory workup demonstrated Be nce Jones proteinuria, with biopsy-confirmed multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis, along with hypogammaglobulinem ia. His hypogammaglobulinemia was thought to be secondary t o multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. His dyspnea was thought to be due to a combination of underlying ob structive lung disease and, more significantly, non -ischemic amyloid cardiomyopathy. His multiple myeloma was treated wi th chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, bortezo mib, and dexamethasone. Immunoglobulin replacement will star t after completion of chemotherapy and autologous b one marrow stem cell transplant. In most cases, treatme nt for AL amyloidosis follows treatment of the unde rlying primary disease to suppress new amyloid formation and to in duce regression of current deposits. Specifically, treatment for cardiac amyloidosis includes diuretics, salt restri ction, and beta-blockers, channel blockers, and digoxin are limited. His amyloid cardiomyopathy did not respond to diure tics and inotropic agents and has yet to respond to chemothe rapy. If his cardiomyopathy fails to respond to the complete course of chemotherapy and/or autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant, he may be a candidate for cardiac transplantation.

Immu nologic evaluation demonstrated severe CD4 (34 cells/\u00b5L), s/\u00b5L), and NK cell (55 cell/\u00b5L) low Ig poor anti-diptheria, anti-te replacement and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole proph ylaxis due to his presentation with severe infectio n and experienced overall clinical improvement. This case emphasizes the questions regarding best evaluation and management of immunodeficiency in post-Fontan PLE p atients. The pathophysiology behind development of PLE and associated immune deficiencies is incompletely unde rstood. It is likely that CD4 and immunoglobulins a re lost through the GI tract in these patients due to loss of chyle . Previous studies have shown selective severe CD4 lymphopenia as well as humoral and cell mediated immune abnormalities w ithout increased evidence of opportunistic or sever e infections, but other studies have reported significant infecti ons in patients who are not supported with antibiot ic prophylaxis or prophylaxis. We propose that the decision to start immunoglobulin replacement and/or antibiotic prophy laxis in post- Fontan patients should be made on a case by case ba sis rather than simply based on the use of lymphocy te counts or immunoglobulin levels. Further study is needed to determine if there are biomarkers that can identify a subset of patients with low lymphocytes and/or immunoglobulin s who are at risk for severe infections and would m ost benefit from additional intervention. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient presented with symptoms of cough, conge stion, fever, and diarrhea and was diagnosed with r hinovirus infection and S. pneumoniae bacteremia associated w ith flare of his PLE. He also had history of chylou s effusions that improved following embolization of his lymphatic du ct, but he subsequently developed PLE. His initial labs were pertinent for a WBC of 11.1 K/\u00b5L with an ALC of 490 /\u00b5L, and an albumin of 1.9. In the setting of a pa tient with significant lymphopenia and bacteremia, the immunol ogy team recommended a broad screen of the immune s ystem as described above. His ALC prior to embolization of h is lymphatic duct was consistently within normal li mits. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: He was diagnosed with immunodeficiency secondary to PLE after Fontan procedure and was started on trim ethoprim- sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and subcutaneous immu noglobulin replacement therapy. Since starting thes e treatments, he has been doing very well with no further infecti ons or hospitalizations and improvement in his PLE.Submission Number: 13 Poster Number: 90 Keyword: Immunodeficiency Primary Cindy Salm Bauer, Author Institution: Division of Pulmonology, Phoenix Children's Hospit al, Phoenix, AZ; Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, AZ Medicine, Mayo Clinic tsdale, Pediatrics, Phoenix Children's 4-Division of Pediatric a Medical Center, Phoenix, AZ 5-Clinical Immunodiagnostic Research Lab of the Med ical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 6-Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Phoenix Ch ildren's AZ Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Infection Child with Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycob acterial Diseases (MSMD) IL-12/IFN--mediated activation of mononuclear phag (NTM) and intracellular pathogens, inc luding salmonella.

Patient Presentation and Testing: At 2 years of age, an otherwise healthy boy develop ed left periorbital swelling. Symptoms seemingly r esolved with antibiotic therapy. At 3-years, the preseptal cell ulitis returned; PET scan showed multifocal sclerot ic lesions of the skull, vertebrae, arms, and legs. Bone marrow biopsy was unremarkable. Femur biopsy showed crushed and devi talized bone while orbital biopsy showed acute on chronic osteom yelitis. Cultures were unrevealing and a diagnosis of Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis was suspected. At 4 years, he developed a lytic parietal lesion; h owever, the family declined a biopsy and at 5 years, the preseptal cel lulitis recurred. Cultures were obtained and were positive for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Despite continu ous treatment with antimycobacterial therapy, he de veloped left cervical lymphadenitis that cultured positive for M ycobacterium fortuitum and MAC. Antimicrobial cove rage for but the lymphadenitis worsened, nece ssitating parotidectomy and cervical lymph node dis section. Cultures from the dissection were negative. Due to significant concern for MSMD, IFN- induced STAT1 phosphorylation in monocytes was assessed as a marker of susceptibility to intracellular bacterial pathogens ; this was decreased at a fluorescence ratio of 1 ( normal > 4). Cell surface expression of IFN- receptor (IFNGR) was me asured using CD119 as a marker; this was increased with a mean IFNGR expression of 2,788 (normal 200-400), suggest ing an autosomal dominant defect in the IFN- recep tor. Mutations in the IFNGR are known to prevent degradation of th e receptor, thus the greatly increased expression s een in this patient. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Genetic testing subsequently confirmed MSMD due to an autosomal dominant frameshift mutation in IFNGR 1 (c.819_822delTAAT), located on chromosome 6q23-q24. While continuing his NTM antimicrobials, the pati ent was promptly started on adjuvant therapy with IFN- (ac timmune 50 mcg/m2, 3 times/week). He will continue on this regimen for 1-year from the first negative culture and then transition to lifelong prophylaxis with az ithromycin. He continues to experience post-surgical left facial w eakness. Delayed diagnosis of autosomal dominant I FNGR 1 defect postponed targeted treatment contributing to surgic al morbidity; thus, highlighting the need for promp t recognition of this condition.

Case Title: B Cell Lymphocytosis and Immunodeficiency: A Gain-O f-Function Mutation in CARD 11 Results in BENTA Dis ease Summary and Lessons Learned: Caspase recruitment domain family member 11 (CARD11 ) is an important signal transducer activation. Germline gain-of-function (GOF) mutatio ns in CARD11 have been identified and referred to a s B cell expansion with NF-B and T cell anergy (BENTA) dise ase. This case highlights the functional dichotomy of CARD11 signaling in T and B cells, with a known GOF CARD11 mutation promoting both B cell lymphocytosis and T cell anergy. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 16-year-old Caucasian female was referred to the immunology clinic for persistent cervical lymphaden opathy and splenomegaly noted since infancy. There was no asso ciated fever, weight loss, or organ-specific sympto ms. Other history included recurrent sinopulmonary and ear infections in early childhood that required two tympanostomy tube placements. She denied serious viral and fungal inf ections. Both her maternal grandfather and mother a lso had recurrent ear infections and lymphadenopathy, and h er maternal grandfather died of lymphoma at age 26. There was no known history of consanguinity. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: She had significant cervical lymphadenopathy (large st lymph node measuring 3.5 x 2.3 x 4.5 cm) but no palpable splenomegaly. Ultrasound of the abdomen indicated s pleen size at the upper limit of normal range. Immunophenotyping showed increased transitional CD1 0+ B cells and double negative -T cells, but redu ced memory and isotype-switched B cells. Polyclonal IgH rearra ngements were detected IgG titers to measles, rubella , tetanus, diphtheria and pneumococcus were protective whereas those to varicella-zoster virus and meningococcus were negative. Lymphocyte proliferation assays demonstra ted normal proliferation to mitogens and antigens, except for a low stimulation index to Candida albicans (< 3). Histol ogical rev ealed significant and expanded mutation (c.146G>A, p.C49Y), which was present in both patient and mother and pr eviously reported in three other cases of mild BENTA disease . A positive long-term prognosis of waning B cell b urden over time is expected for this disease. Nevertheless, our patien t continues to be carefully monitored in case she d evelops monoclonal B cell proliferation or increased infect ions with waning humoral immunity. Submission Number: 25 Poster Number: 92 Keyword: Immunodeficiency Primary Author Name: Marcus Shaker, MD, MS Primary Author Institution: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Additional Authors: Gene Syndrome with Metachronous Co-Primary Testic ular Cancers Summary and Lessons Learned: This report describes an association between the X- linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) contiguous BTK, TIM M8A, TAF7L gene deletion syndrome and repeated testicular canc ers. The pathogenic roles of BTK and TIMM8A deleti ons are known causes of XLA and Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome (MTS); however, the consequence of TAF7L mutations in huma ns in unknown. TAF7L (TATA-box binding protein associate d factor 7-like) is located primarily in the human testis, appears to play a role in spermatogenesis, and is a paralogue of a negative cell cycle regulatory protein. While mutations in the TAF7L gene have not been reported with testicular c ancers, the gene may play a role in colorectal canc ers through its role as a core component for transcription by RNA p olymerase II. We investigated the testicular germ cell tumor (TGC T) data set (inclusive of 157 tumors) but found no association with TAF7L. We then evaluated DNA methylation of the TA F7L gene in a sample of 90 pairs of patient matched specimens of primary breast tumor and adjacent normal breast tis sue. Among three island CpGs, methylation of TAF7L was significantly higher in tumors when compared to nor mal breast tissue. This finding of enhanced CpG m ethylation may be supportive of a TAF7L role in tumor suppression. This is the first report of a primary testicular ca ncer and subsequent metachronous contralateral test icular cancer occurring with an XLA contiguous gene syndrome. Th e association questions what role TAF7L may play as a tumor suppressor gene in the testis, and possibly other t issues. While most BTK mutations are missense, nons ense, splice site, and small deletional events, large deletions still account for around 3.5% of XLA cases. This report highlights the need to suspect the MTS/XLA contiguous gene syndrome in pat ients who present with XLA and sensorineural hearin g loss, as well as the possible role for careful and prolonged testicular cancer surveillance in patients with TA F7L mutations. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 28 year old man first diagnosed at 11 months of age when he presented with bilateral flaccid paralysis subsequent to a varicella vaccination and was found to have profound hypogammaglobinemia (IgG <7 mg/dL ; IgA <7 mg/dL; IgM 21 mg/dL) and absent B cells. Around 2 years of age hearing concerns arose and evaluation revealed severe bilateral hearing loss. At 20 years of age he was diagnosed with a metastatic right testicular semino ma, completing four cycles of chemotherapy after right orchiectomy with no residual disease. Because of concerns of decre ased visual acuity, further genetic evaluation at 24 years of a ge led to the diagnosis of MTS when microarray iden tified a 111-kb deletion of genetic material from chromosome region Xq22.1 resulting in the absence of the BTK, TIMM8A , and TAF7L genes. Seven years after initial diagnosis of his first testicular cancer, the patient presented with swelling of the remaining testicle. Evaluation revealed pulmonary and hepatic metastases of a new primary embryonal t esticular cancer. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our patient has the XLA- MTS contiguous gene syndro me with metachronous bilateral testicular cancers. The population risk of contralateral testicular cancer is low, on the order of 0.5-2%, so his presentation is unusual . Our patient was treated with left orchiectomy, four cycles of chemo therapy, partial hepatectomy, and periarotic mass r emoval.

STIM1 is activated afte r its N terminus domain Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the with combined immunodeficiency (CID), wh ereas gain-of-function (GOF) mutations result in St ormorken syndrome. We present the case of a 3-year-old male with recurrent infections, myalgias, and muscle spa sms who was heterozygous for a novel variant in STIM1 (c.1601 C >T; p.A534V). Patient Presentation and Testing: A 3-year-old male presented for immunologic workup because of recurrent infections consisting of cellu litis, abscesses, and acute otitis media. For 2 years, he had intermi ttent myalgias and spasticity. Muscle biopsy reveal ed mitochondrial proliferation and electron transport chain analysis demonstrated increased mitochondrial activity. Liv e PBMCs were analyzed for [Ca2+]i directly or after they were ta ken into cell culture (stimulated with irradiated B uffy coat cells, B cells, PHA and IL-2 for 10-14 days). PBMC or T cells were loaded with Ca2+ indicators (Fura-2 or Fluo-4) and analyzed for [Ca2+]i levels using a Flexstation 3 plate reader o r LSR2 flow cytometer, respectively. To measure [Ca 2+]i, cells of the patient and a healthy donor were kept in Ca2+-free Ringer solution (0 mM Ca2+) followed by perfusion w ith Ringer solution containing 2 mM Ca2+. Cells were either le ft unstimulated or stimulated with 1 mM thapsigargi n to deplete ER Ca2+ stores, activate STIM1, and induce store-opera ted Ca2+ entry occurred a STIM1 domain not previously associated with human STIM1 mutations. His phenotyp e was not typical of that observed in patients with known LOF or GOF mutations, but did have some features of both. We sought to characterize the effects of this muta tion knowing that LOF and GOF mutations in STIM1 either abolish or enhance SOCE, respectively. Under non-stimulate d conditions, switching from 0 mM to 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ did not result in increased [Ca2+]i as would have been expected for a GOF mutation. Stimulation of the patient's PBMCs or T cells with thapsigargin to induce SOCE resulted in [Ca2+]i increases similar to those found in healthy donor c ontrol T cells when averaged over a series of sever al experiments. Likewise, no consistent decrease or increase in [Ca 2+]i was observed in the patient's T cells after CD 3 crosslinking to induce TCR-mediated Ca2+ influx. Similar results we re obtained with T cells from the patient's father, who is heterozygous for the same mutation. In summary, the heterozygous STIM1 c.1601C>T, p.A534V missense mut ation does not affect SOCE or cytokine production of the patient's T cells and remains a variant of unc ertain significance.

Prior literature reveals no shared immune def ect however these patients often present with severe invasive i nfections including sepsis and meningitis. Fatal in fections have arisen from bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. We describe an 11-month old male with multiple uppe r respiratory infections since birth. He was born p reterm at 26 weeks with a four month stay in the MICU. His initi al hospitalization was complicated by necrotizing e nterocolitis requiring colostomy and G tube placement. He was al so found to have adrenal hypoplasia and hypospadias and diagn osis of MIRAGE syndrome was made. On the most recen t admission for viral URI with parainfluenza, immunol ogy was consulted to work up possible immune defici ency. Initial work up revealed total IgG of 162 with low subclass es 1,2, and 4. IgM and IgA levels were normal. Flow cytometry revealed low CD4 and CD8 T cells, low B cells, and NK cells. He had absent functional responses to HIB , pneumococcal, and tetanus vaccines. Based on these findings he wa s started on IVIG at dose of 5gm monthly with the g oal to keep total IgG > 800. Prophylaxis for viral and fungal infect ions was started with acyclovir and fluconazole. Fo llow up flow cytometry showed normal T cells but persistently lo w B and NK cells. He has been offered a bone marrow transplant and is awaiting a donor. MIRAGE syndrome has no known shared immunologic def ect. Given that there is no guidance regarding ther apy for immune deficiency in the literature, this case high lights possible treatment with IVIG and prophylaxis with antivirals and antifungals as a bridge to bone marrow transplant. Patient Presentation and Testing: An 11 m.o. male with MIRAGE syndrome admitted to th e PICU with respiratory distress. He was intubated and a diagnosis of parainfluenza was made. Upon improveme nt of his respiratory status following nebulizer an d steroid treatments, he was extubated. He has a history of f requent RSV infections and had two prior hospitaliz ations for bronchiolitis. His surgical history includes a gastrostomy tube placement follo wing necrotizing enterocolitis. Immunology was consulted to evaluate for possible immune deficiency. His family history if positive for hypertension and diabetes however no immune deficie ncies. He was evaluated for immune deficiency with flow cytometry, immunoglobulin levels, and functional ti ters for vaccines including tetanus, HIB, and pneum onia. His total IgG was low at 162 and he had low IgG subclasses 1, 2, and 4. He did not show appropriate response to teta nus, HIB, and pneumococcal vaccines. His flow cytometry initiall y showed low CD4 count of 349, low CD8 count of 371 , low B cell count of 158, and low NK cells of 39. Based on the findings of low immunoglobulins with absent functio nal responses to vaccines and lymphopenia, we recommended to start t he patient on IVIG supplementation and fungal/viral prophylaxis with fluconazole and acyclovir. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with hypogammaglobulinemi a with lymphopenia and started on IVIG. He is doing well with infusions and his total IgG has improved to 884. He tolerates prophylaxis with fluconazole and acyclov ir without any adverse effects. He has not had any infections sinc e his discharge. Per his mother's report, he is mor e alert and active after starting IVIG. His repeat flow one month late r showed his CD4+ and CD8+ T cells counts had norma lized however he still has persistent depression of his B and NK cells. He is being followed by hematology/oncology for a possible bone marrow transplant. He will continue treatment with IVIG and prophylaxis as a bridge to bone marrow tra nsplant.

The prevalence is unknown but less than 50 cases ha ve been reported in the literature. It is characterized by lymphedema, lymphangiectasia and developmental delay. Patient's have variable facial features that are of ten characterized by flat facies, flat and broad na sal bridge and hypertelorism. 25% of patients are known to have mutations of coll agen and calcium binding EGF domain (CCBE1) which p lays a vital role in lymphangiogenesis during embryonic developm ent The lymphangiectasias are commonly found in the int estines, and often lead to a protein losing enterop athy. Patients often present with secondary immunodeficie ncies resulting from PLE with lab abnormalities suc h as hypogammaglobulinemia and decreased CD4 T cell. We present a 9 year old female with Hennekam Syndro me who was referred to us for a finding of hypogammaglobulinemia Patient Presentation and Testing: CASE PRESENTATION We present a 9 year old female born to non consangu ineous parents of Puerto Rican descent Family history was significant for an older brother who passed away at 17 months old from pneumonia. The patient was initially diagnosed with with intes tinal lymphangiectasia at 4 months old in the setti ng of FTT, and diarrhea and was subsequently diagnosed with Hennek am Syndrome. Her history is also notable for developmental delay , hypoalbuminemia, Vitamin D and E deficiency, FTT, recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis, congenital optic nerve anomaly, hearing loss and asthma. Physical exam is significant for microcephaly, flat tened facies, hypertrichosis, low set and malformed folds, overcrowding teeth and coarse crackles bilat erally on respiratory exam. Her infectious history includes nine lifetime episo des of pneumonia, one episode of acute otitis media and one episode of influenza B. She has no history of sinusitis, ab scesses, viral or fungal infections, septicemia, or meningitis. Prior lab evaluations were notable for significant hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. Our inpatient evaluation showed decreased CD4, and CD8 counts, and a mild hypogammaglobulinemia. Speci fic antibody titers showed good responses to mumps, rub ella, diphtheria and tetanus, with a mildly decreas ed response to measles. Initial titers to Prevnar were near absent but following immunization she had greater than 70 % protective antibodies to PCV. It was unclear if she had previo usly received the vaccine We continue to follow this patient monthly to trend lymphocyte subsets and immunoglobulins, she has re mained infection free since our initial evaluation. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: CONCLUSIONS We describe a rare cause of secondary immunodeficie ncy. Hennekam Syndrome has been reported in the lit erature roughly 50 times, but never with a focus on immunod eficiency. Hennekam Syndrome should be considered i n any patient with secondary immunodeficiency caused by a PLE with dysmorphic facial features and developmen tal delay.

Case Title: A novel BTK gene mutation, T354I, in a patient X-linked agammaglobulinemia Summary and Lessons X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) from Bruton's tyrosine kinase Mutation in the BTK gene inte rferes with development and function of B-cell. To date, more than 1000 BTK mutations have been identified to be assoc iated with XLA. The patient described is a 55 year old gentleman wh o was referred to our Allergy and Immunology clinic with previous diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID ) since age 4. However over the time he was followe d in the clinic he was noted to have more complications and infecti ons than expected with a CVID patient on prophylact ic antibiotic and IVIG with adequate IgG levels. As well his bloo d work revealed no mature B-cells and therefore the suspicion of X- linked agammaglobulinemia was raised. Hence he unde rwent a BTK gene analysis and was found to have a n ovel T354I missense mutation of BTK gene. 8F, and Y361D/C) have been reported association with aga mmaglobulinemia. Additionally, in silico algorithms (PolyPhen, SIFT) predict T354I to be damaging. Therefore we consider T354I a novel mutation and its presence consistent with a diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Since the XLA diagnosis his IVIG therapy has been adjusted t o 35g q3weeks and he is on prophylactic azithromycin 250mg every other day and is doing quite well with less frequen t infections. This case emphasizes that suspicion for XLA and gen e-study is essential for patients presenting with c linically overlapping disorders that would include XLA as a differential diagnosis. This is especially crucial when a patien t fails to respond appropriately to adequate therapy for their presume d diagnosis. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 55 year old gentleman presented to respiratory am bulatory unit in 2007 with one month history of gre enish-yellow productive cough not responsive to antibiotics, inc luding two courses of cefuroxime, one course of amo xicillin- clavulanate followed by a course of moxifloxacin. A t age 4 he was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia and was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency (CV ID) and was started on intramuscular immunoglobulin and then later switched to IVIG in the 1980s; despite this h e continued to have recurrent sinopulmonary infecti on. He underwent a left lower lobectomy in 1986 for bronchiectasis. His other history included paroxysmal atrial fibril lation and a TIA. His investigations included a CT chest, which revea led volume loss in the left with some focal bronchi ectatic changes and linear densities with some traction bronchiectasis in residual left lung. As well there was some airwa y thickening diffusely and some mucous plugging on the left. His pulmonary function test was consistent with airflo w obstruction, largely reversible post-bronchodilator (consistent with inflammatory airway disease). Sputum cultures had grown Moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumonia Testing for cystic fibrosis and Alpha-1 Antitrypsin were negative. He was then referred to our clinic for further asse ssment and over the 3 years he was followed at the clinic he was noted to have more complications and infections than expe cted with a CVID patient on prophylactic antibiotic (clavulin 500mg bid) and IVIG 25 g monthly, with adequate IgG level s (average of ~11 g/L). Blood work from 2009 had re vealed no mature B-cells and therefore the suspicion of X-lin ked agammaglobulinemia was raised. In 2010 he underwent a BTK gene analysis (by Gene D x DNA Diagnostic Experts), which revealed a novel T 354I missense mutation in the BTK gene, reported as highly likely to be associated with XLA. To our knowledge it has not been published as a mutation, nor has it been reported a s a benign polymorphism. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis that we arrived at was X-linked agamm aglobulinemia (XLA) and since the the diagnosis the patient's IVIG therapy has been adjusted to 35g q3weeks and he is on prophylactic azithromycin 250mg every other day and is doing quite well with less frequent infections. Since it was first described in 1952, XLA has been treated with immunoglobulin (IgG) replacement thera py. IgG replacement reduces infections, need for antibiotic s, end-organ damage and mortality. Dosing of IgG re placement therapy was previously based on specific IgG trough levels however recent consensus recommends that Ig G replacement therapy should be based on the individu al clinical response. Our patient's most recent tro ugh level was 12.1 g/L on 35 g IVIG (every 3 weeks) and he has ha d less frequent sinopulmonary infections. Submission Number: 45 Poster Number: 97 Keyword: Immunodeficiency Author F Summary and Lessons Learned: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder char acterized by potentially life-threatening episodes of angioedema without urticaria persisting for several days. HAE types I and II present with low C4 and low C1 ester ase level/function while type III estrogen-dependent presents with nor mal labs coupled with a family history of swelling or a Factor XII mutation. However, allergists will often encounter patients with history highly suggestive for HAE but normal labs, no family history of angioedema, and no Factor XII mut ation, making encounters, as in the case of the fol lowing patient, very difficult to treat. The patient, a 37-year-old female with a past medic al history significant only for allergic rhinitis, presented with a 7-year history of episodes of e sterase inhibitor concentrate. She reported numero us ED admissions for \"tongue and throat swelling\" without exacerbations. She had been thoroughly ev aluated by two academic institutions with no satisfactory trea tment, and episodes were debilitating to the point of the patient seeking disability approval. Testing for environmen tal, food, and chemical triggers was unrevealing. C 1 esterase inhibitor level/function and C4 were multiple found normal; Factor XII mutation was neg ative. The patient was seen in clinic with confirmed uvula/thr oat swelling and resulting \"hot potato\" voice after exposure to cleaners. She was treated with an Icatibant sample with some improvement and reported a slow return to baseline. During a subsequent attack two months later, a tria l of recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor was administ ered, and symptoms resolved within two hours. At her follow-u p appointment two months later, she reported two fu rther exacerbations that she treated at home with C1 este rase inhibitor concentrate with full symptomatic re solution within hours. Non-histaminergic angioedema is a scenario that all ergists commonly encounter, and HAE should always b e included in the differential. However, when patients do not con form to the guidelines for one of the HAE categorie s, treatment can be difficult and patients can end up going to numer ous specialists and academic institutions, often wi thout relief. This case highlights the potential for traditional HAE t reatments in patients with a history suggestive of HAE but without classic lab findings or family history. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 37-year-old female with a past medical history si gnificant only for allergic rhinitis and no positiv e family history presented with a 7-year history of episodes of lary ngeal edema and glossitis lasting for several days without urticaria. She reported numerous ED admissions for \"tongue and throat swelling\" refractory to corticosteroids, ep inephrine, and antihistamines. She had previously been evaluated b y two academic institutions with no satisfactory tr eatment, and episodes were debilitating to the point that at the time of the initial encounter, the patient was see king disability approval. There seemed to be no specific triggers f or her condition, as chemical patch testing and env ironmental/food prick testing were obtained and found unrevealing. Due to the patient's description of her symptoms, a nd her lack of symptomatic resolution with corticosteroid, epineph rine, and antihistamine medical management, heredit ary angioedema was included in the differential. C1 est erase inhibitor level and function and C4 were thus repeatedly measured but found to be within normal limits, and she also tested negative for Factor XII mutation. T he patient was seen in clinic with confirmed uvula/throat swelling and resulting \"hot potato\" voice on one occasion a fter exposure to cleaners. She was treated with an Icatibant sample with some improvement and reported a slow return to baseline. During a subsequent attack two months later, a tria l of recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor was administ ered and symptoms resolved within two hours. At her follow-u p appointment two months after this incident, she r eported two further exacerbations that she treated at home with C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate with full sympto matic resolution within hours. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient's chief symptoms, laryngeal edema and g with and antihistamines, making anaphylaxis an unlikely diag nosis. Environmental and food prick testing were un remarkable, as was chemical patch testing. While hereditary angioe dema was considered a viable diagnosis, the patient lacked any significant family history, and C1 esterase inhibit or level and function and C4 were repeatedly measur ed and found to be within normal limits. Factor XII mutation testing w as also negative. However, symptoms were highly con sistent with HAE. After being exposed to cleaning agents at work on one occasion, the patient presented to clinic d uring an episode of uvula/throat swelling and resulting \"hot potato\" voice. There, recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor wa s administrated on a trial basis, and she achieved full symptomatic resolution within two hours. The patient successfu lly treated two exacerbations afterward with C1 esterase inhibitor concentration administered at home and was highly s atisfied with the results. At her most recent follow-up appointme nt one month ago, the patient reported immense impr ovement in her quality of life after establishing the diagnosi s and treatment of her condition.

Leiding, MD University of South Florida/Johns Hopkins All Child ren's Hospital Case Title: CTLA-4 Haploinsufficiency Presenting in a Child wit h Very Early-Onset Colitis Summary and Lessons Learned: This is a 2-year-old boy of African American herita ge with multiple congenital malformations who was d iagnosed with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, which proved to be resistant to treatment. Subsequent tes ting revealed a heterozygous mutation in exon 1 of CTLA4. This vari ant has not been previously reported in the literat ure in individuals with CTLA4-related disease. The patient remains in active treatment, and treatment with abatacept is b eing initiated. The protein cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA- 4) is an essential negative regulator of T cells. H eterozygous mutations in CTLA4 cause a disease of immune dysreg ulation. Clinical presentation is variable and may be characterized by enteropathy, hypogammaglobulinemia, granulomatou s lymphocytic interstitial lung disease, infiltration in non-lymphoid organs, autoimmune cyt openias, and recurrent infections. Inflammatory bow el disease may be associated with certain variants in CTLA4, but t he literature remains limited, both by number of pa pers published as well as by ethnic subsets studied. Clinicians who a re presented with children who have early-onset col itis, and particularly inflammatory bowel disease that is dif ficult to treat, should consider possible genetic a bnormalities, such as CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency, as these can impact ther apeutic decision-making and outcomes. Patient Presentation and Testing: This is a 2-year-old boy with diagnosed with very early-o nset inflammatory bowel disease at six months of ag e. He underwent cloacal exstrophy closure, omphalocele re pair, and colostomy placement in the first week of life. At six months of age, he presented with dark tarry stools. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed polyps, i leitis, and colitis. He was p-ANCA positive and started on sulf asalazine. Unfortunately, he continued to have symp toms suggestive of active colitis, prompting a change to prednisone and azathioprine. Despite therapy, his colitis per sisted leading to chronic bloody diarrhea and growth failure. Initial immune evaluation consisted of a normal complete b lood count, by flow c ytometry showed a moderately elevated percentage of FOXP3+CD 25+ cells in the CD4+ T cell population, but the re gulatory T cell immunophenotype was normal. Because suspicion was h igh for a monogenic immunologic disease to explain his symptoms, genetic sequencing was performed. A candi date gene panel was sequenced by Next Generation Se quencing, and a heterozygous mutation in exon 1 of CTLA4 (c.2 3G>A; p.Arg8Gln) was found. This variant has not be en previously reported but is predicted to be pathogenic in Exac and PolyPhen databases. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient's diagnosis of CTLA-4 haploinsufficienc y associated with very early-onset inflammatory bow el disease has provided opportunity for targeted treatment of his specific molecular defect. Given his poor response to treatment thus far, the patient will be started on abatacept. Abat acept is FDA approved for the treatment of rheumato id arthritis but has been used successfully for the treatment of dis ease-related manifestations of CTLA-4 haploinsuffic iency. Abatacept is a protein formed the IgG1 Fc re gion linked with the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 ; it replaces the defective protein in CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency. In addition, given other manifestations of CTLA-4 hapl oinsufficiency including lymphoproliferative disease in non-lympho id organs, particularly the brain and lung, we have initiated further evaluation of these organs to evaluate for disease- specific manifestations.

We describe a case of an infant boy who presented with generalized erythroderma and severe epidermal desquamation since birth. It was believed that he h ad congenital ichthyosis and no primary immunodeficiency was cons idered until after the second episode of Staphylocc ocal sepsis, when the child was already 70-days old. He also had developed severe failure to thrive and milk intole rance. Laboratory evaluation indicated probable Netherton Syndrome, w hich was eventually confirmed by the finding of SPI NK5 gene mutation. Patients with Netherton Syndrome have very high mor tality in infancy due to susceptibility to Staphylo coccal sepsis, pneumonia, chronic enteropathy, failure to thrive a nd electrolyte abnormalities (1), thus, early treat ment is essential for successful patient care. The list of diseases prese nting with erythroderma in infancy is not extensive ; it includes Sj\u00f6gren- Larsson Syndrome, KID Syndrome, SCID in the form of Omenn Syndrome or GvH, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, a nd Netherton Syndrome (2). Thus, if in our patient's c ase a diagnostic work up had focused on the key fin ding of erythroderma, the diagnosis of primary immunodefici ency could had been achieved before the onset of it s florid telltale signs such as severe infections and failure to thri ve. Implementation of appropriate skin care and inf usions of IVIG improved our patient's skin condition and weight ga in. Patient Presentation and Testing: The infant was born at term gestation to consanguin eous parents via C-section performed due to presenc e of fetal tachycardia. Baby was noticed to have generalized e pidermal desquamation, underlying erythema, alopeci a, and foul- smelling skin. His birth weight was 3300 grams. Th e baby was admitted to NICU due to respiratory dist ress which resolved after 1 week of mechanical ventilation fol lowed by 1 week of CPAP. Initially the skin rash wa s thought to be infectious in nature. The rash was then diagnosed a s seborrheic dermatitis, and was treated for 3 week s with topical steroids without improvement. Subsequently, a diagn osis of ichthyosis was suggested, for which a non-s yndromic ichthyosis genetic panel was requested to support t his diagnosis, yet it came back negative. The patient also displayed poor sucking and was fed through an NG tube. He had poor weigth gain despit e receiving additional calories by fortifying human breast milk . This was later replaced by high caloric cow's mil k formula. By 2 months of age the baby had gained only 75g since bi rth and the decision was made to place a gastrosto my tube. Throughout his NICU course, the baby developed one UTI with E. cloacae, two Staphylococcal bacteremias , one episode of Influenza and episode of Para-Influenza, whi ch prompted Immunology consultation. Immunology service evaluated the infant at 70 days of life. Due to the failure to thrive, infectious h istory and parental consanguinity, a primary immunodeficiency was suspe cted. Due to the skin appearance, Netherton syndrom e (NS) was considered the most likely diagnosis. Given our pat ient\u00b4s alopecia it was not possible to evaluate for the presence of trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair), a sign freq uently found in patients with NS, however the suspi cion of NS was further enhanced when it was noted that patient had eosinophilia, albeit transient. Eosinophilia appea red to be related to the source of nutrition, starting in the first week of life while the child was on breast milk, wo rsened when Human Milk Fortifier, a cow's milk-based product, was add ed to his diet, and resolved after starting hydroly zed formula. This suggested a non IgE- mediated cow's milk allergy. C ommonly observed in NS IgE-sensitization to milk, e gg white, peanut, soy, wheat, and cod fish was not found on his RAST test. Furthermore the patient also displayed significantl y elevated IgE 378 IU/ml (0 -15) and IgA 121 mg% (4 .4-73); both common findings in NS. He was found to have normal counts of lymphocytes - T,- B and NK cells, normal IgG and IgM, and normal NK cells functions. This last finding was unexpected, since NK functions are often impaired in patients with NS . The majority of patients with NS have antibody deficiency, manifest ed as the inability to respond to polysaccharide an tigens. This immune response is T-cell independent and is typica lly weak until age of 2 years, and as such was not evaluated in our patent. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Diagnosis was made by single gene sequencing. It re vealed that the patient is homozygous in the SPINK5 gene for a variant designated c.238dup, which is predicted to result in a frameshift and premature protein termin ation (p.Ala80Glyfs*19). This variant has been reported t o be causative for Netherton Syndrome. Patients with NS have very high mortality during th e first year of life for which the decision was mad e to start the administration of IVIG without waiting for the gene tic confirmation of the diagnosis. The patient rece ived 400 mg/kg of IVIG every 2 weeks twice, and subsequently every th ree weeks. Patients with NS have severe skin barrier defect fo r which we decided to apply meticulous skin care us ing our experience with the care for patients with atopic dermatitis. It consisted of soaking of the whole body in water for 10 minutes once daily, using liquid cleanser with pH 5 at the end o f the bath, immediately followed by the application of Petrolatum, spread (in only one movement) from head to toes. Pe trolatum administration was repeated every 4 hours around o'clock. The skin appearance improved after two weeks of tre atment, having much less desquamation, yet with no significant change in the erythroderma. Enteral feeding pathway (G-tube) with hydrolyzed fo rmula, better skin care, and IVIG provided the appr opriate setting for better weight gain. The baby was discharged fro m the NICU on his 91st day of life gaining 200 gram s since the beginning of treatment 3 weeks earlier. Skin care and infusion of IVIG every 3 weeks contin ued as outpatient. There has been remarkable improv ement in skin appearance and increased weight gain velocity, alth ough he remains below the 3rd percentile at 9 month s of age. REFERENCES: (1) Renner et al, 2009.

Mousallem, M.D., Wake Forest School of Med icine, Duke University Medical Center Case Title: Asymptomatic Granulomatous and Intersti Variable Immuno deficiency (CVID) Summary and Lessons Learned: We report a 30 year old female diagnosed with commo n variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and biopsy prove n granulomatous and lymphocytic interstitial lung dis ease (GLILD). She has had chest CTs that showed per sistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy and patchy reticulonodu lar infiltrates in both lungs. She has been complet ely asymptomatic without any respiratory symptoms and h er pulmonary function testing has shown no evidence of restrictive or obstructive defect. GLILD is associated with reduced survival rates and is a risk factor for the development of B cell lym phomas. There are a few published reports regarding the treatment strat egies for GLILD. Combination chemotherapy with Ritu ximab and Azathioprine improved pulmonary function and decrea sed radiographic abnormalities in patients. However , the lack of pulmonary symptoms and her normal pulmonary functio n testing with normal diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) posed a dilemma on whether to treat her at t his point or to closely monitor her. Given lower su rvival rates in CVID patients with GLILD compared to CVID patients without GLILD, an argument was made for active trea tment. However, it remained unclear if treatment would imp rove survival. Given patient's younger age, treatme nt of GLILD and possible prevention of future complications was an important consideration. Ultimately, the decision w as made to closely observe the patient with serial imaging, PF Ts, and close clinical monitoring by Immunology, Pu lmonology, and Hematology. This case provided several notable and interesting teaching points: - CVID patients are at risk for noninfectious compl ications due to immune dysregulation. - The differential diagnosis of the above pulmonary imaging findings include infection, malignancy (ly mphoma), GLILD and sarcoidosis. It is important to obtain tissue b iopsy to have the correct diagnosis to recommend th e appropriate treatment. - There is no published literature regarding the de cisions to actively treat or observe asymptomatic G LILD in CVID patients. Any decision regarding treatment or obser vation may need to be made on a case-by-case basis. Patient Presentation and Testing: We report a 30 year old female who was referred to our clinic for evaluation of immunodeficiency. Her medical history was significant for recurrent sinopulmonary infecti ons. Laboratory evaluation was significant for IgG of IgA of a nd pneumococcal antibody titers, and normal T cell proliferation response to mitogens and tetanus antigen. Flow cyto metry showed a slightly low B cell number and perce ntage (4.5% B cells, 50 B cells). She was diagnosed with CVID an d started on immunoglobulin replacement. Previous chest x-rays have shown persistent bibasil ar opacities, so a chest CT was obtained to evaluat e lymphadenop athy and patchy reticulonodular infiltrates in both lungs. These findings persisted after treatment with antibiotics . Given concern for GLILD or lymphoma, an open lung biopsy was obtained. The pathology showed lymphocytic intersti tial pneumonitis, acute and organizing pneumonia, a nd sarcoid-like granulomas. These are all findings consistent with CVID associated GLILD. Interestingly, cultures from the open lung biopsy showed slow growing Mycobacterium Avium-Intr acellulare (MAI). Ziehl-Neelsen staining acid-fast bacilli were visualized. Evalu ation by Infectious Diseases recommended no treatme nt and closer observation of the MAI given that she was asymptoma tic (no fevers, weight loss, cough, sputum producti on or shortness of breath). Given the discordance between the microbiology resu lts and the staining results, the pathologist decid ed to further investigate the nature of the lymphoid proliferatio n in the lung tissue. A clonal B-cell population wa s detected. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) encoding region in situ hybridizat ion and Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) immunohistochem istry were performed on biopsy specimen and were both negative . Given the clonal B-cell population and concern fo r lymphoma, a PET CT scan was performed which showed diffuse lymp hadenopathy with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the thoracic, cervical, and abdominal regions. A fine n eedle aspiration of a retroperitoneal lymph node wi th high FDG uptake showed pathology favoring reactive process. Follow- up CT scans showed that the lymphadenopathy is stab le. PFTs and DLCO have been normal. She remains asymptomatic fro m a pulmonary standpoint. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with CVID with GLILD. GLI LD is a term used to describe a variety of noninfec tious pulmonary pathology findings found in CVID patients, lymphocytic nclude dyspnea, splenomegaly, and a restrictive defect fou nd on pulmonary function testing. Patients with GLI LD exhibit reduced survival and higher morbidity. Although no established guidelines exist for treatment of GLILD , successful therapies have include corticosteroids, steroid spa ring agents such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, met hotrexate, and rituximab. These therapies showed improvement in cl inical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities for symptomatic patients. Combination chemotherapy with Rituximab a nd Azathioprine improved pulmonary function and dec reased radiographic abnormalities in patients with CVID an d GLILD. Although this patient exhibited abnormal radiograph ic findings, she did not have any pulmonary symptom s (no cough, dyspnea, wheezing, or chest tightness). Her pulmona ry function testing did not show any restrictive or obstructive defect. Her DLCO remains normal. Given that she was totally asymptomatic from a pulm onary standpoint, we debated whether to treat the p atient with combination chemotherapy or to carefully observe th e patient. Given her younger age of presentation, a ctive treatment of her GLILD was considered, with the goal of preve nting future pulmonary complications related to GLI LD. GLILD is a risk factor for the development of B cell lymphomas and there was a clonal B cell population detected on her lung biopsy. After careful discussion with the patient a nd multiple specialty providers (pulmonology, hemat ology), the decision was made to closely observe her and follow her clinical status, perform serial imaging and pe riodic complete PFTs with DLCO.

Koneti Rao M.D. National Institutes of Health Na tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Case Title: A Tale of Two Diseases: LRBA Deficiency and Sickle Cell Disease Summary and Lessons Learned: Our patient was a 16-year-old African-American fema le with history of sickle cell disease diagnosed at birth by newborn screen. Her medical history was complicated by recu rrent acute chest syndrome and sickle cell pain cri ses as well as recurrent strep pharyngitis leading to tonsillectom y. The patient was doing well on hydroxyurea (hemog lobin 7 g/dl) until the age of 15 when she began to have very res istant anemia (hemoglobin nadir 4.6 g/dl) and lymph adenopathy. Her recurrent anemia was treated with prednisone, I VIG, and packed red blood cell transfusions without significant improvement. When she was 16 years old she underwen t further work-up of her anemia and was found to be direct antiglobulin test (DAT) positive. She began receivi ng rituximab and prolonged corticosteroid tapers wi th only mild improvement in anemia. Because of the resistant ane mia, and evidence of autoimmunity, immunological wo rkup was pursued and revealed elevated IgG of 5390 mg/dL. Ph ysical exam revealed hepatomegaly which was confirm ed by CT scan of the abdomen. It was also surmised that her spleen was relatively enlarged when compared to oth er patients with sickle cell disease. Bone marrow biopsy was pe rformed and showed no evidence of malignancy; cytog enetics were normal. Lymph node biopsy was also performed and sh owed reactive hyperplasia without evidence of Epste in Barr virus infection. Flow cytometry revealed low memory B cel ls and decreased class switched and non-class switc hed memory B cells. Ultimately ion torrent gene sequencing revea led two LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide-responsive mutations (heterozygous missense and heterozygous splicing) that were predicted to be deleterious. Th e patient was trialed on mycophenolate mofetil but ultimately pla ced on abatacept to increase CTLA4 levels and ultim ately target her underlying LRBA deficiency. This patient serves as an atypical example of a patient with LRBA deficien cy in addition to sickle cell disease, thus representing a rare group of patients born with two underlying genetic mutat ions. The lesson learned from this case is that if a patient's prese ntation seems atypical or uncharacteristically seve her lymphadenopathy, elevated IgG, hepatosplenomegaly a nd anemia), one should further investigate whether other disease processes could potentially be contributing . Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 16 yo African-American female with history of sickle cell disease diagnosed via newbo rn screening and recurrent strep pharyngitis resulting in tonsillect omy that presented to us with new onset resistant a nemia, lymphadenopathy, elevated IgG, and hepatosplenomega ly. Past medical history also included recurrent ac ute chest syndrome and pain crises. Family history is signifi cant for a mother and father with sickle cell trait . The patient does not drink, smoke, or do illicit drugs. Due to the autoimmune cytopenias, further anemia wo rkup revealed direct antiglobulin test positivity a s well as evidence of hemolysis (elevated reticulocyte count, indirect bilirubin, and LDH along with low levels of haptoglobin). Immunoglobulin levels were performed due to history of recurrent strep pharyngitis and evidence of aut oimmunity and revealed elevated IgG level. Flow cytometry reveale d low memory B cells and decreased class switched a nd non-class switched memory B cells. Ultimately ion torrent gen e sequencing revealed two LRBA (Lipopolysaccharide- responsive vesicle trafficking, beach and anchor-containing) mutations (heterozygous missense and heterozygous splicing) that were predicted to be deleterious. Th ese mutations were thought to be the cause of her new onset autoi mmune hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Though she had a history of rec urrent pharyngeal infections consistent with LRBA d eficiency, these resolved with tonsillectomy. She lacked the c haracteristic low immunoglobulins that accompany LR BA deficiency, and this was thought to be secondary to one mutatio n being a splicing mutation. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with LRBA deficiency, whi ch explains her autoimmune hemolytic anemia, infect ions, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patien t was initially placed on mycophenolate mofetil as a general immunosuppressant. The patient was unable to reach therapeutic levels of this drug and anemic episodes continued. Because it is known that LRBA protein helps with tr afficking of CTLA4 protein; the patient was ultimat ely placed on abatacept infusions to increase levels of CTLA4. Wh ile on abatacept, the patient's hemoglobin stabiliz ed and rate of hospitalization improved significantly. Her relativ e splenomegaly improved as well.

Initial immunoglobulins at 20 months of age were, in mg/dL (normal range): IgG 309 (345-121 3), IgA 47 (34-206). She had prote ctive titers to diphtheria, tetanus, H. influenza. Her case was man aged conservatively. She continued to develop recu rrent sinopulmonary infections. Vomiting and diarrhea at 30 months of age led to hospital admission, with st ool PCR positive for Salmonella. She was treated with antibiotics an d IVIG 6 gm was initiated, and later switched to SQ IG with significant improvement. After 16 months, Ig levels normalized and Ig replacement therapy was successfully discont inued. Patient B is a 10-month-old male evaluated for a ch ronic cough and a family history of a possible immu nodeficiency. Initial immunoglobulins at presentation, (40-143). B and T lymphocyte subsets were within normal limits. Poor responses to Pneumococcus (Prevnar) but prote ctive titers to diphtheria and tetanus were noted. Amoxicillin prop hylaxis 200 mg/day was started. Bloody stool develo ped at 13 months of age, culture positive for Salmonella mont evideo, requiring ED evaluation and hospital admiss ion. Blood cultures also grew Salmonella montevideo. Repeat im munoglobulins during this hospitalization were as f ollows, mg/dL (reference range as above): IgG 217, IgA 22, IgM 52 . IVIG 5 gm was initiated in hospital. Sequence ana lysis of the X-linked BTK gene was negative. Upon 4 week follow up his Ig G was 549, IgA <15, IgM 33. Multiple questions are raised by these cases: the u nique gastrointestinal pathogen, when most appropri ate to initiate replacement Ig, and how to define the duration of r eplacement therapy. Patient Presentation and Testing: Both patients were initially managed conservatively . Once a severe infection developed, IVIG was initi ated. Important tests included measurement of immunoglobulins (Univ ersity Health Care System, Children's Hospital of G eorgia), bacterial cultures and PCR, lymphocyte studies (Chi ldren's Hospital of Georgia), and BTK gene sequenc e analysis (GeneDx). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our patients each presented with serious Salmonella infections with presumptive transient hypogammaglo bulinemia of infancy, managed conservatively. During hospitaliza tion, immunoglobulin replacement was started, stabi lizing these clinical courses. Patient A was able to discontinue Ig replacement after Ig normalization; Patient B c ontinues to be followed, on replacement Ig.

Summary and Lessons Learned: A 7 months old male presented at age of 3 months wi th severe disseminated viral infection. Extensive i mmunological work-up showed low T cells numbers and function, ab sent isotype-switched memory B cells and low immuno globulins except normal IgM. Genetic testing revealed pathoge nic mutation in CD40LG gene. Patient diagnosed with XHIGM and started on IVIG with ganciclovir and cytogam for CM V pneumonitis and viremia and prophylactic antibiot ics for complications that may occur with XHIGM syndrome. C MV-specific cytotoxic T cells therapy was considere d before elective bone marrow transplantation. XHIGM is a combined immunodeficiency caused by pat hogenic mutations in the CD40LG gene. CD40L abnorma lities effect T cell interaction with B, dendritic and nat ural killer cells and neutrophils and result in abn ormal cell class switching, cytokine secretion and neutrophils matur ation. It should be suspected in any patient with f eatures of combined immunodeficiency even in case of normal Ig M level. Diagnosis is made by gene sequencing and f low cytometry for expression of CD40L on stimulated T c ells. Indication and timing of HSCT is unclear. It is published that overall survival between patients treated with or w ithout HCST is similar with improvement quality of life for those transplanted before 5 years (de La Morena). Untrans planted, patients may develop sclerosing cholangiti s or malignancy that is associated with worse outcome. Here, we are considering elective HSCT once lung disease is imp roved, as fully matched sibling is available. The implications of t ransplant from a donor sister with carrier state sh ould be taken into consideration. Patient Presentation and Testing: A full-term 3 month-old was brought to medical atte ntion for rhinorrhea and cough and respiratory pane l detected rhinovirus and RSV. Progressive respiratory distres s resulted in hospitalization and need for mechanic al ventilation. Disseminated cytomegalovirus (CMV) was present in b ronchoalveaolar lavage (BAL) of lung, retina and bl ood and patient was started on ganciclovir and Cytogam. Due to the extent of CMV dissemination, primary immunodeficien cy was suspected. Two male family members died with early childhood infections on the mother side suggestive of an X-linked inheritance. Based on history and presentation, differential dia gnosis included X-linked combined immunodeficiencie s such as severe (SCID), NEMO, IPEX and XH IGM for neutropenia an d lymphopenia; immunoglobulin levels were very low ex cept for normal IgM; lymphocytes enumeration showed low number of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells but normal for B cells; Proliferation with mitogens an d antigen were low. NK cell function was persistently low with normal C D107a mobilization assay. Genetic testing for NEMO was normal. Newborn screening for SCID was normal. Flow cytomet ry confirmed normal number and FOXP3 expression of regulatory T cells. However, B cell compartment showed absent isotype-switched memory B cells and pointed towards X-linked hyperIgM syndrome (XHIGM).Flow cytometry for CD40L after T cell stimulation test was abnormal and high ly suggestive for HIGM. Sanger sequencing of CD40LG revealed a pa thogenic intronic splice site mutation c.288+1G>A. Both sister and mother are carriers for the same CD40LG mutation. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient was diagnosed with X-HIGM syndrome. He was placed on immunoglobulin replacemement threapy and continued on ganciclovir. Currently lung disease wi th cystic bronchiectasis is extensive, partly relat ed to CMV infection and partly to barotrauma on ventilator. CMV-specifi c cytotoxic T cells therapy was considered to maxim ize lung CMV clearance but follow up BAL became negative and the refore this therapy is currently in hold. In prepar ation for elective bone marrow transplantation from sister as donor (1 0/10 HLA match), patient continues prophylaxis for Pneumocystis en intermittently for neutropenia. The timing of hematopoietic stem c ell transplant (HSCT) depends on improvement in lun g disease and function.

Wu, MD, MSCR Primary Author Institution: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Additional Authors: Diana B. McShane, MD Case Title: A crossroad between immunodeficiency and autoinflam mation: PAPA syndrome Summary and Lessons Learned: Our patient was referred for possible immunodeficie ncy with history of recurrent purulent otitis media , septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, cutaneous al cellulitis. Given synovial fluid and abscess cul tures were repeatedly negative and lack of antimicrobial respo nse, an autoinflammatory disorder was considered. P STPIP1 sequencing revealed a pathogenic heterozygous mutat ion, confirming a diagnosis of pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome. Our patient achieved clinical remission with the TNF-alpha inhi bitor adalimumab. Our case emphasizes that providers need a high inde x of suspicion for an autoinflammatory disorder, pa rticularly when sites of inflammation are sterile. Our case also hi ghlights the possibility of ocular involvement, not previously well- described in PAPA syndrome, and adds to the existin g few reports on the effectiveness of TNF-alpha inh ibition in PAPA syndrome. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 12-year-old female was referred for possible immu nodeficiency. She experienced recurrent purulent ot itis media, requiring multiple PE tube placements. At 6-years-o ld, she had 3 episodes of presumed elbow septic art hritis and osteomyelitis. Synovial fluid analyses had >100,000 WBC/mcL with >95% neutrophils. Cultures remained n egative. She was treated with antimicrobials without response. A t 9-years-old, she developed cutaneous abscesses an d preseptal cellulitis refractory to antimicrobials. Cultures a gain remained negative. Her medical history was not able for juvenile arthritis and cystic acne. Social and family histor ies were otherwise unremarkable. Given the lack of antimicrobial response, a lesiona l skin biopsy was performed. It demonstrated areas of dense dermal neutrophilic inflammation suggestive of a neutrophi lic dermatosis. history of pyogenic steril e arthritis, neutrophilic dermatosis, and acne, an autoinflammat ory condition was considered. Her phenotype seemed most consistent with PAPA syndrome. PSTPIP1 sequencing d emonstrated a previously described pathogenic heter ozygous mutation c.688G>A in exon 10 leading to A230T. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our patient was diagnosed with PAPA syndrome, a rar e autoinflammatory disorder characterized by steril e, erosive arthritis, neutrophilic dermatosis, and cystic acne . As in our patient, the natural history is cutaneo us features dominate and arthritis subsides during adolescence. Given it s rarity, there are no adequate trials regarding tr eatment. Data has demonstrated that PSTPIP1 mutations result in dysre gulated IL-1 production. Anakinra, a recombinant IL -1 receptor antagonist, has been effective, but requires daily subcutaneous injections. Data has also shown increa sed TNF-alpha production by stimulated PBMCs from patients, and t here are cases where TNF-alpha inhibition has been successful. Our patient was treated with the TNF-alpha inhibitor ad alimumab, resulting in clearing of acne and pyoderm a gangrenosum lesions. Moreover, she has not developed any new py oderma gangrenosum lesions, preseptal inflammation, or arthritis.

Echocardiogram demonstrated left ventricular dilata tion and severe dysfunction with restrictive diasto lic filling and reduced ejection fraction. She was diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy secondary to probable vi ral etiology. Due to history of recurrent pneumonia, she was refe rred to the Allergy and Immunology Department for s uspected immunodeficiency. IgG, IgA and IgM levels were all decreased and she was diagnosed with common variabl e immunodeficiency (CVID) and started on monthly intr avenous immunoglobulin infusions (IVIG). Over the next four years she developed worsening congestive heart failure an d underwent heart transplant. The second case is a 38-year-old old male, previous ly diagnosed with non-specific interstitial pneumon ia by lung biopsy. He had progressively worsening dyspnea and cough an d steadily declining lung function measured by spir ometry. Two years prior to presenting to the Allergy and Immuno logy Department, he developed recurrent pneumonia a nd worsening symptoms requiring intermittent use of su pplemental oxygen. Due to frequency of infections, immunoglobulin levels were ordered and IgG and IgA were low. He was found to have low pneumococcal ti ters despite having received polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine 2 y ears prior and showed complete lack of response to booster vaccine. He was diagnosed with CVID and started on monthly IVIG. Although the frequency of infection s decreased, his dyspnea drastically worsened over the following 6 m onths and he underwent successful bilateral lung tr ansplant at the age of 42. Following organ transplantation, both patients cont inue to receive monthly IVIG while on immunosuppres sive therapy. Although their risk of infection is increased, neit her patient has had any major infections, complicat ions or hospitalizations following transplant. This case s eries was written with the intention of elucidating the potential complications that can arise from the diagnosis of the CVID and highlight the role of organ transplant ation with this particular primary immunodeficiency. Very few cases of solid organ transplant associated with CVID hav e been reported in the literature. This case series suggests that organ failure may have been due to CVID. Despite treatment of CVID with IVIG, organ damage was irreversible but CVID d id not preclude successful organ transplantation. These patients should be followed closely to determine their long term outcomes. Further research within the practic e of Allergy and Immunology will be an essential tool in diagnosis a nd management of CVID associated with organ transpl antation. Patient Presentation and Testing: In the case regarding the female who underwent hear t transplant, she was referred to Allergy and Immun ology Department for the evaluation of possible immune de ficiency after 10 months of cough and dyspnea, foll owing a pneumonia treated with multiple courses of antibiot ics, inhalers and systemic steroids. Prior to her initial encounter, she had been evaluated by Pulmonary and Cardiology consults. Chest radiograph showed an interstitial pattern and pulmonary function tests revealed decreased total l ung capacity (56%) and markedly decreased diffusion capacity (49%), and she was diagnosed with interstitial lung diseas e of unknown etiology. An echocardiogram demonstrat ed a severely dysfunctional and dilated left ventricle, restricte d diastolic filling, and a reduced ejection fractio n of 20%. Cardiology evaluation led to a diagnosis of nonischemic cardio myopathy secondary to probable viral etiology. Her course was complicated by coronary artery disease with stent p lacement in LAD artery, subsequent ventricular fibr illation with cardiac arrest during a hospitalization for pancrea titis requiring defibrillator (AICD) placement and recurrent pneumonia. At the time of her initial encounter it was unclear if recurrent pneumonias were infectious or inflamm atory in nature. If the etiology was infectious, immune deficiency was probable. If recurrent pneumonias were due to an i nflammatory process, an autoimmune or vasculitic process was mo re likely. Her past medical history was only signi ficant for partial colectomy secondary to diverticulosis and there was no history of recurrent infections prior to her on set of symptoms. Laboratory evaluation was ordered to help distingui sh between an immune deficiency versus an autoimmun e or vasculitic process, including complete blood count, inflammatory markers, metabolic in electrophoresis, immunoglobulin factor, anti-nuclear antigen, cry oglobulin, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis C antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. IgG, IgA and IgM levels were all decreased and remainder of laboratory work up was otherwise unremarkable. These findings sugg ested the recurrent pneumonias and cardiomyopathy were likely secondary to an immune deficiency, specifically CV ID. The second case described the male who received bil ateral lung transplant and was referred to Allergy and Immunology Department for the evaluation of recurrent infectio ns, with the prior diagnosis of non-specific inters titial pneumonia made 8 years prior by lung biopsy. Yearly pulmonar y function tests demonstrated steadily declining lu ng function. He was referred to Rheumatology Department for an elev ated rheumatoid factor and family history significa nt for a sister with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. He developed my algias, daily low grade fevers and paresthesias rai sing suspicion of a connective tissue disease. His symptoms had signifi cantly deteriorated over the previous year requirin g supplemental oxygen and he was on immunosuppressant therapy with mycophenalate mofetil and prednisone. Due to recu rrent upper respiratory tract infections, immunoglobulins were ordered by the Pulmonary Department. IgG and IgA levels were found to be decreased. At his initial encounter, his recurrent respiratory infections were thought to be due to his underlyin g lung disease and/or use of immunosuppressant therapy. In order to eval uate for possible immune deficiency pneumococcal se rotypes were ordered to measure response to polyvalent pneumococ cal vaccine he had received 2 years prior. Serotyp es were found to be low and he was given pneumococcal booster vac cine to which he showed complete lack of response. This confirmed the diagnosis of CVID as the etiology of recurrent infections. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: In both cases, the patients were diagnosed with CVI D by Allergy and Immunology Department after months of recurrent respiratory infections, and close follow up with mu ltiple sub-specialists. Following the diagnosis of CVID, they were started on monthly IVIG therapy which reduced their infection rates. Despite this, both patients cont inued to have worsening organ function, requiring solid organ tra nsplants. Since their transplants, the patients ha ve been on immunosuppressive therapy, in addition to IVIG, and neither patient has had any major complication, in fection or hospitalization. These cases highlight the delicat e balance which must be achieved in the management of this unique subset of CVID patients: the use of IVIG to prevent infection/protect donor organs and immunosuppressi ve therapy to avoid graft versus host disease.

T here is a strong family history of autoimmune disea ses; Mother has ulcerative colitis, diagnosis lupus for an interferonopathy as numerous autoinflam matory syndromes are now known to be due to excessive inte rferon production. His particular presentation was suggestive of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS). A AGS gene panel demonstrated a ADAR mutation indicating his diagno sis is AGS with a ADAR mutation. This gene events degradation of double stranded RNA causing an anti-viral RNA-li ke interferon response and autoimmunity. This case demonstrates the importance of considering monogenic immune dysr egulatory disorders and early investigations to improve patie nt care. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient at 14 months of age had regression of motor and verbal skills, he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. At 2 years of age he had Kawasaki with coronary involvement. Between 2 and 5 years of age he had pneumonia 4 ti mes, 3 times required IV antibiotics. At 5 years old he had idi opathic thrombocytopenic purpura and at 10 years of age influenza virus induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia. At 12 years o f age he was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythema tous (SLE): active, s nephritis, chilblain lupus and seizures. A cat s can of his brain showed bilateral periventricular calcification and calcifi cation in the polyclonal hypergam maglobulinemia on immunofixation. Vaccine-specific ab production was impaired measles, rubella vaccine s after MMRV booster and r 13. Chronic COOMBS positivity. Lymphocyte subsets are normal by immune phenotyping, with elevated 3% of d ouble negative T cells (CD4-/8-/ TCR). Repeatedly borde rline low na\u00efve T emigrant mitogens, anti-C D3 and in mixed lymphocyte culture. Genetic testing showed a normal karyotype. NGS panel for 180 PID-related g enes: Likely pathogenic variance in 3 genes: NOD2, NLRP3 and NCF 2 which all may contribute to an increased risk of autoimmune disease. Array CGH ruled out big deletions/homozygosity. Hi s presentation of developmental regression and mono genic lupus prompted a Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome NGS SAMHD1, : pathogenic heterozygous variant c.3019G>A(p.Gly10 07Arg). This was a de novo mutation as his parents do not carry variant. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Current treatment includes prednisone and mycopheno late which is standard treatment for lupus, however , there has been no remission of lupus nephritis. Improvement was seen after sta rting 1g/kg of IVIG monthly, there was no protocol but was tried as standard treatment was ineffective. The ADAR mutati on causes a amplified interferon response, targeted therapy against the interferon receptor signaling molecule JAK1/2 is the current treatment of choice. Our pati ent will start JAX1/2 inhibitor once funding is secured, this will occur in the next month.

She had a prior history of left inguinal lymphadenitis. Physical examination revealed a draining fistula a t the base of the neck, diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy and 2 healed ingui nal scars. Laboratory evaluation included a normal CBC with (DHR) assay demonstrated a greatly reduced, but not absent respiratory burst. Culture s of the draining fistula yielded skin flora. MRI demonstrat ed a right cervical fistula connecting with a retro pharyngeal phlegmon. Colonoscopy revealed mild inflammatory bowel diseas e. Based on the result of the DHR assay, the patient w as diagnosed with Chronic Granulomatous Disease. Sh e was started on antibiotics and low dose corticosteroids. The pa tient had a complete resolution of the fistula and diarrhea. She is currently undergoing reduced intensity conditioning in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell reces sive (AR) causes of CGD, did not reveal pathogenic mutations. There are reported rare cases of CGD in which DNA s equencing does not reveal pathogenic mutations but protein expression of one of the subunits of the NADPH oxid ase complex is abnormal. Consequently, Western blot analysis of p22phox, p47phox and p67phox demonstrated undetect able p47phox expression, confirming the diagnosis o f CGD. CGD is a primary immunodeficiency due to pathogenic mutations in one of the subunits of NADPH oxidase, which is responsible for the respiratory burst in monocytes and neutrophils. In the absence of a respiratory bu rst, phagocytic cells are unable to kill catalase positive bacteria and fungi leading to recurrent pyogenic infections . 65% of CGD is due to pathogenic mutations in the CYBB (encodes p91 phox) gene, which is the cause of X-linked CGD. The AR f orms of CGD are due to pathogenic mutations in one of three oth er genes encoding subunits of NADPH oxidase: NCF1, NCF2 and CYBA. It is a unique and rare case because the patient pr esented with classic CGD with an abnormal DHR assay of the autosomal recessive CGD v ariants was negative, yet Western blot analysis of the NADPH oxidase complex revealed absent p47 phox expression . We speculate that her mutation is likely in one o f the regulatory genes (such as the promoter region) which is quite unusual. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 4-year-old Chinese female, adopted and brought to the United States at age 3, was referred for evalu ation of a chronic right cervical fistula since age 1 and chronic diar rhea. She had a prior history of left inguinal lymp hadenitis and chronic diarrhea. Family history and vaccination history we re unknown. Physical examination at the time of ar rival revealed a draining fistula at the base of the right neck, dif fuse cervical lymphadenopathy and 2 healed scars in the left inguinal region. Based on the clinical presentation, chronic granulo matous disease (CGD) was felt to be the most likely diagnosis. However, in the absence of culture data, chronic my cobacterial infection due to defects in the IL-12/I FNpathway (Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease) was also high in the differential diagnosis. Other considerations included other defects in neutrophils as well as co mbined immunodeficiencies. Laboratory evaluation included a normal CBC with di fferential, quantitative immunoglobulins and lympho cyte flow cytometry.

Con sequently, Western blot analysis of p22phox, p47phox and p67p hox was performed and demonstrated undetectable p47 phox expression, confirming the diagnosis of CGD. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay demonstrated a greatly reduced, but not absent respiratory burst. Based o n the result of the DHR assay, the patient was diagnosed with CGD a nd on empiric antibiotics (ciprofloxacin an d prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfa and itraconazole an d low dose corticosteroids. The patient had a compl ete resolution of the fistula and diarrhea. She is currently undergoi ng reduced intensity conditioning in preparation fo r hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CGD is a primary immunodeficiency due to pathogenic mutations in one of the subunits of NADPH oxidase, which is responsible for the respiratory burst in monocytes and neutrophils. In the absence of a respiratory bu rst, phagocytic cells are unable to kill catalase positive bacteria and fungi leading to recurrent pyogenic infections . Approximately 65% of CGD is due mutations in the CYBB ( encodes p91 phox) gene, which CGD. The autosomal recessive (AR) CGD forms of CGD are due t o pathogenic mutations in one of the three other ge nes encoding subunits of NADPH oxidase: NCF1, NCF2 and C CYBA for 5% of CGD each. Th e c75_76delGT pathogenic variant is the most commo n cause of autosomal recessive CGD and accounts for >95% of NC F1 gene pathogenic variants (Noack et al., 2001). A R forms of CGD tend to have a milder course of disease due to hypo morphic mutations in the causative genes leading to residual NADPH oxidase function, which was seen in this case. In c ontrast, mutations in CYBB are usually null leading to absent NADPH oxidase activity and a more severe phenotype. Apart from increased infections, CGD is also characteriz ed by a dysregulated inflammatory response, which leads to poor wound healing and propensity for inflammatory bowel disease. Glucocorticoid therapy can be useful in th ese situations and was beneficial in the treatment of both the fistula and inflammatory bowel disease in this case. The optimal treatment of CGD has undergone signific ant changes in the last decade. In the past, prophy laxis with antimicrobials (trimethoprim-sulfa, itraconazole) i n conjunction with IFN- was the predominant therap y. However, there has been significant advances in the outcomes of HSCT for CGD and HSCT is the currently the reco mmended treatment if a well-matched HLA donor is identified .

Primary antibody deficiency s yndromes and CVID are the most common immunodeficie ncy in all age groups. Here we present 17 year old male with combi ned immunodeficiency whose diagnosis was made 6 yea rs after mycoplasma encephalitis. 17-year-old male presented to PID clinic with histo ry of recurrent upper and lower respiratory infecti ons. He had complex past medical history of intractable focal o nset epilepsy, swallow dysfunction and anger disord er which began in February 2011 after encephalitis secondary to mycop lasma infection. On presentation, Immunoglobin (I g) levels were all decreased. The specific levels included: IgA an d IgE were not detectable, IgG was 166 mg/dL (694-1 618 mg/dL), IgM was 6 (48-271 mg/dL). Absolute cell counts of CD19 and CD4 (both memory and na\u00efve subsets) were all low. CD19 count was 26 cells/mcL, CD4 count was 400 cell s/mcL. He also had absent pneumococcal (in 14/14 se rotypes) and tetanus antibody titers. The diagnosis of combined immunodeficiency was made and the patient was started on subcutaneous immuno globulin therapy. Few months after treatment he had signifi cant clinical improvement. Here we describe a 17-year old boy, who presented w ith severe complications of mycoplasma encephalitis at age 11 secondary to undiagnosed combined immunodeficiency at the time of presentation. His significant past m edical history and recurrent infections led to the diagnosis of co mbined immunodeficiency. Most of the cases with ant ibody deficiency present with recurrent bacterial infections. This c ase report illustrates the importance of considerin g an underlying immune deficiency in patients with severe or recurr ent infections regardless of their age. Early diagn osis and therapy are essential to prevent long term morbidity and mortal ity in patients with immunodeficiency. Patient Presentation and Testing: The 17-year-old male presented to UNM Pediatric Imm unodeficiency Clinic with recurrent episodes of pne umonia, throat infections and upper respiratory infections. He reported that he has been very tired many years now. His past medical history was significant for history of ence phalitis and intractable focal onset epilepsy, whic h began in February 2011 after acute febrile illness. At that time, he was diagnosed with mycoplasma encephalitis. Family history was negative for immunodeficiency di seases. Patient was evaluated at primary immunodeficiency c linic due to history of recurrent sinopulmonary and mycoplasma encephalitis. Screening tests of serum showed decreased concentrations cells/uL, CD4+ T cell count of 400 cells/uL. He also had absent te tanus and pneumococcal IgG titers. No evidence of genetic def ects was established. As he carried very high risk for severe infections due to lack of immunoglobulins and immune cells, we initiated treatment with IgG replacement therapy. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis of CVID was made and the patient was started on IgG replacement therapy with subcutanous immunoglobulin at four weekly intervals at dosage o f 500 mg/kg. Four months later, the patient was fre e of infection and the IgG level was consistently higher than 800 mg/dL. Genetic testing for multiple mutations causing CVID and agammaglobulinemia including BTK gene were neg ative. Whole exome sequencing data is still pending. The patient is followed at Immunodeficiency Center clinic every 3 months and screened for complication s of CVID periodically.

Over the next 1.5 years, she underwent biopsi es of her lung, appendix and lacrimal duct, which a ll demonstrated EBV-associated new morpho logical features of marginal zone lymphoma, likely secondary to EBV infection. Her exam is notable for height of 56 inches, 8 inches below her expected mid-parental h eight, along with fine slow-growing hair and prior history of alopeci a. Immune studies were notable for mild lymphopenia with genetic testing revealing a pathogenic variant and a novel mutation leading to RNA changes in the RMRP gene, c onsistent with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH). CHH recessive condition characterized by metaphys eal dysplasia, bone marrow failure, increased risk of hematologic malignancy and variable immune deficiency, with inc reased susceptibility to pathogens that are typically clea red by T- and NK-cell mediated mechanisms including varicella, EBV and HHV-6. CHH presents with a wide range of phenotypic variability, even within the same family, however 100% of patients present with disproportionate short-limb s hort stature, 88% of patients demonstrate impaired lymphocyte proliferation and T-cell function with 35-65% demon strating infections in infancy and early childhood and about 5-10% developing neoplasms, including lymphoma and leukem ia. As a child, our patient demonstrated short stat ure (<1% for age) and fine hair, however lacked recurrent infect ions concerning for a combined immunodeficiency, wh ich likely led to her delayed diagnosis. Her EBV-driven lymphoprolife ration raised new concerns for a primary immunodefi ciency leading to cytotoxic cell dysfunction and inability to clea r EBV. Differential includes syndromes associated w ith lymphoproliferation including MST-1 deficiency, ITK deficiency and CD27 deficiency. Treatment for CHH is based largely on the phenotypic presentation, however the immunod eficiency aspect is variable and little data exists regarding the immune function of CHH patients as they enter adult hood. BMT/HSCT in children has resulted in normaliz ation of T-cell numbers and function and resolution of autoimmune m anifestations, with reported survival rates ranging between 60- 80% depending on donor match. There is little data or specific recommendations for management of assoc iated malignancies, though poor prognosis has been report ed in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, even with conventional cytotoxic protocols. Patient Presentation and Testing: We present the case of a 19yo female of mixed Hispa nic/Italian heritage who presents for evaluation at our clinic. Mother describes a routine pregnancy and delivery a nd patient was otherwise healthy during childhood, aside from Varicella infection at age 9mo (did not require hos pitalization) and now-resolved alopecia. While moth er did state that patient caught infections \"more easily\" than her si blings, she had no reported history of recurrent ot itis media, sinusitis, diarrheal illnesses, thrush or skin infections as a child. As she approached her teenage years, she re ceived outpatient treatment for several illnesses including E. coli U TI treated with Bactrim in December 2010, right low er lobe pneumonia in August 2012 requiring 5 day course of azithromyc in followed by a 10 day course of amoxicillin due t o persistent symptoms and clinical findings of left lower lobe p neumonia on subsequent exam as well as an atypical pneumonia with hazy left infiltrate in January 2014, which resolve d with another course of azithromycin. She was first noted to have cervical lymphadenopath y in March 2014, with reassuring lab workup at that time, including CBC, ESR, CRP and Heterophile antibodies. Lymphaden opathy resolved, however she developed a tender mas s near her left clavicle in October 2015. Labs at that time in cluding LDH, Uric acid, Bartonella and Cocci serolo gies were She underwent fine needle aspiration with subsequen t supraclavicular lymph node excisional biopsy which demonstrated atypical EBV-associated lymphopr oliferative disorder. Follow up PET scan in Novembe r 2015 demonstrated areas of abnormal uptake including a 2 3mmx18mm mass in her left lower lobe, R posterior r ib, 8mm substernal lymph node, a 15mmx15mm mass near her st omach and 18mmx13mm area near her right mid-pelvis. In December 2015, she was noted to have a positive EBV PCR. She had a mucocele appendectomy in January 20 16, which pathology revealed IGH and IGK positivity consisten t with a B-cell clonal process in one biopsy and IG H+ in the second biopsy, which was overall consistent with EBV-assoc iated lymphoproliferative disorder. In February 201 6, she underwent IR guided biopsy of her left lower atypical EBV-positive lymphoprolifer ation. EBV PCR was negative in March 2016. She was well in the int erim, receiving Tamiflu in December 2016 for presum ed flu. In April 2017, she developed a conjunctival lesion in her ri ght eye. MRI revealed enlargement of the right lacr imal gland with associated focal nodular enhancement and biopsy of the lesion in May 2017 was again consistent with EB V-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. Repeat HIV and EBV PC R were negative at that time. She developed new, ra pidly enlarging left pre-auricular of marginal zone lymphoma. Most recent EBV titers in July 2017 were consistent with past infe ction, though she was noted to have active viremia, with elevated EBV DNA PCR in both July and August 2017. Of note, her physical exam is notable for height of 56 inches (mid parental height estimate 64 inches) and she is the shortest of her siblings. She also has fine hair th at is slow growing, having received only 3 haircuts in her lifetime. Prior immune workup was notable for decreased pneum ococcal titers (revaccination records unavailable) with normal diphtheria and titers. Prior subsets with m counts. also obtained given history of lymphoproliferative disor der, and was normal. As part of our workup, repeat immunoglobulins, lymphocyte proliferation studies, vaccine titers, i nflammatory markers, B-cell phenotyping and genetic panel for immunodeficiency was obtained. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Lab workup was significant for normal immunoglobulin subsets along with elevated ESR (25) . HIV testing was negative. Lymphocyte proliferatio n studies and vaccine titers were pending at time of submission. Gene panel was significant for a pathogenic variant change in n.147G>A (RNA change) along with a novel mutation a t n.257_266 deletion (RNA change) of the RMRP gene, consistent with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH). She recently underwent bone marrow biopsy (results pending at su bmission) and is currently being evaluated for chemotherapy treatmen t (rituximab monotherapy or bendamustine-rituximab) vs RCHOP as treatment for her stage 1 marginal zone lymphoma along with consideration for bone marrow transplan tation given her new diagnosis of CHH. Submission Number: Number: 112 Keyword: Name: Hiral Thakrar, M.D. Primary Author Institution: St. Joseph Hospital and Medical Center Additional Authors: Jeremy Feldman, M.D. Case Title: A Rare Case of Acute Mastoiditis causing Meningitis Summary and Lessons Learned: Introduction: Acute mastoiditis, which is usually s een in children is a rare occurrence in adults. Wh ile acute otitis media complications have declined due to antibiotic use, complications can be fatal. According to studies at two hospitals done in Sweden, 3 out of 42 patients with acute otitis m edia were adults. Symptomatic mastoiditis is an inf requent complication of both acute and chronic otitis media but can be serious due to the proximity of the mas toid to the posterior cranial fossa, lateral sinuses, semicircu lar canals, facial nerve canal, and the petrous tip of the temporal bone. Otitic meningitis, although the most common complic ation of chronic otitis media, is an uncommon occur rence in acute otitis media and mastoiditis. Patient Presentation and Testing: We report a case of 33-year-old male with recent pa st medical history of sinus congestion, recurrent s inusitis, and acute otitis media. He was admitted after he developed ac ute mastoiditis complicated with meningitis. Sympto ms included severe headache, fevers, photophobia, altered menta l status, rhinorrhea, and right ear pain. Lumbar p uncture was notable for WBC 17, 619, PMN 88% with CSF the Orbital/ Sella/ Posterior Fossa confirmed mastoiditis and MRI of the brain showed right masto iditis with underlying abscess and diffuse leptomen ingeal meningitis. Patient und erwent mastoidectomy and tymphanostomy tube placeme nt with ENT. Ear culture was remarkable for Klebsiella, but blood cultures were negative. He was managed aggr essively and successfully with antibiotics and fluids. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Discussion: Although mastoiditis is associated with a spectrum of disease, meningitis associated with acute otitis and mastoiditis is a rare complication. Most acute mas toiditis cases occur in children but have dramatica lly declined with the routine use of antibiotics. In adult cases, it has been linked to prior cranial surgery. Mastoidi tis generally presents with fever, posterior ear pain, and edema of the pi nna. The dangerous consequence of mastoiditis is o titis meningitis presenting with fever, neck pain, photophobia and m ental status changes. CT scan should always be per formed when mastoiditis is suspected, with an MRI if there is c oncern for intracranial processes. It is imperativ e to start IV antibiotics early. Prompt recognition and treatment is critical , which can involve IV antibiotics and if necessary mastoidectomy for debridement of necrotic bone. Common organisms can be S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza for acut e mastoiditis and S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and enteric Gram-negative rods for chronic otitis media. As an tibiotics have improved overtime, the aggressive complications of acute otitis media have declined. Very few cases of adult otitis media have been reported. Primary care physicians, hospitalists in consultation with ear nose throat s pecialists need to be cautious so as not to miss this potentially fata l complication of acute otitis media. It should als o prompt physicians to look for immune deficiencies and allergy related ca uses in patients with recurrent disease.

Our patient was noted to have borderline low IgG le vels, protective protein vaccine titers and a recen t diagnosis of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), all fin dings that are not generally associated with CVID. Approximately 25 percent of people with CVID have a n autoimmune disorder. A review of the literature showed that CVID patients with autoimmune disorders tend to hav e immunoglobulin levels that are closer to normal. The literature also revealed that a total of 5 CVID patients have been reported to have IDDM, the oldest of which was 31 years of age. Our patient adds to the literature, further associa ting CVID and IDDM. Patient Presentation and Testing: The initial interview with our patient revealed tha t he was evaluated for cystic fibrosis as a child, presumably due to a history of recurrent infections. In his late teens , our patient was diagnosed with alopecia universal is, an autoimmune disorder that is more commonly associated with CVID . During an overseas deployment in his fourth deca de of life, our patient was diagnosed with two lobar pneumonias and revealed that he suffered from significant symptom s of gastroenteropathy nearly that entire time. The immunology work up showed consistently low IgA and IgM levels with a very poor response to the PPS V23 vaccine. The persistent finding of leukopenia and thrombocyt openia was also noted. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Given the borderline low IgG, low IgA and IgM level s, a history of recurrent bacterial infections, mul tiple autoimmune disorders, hematologic dyscrasias and a poor respon se to a polysaccharide vaccine, a diagnosis of CVID was established. After the diagnosis was made, monthly IVIG infusion s were initiated which have thus far resulted in a better overall energy level for the patient while keeping him free of any serious infections.

It presents most often in adolescence and early adulthood, and may r equire coordinated evaluation by multiple subspecialists f or diagnosis. Haploinsufficiency with heterozygous mutations cause disease with autosomal dominant inheritance, simila r to other diseases conferred by transcription fact or mutations. The presence of monocytemia in a young adult with myelo dysplasia and chronic viral infections or nontuberc ulous mycobacterial infection is concerning for GATA-2 de ficiency. NTM infections in GATA-2 deficiency are relatively common and require a high index of suspicion. M. kansasii infection may cause false positive PPD and negativ e IGRA in the setting of pulmonary symptoms. Bone marrow transpl ant and genetic testing of siblings is indicated in severe deficiencies. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 20 year old Caucasian-Filipino female was admitte d from Heme clinic after presenting with a history of EBV mononucleosis a year ago, a persistent rash since, and pancytopenia and fever of unknown origin of 5 m onths duration. She was admitted to an outside hospital 5 months ag o for fever and pancytopenia; after bone marrow bio psy and mediastinal lymph node aspirate she had been diagno sed with pulmonary and bone marrow sarcoid and star ted on prednisone 40 mg daily without improvement in her s ymptoms. She continued to decline and require tran sfusions in spite of prednisone, then was admitted 3 months ago with fever and treated with IV antibiotics. Prior to her clinic appointment she developed epistaxis, oral ulcers, t hrush, and 17 pound unintentional weight loss in th e setting of drenching night sweats. She was admitted to UAB, w here she briefly required ICU care for uncontrolled epistaxis with hemorrhagic shock in the setting of thrombocytopeni a. She was started empirically on RIPE therapy for LTBI (PPD 12 mm and negative IGRA). She underwent mediastinosco py for evaluation of pulmonary adenopathy and a sma ll pleural effusion; mediastinal lymph node biopsy contained e xtensive necrosis and nonspecific inflammation. He r skin biopsy demonstrated medium vessel vasculitis. She was fou nd to be pancytopenic with hypocellular bone marrow with dysplastic changes with reduced of hematogo nes (CD10+CD20+) and megakryocytes. Circu lating B cells, cells, and monocytes were reduced. She h ad hypergammaglobulinemia with normal vaccine respo nses. Due to NK cell deficiency, monocyte deficiency, and dyspla stic changes with reduced CD10+CD20+ hematogones sh e underwent genetic testing of her bone marrow, with findings o f a novel variant in GATA-2 (c.1024_1025insGCCG; p .A342Gfs*43) causing a frameshift mutation with an early stop co don. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This patient was diagnosed with GATA-2 deficiency b ased on her genetic testing and flow cytometry resu lts. Throughout her hospitalization she required multiple transfusi ons of blood products, and had a recurrence of epis taxis requiring transfusions. She was started on empiric RIPE ther apy in the setting of lymphadenopathy and B symptom s; although her cultures and PCR from skin and lung biopsies were negative for TB she continued on empiric M. kansasi i treatment with ethambutol/rifampin/azithromycin after conferring with Dr. Holland (NIH). She had been treated with anakinra for HLH while inpatient but this was discontinued due to ne utropenia and a maximal ferritin level of 1850. Sh e was referred to the NIH for evaluation and has undergone bone marro w transplant. Her sisters will undergo genetic tes ting for her GATA-2 mutation, as one has pulmonary infections an d the other has recurrent epistaxis.

We evaluated telomere length at the single-cell level in two siblings with SIOD and found remarkably reduced telomere len gth in their circulating T cells. Although recent studies using cell lines manipulated to have SMARCAL1 deficiency assoc iate SMARCAL1 deficiency with telomere damage,(1) t his is the first evaluation of whether telomere abnormalities occur in patients with SIOD. Patient Presentation and Testing: In both patients, prior d biallelic involvement. Patient 1 presented at three-years-ol d with height less than the first percentile, T-cel l lymphopenia (absolute CD3 count of of 97/\u00b5L), protein uria, hypercholesterolemia, recurrent otitis media and re spiratory infections including one pneumonia. Patie nt 2, the younger sibling, presented at two-years-old with milder dis ease including height at the fifth percentile for a ge and T-cell lymphopenia (absolute CD3 count 731/\u00b5L, CD45RA+ count count of 170/\u00b5L). Due to p rogressive nephrotic syndrome, Patient 1 underwent renal trans plant evaluation and both patients underwent hemato poietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) evaluation. We pursued telom ere length analysis because the results could impac t the HSCT conditioning regimen; non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning has been used in patients w ith Dyskeratosis congenita, a disease of impaired telom ere maintenance.(2) Additionally, we wanted to dete rmine whether telomere defects occur in patients with SIOD. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient samples were analyzed at Repeat Diagnostics via a CLIA-approved Flow-FISH telomere length assa y. Mean cells) and compared to age-matched controls. Despi te differing in their disease severity, both patien ts had mean telomere lengths less than the first percentile and more than two standard deviations below the mean i n all measured lymphocyte subsets. These findings are significant as they support the notion of a telomere replicatio n defect in SIOD lymphocytes. To date, neither patient has received a stem cell transplant. However, we are currently investigating the role of telomere replication in SIOD. This area of research could present possible new therapies in SI OD. For example, patients with Dyskeratosis Congenita had telomere in circulating leukocytes with th erapy.(3) References: 1. Poole, LA et al. SMARCAL1 telomere int egrity during DNA replication.

Wu, MD, MSCR, University of North Caroli na at Chapel Hill Case Title: Expanding the clinical phenotype of chronic granulo matous disease (CGD): a female patient with a de no vo mutation in CYBB Summary and Lessons Learned: A 16-year-old female was referred for an autoinflam matory disorder with a history of various cutaneous manifestations, most notably pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis sup purativa, and scarring acne. Lesional cultures negative. Her history seemed most suggestive of pyogenic arthriti s, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome. She was empirically treated with the TNF inhibitor adalimum ab. Shortly after, she developed a cutaneous ulcer infected with Serratia marascens. She died of complications from Providencia stuartii sepsis and macrophage activati on syndrome (MAS). PSTPIP1 sequencing for PAPA syndrome was negative. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a novel mut ation in the X-linked CGD-causing gene CYBB. Functional expe riments demonstrated extremely skewed X-chromosome inactivation. We have identified a female patient with a potentia lly lethal X-linked mutation in CYBB and confirmed the immunodeficiency. Our case expands the spectrum of symptoms associated with CGD to include severe neut rophilic dermatoses, which was misleading the clinical diagn osis. Our case adds to prior observations that TNF inhibition is not beneficial in CGD. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 16-year-old female presented with an 8-year and chalazion, and pustules of the nose and fingertips. Her lesions were steroid-responsive. Previous ther the TNF inhibitor etanercept witho ut response or effects. She briefly tried t he TNF inhibitor adalimumab also without adverse effects. Her medica l history, including a thorough infectious work-up, was otherwise unremarkable. Family history was negative. Her phenotype was most consistent with PAPA syndrom e. She was tested for mutations in two exons of the PSTPIP1 gene associated with PAPA and tested negative. Her DNA sample was submitted for WES to identify a poss ible disease- causing gene. She was not expected to have an X-lin ked disease. WES analysis confirmed an unexpected d iagnosis of CGD. Functional experiments shed light on an unusua l mechanism of her disease due to skewed X-linked i nactivation. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: After ~2 months on adalimumab, our patient develope d fever and malodorous drainage from a leg ulcer. C ultures isolated Serratia marascens. Shortly after, she die d of complications from Providencia stuartii sepsis , MAS, and multi- organ failure. Analysis of WES data revealed a novel mutation in t he X-linked CGD-causing gene CYBB (c.935T>G, p.M312 R). Her mother and two unaffected siblings did not carry th is mutation. Although we were unable to evaluate NA DPH oxidase activity, the mutation is presumed pathogenic since it occurs in a domain where all previously identif ied missense mutations have been pathologic in AN INFANT.

Patients can h ave significant failure to thrive secondary to diar rhea, eosinophilia and endocrinopathies such as early onset type-1 betes mellitus. Our patient was a 10-month-old adm itted to PICU for hyponatremia, chronic se vere eczema, and with significant failur e to thrive and hypothyroidism. Immunologic and genetic assays inc luding whole exome sequencing did not identify a di agnosis. After treatment of the underlying severe malnutrition and neglect, the patient's eosinophilia, hypogammaglob ulinemia, eczema and hypothyroidism dramatically improved. Immunologists should consider severe malnutrition w hen evaluating a patient with immune dysregulation. Although this degree of malnutrition is rare, this case illu strates the impact of nutrition on the immune syste m. Patient Presentation and Testing: 10-month-old admitted to the PICU for severe eczema, litis. Patient's weight on admission was only 4.4kg. He was born at term with a birth weight of 2.84kg and developed ec zema with diarrhea at four months of age. The diarrhea was te mporarily improved with elemental amino acid nutrit ion; however, his mother unrestricted his diet under the care of a homeopathic provider. His brothers had a history of food allergies and eczema. Physical exam was significant for sever e developmental delay, failure to thrive, and sever e eczema. Initial laboratory evaluation upon admission included WBC 17,300 cells/mm3, 3979 cells/mm3, in FOXP3 sequencing, but FOXP3 f low cytometry was abnormal with a large population of C D25- FOXP3+ cells. Flow cytometry evaluating WASp was normal. Whole exome sequencing was performed, but did not r eveal any disease variant with his reported phenoty pe. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Initial medical management focused on treatment of severe malnutrition and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient's atopic dermatitis was aggressively treated with top ical emollients and corticosteroids along with IV a ntibiotics. He was given bowel rest with total parenteral nutrition an d transitioned to elemental formula with a gastric tube. Within weeks, the patient had remarkable growth, improved skin de rmatitis, and his laboratory values including AEC, TSH, IgG, IgA, and IgM normalized. The history of severe malnutrition and parental neglect necessitated removal from the household by Child Protective Services. Currently, the child co ntinues to thrive. Submission Number: 194 Poster Number: 119 Keyword: Primary Author to Intravenous Immunoglobuli ns Summary and Lessons Learned: The aim of our study is to highlight the rare, but sometimes life- threatening side reaction occurring during the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG ) therapy in patients with a humoral immune deficit . Thereby, awareness should be raised regarding the body respo nse to the intravenous substitution therapy, rangin g from subtle early symptoms, that normally disappear rapidly whe n the infusion rate is slowed down or stopped, to h ypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylactic shock, requiring an immediate stop of the infusion and appropriate, pr ompt treatment to be initiated. Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of 3 5 patients diagnosed with a primary immunodeficienc y at the Ph.D. MD Octavian Fodor Regional Institute of Gastro-Ente rology and Hepatology in Cluj-Napoca, included in a National Program and treated monthly with 400-600 mg/kg with IVIG. Of all clinical cases with an immunodeficien cy, we will focus on four patients with a medical history of ot her immune dysregulation (eg. allergies and autoimm une diseases) developing a rapid onset of severe reactions after infusion of IVIG. Those 4 pts developed at the fir st administration of IVIG a severe systemic reaction with itch on extrem ities, generalized rush, severe dyspnea with wheeze and hypotension during 10 minutes. The IVIG where stopped and anaph ylactic therapy started (epinephrine, oxygen, iv so lution, antihistamine and corticotherapy) with improvement during 30 minutes. In 2 patients onother IVIG admin istration was introduce after a month (with same IVIG) and the re action appeared again. The same protocol for therap y was applied. All this pts where change on another brand of IVIG (low in IgA) which was well tolerated. Patient Presentation and Testing: The pts where skin tested with IVIG and developed a n edema with pseudopodes (larger diameter 7 mm/smal l diameter 5,mm). Primary immunodeficiency include a variety o f disorders that render patients more susceptible t o infections due to a dysfunction or lack of one component of the im mune system. Without long-term therapy, these infec tions may produce irreversible changes in the function of var ious organs or could be fatal. Early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment with intravenous replacement, especially for humor deficit, can alter the course of the dise ase and have a positive effect on patient outcome. Therefore the m ain option for long-term therapy in this group of p rimary humoral immunodeficiency diseases remains immunoglobulin su bstitution therapy, either iv or subcutaneous- Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Conclusion. Although anaphylactic reactions to the therapy are not frequent, patients with severe IgA deficiency and other immune dysfunction, such as previous allergic reactions or hypersensitivities, are at increased risk.

Haight, MD, Penn State College of Medicine Case Title: An Atypical Presentation of Common Variable Immunod eficiency Disorder Summary and Lessons Learned: This is a 45-year-old Caucasian woman with past med ical history of anxiety and diarrhea predominant Ir ritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) who recently moved into the area a nd presented for an appointment with her Primary Ca re Physician for urticarial rash unremitting to therapy. The pat ient was subsequently referred to Dermatology with further failure to therapy. One year later, the urticarial rash had no t improved and the patient noticed vitiligo patches on the dorsal aspect of her hands for which she was further evalu ated by Dermatology and referred to Allergy. Six mo nths later, she followed up with her Gastroenterologist for poorly controlled IBS-D. On exam, the patient's skin exam showed vitiligo patches and a diffuse urticarial rash. One month la ter, the patient was admitted to the hospital with community acquired Pneumococcal pneumonia and on further ques tioning, the patient reported multiple episodes of sinus infections in the past couple of months. Her Gastro enterologist pursued laboratory analysis which show ed normal complete metabolic panel, CBC, ANA, and cryoglobuli ns. Immunoglobulin levels were also ordered in the setting of recurrent infections, urticaria, and vitiligo. Tota l IgA level was less than 5mg/dL (normal 66-344 mg/ dL), IgG level was 254 mg/dL (normal 716-1554 mg/dL) and IgM was 10 mg /dL (45 - 250 mg/dl). Skin biopsy of the rash showe d a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophi ls and neutrophils consistent with urticaria. The p atient was subsequently diagnosed with CVID and initiated on m onthly IVIG infusions which resolved her urticarial rash, diarrhea, and vitiligo. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of CV ID that caused a delay in diagnosis of three years. Sinopulmonary infections are the most well-known presentation of CVID and many times clinicians tend to look for sin opulmonary infections as a hint for the possibility of CVID. B ecause our patient presented with an unusual combin ation of symptoms to different specialists (Dermatologist, Allergist, Gastroenterologist) over a prolonged time course, her disease remained undiagnosed for three years. This case highlighted many lessons for all of us - a reminder of the impo rtance of a thorough history and reevaluating your differential diagnosis each time you see a patient. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient presented for an annual physical with w orsening vitiligo and urticaria which was unremitti ng to therapy. Shortly thereafter she was admitted to the hospital with an episode of community acquired Pneumococcal pneumonia and it was noted that she had experienced recurrent sinus infections over the preceding two years. Her history and a chart review were negative for malignancy or a thym oma making secondary hypogammaglobulinemia an unlik ely source of her symptoms. Further past history of the patien t revealed that she was prone to sinopulmonary infe ctions as a child but only in the past two years began to experience symptoms again. The patient has no smoking history, rare alcohol us e, and no recreational drug use. She denies other e pisodes of pneumonia, sinus infections, or ear infections befo re these recent occurrences. There is no family his tory of autoimmune conditions. On examination, she appeared in no acute distress and vital signs were normal. Skin showed vitiligo patches specifically on the dorsal aspect of her hands bilaterally and an erythematous papula r pruritic urticarial rash noted extensively throughout her body. Cardiac examination was regular in rate and rhythm and no murmurs or gallops were heard. Lung auscultation revealed no c rackles, wheezing, or rales. Abdominal examination was nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory analysis rev ealed mildly low T3 of 2.3 pg/ml and normal T4 leve l. Complete metabolic panel, CBC, ANA, and cryoglobulins were a ll normal. Due to the patient's history of diarrhea , a tissue transglutaminase IgA, along with a total IgA level, were performed in order to screen for Celiac Disea se. Her total IgA level was less than 5mg/dL (normal 66-344 mg/dL). A dditional immunoglobulin levels were checked and sh owed an IgG level of 254 mg/dL (normal 716-1554 mg/dL) and IgM of 10 mg/dL (45 - 250 mg/dl). Skin biopsy showed a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils and neutro phils which was consistent with urticaria and is hi ghly suggestive of an allergic response. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Suspicion of CVID in a patient would warrant checki ng serum immunoglobulin levels and, if abnormal, a repeat check of immunoglobulin levels would be needed to confirm th at the hypogammaglobulinemia is not due to an error . Based on lab results showing hypogammaglobulinemia, the next best step for our patient was to refer to a clinic al immunologist who could proceed with checking the patient's respo nse to vaccines and exclude other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia. Our patient's response to va ccine was minimal which met another diagnostic crit erion of CVID. At this point, the next step was to decide th e need for prophylactic antibiotics and/or immune g lobulin replacement therapy. In our patient, due to her pro ven vulnerability as seen through her recurrent inf ections, it was decided to proceed with immune globulin replacement therapy. Because our patient presented with an unusual combi nation of symptoms to different specialists (Dermat ologist, Allergist, Gastroenterologist) over a prolonged tim e course, her disease remained undiagnosed for thre e years. Ultimately immunoglobulin levels were ordered by he r Gastroenterologist when the patient presented for an annual physical and mentioned diarrhea, vitiligo, urticari a, and sinus infections. Since her diagnosis a year ago, she has been treated with monthly IVIG infusions which normalize d her IgG level and resolved her urticarial rash. S he has not had any further episodes of pneumonia or sinus infections a nd vitiligo has not advanced.

The goals of management ar e to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life however there remains limited available data on the best approach to treatment. Here we present two cases with similar presentation s where both patients had elevated IgD levels with negative periodic genetic fever panels, yet they had very di fferent responses to treatment. Patient Presentation and Testing: The first patient is an eight year old boy of Scott ish and Italian descent with no significant past me dical history presenting with recurrent fevers every six weeks fo r several years. He is usually debilitated for a on e week duration with the fevers accompanied by severe abdominal pain, ap hthous ulcers, conjunctivitis, pruritic rashes, and cervical adenitis. His laboratory work up is significant for a normal CRP, ESR and white blood cell count without any neu tropenia. His IgD level is elevated at 195 mg/dL (upper limit of norm al for age: 41.4 mg/dL). He was prescribed predniso ne to begin at the onset of episodes and had a remarkable response, wi th almost immediate improvement in his symptoms and quality of life. The second patient is a three year old boy of Portu guese and Irish decent with past medical history of failure to thrive, multiple episodes of sinusitis with recurrent fever s every four weeks lasting five days to temperature s of 106F. The fevers are accompanied by abdominal pain, aphthous ulcers, diffuse joint pain and lymphadenopathy. His laboratory work up revealed slightly elevated inflammatory mar kers and his IgD level is elevated at 38 mg/dL (upp er limit of normal for age: 20 mg/dL). He completed nine courses of or al steroids over twelve month period which did not improve his symptoms. He was placed on meloxicam daily, also wi thout any relief. The next step in management is a nakinra for abortive therapy, and we are still awaiting these r esults. Unfortunately, his multiple courses of oral steroids have already resulted in effects on his growth and development. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our cases are to make the medical community aware o f similar clinical picture yet very different respo nse to treatment and the new treatment options available for Hyper I gD Syndrome. This is an important aspect to be cog nizant of considering the significant morbidity associated wi th this syndrome.

His most concerning illnesses have been 3 episodes of lymphadenitis, affecting his cervica l and submandibular nodes, two of which required surgical intervention despite oral antibiotic therapy. With the surgical intervention, bacterial culture revealed growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). An evaluation of his immune system is performed revealing no abnorma lities in his absolute neutrophil count, serum immu noglobulin levels, or lymphocyte enumeration. While ill, he ha s a DHR study that reveals a significantly diminish ed burst. Though suggestive of CGD, abnormal DHR findings can result in the setting of laboratory error, pre-act ivated specimens, acute illness, glutathione synthetase deficiency, m yeloperoxidase deficiency, glucose-6-phosphat e (syndrome tis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) and Rac2 deficiency (if N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalan ine is used for stimulation). Addressing these scen arios, he underwent subsequent testing: - Repeat DHR analyses (while healthy) revealed cons istent results without evidence of pre-activation. - A peripheral blood smear revealed decreased prima ry granules but intact MPO enzymatic activity. - Expression of chemotaxis markers was normal and n eutrophil chemotaxis was intact. - Neutrophil bactericidal activity against Staphylo coccus aureus colonies was Ferricytochrome c reduction assays revealed decre ased superoxide production. The results detailed above and the clinical history were consistent with CGD. Additional consideration s for testing included nitroblue tetrazolium testing as well as D HR analysis of the patient's mother to assess for c arrier status (X- linked CGD). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: variants with deleterious characteristics in NCF2 consistent with a rare form of autosomal recessive CGD affecting the p67-phox subunit of The patient began prophylac tic antibacterial and antifungal therapy and is under c onsideration for interferon gamma therapy versus he matopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Translational Autoinflammatory Disease Studies U nit, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, USA Case Title: Sideroblastic anemia, immunodeficiency, fever and d evelopmental delay (SIFD): case report and therapy Summary and Lessons Learned: Introduction: The number of primary immunodeficienc ies described has increased over the years counting more than 300. SIFD is characterized by syderoblastic anemia, B cell immunodeficiency, periodic fever and neurol ogical development delay. It is associated with mutation o f TRNT1 gene and it was previously described in 14 patients. Mean survival is 48 months and cardiac problems are repo rted as cause of death. Etanercept has been used to treat autoinflammatory diseases. We report a patient with SIFD under treatment with anti-TNF alpha. Case report: A 6 month old girl of a nonconsaguineo us family, was referred with recurrent fever, most of the times unrelated to infection. She was a premature baby, 3 4 weeks, 2.140g, with laryngomalatia. Intensive Ca re was necessary for 14 days due to decreased oxigen saturation dur ing breastfeeding. Extended neonatal screening was normal. Umbilical cord fall occurred after 20 days. Fever a nd local reaction were reported after each vaccinat ion. Cutaneous lesions were previously diagnosed as insect bite an d skin biopsy was reported as leukemia cutis. The p atient was referred to Oncology in order to exclude leukemia. The following infections were diagnosed: paniculiti s, herpes due to Metapneumovirus. Recurrent high fever episodes associated with anemia occurred in the first year a nd blood transfusion was done during acute episodes (3-6 months old). Severe failure to thrive and delay on neurol ogical development were also present. No hearing lo ss was confirmed. Acute phase proteins were persistently elevated (CR P, Ferritin). Immunoglobulin whole exome sequencing. Now adays, the patient is being treated with anti-TNF alpha with g ood response. Discussion: We report a patient with recurrent feve r, elevated inflammatory markers, hypogammaglobulin emia and developmental delay, as defined by the SIFD and a b iallelic mutation in nucleotidiltransferase RNAt1 ( TRNT1). This report emphasizes the clinical presentation and the variab le severity. Molecular diagnosis not only helped wi th final defect finding but it could also orient therapy. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 6 month old female patient was referred due to w ith recurrent fever and severe anemia. Cutaneous le sions were seen at that evaluation and skin biopsy described as le ukemia cutis. Oncology excluded this diagnosis and she was referred again for evaluation of the immunologist. Consideri ng recurrent fever, failure to thrive and no infect ion site identified, auto inflammatory disease was suspected. Acute phas e proteins were persistently elevated and hypogammaglobulinemia was also diagnosed. Benign au toinflammatory diseases were excluded and WES looki ng for definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: TRNT1 mutation was identified after whole exome seq uencing Sideroblastic anemia, immuno deficiency, fever and developmental delay (SIFD). The molecular diagnosis was done by Translational Autoinflammato ry Disease Studies Unit, National Institute of Health, Bethesd a, USA and we worked all together to establish the best therapy for this patient. Anti-TNF alpha was prescribed and the frequency and intensity of the fever improved as w ell as the patient's development.

Inherited and acquired deficiencies of such proteins can create clinically significant suscepti bility to infection, most commonly by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza typ e b, and Neisseria meningitidis. A 22 year old previously healthy bisexual male acti ve duty submariner presented with fevers, chills, m yalgias, sore throat, headache, and a painful vesicular rash whic h spread from his face to diffusely cover his neck, chest, and back. On exam, the patient was noted to be febrile and tachy cardic with significant neck pain and stiffness. Bo th Kernig and Brudzinski signs were positive. In addition, he dem onstrated a leukocytosis of over 20,000 and elevate d inflammatory markers. PCR of the patient's rash was positive for herpes-simplex virus type I (HSV-1). A lumbar punc ture was performed, and yielded a positive PCR result for Ne isseria meningitidis (non-groupable). The patient w as diagnosed with both cutaneous HSV-1 and Neisseria meningitis. He was started on intravenous acyclovir and ceftriaxon e and improved significantly over the course of several days, disc harging approximately a week after admission. HIV serology was obtained and returned negative. On further history, the patient and his mother both confirmed that he had previously experienced similar vesicular rashes when he was yo unger, and his sister had suffered from disseminate d meningococcal disease as a child. Given the family history, the p atient was tested for an inherited immune deficienc y and found to have very low or undetectable CH50 on three separate occ asions. Additional laboratory tests, to include C2, C3, C4, IgA, IgM, and IgG all returned within normal limits. The pati ent then underwent specific testing for a suspected deficiency of terminal complement (C5-C9) and was found to have u ndetectable levels of C5. An inherited deficiency of the complement system ca n predispose patients to infections with encapsulat ed bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. While the scientific lit erature describes correlations between specific com plement deficiencies and mammalian humoral response to herpesvirus infec tion, the presence of co-morbid disseminated HSV-1 in this patient cannot be definitively attributed to such a deficiency and may simply reflect activation of la tent virus during a state of acute physiologic stress. Providers should perform careful interviews to obtain personal or f amily history suspicious for inherited immune deficiencies and un derstand the laboratory analysis required for diagn osis, as such patients are at increased risk of death from infect ion and should receive targeted vaccination and edu cation. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient's initial presentation consisted of sig nificant headache, meningismus with positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs, fever, and tachycardia. He noted that he had developed a sore throat, fever, headache, and myal gias five days prior to presentation. Initially, he thought that t hese symptoms were consistent with the common cold. Three days prior to admission, he presented to a healthcare clinic d ue to persistent symptoms and received a single inj ection of intramuscular penicillin for presumed streptococcus pharyngitis. When he again worsened over the cours e of the next few days and subsequently developed a painful vesic ular rash, he decided to present to the urgent care clinic and was then transferred to our care. Of note, the patient was bisexual and reported multiple recent sexual co ntacts with men and women. He reported using condoms infrequently. Given his clinical picture on presentation, primary concern was for a cutaneous infection (herpes simp lex or varicella zoster) which had disseminated to cause a viral men ingitis or for infection with a bacterial pathogen. Lumbar puncture was performed, and showed greater than 6,000 white blood cells, low glucose (3), and elevated protein (181) with a positive result for \"non-groupable\" Neisseria meni ngitidis. Other considerations, given his initial c omplaint of sore throat, included complications of infectious mononu cleosis or streptococcus pharyngitis. Monospot, rap id strep test, and throat culture all returned negative. Bacterem ia was considered given the systemic nature of his clinical presentation with tachycardia, fever, myalgias, and profound leukocytosis. Blood cultures were obtaine d and returned negative. Given the patient's recent risky sexual b ehavior, an acute presentation of HIV was considere d. Multiple late generation laboratory tests, to include HIV-1 RNA r eturned negative for human immunodeficiency virus. Given his history, other sexually transmitted infections, suc h as syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were tested for as well (even though no discharge or lesions were noted on genita l exam). All of these tests returned negative. PCR of the contents of his vesicular skin lesions returned positive for HS V-1. The patient informed us that he had previously expe rienced a similar vesicular rash on his face as an adolescent, but he had otherwise been very healthy, never suffering fr om recurrent infections. However, he also informed us that his sister had suffered from severe disseminated meningococcal disease at a very young age. Both his mother and h is prior pediatrician (who had treated both children) corrob orated this information. Because of the family hist ory, we decided to test the patient for an inherited immunodeficiency. Given the increased incidence of Neisseria infecti on in those with complement protein deficiencies, the first test we obtained was CH50, which returned very low. To conf irm this result, we tested the patient a second time, and CH50 level s were undetectable. Noting that complement may be low in the setting of acute infection due to physiologic consu mption rather than true deficiency, we waited more than a week after his hospital discharge to test the patient a third time. The result was undetectable CH50. At this point, we decided to investigate the specif ic complement proteins. Given that terminal complem ent is essential for immune defense against Neisserial infections, C 5-C9 were each specifically tested. Ultimately, the patient was found to be completely deficient in C5. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: While admitted, the patient was treated with intrav enous acyclovir and ceftriaxone for his acute infec tions. His symptoms quickly improved. However; the ultimate diagnosis was a deficiency in complement protein C5, one of the terminal complem ent components (C5-C9) critical in the formation of the membrane attack complex and subsequent defense aga inst the Neisseria species of bacteria. As this lab has just resulted, we are in the process of contacting the patient to notify him. Since this patient is an active duty submariner, he has already been vaccinated against meningococcus. Our goal is to ensure that he has also received both the pneumococ cal and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugated va ccinations, as these are indicated in all individuals with termina l complement deficiency. In addition, we plan to ha ve further discussions with this patient regarding his conditi on. These will include the need to be vigilant rega rding the early signs of infection, the importance of wearing a medical i dentification badge, and the potential benefit of a ntibiotic prophylaxis with monthly injections of benzocaine penicillin.

Department Title: Unique Presentati on of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) with a No vel Mutation Summary and Lessons Learned: A four day old female born at 40 2/7 weeks of gesta tional age to consanguineous parents with a profoun d rash at the time of birth, Candida funisitis presented with cli nical sepsis. She was noted to have oral thrush, wo rsening rash and fever which prompted her presentation to the hospit al. Initially, urine cultures grew Group B Streptoc occus, but eventually, her tracheal cultures and skin scraping s grew Candida albicans. She clinically declined an d passed away despite double coverage for gram negative, gram pos itive bacteria and fungi. Initial immunological wor k up was unrevealing as Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) was not suspected. After information about her skin scrapings, placental and umbilical cord pathology results, fun gal tracheal cultures, CGD was suspected and a dihy drorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay was onsistent with autosomal recessive CGD with postmor tem genetics consistent with NFC2 mutation. This case defines th e importance of suspecting autosomal recessive CGD in patients with a history of consanguinity with disseminated candid iasis. With a high index of suspicion, early diagno sis can lead to potentially lifesaving treatments such hematopoieti c stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, in our pati ent, this was not an option given her lack of response to antimicrobi als with continued pressor refractory septic shock. In addition, it is important to identify autosomal recessive CGD for f uture family planning. Patient Presentation and Testing: A four day old female born at 40 2/7 weeks gestatio nal age to consanguineous parents and no family his tory of immunodeficiency presented with septic clinical fea tures and rash. At birth, she was noted to have a r ash and required oxygen for presumed meconium aspiration. On day of life four, she developed oral thrush, a worsening e rythematous papular rash and fevers prompting hospitalization. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negativ e at presentation and urine grew Group B Streptococcus. Despite adequ ate treatment with penicillin and gentamicin, she d ecompensated and required intubation and vasopressor support. A ntimicrobial coverage was broadened, including doub le fungal coverage. Skin scrapings grew Candida revealed low-normal IgG, norma l IgA and IgM. T, B and NK cells were mildly low. L ymphocyte mitogen proliferation was normal. DHR was ordered a s other immunological work up unrevealing which sho wed 5.2 % neutrophil activity. This was ordered due to growth of catalase positive fungal organism (Candida albi cans). On day of life 47, she expired from vasopressor refractory sh ock with persistent hypoxemia despite double with antifungals. Postmortem examination showed dissemin ated candida granulomatous bronchopneumoni a. Granulomatous also presen t in the skin, mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, small bowel a nd spleen. Pathology records confirmed the presence of Candida funisitis with fungal yeasts. Genetic testing revea led Q374X nonsense variant in the NCF2 gene which i s a pathogenic variant not previously reported, but consistent wit h autosomal recessive CGD. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: With and DHR consistent wi th autosomal recessive CGD, genetic testing was pur sued to confirm diagnosis for future family planning. This identified a Q374X nonsense variant in the NCF2 gen e consistent with autosomal recessive CGD. Due to delay in diagnosis for various circumstances, her disease was identifi ed after the patient expired. This mutation appears to be lethal variant as the baby did not clinically improve des pite appropriate therapy. Unfortunately, she was too ill for definit ive therapy such as HSCT. This case exemplifies the need to have high suspicion for CGD in disseminated candidiasis with or without granulomatous inflammation. Early diagno sis and antifungal treatment immediately after birth may ha ve altered her clinical course. p67phox is one of the five nicotinamide adenine din ucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase units encoded b y the NFC2 gene with mutations seen in up to 5% of CGD cases. According to Ben-Farhat et al., seven out of eleven patients in their Tunisian cohort presented with invasive Aspergillos is and six with mycobacterial infection. Five died despite adequate treatment. Cohen et al. found that 55 out of 250 CG D patients had severe fungal infections with 43 cas es attributable to Aspergillus species, eight to Candida albicans, thr ee to Candida glabrata and one to Hausemila polymor pha. Severity of clinical outcome depends on the mutatio n and amount of residual NADPH oxidase activity. Wh ile there are reports of primary candidal infections suspected to be from CGD, only one other definitive case of NFC 2 gene mutation is reported with a presentation of disseminated can didemia and granulomatous lung disease.

Yang PhD- Department of Immunology and Microbial Disease, Albany, New York Case Title: Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis in Otherwise Heal thy Hosts Summary and Lessons Learned: This is a case series on 3 patients with isolated C hronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis without any other clinical manifestations. Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis S yndrome (CMCS) is a heterogeneous group of disorder s of chronic superficial candidiasis, usually accompanied by oth er infections and/or autoimmunity. It has been wel l described in the literature. Isolated Mucocutaneous Candidiaisis, al so known as Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis Disea se (CMCD), is a more recently described entity. All three of our pa tients went through a significant period of time wh ere treatment was solely based on symptomatic control versus discover ing an underlying etiology. This is likely due to d ecreased awareness of CMCD in the medical community. This case series highlights the need for an increase in awareness by physicians regarding CMCD. By recognizing this disease, physic ians can start implementing a targeted treatment ap proach, instead of symptomatic control with anti-fungals. Despite t he efficacy of anti-fungals, they are not the defin itive treatment as it does not treat the underlying immunodeficiency and frequent use has been associated with resistance. Patient Presentation and Testing: Our first patient is a 10 y/o boy with recurrent or al/genital candidiasis since infancy. Second is a16 y/o girl with recurrent esophageal candidiasis and third, a 52 y/o female ( mother of patient 2) with persistent vaginal candid iasis for over 30 years. They responded to oral antifungals, but rela psed after discontinuation. CBC, CMP, and T/B/NK ce ll subsets were normal. Two of the patients had slightly low serum Immunoglobulin G levels. Lymphocyte proliferation a to Candida. Delayed-type hy persensitivity skin testing to Candida was also non reactive. This suggested a Candida specific defect, which led to cytokine analysis of the patients. IL-17A was absen t in all patients, while IL-17F was present only in one patient. Genet ic testing for common CMCS/CMCD mutations was negat ive. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patients were diagnosed with CMCD. Several endo typic and genotypic alterations are responsible for the lack of immunity towards candida. However, the absence of I L-17 A is unique to our patients and also plays an important role in immunity against Candida. Our patients presented wi th CMCD and lacked other immunological alterations normally seen with CMCS. Whether the absence of IL-17A alone is responsible for their disease manifestation is yet to be determined. Our patients are doing well on antifung als as needed. However, cases on effective treatmen t with immune modulators have been reported and can be considered for our patients in the future.

Garcia Lloret, MD UCLA- Department of Pedi atrics Case Title: Abatacept therapy for a patient with two novel muta tions in LRBA gene Summary and Lessons Learned: The use of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in our pati ent identified two novel mutations in the LRBA gene resulting in a severe phenotype of autoimmunity and immunodeficien cy. His symptoms were poorly controlled on traditio nal therapies for CVID and autoimmunity. Only with WES were we able to identify his specific immunodeficie ncy and an effective therapy. Abatacept therapy resulted in li fe-changing improvement in his symptoms. Using WES to further define CVID can have both diagnostic and therapeuti c benefits for patients and should be actively purs ued when primary immunodeficiency is suspected. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient presented in 2007 at age 2 with TPN dep endent intractable diarrhea, FTT, immune cytopenias and profound hypogammaglobulinemia. He had an extensive immune w ork-up, the rest of which was unremarkable. With th e presumptive diagnosis of CVID, he was started on Ig replacement. He went on to develop a refractory Ev an's syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and lymphocytic interstitial p neumonitis. Managed with a variety of immunosuppres sive regimes, his condition remained unstable, requiring multiple hospitalizations for respiratory infections, worse ning anemia and electrolyte abnormalities. WES performed in 2016 sh owed compound heterozygous variants (c.1161+1G>A, c .1931dupC) in the LRBA Patient Outcomes: LRBA (lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anch or protein) by bi-allelic muta tions in the LRBA gene resulting in autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation and immunodeficiency presumably through failure of CTLA4- mediated regulation. Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig) has been recently shown to be an effective treatment for sym ptoms of autoimmunity due to LRBA deficiency. Patient was started on Abatacept (422 mg = 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks). Within two months of instituting t his therapy, the diarrhea completely resolved, he had no more episod es of hemolysis and no significant infections. Both his nutritional status and his growth curve improved. He is current ly 12 years old and remains on IVIG but is no longe r on any immunosuppressant medications.

Summary and Lessons Learned: This case involves a previously healthy 2-year-old boy who was admitted for and cefepime-resistant Pseudomonal is typically seen only in an immunocom promised host. He was hospitalized for a total of 3 months an received a total 9 week course of antibiotics wi th meropenem and tobramycin. Our patient's initial immunologic workup was essent ially negative, which led us to investigate the opt ions available for genetic testing. An ion torrent gene chip assay wa s used for the detection of 300 immune dysregulatio n genes from the patient's whole blood specimen was performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This technol ogy allows for rapid gene sequencing and identification of mutatio ns. In the case of our patient, the assay performe d a targeted capture of exons from a panel of immune related gen es. Although no obvious causative agents were iden tified out of the captured regions screened, one novel heterozygo us, missense variant was identified in ERBB2IP, and six uncommon, heterozygous, nonsynonymous, variants of unknown si gnificance, with a CADD-PHRED score greater than 15 were found in RAD50, PTPN13, TRNT1, SLC11A1 and TYK2. Many of these mutations have been linked to other known immunodeficiency syndromes. Although our patient had no overt immunodeficiency identified by routine immunologic screening, an ion torrent assay analysis revealed nonsynonymous mutations in seven genes related to immune dysregulation. This sugges ts a severe form of radiosensitive combined-im munodeficiencies. This indicates that genetic test ing is paramount in the identification and diagnosis of rare immunodefi ciencies, especially in the identification of new a nd novel mutations. Identification of new mutations can assist in earli er diagnosis for other children with similar stigma ta, earlier treatment and prevention of poor outcomes, morbidity and mort ality. Patient Presentation and Testing: Our patient is a previously healthy 2-year-old boy of Asian Indian heritage, who presented to the hosp ital with one day of fever, status epilepticus and respiratory failur e. Initial workup revealed that he was bacteremic with pan-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) grew cefepime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient suffered an ischemic stroke secondary t o septic emboli and CNS vasculitis. Brain MRI loca lized the septic emboli to the right occipitoparietal region with ve ntriculitis. He developed hydrocephalus and an ext ernal ventricular drain was placed, which was later replaced by a ven triculoperitoneal shunt. The patient completed an extensive 9-week course of antibiotics with meropenem and tobramycin , and showed long strides towards recovery at the e nd of his 3- month hospitalization. This 2-year old had no significant past medical his tory. He had never been on antibiotics in the past . His parents reported that he had 1-2 colds per year, but otherw ise he had no significant illnesses or hospitalizat ions. His immunizations were up to date. His growth and deve lopment were appropriate for his age. His parents are first cousins. There was no personal or family history o f HIV, miscarriages, chronic diarrhea, heart defect s, facial defects, eczema, abnormal teeth, fractures, delayed umbilica l cord separation or delayed teeth eruption. There was no family history of immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, autoi mmune disease or frequent/recurrent infections. The initial evaluation included a complete blood co unt which showed leukocytosis with marked left shif t and thrombocytopenia. His metabolic panel showed stabl e electrolytes with good kidney function. The C-re active protein was elevated. Urinalysis and urine culture were ne gative. Blood culture drawn prior to initiation of antibiotics showed pan-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, th e initial CSF culture aeruginosa r esistant to cefepime. Initial immunology workup revealed normal immunoglo bulins, and normal T, B and natural killer (NK) cel l enumerations (percentage and total counts). Pneumococcal, dipht heria and tetanus titers were protective. The concanavalin A (conA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) were adequate. HIV 1/2 antibody test was negative, oxidative burst was nor mal, and complement C3, C4 and CH50 were normal. A lternate complement pathway (AH50) was normal as well. Swea t chloride testing was unable to be performed due t o an inadequate specimen, however, our patient's newborn screen was negative for cystic fibrosis. CD11 and CD18 were also normal. An ion torrent gene chip assay used for the detecti on of 300 immune dysregulation genes from the patie nt's whole blood specimen was performed at the National Instit utes of Health (NIH). The ion torrent assay is a t ype of DNA sequencing technology that breaks down DNA into fra gments which are then amplified with adapters conta ining complementary base pairs to which they will bind. This technology allows for rapid gene sequencing an d identification of mutations. In the case of our patient, the assa y performed a targeted capture of exons from a pane l of immune related genes. Although no obvious causative agent s were identified out of the captured regions scree ned, one novel heterozygous, missense variant was identified in ER BB2IP, and six uncommon, heterozygous, nonsynonymou s, variants of unknown significance, with a CADD-PHRED score gr eater than 15 were found in RAD50, PTPN13, TRNT1, S LC11A1 and TYK2. These genes are related to immune dysregulati on and have been linked to other known immunodefici encies. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The results of the ion torrent gene assay revealed a possible novel combined-immunodeficiency syndrome , in particular atypical autosomal recessive hyper IgE-Syndrome (AR HIES) a less severe form of radiosensitive comb ined- immunodeficiencies. Our patient remained hospitali zed for 3 months but showed significant strides tow ards recovery at the time of discharge. During his hospitalization he was treated for 9 weeks with meropenem and tobra mycin for Pseudomonal sepsis, meningoencephalitis and presume d ventriculitis. He was discharged to an inpatient rehab facility and continues to follow up with the Immunology team for ongoing investigation into the etiology of his severe infection.

Summary and Lessons Learned: We describe a case of a male with Bruton's agammagl obulinemia (XLA) diagnosed at 16 months of age and treated with IVIG who presented at 3 1/2 year of age with a 4-mo nth history of poor linear growth, obesity, increas ing clumsiness, stumbling and falling as well as refusal to climb s tairs. In addition he started having difficulty tal king. A brain MRI showed features of demyelinating brain disease. We suspect ed that his condition was caused by infection rathe r than by inflammatory process such as acute demylelinating m eningoencephalitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) - like disease or by congenital leukodystrophy. Enteroviral infection s were reported as a cause of chronic meningoenceph alitis in agammaglobulinemia (CEMA), but we haven't found it in CSF tested by RT PCR on two separate occasions ( 1). The CSF was also negative for other viruses and bacteria. O n the other hand the CSF contained high myelin basi c protein (MBP) and, surprisingly, there was IgG and 5 oligoclonal bands, which were absent in the serum. As we were conducting patient's work up a report wa s published in NEJM showing that the next generatio n sequencing (NGS) successfully identified neuroleptospirosis n ot detectable by the conventional CSF tests in anot her patient with immunodeficiency, which encouraged us to use this d iagnostic method in our patient (2) Applying metag enomic NGS allows for identification of all genetic material i n the sample and characterization of known pathogen s and of novel pathogens that elude conventional testing. The unbi ased NGS was performed by Dr. Charles Chiu at the U niversity of California, San Francisco, but no infectious materi al was detected. The patient's clinical condition continued to deter iorate and we consulted Dr. Waldman at Children's H ospital of Philadelphia. She found no evidence of leukodystrop hy, but in brain biopsy performed there Enterovirus was identified by PCR. In the recently published review Bearden et al., re commend brain biopsy if there is a high index of su spicion of enteroviral infection and progressive neurologic de terioration in patients with XLA (3). However, as a base for this recommendation they described only one case. Our ca se is different that in addition to RT PCR, we also performed the NGS, which may be perceived (not necessarily proven ) to have a higher sensitivity than PCR. Brain biopsy is obviously an invasive procedure. Th us, those taking care of patients similar to ours m ight lean towards less invasive testing like the NGS in CSF, as erron eously as we did. Patient Presentation and Testing: We describe a case of a male with Bruton's agammagl obulinemia (XLA) diagnosed at 16 months of age. Pri or to the diagnosis the patient had frequent ear and upper re spiratory infections, which were attributed to his attendance at day care. He presented for evaluation after he was foun d to be neutropenic with ANC 100 cells/mm3. This pr ompted measurement of immunoglobulins, which were as (14-106) 4 IU/ml. Flow cytometry revealed n o CD19+ cells, and normal -T and -NK cells. A BTK g ene sequencing revealed a novel variant c.1185G>A (p.Trp395X), whi ch was predicted to lead to a nonsense mutation and had been scored as probably associated with X-linked agammag lobulinemia. The family history revealed no consang uinity or immunodeficiency. Patient has been growing normally and achieved developmental milestones as expected. We started replacement with 500 mg/kg of IVIG, whic h initially was infused every 3 weeks and then mont hly. A through of IgG was maintained > 600 mg%. Neutropenia and ea r infections resolved. He was well till age 3-year-and- 8 months when he p resented with a 4-month history of poor linear grow th and obesity. He was noticed to refuse to climb chairs, became cl umsy, was easily stumbling and falling. In addition he started having difficulty talking. A MRI revealed: \"multifocal whi te matter abnormalities in the supratentorial compa rtment and slightly seen in the pons with and increased signal along th e undersurface of the corpus callosum. Findings may represent dysmyelination or demyelination rather than a delay ed myelination.\" We suspected that this condition was caused by prim ary infection rather than by inflammatory process, like acute demylinating meningoencephalitis (ADEM), multiple s clerosis (MS) - like disease or by congenital leuko dystrophy. We performed a spinal tap, which ( neu trophils 8 %, limphocytes 72% and mg% 48 mg% (range: 15-45). Myelin base was elevated at 2.3 ng/ml (range: 0. 0-1.2). Surprisingly, there were also five oligoclonal band s, which were present in the CSF, but were not dete cted in the serum. On a repeat CSF analysis performed a month later th ere was 3.9 mg% of IgG (range: albumin index was 4 (range: 0- 8) , which is consistent with intact blood-brain barrier. This in dicated that IgG in the CSF was not from IVIG, but probably of intrinsic origin. No commercial laboratory agreed to look for B lymphocytes in the CSF. On both spinal taps, the CSF tested by RT PCR was n egative for Enterovirus. It was also negative for J VC, HSV 1, HSV 2, EBV, and Mycoplasma by PCR. Bacterial and mycobacte rial cultures, were negative. Hoping that it might be he lpful in diagnosis we measured cytokines in CSF, an d the results were as follow: All results are in the pg/ml. IL-1 Beta ( GM-CSF: 3 (range<1). The results are not easy to interpret. I ncreased cytokines indicated primarily activation o f Th1 cells T (TNF and INF), but also activation of macrophages (IL-1 Beta and GM-CSF) as well as of Th2 cells (IL-4) The results of other tests were as follows: CBC: WB C 4.7, Hb normal comprehensive metabolic panel . MRI of the cervical spine did not show any signal a bnormalities. Consulting neurogeneticist initiated work up for, i n her opinion, an unlikely leukodystrophy. The resu lts were as carn itine, VLCFA and urine organic acids. During the time we were conducting the patient's wo rk up a report was published in NEJM showing that t he next generation sequencing (NGS) successfully identified neuroleptospirosis not detectable by the conventio nal CSF tests in another patient with immunodeficiency. This encoura ged us to use this diagnostic method in our patient (2). Applying metagenomic NGS allows identification of all geneti c material in the sample and characterization of kn own pathogens and of novel pathogens that elude conventional test ing. The unbiased NGS was performed by Dr. Charles Chiu at the University of California, San Francisco, and it detected no infectious material Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Despite negative CSF studies we worried that we are missing an enteroviral infection. Even though, cur rently there is no specific therapy for enetroviral infections, as our patient continued to neurologically worsen, we dec ided to treat him with high doses of immunoglobulins, as has been don e previously by others for chronic enteroviral myel oencephalitis. We treated our patient with 2 g/kg IVIG, and starte d weekly infusions of SCIG. We aimed to keep throug h level at 2000 mg%. However, the patient continued to worsen. A follow up MRI revealed development of extensive a trophy with dysmyelination or worsening demyelinati on and demonstrated a large bilateral chronic subdural hem atoma. Therefore, we decided to treat a potentially develo ping ADEM, and the patient received a high dose (30 mg/kg) of IV solumedrol daily for 5 days. However, no improvemen t in the patient's condition was appreciated, and i n fact he has been progressively deteriorating further. His speec h became reduced to monosyllables and later no lang uage at all. He lost his toilet training. His gait which was initia lly wide-based progressed to a non-ambulatory state and later to spastic quadriparesis. He lost head control, and was having difficulty feeding, chocking with liquid and solid food, in addition he developed persistent horizontal nystagmus. In this situation, a year after he presented with n eurological symptoms, we decided to consider treatm ent with Rituximab anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody. This idea might seem counterintuitive in the patient who had no B lymphocytes. However, we knew the findings by Nonoy ama et al., who reported that patients with XLA hav e small number of \"leaky B cells\" which can proliferate, un dergo isotype switching, and differentiation into s pecific Ab- producing cells (4). There was also evidence that B cells play the role in multiple sclerosis (MS), th e prototypical inflammatory demyelinating disease. In addition, th ere were reports of some benefit from B-cell deplet ion in MS (5, 6). Thus, our patient received IV Rituximab once weekly 375 mg/m2 for 4 weeks. However, again no measurab le improvement of his condition was noticed. Eventually, fifteen months after presenting with ne urological symptoms, a brain biopsy was performed a t Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Microscopic examination o f dura showed no significant pathologic changes. Th ere was leptomeningeal chronic inflammation with lymphocyte s and macrophages highlighted by CD68, CD163, CD45 and CD3. The gray matter demonstrated loss of neurons, react ive astrogliosis and microglial nodules. A chronic inflammatory process involved the white matter with perivascular cuffs and wide spread T- lymphocytes. No B lymphoc ytes were present, but note that the brain biopsy was perform ed a month after the last dose of Rutiximab. Subdur al membrane demonstrated fibrous tissue with granulation tissue and meningeal cells hyperplasia. There were numero us highlighted and CD68 and T lym phocytes. Scattered hemosiderin deposits were ident ified and iron stain was highlighted them. The morphological features were those of severe, no n-necrotizing, chronic meningoencephalitis and in k eeping with enteroviral meningoencephalitis. Brain tissue was positive for Enterovirus (by PCR). There is currently no specific treatment for entero viral infections, but new promising antiviral drugs are in development. Thus, if there is a high index of suspicion of ente roviral infection and progressive neurologic deter ioration in patients with XLA, a brain biopsy should be considered. References: 1.

Summary and Learned: Rationale: Congenital Agammaglobulinemia is a prima ry immunodeficiency usually caused by defects in B cell development. Patients typically present with recurr ent sinopulmonary or invasive infections with encap sulated bacteria. Immune system evaluation frequently demonstrates ab sent immunoglobulins and a paucity of B lymphocytes . X-linked Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) gene is the most common genetic variant identified (approximately 90%). We describe a unique case of a school aged male with a history of Haemophilus influenza meningitis as well as absent immunoglobulins and B cells without a recognized ge netic defect after extensive testing. Methods: Genetic testing was performed by Invitae C orporation. Immunologic testing was performed by AR UP Laboratories as well as Cincinnati Children's Hospi tal Diagnostic Immunology lab. Results: Patient is a nine year old immunized male with history of polymicrogyria, ADHD, seizures and mild recurrent sinopulmonary infections who presented with two ser ious infections within the past year. He had no hi story of serious infections until the age of nine years. At that tim e, he presented with headache, altered mental statu s and fever. He was subsequently diagnosed with Haemophilus influen za meningitis. After an uneventful recovery, he pr esented two months later with an intra-abdominal soft tissue in fection. Subsequent immunological studies revealed absent immunoglobulins and B cells. He also had no respon ses to his previous vaccinations. Testing for BTK p athogenic variants was negative. Secondary testing for agammaglobuline mia, hypogammaglobulinemia, as well as common varia ble immune deficiency associated genes was also negativ e for any pathogenic variants (30 genes). Conclusions: X-linked agammaglobulinemia is the mos t common cause of congenital agammaglobulinemia occ urring in 1 in 250,000 persons. While there have been other rep orted cases of autosomal recessive forms of agammag lobulinemia, these cases still remain relatively rare. We repor t a patient with history and labs consistent with c ongenital agammaglobulinemia without a clear genetic etiology . Determining the genetic etiology of an immunodefi ciency is important in terms of assisting with future prognos tic factors as well as with any future genetic coun seling regarding potential offspring. Whole exome sequencing is bei ng pursued in this patient to establish a genetic c ause. This will allow us to potentially uncover new genetic causes for agammaglobulinemia which will benefit the commu nity of allergy immunology by providing information to continue to expand the knowledge base for immunodeficiency. I n addition, it is important to realize that agammaglobulinemia can present at varying ages and to remember to always keep it as a differential diagnosis. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient initially presented to the emergency de partment with two days of fevers to 102-103F, heada che, neck pain, sore throat as well as one day of altered mental st atus. The patient had been evaluated by his Pediat rician on the day of presentation to the emergency department, was diagn osed with strep pharyngitis, and given an IM inject ion of Rocephin. Rapid flu testing at the Pediatrician's office was negative. The patient then presented to the emergency department later that day secondary to increasing a lteration of his mental status. In the emergency d epartment, the patient was noted to have a physical exam consisten t with meningitis signs including a positive Kernig , positive Brudzinski, and altered mental status with GCS of 1 1-12. Lumbar puncture was obtained which returned grossly purulent fluid significant for 10,240 WBC, glucose of 25, and elevated protein. Procalcitonin was ele vated to 48.9. Other pertinent lab findings include thrombocytopenia as well as mild hyponatremia. CT of the head/sinus wa s obtained which was negative for abscess but positive for mil d paranasal sinus mucosal thickening. Chest x-ray was negative for any radiographic abnormality. Patient was subseque ntly admitted to empiric therapy with rocephin, vancomycin, and acyclovir. CSF cultu res ultimately returned positive for Haemophilus in fluenza, patient was treated with a ten day course of rocephin. Thr ombocytopenia and hyponatremia self-resolved prior to discharge. The patient presented with a second serious infecti on two months later. The patient presented to the emergency department with seven days of worsening left sided abdominal, hip, and back pain. The patient had dai ly fevers to 102.5F. The patient had presented to the emergency department once prior as well as to his pediatrici an's for one visit. The patient had been started on miralax for a moder ate stool burden visualized on abdominal x-ray. Pat ient was found to be positive for coronavirus, Rhino/enterovirus b y respiratory swab at the pediatrician's office. F urther work up was initiated when the patient presented to the emergen cy department for the second time on day seven of i llness. A CBC, CMP, lipase, CRP, mono screen, EBV antibodies, rapi d strep, throat culture, urinalysis, urine culture, blood culture, ultrasound of appendix, CT abdomen and pelvis were obtained. Imaging returned normal. Labs were sign ificant for leukocytosis to 15.6 with a predominance of neutrop hils, and CRP elevated to 24.4. Patient was admi tted for abdominal pain and started on medications for pain control. MRI of the spine/pelvis were then obtaine d with concern for an increased dose of T2 signal intensity in the left iliacus muscle extending along the psoas. Re peat MRI of the pelvis was obtained to clarify the area of involvement of T2 intensity which returned consistent with myositi s/fasciitis. Vancomycin was started and then later changed to ce ftarolin. Patient recovered without incident. Initial immunoglobulins were undetectable. Immun oglobulin levels were repeated and confirmed as abs ent IgA, IgG, and IgM. At follow up he was found to have absent r esponses to diphtheria and tetanus. Subsequent lym phocyte subsets revealed absent B cells. T cell absolute n umber was within normal limits. Bruton Tyrosine K inase (BTK) genetic testing was sent to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. BTK testing returned negative for a mutation. Additional genetic panel for 30 genes associated with common variable immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, and agammaglobulinemia were sent to invitae. This pane l also returned negative for any mutations. Patient is currently following with genetics and al lergy immunology to pursue whole exome sequencing. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient having two serious invasive infections within a couple of months of each other prompted sc reening immunoglobulin levels to be obtained during the pat ient's second hospitalization course. Since the sc reening levels returned low, repeat immunoglobulin levels were obt ained from a more sensitive testing modality. Thes e values returned absent. The labs were concerning for an i mmunodeficiency therefore further investigation ens ued. Lymphocyte subsets were obtained to try to help dif ferentiate between deficiencies of B versus T cells versus both. Lymphocyte subset results of absent B cells with no rmal number of absolute T cells. This combined wit h lack of response to immunization titers lead to a pattern c onsistent with congenital agammaglobulinemia. The most common genetic defect for congenital agammaglobulinemia is a mutation in BTK, which occurs in 90% of males wi th agammaglobulinemia. The BTK testing was therefore obtained which returned negative. Subsequently a p anel of 30 genes associated with common variable immunodeficie ncy, hypogammaglobulinemia, and agammaglobulinemia was obtained which also returned negative. Whole exome sequencing is now being pursued with allergy immun ology as well as genetics department to try to determine if the p atient has an undiscovered genetic cause for his agammaglobulinemia. The patient was also started o n weekly home subcutaneous injections of immunoglob ulin therapy, after the patient was recognized as having lack of immunoglobulins and B cells. The patient has remained infection free for four months since initiating the rapy and the patient's mother reported that the pat ient has also not had any upper respiratory symptoms which he had fre quently at baseline throughout his life. Repeat tr ough levels of IgG were obtained which revealed improvement which assisted verification of adequate replacement thera py being achieved. In conclusion, the patient's history, im munologic work up, and response to subcutaneous imm unoglobulin therapy is most consistent with a form of congenita l agammaglobulinemia. At this time the genetic cau se for his congenital agammaglobulinemia is unknown which is w hy we are continuing to pursue whole exome genetic sequencing. BTK which is the most common genetic c ause was negative. The other more rare autosomal r ecessive forms that have been discovered as causes for conge nital agammaglobulinemia are less consistent with t he patient's presentation as well given that the patient does ha ve other significant past medical history including seizures, polymicrogyra as well as that he presented later th an most at 9 years of age. Submission Number: 243 Poster Number: 131 Keyword: Immunodeficiency Primary Author Name: Alissa Welsh, MD Primary Author Institution: Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Additional Authors: Kenneth Paris, MD Department of Pediatrics, Louisiana State Universit y Health Sciences Center, Children's Hospital of Ne w Orleans, Division of Allergy/Immunology Case Title: Hypogammaglobulinemia in a Patient with Cardiofacio cutaneous Syndrome Summary and Lessons Learned: Introduction: Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome (CFC) is a rare autos omal dominant (AD) disorder arising from mutations in several genes, which lead to defects in the RAS/MAPK pathwa y, similar to Noonan Syndrome and Costello Syndrome . CFC is associated with heart defects (pulmonic stenosis or atrial septal defect), distinct facial features (h ypertelorism, ptosis, micrognathia and low set (eczema, ichthiosis, nevi, keratosis pilaris and thin, curly hair, along with curly, sparse or absent eyelashes and ey ebrows). There have been case reports of lymphatic dysplasia, leukoproliferative disease and autoimmune disease i n patients with associated RASopathies, however immunodeficiencies including hypogammaglobulinemia have not been described in CFC. Case Report: A 4-year-old female with history of CFC per genetic testing, presented with recurrent infections inclu ding frequent viral infections requiring hospitalization, and frequent severe gastrointestinal infections including Clostr idium dificile and Hafnia alvei, as well as recurrent otitis media. U pon presentation, she was found to be lymphopenic, with normal albumin levels, and hypogammaglobulinemic with IgG of 308 and IgA of 17.9 were noted. Pneumococcal ti ters were obtained and found to be protective to 0 of 14 stra ins tested, despite having received full childhood vaccination series, including pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine. She developed borderline protective titers to onl y 5 of 14 serotypes after receiving the pneumococcal 23-valen t polysaccharide vaccine. Flow cytometry was compl eted which revealed low B and T cell numbers, with normal natu ral killer cells. Switched memory B switch cells w ere also low. She also had a history of seizures, which are a known a ssociation of CFC and was also being worked up for possible mitochondrial disorder with history of acidosis. F urther evaluation and treatment with IVIG are pendi ng. Discussion: Our patient presented clinically with recurrent inf ections, and was found to have persistent hypogamma globulinemia, along with low CD4 and CD8 T cells. Low switch memo ry B cells on flow cytometry were also noted, possi bly associated with her blunted response to Pneumovax. As previou sly mentioned there are reports of lymphatic defect s, predisposition toward cancers including leukoprolif erative diseases, and autoimmune disease with RASop athies, however immunodeficiencies, including hypogammaglob ulinemia have not been reported with CFC. Her clin ical phenotype can in part be explained by her documente d humoral immunodeficiency. Conclusion: CFC is rare syndrome, affecting multiple organ syst ems including the immune system. While there are k nown associations with lymphatic dysplasia and leukoprol iferative disease, other immune deficiency such as hypogammaglobulinemia had not previously been descr ibed, and should be considered in these patients. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient presented as a consult during hospitali zation under the gastroenterology service for blood y diarrhea, and was also noted to have recurrent viral infections r equiring hospitalization, recurrent otitis media an d severe GI infections including Clostridium dificile and Hafnia alvei req uiring hospitalization. Upon presentation she had a lready been diagnoses with CFC per genetic testing. Immunology service was consulted and records revealed lymphope nia on multiple occasions. Hypogammaglobulinemia with IgG of 308 and IgA of 17.9 were revealed. Pneumococca l titers were obtained and found to be protective to 0 of 14 stra ins tested, despite having received full childhood vaccination series, including pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine. She developed borderline protective titers to onl y 5 of 14 serotypes after receiving the pneumococcal 23-valen t polysaccharide vaccine. Flow cytometry was compl eted which revealed low B and T cell numbers, with normal natu ral killer cells. Switched memory B switch cells w ere also low. Labs were repeated including when child was well and IgG remained low. Patient continued to get recurrent infections, so decision was made to treat with IVIG which is curre ntly pending. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our diagnoses is hypogammaglobulinemia based on per sistently low immunoglobulin levels. CFC diagnoses was already in place upon presentation and was initially based off of clinical phenotype and confirmed by genetic testing. Treatment with IVIG is pending due to frequency and severity of infections with persistently low immunoglobulin levels along with sub-optimal response to pneumococcal 23-valent poly vaccine. Submission Keyword: Immunodeficiency Primary Author Name: Colleen Sabella, MD Author Institution: Phoenix Children's Hospital Additional Authors: Ronald Mittel, MD, Phoenix Children's Hospital Case Title: Delayed Diagnosis of DOCK8 Deficiency Summary and Lessons Learned: Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive, combined immunodeficienc y characterized by severe atopy, increased susceptibility to cutane ous viral infections, Staphylococcus skin abscesses , and sinopulmonary infections. Typically, eczema present s during infancy and other symptoms develop through out childhood. Here we present a case of DOCK8 deficien cy with delayed diagnosis at age 12 that originally manifested with diffuse eczema and a severe genitorectal HPV infect ion during infancy. Unusually severe viral skin inf ections, especially in infants with atopic dermatitis, should prompt pr imary care physicians and immunologists to consider DOCK8 deficiency in the differential. Case reports of rar e diseases help elucidate variable pathogenesis. In the case of DOCK8 deficiency, early diagnosis may prevent life threat ening infections and malignancies. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient was referred to immunology at 12 years of age after developing vesicular lesions in the cr anial V1 distribution consistent with herpes zoster that req uired hospitalization for IV acyclovir. Upon review of his medical history, the patient was born to unrelated parents at full term. He exhibited diffuse eczematous chang es within a few weeks of birth. By 8 months of age, he developed a severe genitorectal HPV infection, requiring multip le surgical debridements to resect the lesions. He later develo ped recurrent skin abscesses, oral candidiasis, and MRSA impetigo. Additional atopic comorbidities include allergic rh asthma, and food allergies. Due to the seve rity of his herpes zoster episode and history of recurrent infections, immunology work up was initiated at age 12. Labora tory analysis was significant for eosinophilia, low CD4+ (300/mm3) an d CD8+ ted IgE (1315 normal IgM, IgG, and IgA levels. Lympho cyte mitogen and antigen stimulation studies reveal ed absent response to candida and tetanus. Given his history of atopy and severe viral cutaneous infections, alo ng with eosinophilia, lymphopenia, and T cell dysfunction, DOCK8 deficiency was highly suspected. DOCK8 protei n expression was markedly reduced on flow cytometry. Sequencing of the DOCK8 gene revealed a pathogenic point mutat ion (c.2971- 1G > A). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with DOCK8 deficiency. He recently underwent a myeloablative allogenic stem cell transplant from a matched, unrelated donor (10/10). Hematopoie tic stem cell transplant is the only curative thera py for DOCK8 deficiency. Currently, the patient remains hospita lized after his transplant due to complications of acute kidney injury and acquired anemia.

Lei ding MD Case Title: \"Diagnosis and Treatment of a Patient with CTLA-4 H aploinsufficiency\" Summary and Lessons Learned: Our patient is a 13 year-old Hispanic male who carr ied a diagnosis of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune- mediated thrombocytopenia with antiplatelet antibod ies consistent with Evan's syndrome. His symptoms b egan when he was 11 years old. He presented initially with in termittent fevers, fatigue, pallor, and scattered p etechiae on the extremities. He was found to have pancytopenia with reticulocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy was signific ant for hypocellular marrow with marked erythroid hypoplasi a. He also had parvovirus viremia with a viral load greater than 1 million copies/mL. Despite treatment with recurrent steroid pulses, blood transfusions, and mycophenol ate mofetil, he continued to have autoimmune hemolytic anemia and t hrombocytopenia and was treated with rituximab. Hem oglobin and platelets recovered within a few months post ri tuximab treatment. Over the next six months, he dev eloped severe polyarticular arthritis and occasional dyspnea. He was treated with abatacept and had significant impr ovement in arthritis and dyspnea. Immunologic evaluation was i nitiated and he was ultimately found to have a hete rozygous splice site (c.567+1G>A) mutation in CTLA-4 consistent CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency. This case demonstrates that CTLA-4 haploinsufficien cy has many autoimmune manifestations that can deve lop at different times mimicking isolated rheumatologic co nditions. CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency is characterize lymphoid proliferation in non-lymphoid organs including inte stine, brain, and lung. Patients can also present w ith hematologic cytopenias and immunodeficiency. Our patient had ma ny of the features of CTLA-4 haploinsuffiiency. Mos t remarkably, he also had polyarticular arthritis, which has not been previously described with CTLA-4 haploinsuffic iency. Patient Presentation and Testing: Our patient is a 13 year-old male with history of w arm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia with antiplatelet antibodies consi stent with Evan's syndrome who presented to our imm une dysregulation clinic for evaluation. He was diagnos ed at age 11. Prior to presentation in our clinic, he had been treated with multiple courses of steroids and mycophenolate mofetil in addition to a 4-week course of rituxima b. However, he continued to have frequent relapses of anemia and t hrombocytopenia. On presentation to our clinic, he complained of severe joint pain and swelling despite continued tr eatment with mycophenolate mofetil. Joints affected included bilateral knees, ankles, wrists, and all small join ts of the fingers. Based on his history of Evan's syndrome and systemi c juvenile arthritis, primary immunodeficiency dis ease was suspected. Immune evaluation revealed normal T, B, NK cell populations, normal T cell proliferative re sponses, and immunoglobulin quantities. An evaluation for autoi mmune lymphoproliferative disease was unyielding an d he had normal quantities of CD4-CD8- T cells. Because of s ystemic arthritis, he was referred to rheumatology. Because of high suspicion of an immunodysregulatory primary immunod eficiency disease, genetic testing was performed. A deleterious splice site mutation was found indicating CTLA-4 ha ploinsufficiency. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: In patients with CTLA-4 haoploinsufficiency, there is usually a history of antibody mediated cytopenia s in addition to a constellation of other immune mediated diseases..2 Abatacept is as CTLA-4 fusion protein composed of t he Fc region of IgG1 bound to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4. A batacept was initiated in our patient and he had si gnificant improvement in arthritis and pulmonary symptoms wit hin 2 infusions. Further studies to assess for mani festations of CTLA-4 deficiency have including imaging of the bra in, lungs, and serologic assessment for insulin res istance have been normal. References: 1.

Case Title: DiGeorge Syndrome (DGS) Variant and Immune Manifest ations in an Infant of a Diabetic Mother (IDM) Summary and Lessons Learned: Rationale: DGS is classically caused by a mutation on chromosome 22q11. DGS variant or DGS phenotype are terms used to describe patients presenting with a typical DGS phenotype but lack a 22q11 mutation. DGS vari ants are caused by other genetic abnormalities and teratogens inclu ding retinoic acids, alcohol, and maternal diabetes . The phenotype and immunological manifestations of DGS variants ar e extremely heterogeneous. We present a case of a D GS variant in an infant born to a diabetic mother. Methods: Case Description Results: A term male infant born to a 28-year-old mother with insulin-dependent diabetes was found to have hypocalcemia, hypoparathyroidism, butterfly vertebr ae, cardiac abnormalities, and an involuted thymus. Newborn screen was notable for repeatedly abnormal TREC. S CID panel revealed heterozygous mutations for Ligas e-4, STIM4 and DOCK8. did not reveal any fu rther immunologic mutations. Laboratory evaluation revealed normal FISH for 22q11.2 and a normal microarray. Is ohemagglutinin at birth was negative. Initial subs ets showed CD4% and CD8% as low as 23% and 9%, respectively, with a total count of 265 and 100. He was placed on proph ylactic Bactrim and is avoiding live vaccines. IgG, IgA, and IgM le vels have been normal. The patient demonstrated los s of antibody protection to tetanus. B cell panel showed normal percentages of CD45RA/RO. Currently 17 months old, the patient has shown a slow increase in his lymphocyte subsets, wi th his most recent CD4 count being 897 (normal rang e 1300-3400 in children age 12-23 months) and CD8 count being 660 (normal range 620 -2000 in children age 12-23 month s). Conclusions: DGS variant in infants born to diabeti c mothers is rare but has been described. Immunodef iciency usually improves gradually in these variants. We describe a case of a DGS variant, his phenotypic manifestatio n, and his immunological findings. We note that he interesting ly carries heterozygous mutations for multiple SCID -associated genes. Whether these genes are involved with the s low improvement in his lymphocyte subsets or the in ability to maintain specific antibody protection is unknown. I t is important to increase awareness of DGS variant s and closely follow these patients' immune function, which can b e highly variable. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient initially presented as a full-term baby born to a diabetic mother. In the newborn nursery, he developed respiratory distress. A chest x-ray revealed cardio megaly and vertebral body abnormalities. An echocar diogram showed VSD, ASD and PFO. There were no limb abnormalities, esophageal abnormalities, or anal atresia on exam. Renal ultrasound showed mild hydronephrosis. He did not m eet criteria for VACTERL, and his findings were lik ely the result of uncontrolled maternal diabetes before and soon afte r conception. In order to rule out an underlying ch romosomal abnormality, a microarray was sent and was within n ormal limits. Patient was then noted to have persis tent hypocalcemia raising concern for the possibility of DiGeorge Syndrome, for which FISH analysis of 22q1 1 was sent. During this time, his newborn screen panel resulted with abnormal TREC values, at which point our serv ice was consulted. We suggested lymphocyte subsets, mitogen ic and antigenic responses, CD45 RA/RO and SCID pan el. We also suggested a chest ultrasound to assess for thymic t issue, which revealed an involuted thymus. Given th at genetic testing for 22q11 was negative, our service was suspicious for either a genetic DiGeorge variant or a variant secondary to being an infant of a diabetic mother. TBX1 genetic testi ng for DiGeorge subsets revealed low CD4 an d CD8 T cells. Given that an underlying diagnosis was not r eached and the patient had multiple abnormalities, whole exome sequencing was sent and did not reveal any further mutations. The diagnosis of DiGeorge variant second ary to being an Infant of a Diabetic mother was made. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This patient's constellation of anatomic anomalies, endocrine derangements, and immunodeficiency was s uggestive of a classic DiGeorge Syndrome. FISH analysis for 22q11 and microarray were normal, implying that this pati ent is a DiGeorge variant. TBX1 genetic testing was negative, confirm ing a teratogenic cause for DiGeorge variant, speci fically being an infant of a diabetic mother. Given this diagnosis a nd the variability of immune function in these pati ents, he had a full immunological workup and was noted to have CD4 and CD8 lymphopenia. He was managed with prophylactic B actrim and avoidance of live vaccines. The patient follows with our immunology clinic every few months to und ergo testing of his immune function, which is described to improve in variants, in contrast to classic DiGeorge Syndro me. As his lymphocyte subsets improve, we hope to vaccinate hi m with live vaccines and discontinue prophylaxis wi th Bactrim.

Interestingly, this patient was diagnosed with WABS and ITK deficiency followin g his Hodgkin's diagnosis. There are no published reports of patie nts with both WABS and ITK deficiency. This case r einforces the fact that primary immunodeficiency may initially present with symptoms other than chronic infection. Patient Presentation and Testing: An eight year-old male was referred for evaluation due to a 4 month history of a waxing and waning uni lateral neck mass. The mass had first been noted following an e pisode of febrile tonsillitis. The patient's medic al history as significant for poor weight gain and mild intellect ual disability. Family history was significant for parental consanguinity (first cousins). Following an excisional biopsy, b one marrow aspiration, and scans, classic Hodgkin's stage IIB was diagnosed. The patient enrolled in the experimenta l arm of the COG:AHOD1331 study in November of 2015 . The chemotherapy agents used were Brentuximab, Etoposid e, Doxorubicin, and Cyclophosphamide with Prednison e. Due to microcephaly, bilateral hearing loss, intellectual disability, and the recent Hodgkin's diagnosis pati ent was evaluated by genetics with whole exome sequencing. A homozygous pathogenic c.223C>T mutation in DDX11 gene associat ed with Warsaw breakage syndrome and a homozygous pathogeni c terminal deletion mutation in interleukin-2-induc ible T cell kinase gene (ITK) associated with lymphoproliferati ve syndrome 1 were identified. The patient's siste r was heterozygous for DDX11 and ITK genes. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: This patient was diagnosed via whole exome sequenci ng with both ITK deficiency and Warsaw breakage syn drome. Subsequently, the patient was found to have persist ent Epstein-Barr Virus viremia, for which he was st arted on viral thymidine kinase inhibitors. Due to the known risk of recurrent lymphoproliferative malignancy in the setting of ITK with EBV viremia the patient underwent allogenic stem ce ll transplant in February of 2017, utilizing a cond and Engraftment was rapid however the patient de veloped respiratory symptoms and tested positive for human metapneumovirus in the immediate period following h is transplant. High dose IVIG was administered, howev er viral infection persisted for several weeks. Po st-transplant prophylaxis for graft versus host disease with Meth otrexate and Tacrolimus was also administered, howe ver, the patient developed steroid refractory acute GVHD of the skin , gut, and liver with a maximum acuity of grade IV. Twelve mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusions were used to treat the acute GVHD with complete recovery. His hu man metapneumovirus infection also resolved and the pat ient continues to do well just over one year out fr om transplant.

Patients generally have hypogammaglobinemia, recurr ent sinopulmonary infections, impaired functional a ntibody response, inflammatory, and autoimmune manifestatio ns. Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS) is a recurrent inflammatory glaucoma with increased intraocular pr essure. It more commonly presents unilaterally and typically lasts days to weeks. Ocular complications have been descr ibed in patients with CVID; However, PSS has not be en associated. We report the case of a patient with CVID who devel oped decreased vision and headaches secondary to PS S. This is a rare presentation of a woman with a primary immunod eficiency of CVID and an inflammatory disease of PS S. A distinct relationship still needs to be established; However , this case might draw attention to possible ocular findings in this rare disorder. Patient Presentation and Testing A 36 year old woman with a history of recurrent sin opulmonary infections underwent blood testing which revealed very low levels of immunoglobulins with poor response to polysaccharide vaccine, and a diagnosis of CVID wa s made. The patient began receiving intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. In February 2017, patient presented to an ophthalmologist for problems with blurred vision, m ild eye discomfort, and headaches. The symptoms cam e on in the morning and lasted 1-2 weeks for the past two month s and are associated with light flashes and disorie ntation. Tonometry revealed bilateral increased intraocular pressure (OD 34 mmHg and OS 42 mmHg) and slit lamp examination revealed stellate keratic precipitates; a diagnosis of PSS was made. Diagnosis, Treatment, and Patient Outcomes For the treatment of PSS the patient was started on Lotemax 0.5% suspension: 1 drop into both eyes twi ce a day. Within two months of treatment, the patient noticed an imp rovement in her symptoms. Follow up ocular slit lam p examination revealed a few faint keratic precipitates and tonom etry showed bilateral decreased intraocular pressur e (OD 15 mmHg and OS 9 mmHg). Patient continues to follow up with the ophthalmologist with no further complaints.

Inc, Mayfield Heights, Ohio Case Title : Common Variable Immunodeficiency Associated with Stiff-Person Syndrome Summary and Lessons Learned This is a unique case of a patient who had multiple years of musculoskeletal weakness and gluteal atro phy without a known diagnosis despite extensive medical workup in cluding negative anti-GAD 65 antibodies. During thi s period, the patient began to develop recurrent sinopulmonary in fections. With a thorough immunologic workup, the p atient was diagnosed with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CV ID) and started on immunoglobulin therapy. Multiple years later, repeat testing for anti-GAD 65 antibodies wa s positive leading to the diagnosis of Stiff-Person Syndrome (SPS). The SPS disease is characterized by rigidity, stiffness , and weakness of the truncal muscles due to autoan 65 GAD65). Autoimmune diseases involving many with CVID including and gastrointestinal; however , the neurologic system is less commonly associated. Diagnostic evaluation to identify autoimmune disord ers in patients with CVID can be difficult. To make the clinical diagnosis in the setting of CVID is not ideal as ne cessary serology testing may likely be altered and may not be helpful with the decrease antibody presence due to the immu nodeficiency. As with our patient, both protective and self- antibodies were affected due to decreased antibody production capability of CVID. It is important to n ote that with our patient the workup and eventual diagnosis of her au toimmune disease took many years to obtain. As immunologists, diagnosing and treating associate d autoimmune diseases in patients with CVID can be difficult and is imperative that a high clinical index of suspicion is maintained. Repeat testing may be necessary to i dentify the cause of the autoimmune symptoms. It took many years before the ultimate underlying cause of her weakness was f ully elucidated. This patient represents the first repor ted case of SPS in a patient with CVID. Though it i s extremely rare, clinicians might consider the diagnosis of SPS in a patient with CVID with musculoskeletal weakness an d atrophy when other autoimmune disorders have been ruled out. Patient Presentation and Testing The patient was a physically active 50-year old wom an with a five-year history of right-sided pelvic a nd low back pain that was accompanied by gluteal muscle atrophy. Dur ing this period she also developed recurrent sinopu lmonary infections and required antibiotic courses on a mon thly basis for more than one year. Before presentin g to the immunology clinic, she had already been completing intensive physical therapy without improvement of h er symptoms. An extensive workup was performed, which included n ormal electromyography and repeatedly absent anti-G AD65 antibodies. An extensive rheumatologic and neurolog ic laboratory workup was negative. When she present ed to the immunology office her immune evaluation demonstrate low IgG at 551 mg/dL (reference range: 694-1618 mg at 54 mg/dL (reference range: 81-463 mg/dL) wit h normal IgM at 113 mg/dL (reference range: 48-271 mg/dL). The patient had absent pneumococcal er both a pneumococcal polysaccharide and conjugate vaccinations. Diagnosis, Treatment, and Patient Outcomes With the laboratory findings, she was subsequently diagnosed with Common Variable Immunodeficiency. Th e patient was started on standard 400 mg/kg monthly dosing of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions for began to improve recurrent infections substantially. Unexpec tedly with the initiation of IVIG, her muscle weakn ess showed slight improvement; however, no complete resolution was se en. Three years after initial testing, the patient had repeat anti- GAD65 antibody testing, which was positive at 41.2 IU/mL (reference range: < 5.0 IU/mL). With the pati constellation of musculoskeletal symptoms and the p ositive anti-GAD65 testing, the patient was diagnos ed with Stiff- Person Syndrome. After this diagnosis and with her persistent musculoskeletal symptoms her IVIG dosing was increased to 1g/kg for immune modulatory effect. With this do se increase, the patient has seen an improvement in her musculoskeletal manifestations. This case IVIG desc ribes the first patient with CVID and Stiff-person Syndrome.

This process is augmented in immunoc ompromised individuals including those with primary immunodeficiencies and those on immunosuppressive t herapy. Uncontrolled lymphoproliferation can compro mise critical physiologic functions and require invasive treatment. Here we present a case of critical airw ay compromise requiring tracheotomy due to EBV-associated non-mal ignant lymphoproliferation in a Crohn' and mannose binding lectin (MBL) deficiency, with compl ete resolution following rituximab treatment, an an ti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. This case highlights that targ eting rituximab can reduce non-neoplas tic EBV- associated lymphoproliferation in individuals with reduced ability to mitigate EBV-driven lymphoid org an infiltration. Patient Presentation and Testing A 17 year-old female on 0.75mg/kg of 6-mercaptopuri ne (6MP) daily for Crohn's disease presented with f evers, malaise, and persistent tonsillitis. She had an unremarkable family, social, and surgical history. She had no a cute sick contacts. She was hospitalized for progressive respiratory di stress and required tracheotomy due to severe lymph oid hyperplasia. Immunologic and infectious evaluation included seru m cell and immunoglobulin counts, viral detection a ssays, genetic screening, and tonsillar biopsies to determine etio logy of her fevers and lymphoid hyperplasia. Biopsi es were also used to rule out neoplasm. Diagnosis, Treatment, and Patient Outcomes EBV panels detected rapidly increasing viral load ( range 3,674 - 96,401 IU/ML) with positive IgM viral capsid antibodies. Biopsies revealed EBV-positive florid immunoblastic proliferation with extensive necrosis. Pathology w as negative for malignancy, ruling out B-cell lymphoma.

Natural Killer cell function and soluble IL-2-receptor leve ls were within normal limits, making hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) unlikely. Genetic testing for primary immunodeficiencies was sent. 6MP was d iscontinued and she was started on rituximab weekly to mitigate B-c ell proliferation and reduce lymphoid organ hyperpl asia. EBV viral load was undetectable after seven weeks of treatmen t and airway narrowing markedly improved, allowing for decannulization.

He had high serum IgE, positive Aspergi llus IgE, new pulmonary infiltrates, and positive s kin testing, and was started on oral steroid therapy for allergic bronch opulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Due to history of steroid induced hyperglycemia, omalizumab therapy was trialed. This anti-IgE therapy has been used sporadically in chi ldren with CF as treatment for ABPA, and has been seen to decrease f requency of respiratory symptoms, reduce use of sys temic corticosteroids, and improve expiratory flow functi on. One year later, our patient has noticed signifi cant improvement in his respiratory symptoms, less cough, increased exe rcise tolerance, and improved sleep. His FEV1 has r eturned to baseline, and his steroid therapy has been tapered. Steroids are the mainstay of ABPA therapy. However, due to well-known side effects of long term use of systemic steroids including immune suppression, infections, hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, weight gain, o steoporosis and steroid induced diabetes, other treatments have bee n explored, including omalizumab. Omalizubmab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, with proven efficacy in severe a llergic asthma. Since ABPA has increased IgE produc tion, there have been multiple cases describing positive results usi ng omalizumab for treatment, however there have bee n no randomized, blinded, controlled multicenter trials. Our case adds further data to suggest using omaliz umab as treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis cystic fibrosis. Testing: A well-known patient to the pulmonology clinic, a 1 2-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who had a sudd en decline in his pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and failed oral an tibiotic treatment was admitted to the hospital for worsening cough and sputum production. He complained of watery eyes , sinus pain behind his eyes and over his maxillary bones. He denied fevers and shortness of breath. Mom attribut ed his worsening lung function to increased pollen in the environment. At the time, PFTs showed FEV1 78 with a baseline of high 80s, low 90s. He was started on meropenem, IV tobramycin and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole on ad mission. Due to concerns for allergic bronchopulmon ary aspergillosis, IgE was obtained and was noted to be 621 kU/L (normal <25). Chest x-ray also showed new opacities in right upper lobe, right lower lobe, and left perihi lar region. Thus additional testing was sent for as pergillus. M3 A. Fumigatus AB Quant was elevated at 10.9 KUa/L (norm al < 0.35). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Due lack of significant improvement of respiratory symptoms on antibiotic therapy, there were signific ant concerns for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Despite ch anging IV antibiotics, FEV1 remained unchanged, thu s leading to unlikely cause of bacterial exacerbation and most l ikely ABPA. He was referred to allergy/immunology c linic where he was positive for aspergillus skin testing sensitivi ty. He was started on oral steroid therapy which am eliorated his respiratory symptoms and improved his nighttime sle ep. However, due to a history of steroid induced hy perglycemia, omalizumab was suggested. His increased pulmonary e xacerbations delayed his injections for almost a ye ar. His FEV1 prior to omalizumab was 81 A year after receiving o malizumab therapy every two weeks, FEV1 is at 96. H e states improvement in is respiratory symptoms, less cough, increased exercise tolerance, and improved sleep. His steroid therapy has been tapered and his IgE level has decr eased to 200 kU/L from 1200 kU/L prior to treatment .

Sell, MD: La Jolla Veterans Affairs, San Diego; University of California, San Diego Case Title: Nivolumab-Associated Posterior Reversible Encephalo pathy Syndrome and Encephalitis Summary and Lessons Learned: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise as cancer therapeutics. Nivolumab is a human monoclona l antibody against surface protein programmed death 1 (PD-1), which blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its l igand on T cells, inhibiting apoptosis and promoting tumor-targeted T cell activation. Immune-related adverse events ass ociated with checkpoint inhibitors are well described. We report a case of posterior reversible encephalopathy synd rome (PRES) and encephalitis associated with nivolumab. A 67 year o ld man with end-stage renal disease, ulcerative col itis, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma presented with naus ea, vomiting, and word-finding difficulty two weeks after his fourth treatment with nivolumab. In the emergency departme nt, he was hypertensive and became unresponsive wit h agonal breathing. Brain MRI revealed vasogenic and cytotox ic edema involving the bilateral parieto-occipital, temporal, and superior frontal lobes suggesting both PRES and enc ephalitis secondary to nivolumab. He was started on high dose steroids. Though his neurological examination impro ved transiently, profound visuospatial defects, lef t hemiparesis, and slow cognitive processing persisted. During this ti me, his blood pressure remained elevated and diffic ult to control. Repeat brain MRI showed worsening foci of restricte d diffusion in the bilateral sensory and motor cort ices, temporal and parieto-occipital lobes, and cerebellar hemispheres . He communicated a desire to focus on comfort and passed away shortly thereafter. Increased capillary leakage due to T cell-mediated toxicity to the vascular endothelium is the propose d mechanism of nivolumab-associated encephalitis. The PRES-like fi ndings in this case were likely multifactorial due to both the autoimmune process and malignant hypertension. Howe ver, the cerebral edema was more widespread than in typical PRES, accompanied by cortical infarction, and respo nsive to steroids, suggesting severe encephalitis ue to nivolumab. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-Ligand 1 or 2 n ormally serves the immunoregulatory function of inh ibiting T cell activation and proliferation. The disruption of PD- 1/PD-Ligand binding by nivolumab enhances T cell ac tivity with anti- tumor effects. However, this increased T cell funct ion has been linked to a wide range of inflammatory adverse events. Specific risk factors for immune-related neurologic complications are unknown. In our patient, endothe lial dysfunction due to chronic renal failure along with pre-existin g ulcerative colitis could have increased his risk of developing an adverse event from nivolumab. Inviting further rese arch, pre-existing autoimmune conditions have not b een established as risk factors for immune-related adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitors. This description of nivol umab-induced encephalitis increases awareness of immune-mediated adverse reactions to checkpoint inhibitors and is important when considering the broader impact of immunotherapy. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 67 year old man with end-stage renal disease, ulc erative colitis, and metastatic renal cell carcinom a presented with nausea, vomiting, and word-finding difficulty two w eeks after his fourth treatment with nivolumab. He had previously undergone unilateral nephrectomy, bilateral adrenal ectomy, and treatment with sorafenib with progressi on of liver and lung metastases. Upon initial assessment, he was af ebrile and hypertensive, with normal oxygen saturat ion and work of breathing. Physical examination revealed mild expre ssive aphasia, but no other abnormalities. CT head was ordered to evaluate for stroke or mass lesion. While in the CT scanner, he became unresponsive with agonal breath ing. Code blue was called for respiratory failure, and he was prom ptly intubated and admitted to the intensive care u nit. Head CT scan and plain chest film showed no acute abnormalities. Brain MRI was obtained to further evaluate for neu rologic etiologies for his respiratory compromise. Brain MR I revealed vasogenic and cytotoxic edema involving the bilateral parieto-occipital, temporal, and superior frontal l obes. EEG was also ordered to evaluate for seizure- like activity, but no epileptiform waves were seen. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The MRI findings were concerning for posterior reve rsible encephalopathy syndrome given involvement of the bilateral parieto-occipital lobes, however the widespread dis tribution of cerebral edema suggested that the PRES was part of a larger, severe encephalitis secondary to nivolumab. As corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment f or autoimmune side effects of checkpoint inhibitors, the patient was started on methylprednisolone 125mg daily. He i nitially remained unresponsive with rigid extremities, however, after increasing the dose of methylprednisolone to 500 m g daily, he became awake and alert, followed commands, and resp onded to questions. However, left hemiparesis and s low cognitive processing persisted. Additionally, visua l testing demonstrated oculomotor apraxia, optic at axia, and simultagnosia consistent with Balint's syndrome in the setting of normal visual fields and acuity. Dur ing this time, his systolic blood pressure also rose to a peak of 190 mmHg and remained difficult to control on a nicardi pine drip. As his neurologic exam plateaued, repeat brain MRI was obt ained and showed worsening foci of restricted diffu sion in the bilateral sensory and motor cortices, temporal and parieto-occipital lobes, and cerebellar hemispheres suggesting cortical infarction. The patient was able to commun icate a desire to focus on comfort without further dialysis, and he transitioned to a palliative care unit where he pas sed away.

Preferred first-line therapy i nclude C1 inhibitor (C1INH) replacement or inhibiti on of bradykinin production or function. However, despite the avail ability of targeted therapy, a number of HAE patien ts may be incorrectly treated and/or do not have access to re scue medication. Patient Presentation and Testing: Case 1: A 10 year-old male with HAE presented with angioedema involving the face and airway after a mi nor bicycle injury. Mother administered prednisolone and diphen hydramine immediately because she had been instruct ed to give systemic steroids and antihistamines for rescue dur ing a previous visit to a local children's hospital emergency department (ED). Patient's angioedema progressed t o respiratory compromise, so he was emergently intu bated and received plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (pdC1INH) in o ur ED. Labs obtained after pdC1INH were significant for a low C4 level 4.5 mg/dL (normal 10-40 mg/dL) and level 17 mg/dL), consis tent with Type 1 HAE. Patient's mother and sister were also previ ously diagnosed with HAE, yet none had access to on -demand treatment. The patient was successfully extubated a nd discharged after HAE education, arrangement for C1INH prophylaxis, and follow-up with his pediatrician. O ne month later, during time of submission, he was i ntubated again at another ED and is pending transfer to our PICU. Case 2: A 17 year-old incarcerated female with HAE was brought to our ED with 2 days of head and neck angioedema and profuse drooling after fighting. Despite immed iate administration of pdC1INH, patient required in tubation due to significant airway compromise. Labs were significa nt for a low C4 level < 2 mg/dL and low C1INH prote in level < 3 mg/dL, consistent with Type 1 HAE. The patient had a long history swelling since early childhood afte r trauma and had been seen by multiple ED's and providers, yet rescu e medication was never arranged for her. She was s uccessfully extubated and is receiving C1INH prophylaxis at her institution. Arrangements have been made to test h er 2 year old son for HAE. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Conclusion: These cases highlight the importance of patient education and availability of rescue medic ine for HAE patients. Both of our patients had a known diagnos is of HAE, multiple family members with HAE, and nu merous encounters with the healthcare system but received delayed and incorrect care resulting in serious mor bidity. Further studies investigating the disparities in access and delivery of healthcare would be beneficial to all HAE patients.

Given that AIT requires injections of small quantities of alle rgens in gradually increasing doses, some individua ls may experience anxiety related to potential allergic reactions. A 12-year-old male was receiving AIT for allergic r hinoconjunctivitis induced by mold, pollen, and gra ss allergens. During the build-up phase of AIT, the patient reported sym ptoms of an allergic reaction including chest and a bdominal pain accompanied by shortness of breath that occurred af ter hospital discharge. The medical team extended t he 30-minute observation period in order to assess these reporte d symptoms, but objective findings of an allergic r eaction were not observed. The medical team suspected that the patie nt was experiencing anxiety related to AIT and it w as unclear if continuing AIT was in the best interest of the pati ent. Subsequently, during AIT the patient concurrently p articipated in 18 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT ) sessions that addressed both general and allergy-specific anxiety management. CBT began with psychoeducation about allergies, AIT, and anxiety. Intervention then included identificat ion of automatic thoughts and distortions related t o allergic reactions from AIT and cognitive restructuring. The patient e ngaged in systematic desensitization through relaxa tion training and deep breathing while utilizing planned behavioral d istractions during AIT. The therapist attended an A IT appointment with the patient to observe his symptoms and model appropriate use of the interventions. In addition, the patient and therapist developed personal goals regarding AIT an d tracked progress on a weekly calendar. CBT was co mpleted in conjunction with consultation with the allergy medi cal team in order to ensure accurate assessment of the patient's AIT experiences. Over time, the patient reported decrea sed chest and abdominal pain and denied respiratory concerns following AIT, and the patient was able to continue with the recommended course of AIT without concern and is currently receiving monthly AIT injections without the presence of the psychology team. This case highlights the relevance of CBT intervent ions in differentiating between symptoms of an alle rgic reaction versus anxiety during AIT. More broadly, this case highlights the importance of psychological services for children with anxiety related to allergic and immunologic conditi ons and interventions. Communication between medica l and mental health providers may facilitate patients' adherence to medical recommendations and increase their over all quality of life. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient was 10 years old when he first presente d to the Allergy Clinic at Children's National Medi cal Center (CNMC). He was previously diagnosed by an outside provider with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC), asthma, ec zema, food allergies (peanuts, shellfish), and eosinophilic es ophagitis (EoE). The patient was prescribed Zyrtec, Alaway eyedrops, and Flonase for ARC management, Flovent daily and a lbuterol prior to physical activity for asthma mana gement, Westcort cream for eczema management, and Prevacid for EoE management. The patient was compliant with shellfish and peanut avoidance. The patient was started on weekly allergen AIT to t reat ARC. After receiving the fourth dose of AIT (0 .2 mL of red-top vials A and B), the patient reported coughing, wate ry eyes, and difficulty breathing 30-40 minutes aft er his injection. Notably, these symptoms occurred after the patient left the hospital following his observation period and were not examined by medical personnel. As a result of these reported symptoms, the subsequent AIT dosage was d ecreased to 0.15 mL of the red top vials A and B and the patien t continued to report coughing, chest pain, runny n ose, and fatigue after he left the hospital. The patient was adminis tered Benadryl by his mother and the symptoms were not reported to the medical team until the following visit. The med ical team elected to repeat this dose and extend th e observation period to 60 minutes. At this appointment, the pati ent experienced runny nose, mild swelling at the in jection site, and itching but there were no objective signs of wheezi ng or shortness of breath. Following these reaction s, the patient's dose was reduced to 0.1 ml of the red top vials A a nd B; however, the patient began missing appointmen ts and there was continued report of adverse symptoms following AIT which limited progression of the intervention. Based on the patient's reported symptoms, lack of p hysical evidence of an allergic reaction, and resul ting missed AIT appointments, the medical team referred the patient to the Allergy Psychology team at CNMC. At that ti me, the therapist conducted a comprehensive evaluation of t he patient's developmental, social, and educational history and diagnosed with patient with Psychological Factors A ffecting a Medical Condition and Generalized Anxiet y Disorder. Based on these diagnoses, the therapist developed a treatment plan that included Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for social anxiety and AIT-specific anxiety. The medica l and psychosocial teams collaborated to develop a treatment plan for the patient's AIT progression. Specifically, the te am agreed to prolonged observation periods followin g AIT (60 minutes), weekly communication between medical personnel and the patient's therapist following AIT appointments, and presence of the therapist at one or more AIT appoin tments to observe the patient's symptoms and model appropriate anxiety-reducing interventions. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient received a diagnosis of Psychological F actors Affecting Other Medical Conditions which is defined as the presence of either psychological or behavioral fact ors that negatively impact a medical condition or i ts management. In the current case, the patient's physiological sympt oms of anxiety were misattributed to an allergic re action and were negatively impacting the treatment of his allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Additionally, assessment of ot her psychosocial functioning revealed symptoms that warranted a co- morbid diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (G AD), including (1) excessive worry about topics such as social int eractions, separation, school performance, and safe ty of family members, (2) difficulty controlling worry, and (3) physical symptoms of anxiety including impaired con centration, fatigue, and inability to carry out developmentally appropriate activities. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a short-term, g oal-oriented psychotherapy treatment that aims to c hange patients' patterns of thinking and behavior through practical problem-solving and skill building, was recommende d, as it is the treatment of choice for patients with these diagnos es. Individual sessions with the patient were held weekly, and the medical team and therapist communicated following t he patient's AIT appointments regarding symptom pre sentation. After sufficient preparation and skill-building, th e therapist attended one of the patient's AIT appoi ntments in order to facilitate the use of CBT skills developed during t herapy. During this appointment, the therapist comp leted frequent assessments of the patient's anxiety symptoms, iden tified when coping strategies could be implemented (e.g., deep breathing and relaxation when patient began to feel chest discomfort), and provided prompts for the pa tient to engage in distracting activities. The therapist also helpe d the patient identify negative thoughts and distor tions, challenge those thoughts, and identify positive replacement thought s in-vivo. This portion of the CBT intervention was particularly helpful as reported by the patient as he felt he co uld use the interventions more effectively in subse quent appointments. The patient achieved complete remission of AIT-rela ted anxiety as evidenced by the absence of patient- reported symptoms (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing), a decrease in anxiety rating scores, and an ability to continue AIT treatment as recommended by the medical team. The p atient continued CBT sessions to address GAD sympto ms and achieved remission for these symptoms as well.

Dr. Eduardo Liceaga Case Title: Efficacy of immunotherapy in ant bite allergy Summary and Lessons Learned It is reported in the literature that from 0.8% to 5.0% of the human population has developed allergic reactions in skin or systemic, after a sting by Hymenoptera, approximate ly 50 people die each year in EE. As a result of se vere anaphylaxis after a bite by these insects (bee, wasp and ants). The fire ant (Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri). Bite with their jaws while they bite. This allows them to remove the sti nger, to rotate and to prick again. A single ant c an inflict several bites on very little time. Patient Presentation and Testing A 13-year-old male patient diagnosed with anaphylax is secondary to ant stinging at a second exposure w as decided on treatment with specific immunotherapy (ITE), his la boratory studies with 7500 leukocytes 5.4% eosinoph ils and 400 cells, IgE 750 IU / ml. Diagnosis, Treatment, and Patient Outcomes Diagnostic testing was performed in vivo using pric k with ant antigen. ESPIA questionnaire is applied, the patient refers, improvement of symptoms at 3 months of ITE administ ration to exposure to new ant pickets, overall rati ng of 67 points, which translates into a good efficacy of the same. Immunotherapy is an effective treatment for allerg y to ant bite and is an excellent therapeutic option in patients who tri gger anaphylactic reactions that put their lives in risk.

All known etiologies of chronic childhood urticaria were rul ed out. The patient reported an initial UAS7 score of 42 points and a Total Serum IGE measured 125 IU/ml. After 3 months of refractory treatment to multiple Nonsedating antihi stamines at 3-4 times the usual dosing and Monteluk ast 5 mg po daily the patient was initiated on Omalizumab 150 m g SC q monthly. The patient responded after the fi rst dose reaching a UAS7 score of 0 points within 1 month of treatmen t. The patient remains antihistamine and symptom fr ee after 6 months of Omalizumab 150 mg SC q monthly and withou t reported adverse events. Omalizumab is approved f or children >12 years for refractory Chronic Urticaria ; however, there is a lack of evidence based studie s in children under 12 with poorly controlled Chronic Urticaria. This c ase demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Omalizu mab in the management of a patient with Childhood Chronic Spon taneous Urticaria and reflects the need for further studies to support our understanding and use of Omalizumab in this pediatric patient population. Patient Presentation and Testing: The patient is a 7 year old girl with a 13 month hi story of daily episodes of urticaria and dermatogra phism without angioedema. She denied any specific food and food a dditive, drug, contact, infectious, nutritional or autoimmune trigger. Past allergy history was significant for w ell controlled mild intermittent allergic asthma. S he reported a history of an adverse drug reaction to amoxicillin. Her mother is diagnosed with severe persistent allergic asthm a and is presently receiving Omalizumab 225 mg SC q 2 weeks. Total Ser um IGE measured 125 IU/ml with High Specific IGE se nsitivity to Birch Pollen, Cat and Dog Dander and Apple. Treatme nt was initiated with multiple high dose nonsedatin g antihistamines including Cetirizine 10 mg BID, Fexo fenadine 180 mg BID and subsequently Levocetirizine 10 mg BID, Loratadine 10 mg BID and Montelukast 5 mg qd withou t significant clinical response. The patient repor ted an initial UAS7 score of 42 points. After 3 months of refracto ry treatment to aforementioned antihistamines and m ontelukast 5 mg per day, the patient was initiated on Omalizumab 150 mg SC every 4 weeks. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis of chronic spontaneous urticaria was based on a 13 month history of persistent daily urt icaria without angioedema unresponsive to multiple high dose nonse dating antihistamines (3-4 times the recommended do levocetiri zine) and of childhood chronic urticaria including infectious, nutritional, autoim mune, food, food additive and drug hypersensitivity and inducible stimuli were ruled out. The patient reported an ini tial UAS7 score of 42 points. Total Serum IGE measu red 125 IU/ml. Due to symptom severity and poor response from the above treatments the patient was initiated on Omali zumab 150 mg SC q monthly and responded after the first dose reaching a UAS7 score of 0 points within 1 month of treatment. All prior nonsedating antihistamines have been disconti nued and after 6 months of Omalizumab treatment the patient remains in clinical remission without reported adve rse events.

Wo rk-up reveals eosinophil and mast cell infiltration of the upper and lower gastrointestional tract with tryptasemia. Bone marrow is normocellular with eosinophilia and without mast ce lls. Her diagnosis is indolent systemic mastocytos is. This case illustrates the differential diagnosis of periphera l eosinophilia, which includes mastocytosis. Syste mic mastocytosis may uncommonly present with normal bone marrow and mast cell infiltration of extracutaneous organ(s). Patient Presentation and Testing: A 56-year-old female with a history of diabetes mel litus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and allergi c rhinitis presents with 2-3 weeks of diffuse abdominal pain, bloating, watery diarrhea (10 episodes/day), non-bloody emes is, and intermittent dysphagia with odynophagia. She is a f ormer 30 pack-year smoker. Apart from the addition of exenatide 2 months prior, there are no changes to her medicatio ns. Physical examination is normal except for diff use abdominal fullness and tenderness to palpation without guardi ng. Liver and spleen are not palpable. Laboratory evaluation shows peripheral eosinophilia which increased from 1,320 cells/\u00b5L (0-610) on admission to 12,770 cells/\u00b5L on day 7. Upper and lower gastrointestinal biopsies >400 eosinophi ls/high-power field (HPF) and cells/HPF in the gastric tissue, duodenum, terminal ileum, and colon. The ma st cells are arranged in dense infiltrates and >25% are atypical or spindle-shaped. They express CD2 and CD25 in addit ion to CD117. Laboratory evaluation reveals no cyto penias and normal liver and kidney function with the exception of albumin 3.0 gm/dL (3.5-5.0). Tryptase and total serum (<11) serology and anti-neutrophil cytoplas mic antibodies are negative. Peripheral blood flow cytometry, IgG, IgA, and IgM are normal. Bone marrow biopsy shows a normocellular marrow without mast cells and with mildly myeloid-predominant trilineage hematopoiesis and eo sinophilia. Genetic testing for KIT et-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFRA, PDGF RB), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1 ) is negative. Serum tryptase and peripheral eosinophils remain el evated 6 weeks later, at 45 ng/mL and 1,020 cells/\u00b5 L, respectively. Albumin normalizes.

She had a positive Darier sig n. Treatment with different types of antihistamines , targeting both H1 (including ketotifen) and H2 receptors, as well as second generation H1 antihistamines used at fourf old the regular dose, had no effect. Total IgE level was 94,7 UI/m L. Skin biopsy showed accumulation of perivascular mast cells in the superficial dermis. No involvement of any other org an was evidenced. Diagnosis of adult-onset maculop apular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM) was established, base d on current criteria which include presence of typ ical skin lesions; a positive Darier's sign; and a biopy show ing increased infiltration of mast cells in the der mis. Due to unresponsivess to treatment, she was started on oma lizumab in January 2017. Omalizumab injections we re administered innitially at a dose of 150 mg every 2 weeks for the first three months of treatment, an d subsequenlty at a dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks for the following two months, to June 2017. After the first 3 monhs of th erapy with omalizumab, the patient presented marked improvemen t of her symptoms, particularly with disappearance of pruritus and considerable reduction of the color intensity o f the skin lesions. No new skin pruritic maculopapu lar lesions appeared. There was a decrease in Mastocytosis Qual ity of Life questionnaire scores 81% and 52% at ba seline and post- treatment, respectively); increase in the Urticaria Control Tests UCT scores (4 and 14, respectively; controled disease >12); decrease of Chronic Urticaria Quality of Lif e CU-QoL scores (79 and 50, respectively); and zero score for pruritus. Dermatology Life Quality Index DLQI scores were als o reduced 25 and 14 at baseline and after treatmen t, respectively. Baseline serum tryptase level was 12.3 mcg/L, and a fter 3 months of Omalizumab treatment it decreased to 10.2 mcg/L, with a 17.2% reduction. Mastocytosis is a rare disease characterized by pro liferation and accumulation of mast cells in the sk in and/or internal organs. It can be divided into cutaneous and system ic. The aim of treatment is to control the signs an d symptoms caused by the release of mast cell mediators. It is import ant to avoid factors that trigger degranulation of mast cells, including heat, cold, pressure, stress, anxiety, infections, and drugs. Omalizumab has been shown to control objective and subjective symptoms of mastocytosis. Although Omali zumab use is not approved for use in cutaneous mastocytosis, being licensed only for chronic spontaneous urticar ia and difficult to control asthma, this therapy has proven to be a goo d option for patients with this rare cutaneous dise ase. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient presenting with maculopapular, brownish, fi xed and intensely pruritic skin lesions which were worse in times of stress, since she was 19 years-old. She demonstrat ed major concern of her appearance, affecting her social life, due to the presence of the skin lesions, and complained of intense pruritus which had a profound impact on he r sleep, work and daily activities. She has never complained of a bdominal pain, diarrhea, hypotension, syncope, musc uloskeletal pain, or any allergic reactions including anaphylaxis or reactions to hymenoptera stings. She presented a po sitive Darier sign. No liver, spleen or lymphonode enlargement was foun d on physical examination. Skin biopsy showed massi ve infiltration of mast cells in the dermis. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Diagnosis of adult-onset maculopapular cutaneous ma stocytosis (MPCM) was established by current crrite ria. Patient was unresponsive to different types of antihistamin es, targeting both H1 and H2 receptors, including s econd generation H1 antihistamines at fourfold the regular dose. Af ter the third application of Omalizumab the patient noticed a considerable reduction in the intensity of the lesi ons and complete disappearance of the pruritus. Obj ective measures including UCT, CU-QoL and DLQI indicated improvemen t, and tryptase levels were reduced by 17.2% after 3 months of treatment. The patient's subjective judgement was o f a marked improvement of her symptoms, and therefo re therapy with omalizumab was maintaned. Omalizumab has prove n to be a good option for patients with this rare c utaneous disease.

Summary and Lessons Learned: Introduction- Motor involunta ry, coordinated, often bilateral purposeless movements which can be usually halted by distraction. Such types of behavi oural disorders are often described with autism, tics and obsessive compulsive disorders, though they may be seen in i solation. MS can be associated with relative or absolute increase in stimulatory chemicals like dopamine or reduction i n inhibitory mediators like -Aminobutyric acid and Acetylcholin e. Pharmacological and behavioural therapies are mo stly ineffective in controlling MS, highlighting the possibility of additional pathogenetic pathways. Case- A 10 year girl presented with abnormal body m ovements since the age of 18 months, which began as to-and-fro body rocking while crawling and sitting, gradually progressed during brushing, standing and watching t elevision over next year. She started having repetitive rhythmic h ead banging, at age 3, while subjected to stress or just prior to sleep. These movements were controlled with distraction or parental interruption. She was prescribed with Ris peridone along with behaviour therapy, for years, with some contro l over body-rocking but head banging was still prob lematic. Neuroimaging, sleep and electroencephalographic stu dies were normal. She was referred to allergy clini c with complaints of seasonal cough and nasal block since early childhood requiring frequent over-the-counter anti-allergic medications. Head banging duration and intensity us ed to become worse during these episodes. Physical examination revealed bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy a nd wheeze in chest. Spirometry showed reversible ob structive pattern. Her total and specific IgE levels were sig nificantly high (1435 IU/mL and 53.7 kUA/L respecti for (Eragrostis, Pennisetum, Brassica and Holoptela). daily) along with salbutamol inhale r (200 microgram) as-and-when required. She was als o advised for allergen avoidance measures. Her respiratory sympto ms resolved in 2 weeks along with significant impro vement in head banging resulted in weaning of psychotropic medicat ions by the end of 4 weeks. During 1 year follow up , her allergic and stereotypic symptoms were adequately controlled on anti-allergic medications only. Conclusion- There are evidences of mast cell-microg lia-neuron interaction in the pathogenesis of ASD a nd autoimmune diseases but the role of mast cells in MS has never been previously reported. In our child, an isolate d MS responding to anti-allergic medications is discussed, suggesting the possibility of mast cell induced pathogenesis a s a common link, warranting prospective studies for establishment of casual relationship.

Submission Number: 175 Poster Number: 148 Keyword: Mast Cell Disorders Primary Author Name: Haroon Khalid, MD Primary Author Institution: Kansas University Medical Center Additional Authors: Sadia Hayat Khan, MD FAAAAI Case Title: A Challenging Mast Cell Activation Disorder Summary and Lessons Learned: Classifying mast cell disorders is important in pat ient management. We describe a patient with anaphy laxis unprovoked anaphylaxis, and elevated b aseline tryptase who did not meet the WHO cri teria for Systemic Mastocytosis (SM). Our patient had anaphylaxis after paper wasp sting and also episodes of anaphylaxis with no clear inci ting events. His baseline serum tryptase was elevated and his bone m arrow biopsy revealed 1% mast cells without any abe rrant expression of CD2 or CD25. C-kit process. tomogr aphy of his neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis was normal. Upper GI endo scopy and colonoscopy with random biopsies showed n o evidence of mast cell involvement. He met 2 out of the 4 WHO minor criteria for SM (c- kit positivity and elevated serum tryptase). He do es not meet WHO criteria for SM but rather falls into the category of monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (MMAS). Our case highlights the fact that the WHO criteria need to be met to accurately diagnose SM. MMAS sho uld be considered in patients presenting with unprovoked a naphylaxis, elevated baseline tryptase levels, but not meeting criteria for SM. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 36 year old man presents for further evaluation a fter receiving a diagnosis of stinging insect venom hypersensitivity. Initially diagnosed after paper wasp sting induced anaphylaxis at age 4, he subsequently tested positi ve on venom skin testing, but only received venom immunotherapy (VIT ) for three years. However, he then went on to hav e unprovoked anaphylaxis at ages 16 and 29. After elevated serum tryptase levels (22.1 and 24.1 ng/ml) on 2 separate clinic visits, a bone-marrow biopsy revealed 1% mast cells, positive for D816V mutation of the c-KI T gene, without aberrant CD2 or CD25 expression. N o extracutaneous mast cell disease was noted on either CT of the nec k/chest/abdomen and pelvis or gastrointestinal endo scopy-guided biopsy. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Our patient did not meet the WHO criteria for SM an d was diagnosed with MMAS. A rare clonal mast cel l activation disorder, MMAS is diagnosed if only minor clonality criteria for SM are present without meeting full c riteria. Hymenoptera stings are common triggers. Lifelong V IT is recommended if venom hypersensitivity is dete cted. The patient described had repeat venom skin testing and was positive to yellow jacket, wasp and white faced hornet. However, he declined lifelong VIT despite strong co unseling. At last follow-up, he had not had any fu rther episodes of anaphylaxis. Submission Number: 293 Name: Sonia Mathew Primary Author Institution: Mercer University School of Medicine Additional Authors : Merin Kuruvuilla, MD Case Title: Mastocytic Enterocolitis: The Case of An Itchy Gut Summary and Lessons Learned The patient had a longstanding history of constipat ion alternating with diarrhea, suggesting a diagnos is of IBS. However, symptoms became progressively worse with intermitte nt abdominal pain and diarrhea occurring up to eigh t times per day. History and diet changes did not reveal an ide ntifiable cause. Finally, colonoscopy with immunost ain for mast cell tryptase (MCT) revealed increased mast cell infiltr ation, suggesting a diagnosis of mastocytic enteroc olitis. The patient was started on loratadine 10 mg and famotidine 20 m g, both BID. Due to marginal effect on symptoms, a trial of oral budesonide 9 mg daily was instituted. At one month follow up, the patient reported a marked decrease i n symptom frequency and severity. To our knowledge, this is t he first case of ME successfully managed with oral budesonide. The most common diagnoses in patients with chronic diar rhea are irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bow el disease, malabsorption syndrome, infection, and idiopathic s ecretory diarrhea. However, in some patients, labor atory workup for these diagnoses is negative, histologic appearances on routine staining are unremarkable, and treatmen t is ineffective. In a subset of patients with chronic diarrhea, incr eased mast cells in the gut mucosa is revealed by i mmunohistochemical analysis for MCT and has been observed to be the pr imary morphologic abnormality. This condition is de scribed as mastocytic enterocolitis, and most patients with th is condition respond to mast cell stabilizers and h istamine H1 and H2 receptor antagonists. Incorporation of endoscopy, c olonic or duodenal mucosal sampling, and MCT immuno staining as part of investigation in chronic intractable diarrh ea can help to identify mastocytosis earlier, allow ing for earlier administration of appropriate treatment and allevia tion of symptoms. Therapies for mastocyctic such as ranitidine and famotidine. Cromolyn has been shown to provide improvement in g astrointestinal symptoms while antileukotrienes have shown improvem ent in pruritis and flushing. If these therapies fa il, budesonide can serve as an alternative treatment. This case re port provides support for considering budesonide in patients with mastocytic enterocolitis who have shown no improvem ent with antihistamines, cromolyn, and antileukotri enes. Patient Presentation and Testing The patient is a 39 year old male with a PMH of ent erocolitis, GERD, epilepsy, Asperger syndrome, MDD, and OSA who presented on August 23, 2017, for evaluation of a r ecent diagnosis of mastocytic enterocolitis. The pa tient has had a longstanding history of constipation alternating wi th diarrhea, suggestive for IBS. Five months prior to presentation, these symptoms had become progressively worse, with intermittent sharp abdominal pain, bloating, and d iarrhea occurring up to eight times per day. There were no identifiable food triggers to suggest food allergy. Reduced gluten diet had no effect on symptoms, which would have otherwi se suggested Celiac disease. Four months prior to p resentation, CT with contrast showed fatty pancreas and mildly d ilated small bowel concerning for enteritis. One mo nth prior to presentation, colonoscopy with mast cell tryptase i mmunostain showed increased mast cell infiltration (20.2 per high power field). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with mastocytic enterocolitis. There was no definite increase in chronic lial lymphocytes, neutrophilic infiltrates, granulo mas, changes, or parasites. Baseline tryptase and serum IgE levels w ere normal, which pointed away from systemic mastocytosis and food al lergy. Evaluation for the c-kit mutation was not pu rsued since history was unremarkable for systemic mastocytosis. Of note, the patient has history of chronic season al allergic rhinitis with marked exacerbation during spring and fall. Hi s symptoms are managed with intranasal spray and or al antihistamines. He has no other history of cutaneou s symptoms, recurrent anaphylaxis, or symptoms sugg estive of mast cell activation disorder. He has allergies to penic illin and sulfa drugs. Social and family histories are noncontributory. Diagnosis, Treatment, and Patient Outcomes There were no identifiable food triggers to suggest food allergy. Reduced gluten diet had no effect on symptoms, which would have otherwise suggested Celiac disease. CT w ith contrast showed fatty pancreas and mildly dilat ed small bowel concerning for enteritis. Colonscopy with mast cell tryptase immunostain showed increased mast cell in filtration (20.2 per high power field), which led to diagnosis of ma stocytic enterocolitis. Baseline tryptase and serum IgE levels were normal, which pointed away from systemic mastocytos is and food allergy. Evaluation for the c-kit mutat ion was not pursued since history was unremarkable for systemic mastocytosis. The patient was then started on lora tadine BID and famotidine BID, which has been shown to reduce symp toms in mastocytic enterocolitis. However, they had had minimal effect in this patient. The patient was then starte d on budesonide 3 mg, TID. The patient stated that he continued to have abdominal pain and diarrhea, but symptoms had decreased in frequency and severity.

Presently, tiotropium bromide monohydrate is a long acting ant icholinergic with specificity for muscarinic recept ors indicated for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated wi th COPD and asthma. It is an aqueous solution avail able in an inhalation device and can effectively be sprayed in to the nose to be used off label for gustatory rhin itis. Patient Presentation and Testing: We present a case of 91-year-old male with history of gustatory rhinitis for the past 7 years. Within 15 minutes of ingestion of any kind of food whether it was hot, c old, spicy or bland, he developed symptoms of clear watery rhinorrhea and sneezing, which would persist for 15 minutes or more. He was seen by an allergist in th e past and had tried nasal and oral antihistamines, nasal steroids , nasal spray, ipratropium bromide helped him to an extent but did not completely resolve his symptoms. His symptoms were negatively impacting his social life and he could n o longer go on dates to dinner. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Because his symptoms were consistent with gustatory rhinitis and ipratropium provided some relief, tho ugh minimal, we decided to try a long acting anti-cholinergic dr ug. We prescribed Tiotropium Respimat to use 1 spra y in each nostril once a day. It was an off label indication for gust atory rhinitis and risks and benefits were discusse d with the patient and his son in detail. He was seen for follow up in 2 m onths and his rhinorrhea had improved significantly since starting the tiotropium. He was able to do his routine activitie s and enjoy his social life without any restriction . He resumed having dinner dates. Submission Number: 106 Poster Number: 151 Keyword: Rhinitis Authors: A.

Summary and Lessons Learned: A 51 year-old male with personal history of rhiniti s and nasal polyposis was sent three years ago to o ur allergy unit. He referred runny nose, nasal congestion, hyposmia and trouble sleeping. All his symptoms got worst after taking ibuprofen. No wheezing or bronchospasm was recogniz ed. After a complete anamnesis NSAID challenges wer e performed with positive results for ASA(Anaphylaxis ) and negative for etoricoxib. He was diagnosed of aspirin- exacerbated respiratory disease-AERD He was follow-up by the otolaryngology unit where h e was diagnosed with bilateral grade 3 Nasal Polyps . Treatment with Nasal washes with salty water, intranasal cort icosteroid and montelukast was initiated with bad r esponse. Course of oral prednisolone was added with a temporary imp rovement. Because of the poor response surgery for nasal polyposis was done with improvement of symptoms. On e year later nasal congestion reappears with grade 2-3 of nasal polyps. Nasal smear: 400 eosinophils. After of corticosteroids treatment with omalizumab , 300mg/4 weeks, was initiated. At first it was effective wit h clinical improvement (decrease in polyp size and subjective progress in nasal breathing), but after a year of treatment pol yps grew to grade 4 and a new course of corticoids was needed. Omalizumab was discontinued without worsening. Few months later ASA desensitization was done. Basa : 10mg--15mg- -25mg--50 mg--100 mg--125mg, total accumulated 325m g. After the 1stdose he present rhinitis and peak f low decrease to 410; was raniti dine and 40mg methylprednisolone. Following doses w ere given without new symptoms till the 5th. After it, he pre sented nauseas vomiting and sweating that was treat ed with 0.3cc adrenaline and 4mg ondansetron, with good response and tolerating the last dose. Day 2 passes off in normal conditions: 100mg--200mg -325mg--650mg. Premedication:60mg methylprednisolon e. A dose of 650mg of ASA every 12hs was given during the first month with improvement of rhinitis, hypos mia, snore and breath. Nasal endoscopy demonstrate a reduction on the polyps to grade 2. ASA dose was reduced to 350m g/12hs with a deterioration of the rhinitis, the 650mg dose was restore. In conclusion, ASA desensitization protocols may be safely performed and can be useful to treat polypo sis even in those cases that biological treatment was ineffective. Ea ch case must be considered individually. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 51 year-old male with personal history of rhiniti s and nasal polyposis, without other medical histor y, was sent three years ago to our allergy unit. He did not have any relevant allergy family history. In that time he refereed runny nose, nasal congesti on, hyposmia and trouble sleeping. No wheezing or b ronchospasm were recognized by the patient At least every two w eeks he had an episode of severe nasal congestion, during that days he needed to sleep propped up or sitting up. All his symptoms got worse every time he consumed a n ibuprofen. After a complete anamnesis our team associated the worsening with the intake of ibuprofen. Until that moment he didn't realized that the drug was de cause of his s evere nasal congestion. Because of this we decided to do drug challenge tests in our outpatient care area. NSAID challenges were performed. The ASA challenge test was positive: ten minutes after the second do se (25mg\u2014 50mg, accumulated 75mg),the patient presented nasal congestion, received tr eatment with dexclorfeniramine, methylprednisolone and adrenalin e. The challenge test with etoricoxib was well tolerat ed. Finally he was diagnosed of chronic rhinosinusitis and NSAIDs intolerance --->aspirin-exacerbated resp iratory disease, AERD Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: After the diagnosis of AERD he was follow-up by the otolaryngology unit where they saw bilateral grade 3 Nasal Polyps. Treatment with Nasal washes with salty water, intra nasal corticosteroid and montelukast was initiated with bad response. Course of oral prednisolone was added wit h a temporary improvement. Because of the poor response surgery for nasal poly posis was done with improvement of symptoms, but on e year later nasal congestion reappeared with grade 2-3 of nasal polyps. A nasal smear showed 400 eosinophils and e ndoscopy grade 3-4 polyps. He was then sent to the allergy unit where after a few courses of corticosteroids, off-lavel treatment with omalizumab was established. The dose, was 300mg every four wee ks. At first it was effective with clinical improve ment and subjective progress in nasal breathing. Nasal endos copy examination showed a decrease in polyp size, w ith bilateral grade 2 polyps. After a year of treatment polyps grew to grade 4 an d a new course of corticoids was needed. Omalizumab was discontinued without worsening. A few months later, and after studying the case in our Severe Asthma Unit with pulmonologist and otola ryngologist, ASA desensitization was done. Before starting with de desensitization protocol we measure basal peak d spray as pretreatment. We follow the next protoco l in two days. - Day 1: 1stdose 10mg, 2nd 15mg, 3rd 25mg, 4th 50 m g, 5th 100 mg, 6th 125mg, total accumulated 325mg. After the 1stdose he present rhinitis and peak flow decrease to 410; and 40mg methylprednisolone. Following d oses were given without new symptoms till the 5th. After it, he presented nauseas vomiting and sweating that was tr eated with 0.3cc adrenaline and 4mg ondansetron, wi th good response and tolerating the last dose. - Day 2 passes off in normal conditions with the fo llowing doses: 1st 100mg, 2nd 200mg, 3rd 325mg, 4th 650 mg Before the first dose was given he received 60mg me thylprednisolone because during the night he got a severe hives. A dose of 650mg of ASA every 12hs was given during the first month with improvement of rhinitis, hypos mia, snore and breath. Nasal endoscopy demonstrated a reduction on the polyps to grade 2. ASA dose was reduced to 350mg/12hs with a deteriora tion of the rhinitis, the 650mg dose was restored. In conclusion, ASA desensitization protocols may be safely performed and can be useful to treat polypo sis even in those cases that biological treatment was ineffective. Ea ch case must be considered individually. Submission Number: 111 Poster Number: 152 Keyword: Rhinitis Primary Author Name: Sean Hess D.O. Author Institution: Larkin Community Hospital Additional Authors: Shahnaz Fatteh M.D. Nova Southeastern University Case Title: The benefit of Mepolizumab in the treatment of alle rgic rhinitis in patients with eosinophilia is a humanized interlukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody. It is currently approved for a sthma as it affects the pathway responsible for maturation and release of eosinophils in the bone marrow. Eosinoph ils are associated with airway allergic disease. The reduct ion of the amount of eosinophils in the blood has b een shown to be effective in decreasing pulmonary inflammation. Eos inophils have also been shown to be a key effector cell in nasal inflammation that is seen in allergic rhinitis. Whi le not currently approved for allergic rhinitis, du e to the pathway involved and the subsequent decrease in eosinophils , Mepolizumab could be further investigated as a po ssible treatment for allergic rhinitis and other diseases in which eosinophilia is present. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 63 year old female presented with a chief complai nt of chronic cough secondary to moderate persisten t asthma for years. The cough was constant throughout the day an d responded poorly to medication. The patient also complained of allergic rhinitis symptoms most notably runny nose and nasal congestion. The patient was evaluated usi ng the total nasal symptom score. She had severe rhinorrhea, sev ere nasal congestion and severe nasal itching. She stated that the symptoms interfered with her sleep. She denied snee zing. The patient had used nasal corticosteroid inh alers in the past with small improvements in symptoms. Chest CT was n egative for significant findings, however laborator y testing repeatedly showed eosinophilia. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Due to the patient's persistent cough and asthma sy mptoms, Mepolizumab was initiated. The patient's co ugh symptoms decreased dramatically. After repeated injections, it was noted that the patient's allergic rhinitis s ymptoms began to improve also. The patient was evaluated by a total nasal symptom score and had scores of 0 for nasal c ongestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and sneezing. The patien t's nasal symptoms did not interfere with sleep aft er the Mepolizumab was initiated. The patient's eosinophil level decreased from a level of 2261 prior to Mepo lizumab to an eosinophil level of 138 after treatment.

Eidelman, MD, Department of Allergy and Immunology, Cleveland Clinic Florida Case Title: The one that did not go away: adenoid hypertrophy a s a rare cause of upper airway impairment in adults Summary and Lessons Learned: Adenoid hypertrophy is a rare, or underreported, ca use of nasal congestion in adults. In severe cases, symptoms could progress to cause upper airway impairment and mouth breathing. Unlike palatine tonsils, adenoid cannot be visualized directly due to its anatomical location, therefore, imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) a re often indicated. It is important to recognize adenoid hyp ertrophy as a rare cause of upper airway impairment and mouth breathing in adults, and consider appropriate inves tigation and therapy when indicated. Adenoid hypert rophy persistence should be considered in the differentia l diagnosis of therapy-resistant chronic rhinitis i n adults. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 50-year-old male presented was referred to allerg y clinic after an initial evaluation at otolaryngo logy department for bilateral tinnitus, chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. Symptoms have been present for longer tha n 5 years. The patient reported chronic hoarseness and a history of smokin g 40 years for pack a day. Allergic rhinitis sympto ms were not responsive intranasal steroid and antihistamine spr ays used twice daily. CT of the neck and sinuses sh owed prominence of nasopharyngeal adenoidal tissue measuring 3.5 x 2.7 cm in cross-section, left maxillary sinus polyp versus mucus retention cyst, and mild paranasal prominent adenoidal tissue of the posterior nasopha rynx was considered to be secondary to infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic process. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Patient did not obtain adequate symptom improvemen t with medical therapy. Due to the large nasopharyn geal mass blocking the nasopharynx, surgical correction was p lanned and implemented. The patient reported improv ement after adenoidectomy. The biopsy of the mucosa with benign prominent lymphoid infiltr ates, no malignancy was seen. The patient was attempting smo king cessation during the most recent follow-up vis it.

Broff, MD Primary Author Institution: Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School Additional Authors: John Lazor, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Case Title: An Unusual Cause of Sinusitis Summary and Lessons Learned: Chronic nasal congestion and chronic sinus symptoms may be the result of a more serious underlying con dition. If symptoms do not respond to standard empirical thera py in a timely fashion, further investigation with an imaging study should not be delayed. Tumors of the nasopharynx a re not rare and must be diagnosed promptly to allow the patient maximal opportunity for the best possible outcome. Patient Presentation and Testing: 33 year old, previously healthy female, presents wi th a four month history of nasal congestion, sinus pressure, and anosmia of an unrelenting nature. She denied rhinor rhea, sneezing, sniffing, nasal pruritis or ocular itch or tearing. She had been treated empirically with three different c ourses of antibiotic, consecutively, for presumed s inusitis with no imaging study. She got no relief with cetirizine or fluticasone nasal spray. She did get brief relief with oxymetazoline nasal spray. She presented for allergy evaluation a s she was not improving on the current treatment pr ovided her. Past medical history was noted for childhood asthma until age thirteen. She was otherwise in excellent health and on no medications. Family history is noted for asthma and allergic rhinitis in her mother. Her son has asthm a, atopic dermatitis, and egg allergy. Examination of her nose revealed extremely edematou s nasal membranes, almost completely obstructed, an d bilateral nasal polyps. No cervical or submandibular lymphade nopathy. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Prick and intradermal inhalant skin testing were al l negative, with appropriate controls. A sinus CT s howed complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus, bilater al frontal sinuses and bilateral ethmoid air cells. There was complete opacification of the nasal passages with bowing of both lamina papyracea laterally into the orbits. Th e CT study was very suggestive of a malignancy, so an urgent ENT consul tation was arranged. The ENT surgeon removed a few nasal polyps revealing tumor tissue. A biopsy obtained for froze n section returned with the diagnosis of Esthesione uroblastoma, a rare tumor of neuroectodermal origin arising in the olfactory lobe of the brain. The tumor was extensi ve on subsequent MRI, threatening both optic nerves, but was conside red surgically resectable. She was referred to Mass Eye & Ear Infirmary for surgery and post operative cancer car e.

Leiding, M.D. Richard F. Lockey, M.D. University of South Florida Morsani College of Medi cine Department of Pediatrics Division of Allergy a nd Immunology Case Title: Identifying the Root of the Case of Recu rrent Sinusitis due to Oroantral Communication Summary and Lessons Learned: This is a case of recurrent sinusitis due to an oro antral communication (OAC). OACs can occur secondar y to a root canal and result in recurrent sinusitis. The diagnosis of an OAC is based on clinical symptoms even though a panoramic dental radiograph or computer tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses can help diagnose it. An OAC should be susp ected in subjects with recurrent sinusitis following a denta l procedure or a sinus culture yielding oral flora. Identification of an anatomical cause for recurrent sinusitis will preve nt an unnecessary and costly immunodeficiency evalu ation. Patient Presentation and Testing: A 53 year old female presents to allergy/immunology clinic for evaluation of recurrent sinus infection s and suspected immunodeficiency. She has experienced up to four si nus infections per year during the past six years, signs and symptoms of which include: purulent nasal discharge , post nasal drip, right facial swelling, cough, fe vers and night sweats, and cervical lymphadenopathy. She required multiple courses of antibiotics and states that her susceptibility to sinus infections became more frequent after undergo ing root canals of her second and third right maxil lary molars approximately six years ago. Her sinus infections a lso seem to be more likely to occur one to three we eks after dental cleanings. She denies any other history or family h istory of immunodeficiency or recurrent infections. Physical exam revealed normal vital signs and tenderness over the right maxillary sinus, ipsilateral anterior cervic al lymphadenopathy, and purulent drainage in the posterior oropharynx. Medical records document cervical lymphadenitis two years prior complicated by a right carotid artery dissection. C ultures from her sinuses and fine needle aspiration of a cervical lymph node yielded Propionibacterium acne, an anaerobic b acterium common to the oral cavity. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: An OAC between the oral cavity and maxillary sinus was suspected. A complete blood count with differen tial, quantitative immunoglobulins, pneumococcal and teta nus/diphtheria antibody titers, and lymphocyte subs ets and proliferation studies were normal. A maxillary sinu s CT was normal aside from changes suggestive of ch ronic sinusitis. However, her dentist indicated that she experienced a sensation of fluid entering her maxillary sinus while drinking liquids and of air entering her maxillary sinus dur ing a valsalva, consistent with an OAC. Extraction of her crowns and her right second and third molars elicited pus from the operative site, consistent with an OAC. Her sympto ms resolved after extraction surgery and a six month course of oral c lindamycin. She has been symptom free for the past eighteen months.

We present a patient with i ndolent marginal zone lymphoma who developed multiple episodes of an gioedema without urticaria. This case highlights th e importance of diagnosing acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. Onc e the diagnosis is made the patient must receive br adykinin targeting therapy for episodes of angioedema as well as treat ment of the underlying condition. All allergy/immun ology providers should maintain a high level of suspicion for acqui red C1 inhibitor deficiency in patients with recurr ent angioedema and underlying malignancy, particularly non-Hodgkins ly mphoma. Patient Presentation and Testing: 68-year-old female presented with lip and cheek swe lling without urticaria or pruritus. In the last on e year, she described multiple similar episodes of intermittent lip, tongue and face swelling. Ten months prior sh e reported severe tongue swelling that required intubation. NSAIDs we re suspected to be the cause and were discontinued, but frequent episodes of angioedema continued. Each episode last s for several days and no other triggers can be ide ntified. Antihistamine therapy did not improve the angioedem a. Past medical history includes invasive ductal carci noma of the of breast in remission, hypothyroidism, arthritis with possible lupus, and marginal zone lymphoma diagnose d one year prior. No treatment had been administere d for indolent lymphoma. There is no family history of an gioedema. She has never taken ACE-inhibitors. Laboratory testing showed a decreased C1 esterase i nhibitor level of 4 (reference range 19-37 mg/dL), C1 esterase functional level decreased at 18% (reference range >41%), C1Q decreased at undetectable C2 and normal C3. ANA positive at 1:160 with homogenous pattern. Double stranded DNA antibody negative. Similar results were obtaine d from an outside hospital 10 months prior. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis is acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency b ased decreased levels of C4, C1 inhibitor l evel and function. The presentation was treated wi th icatibant (bradykinin receptor antagonist) with rapid improvement of angioedema. Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is often caused by an underlying condition, most commonly B cell mali gnancy and autoimmune disorders. Treatment should include ther apy directed at the predisposing condition as well as bradykinin targeting therapies for acute episodes of swelling. The predisposing condition in this case is indolen t marginal zone lymphoma. Thus, rituximab was initiated biweekly. A fter 6 weeks of therapy with rituximab the patient had a marked decrease in acute attacks of angioedema.

Symptoms usually develop in th e first few months of life and often begin after weaning from breast m ilk to cow's milk. The triad of alopecia, diarrhea, and dermatitis is classically described as an indication of zinc defi ciency. The rash can be eczematous and may be misdi agnosed as atopic dermatitis. Here we present an infant initially dia gnosed with refractory eczema that was later determ ined to have severe zinc deficiency associated with acrodermatit is enteropathica, highlighting the need to maintain this on the list of differential diagnoses for eczema. Patient Presentation and Testing: This patient presented to the Allergy and Immunolog y clinic as a 19 month old male born at 39 weeks vi a spontaneous vaginal delivery to a gravida 2 para 1 healthy moth er who was found to have severe eczematous dermatit is, hair loss, and diarrhea that started around 1.5 months of age and rapidly progressed. In addition, he had recurre nt viral induced upper respiratory tract infections, wheezing, and c hronic rhinitis. The patient's newborn screen was n egative for cystic fibrosis, metabolic or endocrinologic abnormalities ; and a sweat chloride was negative. A celiac panel was negative, thyroid studies were within normal limits, pancreat ic enzyme levels were low, and immunoglobulins were within normal limits for age. He remained breast fed and his grow th is maintained around the 35th percentile. He has incidentally also been diagnosed with a milk protein sensitivity, but IgE to cow's milk is negative. The only pertinent family history was colitis in the patient's father. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: He was initially treated for eczema but failed trea tment with topical corticosteroids and emollients. He was referred to dermatology, who made the diagnosis of acrodermatit is enteropathica. He had a serum zinc level of < 2 5 mcg/dL (reference 75-150 mcg/dL). Although genetic testing was recommended (SLC39A4), his family was unable t o afford the expense. However, he was started on zinc supplement ation presumptively at 3 mg/kg/day by mouth daily, had complete resolution of his symptoms, and normalization of hi s serum zinc levels. This case highlights the need to consider acroderma titis enteropathica in a patient with refractory de rmatitis to avoid misdiagnosis. We must also consider the financial b arriers when considering confirmatory testing for c ongenital zinc deficiency and explore treatment options of presump tive zinc supplementation, when testing is not feas ible.

Here we present a previously non-atopic adult male carpe nter with new onset dermatitis. Initial symptoms consisted of a mild rash and concurrent eye irritation, progressin g over 2-3 months to increased eye irritation, associated periorbital ed ema, and significant dermatitis on exposed areas of skin. Distribution suggested an airborne contact dermatitis. Symptoms consistently and completely resolved with avoidanc e of his wood fabrication shop. Skin patch testing revealed posi tive reactions to several woods, formaldehyde, and fabrication gloss. The patient was instructed to avoid allergens and, when unavoidable, increase skin protection measures . He was offered treatment with topical tacrolimus and triam cinolone for symptomatic control. Providers should be aware of occupational contact d ermatitis from wood dusts. Diagnosis can be challe nging given the multiple potential agents and lack of guidance rega rding wood-based testing. Treatment is challenging when avoidance is not sustainable, particularly with regard to imp act on quality of life and livelihood. Patient Presentation and Testing: 24 yo previously non-atopic adult male carpenter wi th new onset dermatitis. Typical protective equipm ent covered most of his body with the exception of neck, face, and arms from the elbows distally. Eye protection was perforated. Initial symptoms were eye itching and mild redness on the hands that worsened with scratching/itching. Topical emollients and triamcinolone were ineffective. Ove r 2-3 months, symptoms progressed to include worsen ing eye itch, periorbital edema at the margin of his protective g lasses, and increasingly severe rash from the finge rs to the antecubital fossa. Additional pharmacologic treatment with cet irizine, ranitidine was ineffective. Avoidance was associated with complete resolution of symptoms. Skin patch testing to include North American Standard, Plastic and Gl ues, as well as assorted woods and glues from patient's wood fabric ation shop was performed and diagnostic for contact dermatitis. To avoid contaminants, thinly planed wood samples w ere prepared for patch testing rather than collecte d wood dust. Patch testing revealed strong positive reactions to mahogany, fishtail, formaldehyde and weakly positi ve reactions to cherry, walnut, paduk, maple and fabrication gloss. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The patient was diagnosed with occupational allergi c contact dermatitis, supported by the distribution of affected skin, consistent resolution of symptoms with avoidance of the wood fabrication shop, and positive patch test ing. The patient was counseled regarding avoidance and skin protecti on measures to optimize safety and to comfortably c ontinue in his profession.

Oral Crohn's can present b efore or after the onset of GI disease and it appea rs to affect a different patient population and manifests particul ar trophicity for squamous cell epithelium. In the angioedema is frequently consulted to A&I sub-speci alists therefore awareness of rare diseases for dif ferential diagnosis is important. CASE REPORT: We present a 74-year-old lady with Oral Crohn's syn drome who presented with chronic indurated swelling of her lower lip, painful, angular cheilitis, deep linear ulcera tions of the tongue, and no evidence of facial pals y or digestive symptoms. She developed esophageal strictures and h ad a history of perforation 9 years before she pres ented to our clinic that required surgical repair. She also had a history of abdominal and perianal abscesses that required I&D 6 years ago. Never diagnosed with Crohn's. She had a histor y of DM -II, hypothyroidism, GERD, hypercholesetero lemia, allergic rhino-sinusitis, Vit D deficiency and hypertension. She did not have a family history of HAE and had n o one else in the family with a similar problem. She was never placed on ACEI. At the time of presentation review of sym ptoms revealed unintentional weigh loss and low grade fevers noted by the patient as well as random abdominal pains. Her exam revealed tense lower lip edema, with painless and n on-pruriginous swelling that was 2-3 times normal l ip size, poor dentition, deep longitudinal fissures of the tongue and angular cheilitis. Her labs at the time of her initial visit was significant for elevated ESR (84, reference range - 15mm/hr) , low hemoglobimn and hematocrit values (1 0.1 levels (39ug/dl), low TIBC (257 mc g/dl). She had an up assessed her quan titative C1 esterase inhibitor values and function as well as her C1q le vels. A derm consult was also requested for lower l ip biopsy with the concern of cheilitis granulomatosa. Her C1 esterase inhibitor levels were elevated (41mg/dl) her C 1 esterase inhibitor functional study was 102% of mean normal. Her C1q levels were within normal range (21mg/dl). Patient was seen at Duke Dermatology clinic and changed her min d not to have biopsy and upon follow up p-ANCA (Ant i- Myeloperoxidase Antibody) , IgG and IgA ASCA testin g was requested and her p-ANCA levels came back as within normal (6 units) and both her IgA and IgG ASCA was elevate d (29 and 38 U respectively). Patient was lost to f ollow up after her second visit. DISCUSSION: Oral Crohn's disease is characterized by a very low prevalence (0% to 9%), male predominance, protract ed course with high prevalence of associated anal and esophageal i nvolvement (suggesting a trophicity for squamous ce ll epithelium). Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is the main dif ferential diagnosis as both entities have associate d edema, induration, angular cheilitis, chronic protracted e volution, and granulomatous histologic features. Fa cial palsy and absence digestive symptoms are suggestive of MRS . A&I sub-specialist are frequently consulted for b oth cases of indurated edema, mistaken to be angioedema, hence k nowledge of these rare diseases are essential. Patient Presentation and Testing: Patient presented with chronic indurated swelling o f her lower lip, painful, angular cheilitis, deep l inear ulcerations of the tongue, that was mistaken for isolated lip angi oedema. Had GI problems for the past 9 years includ ing esophageal strictures that required dilatation, and perianal a bscess that required incison and drainage. She had no history of HAE and was never placed on ACEI despite being hyperten sive. Had low RBC indices and iron and elevated ESR and her tests for HAE type I and II as well as AAE was negative. A lip biopsy was requested but patient declined the procedure at Dermatology office and did not want any interventio nal diagnostic procedure later on. Based on her pas t history of GI problems that was consitent with Crohn's, her revie w of systems that was positive for low grade fever and intermittent abdominal pains as well as wight loss and her exam findings as well as lab data that was suppertive of Cronh's including ASCA IgG and IgA in the presence of negative p-ANCA , patient was considered to be a case of oral Crohn 's disease. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis of the patient based on very characte cteristic oral exam findings, past history, lab dat a and review of symptoms is oral Crohn's disease which appears to h ave a peculiar trophism for squamous cell epitheliu m, frequently involving anal, esophageal and orolabial mucosa com pared to Crohn's in general. Patient was lost to fo llow up however and did not respond our calls. A treatment plan at this stage of Crohn's appear to involve biologic ag ents that would include TNF inhibitors such as Adalimumab, Inflixim ab and Certolizumab as well as monoclonal antibody against the cell adhesion molecule 4-integrin Natalizumab.

OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and diagnostic aspe cts of a patient with aquagenic urticaria treated i n the allergy outpatient clinic at the CUBM of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (Br azil). Patient Presentation and Testing: 12-year-old boy reported the appearance of prurig inous punctiformis after bathing or swimming in a p ool 4 months earlier. The lesions lasted for approximately 30 mi n. Regardless of modifications in water temperature and soap, the episodes occurred several times a week. The patient denied any association with type of clothing or fo od or other systemic manifestations. Personal antecedents inclu ded allergic rhinitis. Familial antecedents include d a father with porphyria and a mother with allergic rhinitis. Phys ical examination revealed no lesions. Dermographome try and tests for cold urticaria using ice cubes and cholinergic urti caria were negative. Water compresses at 37\u00baC resul ted in urticariform lesions on his back and trunk, confirming the diagn osis. The total IgE level was 386.0 UI/mL, and a he mogram showed 6.3% eosinophils. Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: The diagnosis was Aquagenic urticaria and theTreat ment with antihistamines was effective for 6 months , when intensely pruriginous lesions reappeared. The dosag e of antihistamines was quadrupled, and 10 mg/day a ntileukotriene was initiated. After 2 months, the condition improv ed, with a progressive reduction in medication unti l complete withdrawal after 5 months. For 2 years, a total rem ission of symptoms has been maintained. Clinical manifestations and age of onset were simil ar to those described in the literature. Diagnosis and correct treatment are important for good prognosis.

Based on the diffe ring clinical presentation and histologic findings, urticaria and tinea corporis (TC) are two distinct entities that shouldn't be confused, as treatment of one can exacerbate the other. We pr esent a young woman with TC likely from zoonotic tr ansmission which became disseminated with evidence of Majocchi s Granuloma (MG) secondary to immunosuppressive tre atment for suspected urticaria. DTC and MG are uncommon en tities and should be differentiated from urticaria. Proper diagnosis is important as each entity is treated di fferently. In general, the most common cause of TC is Trichophyton rubrum but zoonotic transmission may be from Tricho phyton mentagrophytes. Patient Presentation and Testing: : Our patient was a 16 year old female with pet rat s who presented for a rash consisting of annular, n on-blanching plaques with central clearing. She was seen by ER, allergy, and dermatology physicians, and diagnosed repeatedly with urticaria. She was treated initially with anti-hist amines, then later with IV corticosteroids due to r ecalcitrance. The central clearing of multiple lesions was more chara cteristic of TC, so repeat biopsy was performed, wh ich confirmed diagnosis. We suspect immunosuppression from cortic osteroids blunted the immune response leading to DT C and MG. Patient was treated with oral anti-fungals. We susp ect she contracted the infection from her pet rats. Infection with Trichophyton mentagrophytes has been described in l aboratory animals . Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: Shave skin biopsy was performed which demonstrated perivascular dermatitis, parakeratosis, and spongio sis. Notably, there was in the epidermis and the ha ir follicle consistent with MG.

Cros s-reactivity between bees and wasps by specific IgE is frequent between 30-60% of cases and it is mainly due to hya luronidase (Api m2 / Ves v2, Pol d 2), to diapeptidylpeptidase IV ( Api m5 / Ves v3) or / v6). However, cross- reactivity between vespids and bee phospholipases h as not been described because they do not share com mon structures.

He consul ted at a primary health center and was treated with methylprednisolone 60 mg and dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg intramuscularly with improvement of symptoms wit hin a few hours. He was not treated with adrenaline. After performing the allergy study 2 months after t he reaction, he had normal tryptase; positive intra dermal tests to bee venom and negative to vespids venoms; specific IgE to bee, Vespula and 0.11 a nd 0.05 kU/L respectively; and positive basophils activation tes t (BAT) only to bee venom, he initiated Pharmalgen\u00ae Apis mellifera immunotherapy (ALK Abell\u00f3). Diagnosis, Treatment and Patient Outcomes: After 3 years of treatment he had specific IgE of 3 .65; 7.56 and 6.15kU/L respectively, in the absence of new stings. A decrease in BAT positivity to bee venom and a negat ive sting challenge test with good tolerance to bee sting. To differentiate between sensitization and cross-re activity an immunoCAP-inhibition study was performe d to Apis mellifera, Vespula and Polistes venoms and differen t molecular allergens, including CCDs. It was possi ble to demonstrate cross-reactivity between venoms and CCDs and betwee n vespids phospholipases and CCDs. Conclusions We that sensitization to CCDs is responsibl e for sensitization found to vespids venoms after i mmunotherapy with bee venom. No other allergen from bee venom wa s found responsible for cross-reactivity by the mol ecular study performed. We did not find publications of similar cases. "}
