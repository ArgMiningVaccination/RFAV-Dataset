The differential vaccine effectiveness (VE) was assessed by a nested series of models across matching strata. For an exact match for high-dose and standard-dose seniors, matching elements included exact age, gender, residence type, race/ethnicity, provider bias, and residence area. Among the findings: - A simple aggregate comparison of influenza hospitalization risk showed no added HD effectiveness. - For nested models, adding strata increased VE in this study population. - Among 23,712 matched pairs of HD to standard-dose vaccinated seniors, the HD vaccine was 30.7% more effective in preventing influenza-related hospitalization.
