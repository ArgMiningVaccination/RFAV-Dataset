Herbal medicine is a complex science and important facet of Traditional Chinese Medicine. For over 2,000 years, it has proven to be an effective form of treatment. Similar to Acupuncture, herbal medicine works by rebalancing and stimulating the body's own natural healing ability. Chinese herbs are usually given in combinations known as formulas, with anywhere from 2- 14 different herbs. Various parts of a plant, such as roots, stems, leaves or flowers, as well as minerals and shells are used. Chinese herbal formulas are unique in that they are individually designed for your specific needs. Herbal preparation is customized as well, offered in different forms, such as tinctures, raw, powdered, capsules or pills. "}
