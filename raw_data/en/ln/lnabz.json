Ayurvedic Medicine utilizes specialized diets, lifestyle modifications, yoga, meditation, supplements, massage, and specific cleanses. Often, Ayurvedic medicine and acupuncture can be used together to enhance each health plan's impact on long-term health. Your first Ayurvedic medicine appointment will be 60 minutes. During this time, Bridget will take a detailed history of your life and health concerns. Diagnosis will be based upon intake, tongue, and pulse evaluations. Your session will help to determine your constitution (original health state) and current state of the constitution. Follow-up appointments are recommended every 6 weeks during the course of care. Treatment depends on your unique constitution (prakriti), your primary elemental combination (dosha), and the current presentation(vikriti). A main goal of Ayurvedic medicine is to harmonize your body systems, support digestive fire (agni), and cleanse your body of undigested food called ama, which can stick to the inside of your body and make imbalance. Together we will determine an individualized wellness plan for you it may include: herbal medicine, dietary recommendations, daily practices, yoga, breathing practices "}
