[A role for the slow oscillations of the neocortex in epileptic spasm generation (Dec 7, 2020)](https://nri.texaschildrens.org/news/role-slow-oscillations-neocortex-epileptic-spasm-generation) Epileptic spasms are a type of brief seizures that are the hallmark of catastrophic seizure disorders, which are characterized by severe cognitive and motor deficits. While common in West syndrome (or infantile spasms), these spasms can occur in people of any age group. Very little is known about the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and the neuronal circuit(s) responsible for the generation of these spasms. Researchers from [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/) and [Texas Children's Hospital](http://www.texaschildrens.org/) now provide evidence that epileptic spasms originate from the pyramidal cells in the deep layers of the neocortex. Further, they uncovered a novel neurophysiological phenomenon that explains how cortical neurons generate spasms. This is also the first study to reveal a hitherto unknown relationship between a normal brain state, like sleep, and spasms. The study was recently published in the [Annals of Neurology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25935).

[BICRA gene provides answers to patients, doctors and scientists (Nov 23, 2020)](https://nri.texaschildrens.org/news/bicra-gene-provides-answers-patients-doctors-and-scientists) Physicians and scientists are constantly on the lookout for new disease genes that can help them understand why patients have undiagnosed medical problems. Often the first clues come from genetic testing that reveals a change or mutation in a gene that they see in a child but not their parents. This is exactly what led to a new study published today in the [American Journal of Human Genetics](https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30400-6).

In the early years, survival rates were slim. After decades of improvements in treatment options, today, the cure rate for Burkitt lymphoma exceeds 90% in high-income countries like the U.S. and those in Western Europe. But the prognosis is dramatically worse in low-income countries in Africa, with survival rates estimated at less than 30%. Doctors at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, and Texas Children's Global HOPE (Hematology-Oncology Pediatric Excellence) Program are working to improve those odds. They have been caring for children with endemic Burkitt lymphoma in Malawi and Uganda, striving to improve survival rates.

[Novel regulators of myelin repair and regeneration discovered (Aug 13, 2020)](https://www.texaschildrens.org/novel-regulators-myelin-repair-and-regeneration-discovered) Myelin, a type of glial cell, forms an insulating sheath that surrounds the nerves of the brain and the spinal cord and is critical for rapid and accurate transmission of nerve signals. Damage or loss of myelin sheath is a hallmark of several neurological diseases in adults (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and in infants (e.g. cerebral palsy) and is common after injury. However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms involved in the repair and regeneration of myelin. A recent study from [Baylor College of Medicine](http://www.bcm.edu/) and [Texas Children's Hospital](http://www.texaschildrens.org/) has identified a new regulator (Nedd4) and genetic pathway (Daam2-VHL-Nedd4) that controls myelin formation during development and after injury. The study appears in the journal [Genes and Development](http://genesdev.cshlp.org/gca?gca=genesdev%3Bgad.338046.120v1&submit=Get+All+Checked+Abstracts).

However, without a thorough understanding of how a gene functions in different brain cells during various stages of development and later in post-natal life, it is difficult to determine how they individually - and as a group - contribute to disease pathologies.
