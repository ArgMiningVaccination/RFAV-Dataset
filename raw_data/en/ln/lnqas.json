It's hard to believe as I sit here writing this that it's been four years since I started Nurture Chiropractic Company. As I look back and where I started, where I am now in my business, and where my dreams are taking me and this company, I'm so incredibly grateful. What do you think of when you think \"stress?\" We all have been in a great deal of stress the last few years between a global pandemic, war, and natural disasters all around us. Add to that the so-called \"normal\" stress that comes from work, finances, and family, and it's quite a lot! Now, with your pregnancy, you are experiencing a whole new level of stress! Whether you're an experienced mom or this is your first time, your body and emotions are going through many changes. Did you know that stress can have a negative effect on your body and growing baby? This is how it works. During times of stress, our bodies produce cortisol. During pregnancy, this has a direct impact on the placenta and the growing fetus. In the last two years, we've all been inundated with information and opinions about our body's ability to defend itself, especially when it comes to immunity against COVID-19 and similar viruses. One fact that I don't think we heard enough about is how having adequate Vitamin D levels protects our overall immune system. Even before the vaccines were introduced, several studies showed that patients with Vitamin D in the ideal range had much better resistance to the virus. I've been asked many times in the last couple of years if chiropractic care can help the immune system, including help to resolve long-term symptoms of the viral response, including sensory loss. Chiropractic care throughout your pregnancy can help alleviate stressful symptoms like hip and pelvic pain. Using the right techniques, chiropractic care can even make the delivery safer and easier. Specifically, working with a chiropractor who is trained and certified in the Webster analysis and technique is a healthy and comfortable way to find relief and prepare for a potentially easier birth. Have you heard of the DUTCH testing system? As a chiropractor, I am always looking for new ways to serve my patients and help them find ways to have healthier and happier lives. I recently started promoting this testing through my office and wanted to share a little bit more about it. As we start a new year, I wanted to share with you a little bit about how new appointments work at Nurture Chiropractic. For those who are an existing patient, some of this information might be new to you so it will make a good refresher! I often have new patients come in who are clearly a little bit nervous and I discover that the only exposure they've had to chiropractic care is what they may have seen on talk shows or social media. They quickly are relieved to learn that my techniques and attitude around chiropractic care are far different than what they expect. I wanted to share a few common misconceptions people have about chiropractic care based largely on what they see on social media. Let's also talk about what you will find at Nurture Chiropractic instead! You may have noticed that I use Revive essential oils in my office. Most people know that they are great for focus, stress, and some physical ailments. Combined with consistent chiropractic care, essential oils can be an amazing part of keeping your body and mind working to its best potential! But, as my headline suggests, there might be a few things you can use essential oils for that you may not have considered. Imagine how it could help you feel better and work better if you did something simple as sit properly while you work! Besides chiropractic care, that is the easiest and one of the most effective things you can do to protect your spine and feel well. "}
