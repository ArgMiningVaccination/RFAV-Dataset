Classical homeopathy refers to the original principles of the homeopathic system, in which a single homeopathic medicine (also known as a constitutional homeopathic remedy) is chosen according to the person as a whole (a person's constitution - summary of physical signs and symptoms, emotional feelings, mood, sensations, subconscious patterns and person's characteristics). Homeopathic constitutional care can elicit a profound healing response and can be extremely effective in treating chronic health problems that had seemed incurable. Homeopathy penetrates deep into the root cause, relieving physical symptoms, mental and emotional imbalances, energy blockages, and correcting the effects this imbalance has had on the body, mind and spirit. It truly is holistic medicine. It can also help activate your essential center of pure potential and allow you to function more from your true essence. Treating the Whole Person Classical Homeopathy is a holistic system of medicine based on the philosophy that our body, mind and emotions are all interconnected. Based on this perspective, one of the primary objectives of a classical homeopath is to find the particular constitutional medicine that matches each person's physical, mental and emotional symptoms and features. The constitutional remedy is selected based on the Law of Similars, taking into consideration the person as a whole, including past and present symptoms. What Can Homeopathy Treat? Homeopathy can be effective in treating virtually any health issue - from allergies to deep-seated, chronic conditions - regardless of whether the origin is physical, mental or emotional. It is a medicine that is both life-enhancing and revitalizing, bringing harmony to stressed bodies, frazzled nerves and weary spirits. A well-chosen homeopathic remedy can produce profound improvement in acute conditions by significantly reducing the intensity of symptoms and recovery time. Many common children's complaints, such as bedwetting, colic, earaches, and teething, also respond remarkably well to homeopathy. Many women find great relief with homeopathic treatment during pregnancy and childbirth and with menstrual irregularities, PMS, and menopausal symptoms. Homeopathic treatment can be particularly useful in deep-seated, chronic conditions that have developed over a long period of time, frequently accompanied by a general deterioration of health. Homeopathy can help reverse the limitations of chronic disease and maintain long-term health. The Law of Similars Homeopathy is based on the Law of Similars, which is an ancient healing principle stating that \"like cures Like.\" This principle was recognized by the Greek doctor Hippocrates. Hippocrates developed the use of the Law of Similars, based on the principle that \"like cures like\". This principle was re-discovered over 200 years ago by German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), who developed them into the healing modality that he called Homeopathy - from the Greek words homoios (similar) and pathos (disease). A simple example of this principle can be seen with the common onion. Slicing an onion can cause symptoms of burning and watery eyes, as well as sneezing and a runny nose. Many people who experienced the hayfever symptoms of burning, watery eyes, sneezing and runny nose have found pleasant relief after taking the homeopathic remedy Allium cepa (the remedy made from red onion). Homeopathic Remedies Homeopathy uses homeopathic remedies: highly diluted doses of natural substances that stimulate the body's healing mechanism to promote health. Homeopathic remedies are completely free of side effects, non-toxic and safe for everyone of all ages, even during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. In fact, the non-toxic nature of these remedies makes the manufacturing process safe for the environment as well. Today, homeopathy is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the second most commonly used form of alternative medicine in the world.
