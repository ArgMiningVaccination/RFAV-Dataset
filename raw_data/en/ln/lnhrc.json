We offer natural women's health care options for all stages of life. Beginning at puberty women's bodies, and more specifically their hormones, are in a constant state of flux. As women transition through the various stages of life, from the beginning of menstruation through the reproductive years and into menopause, women's health is an area of care that can leave women feeling overwhelmed, frustrated and confused. This is an area where acupuncture and integrative medicine shines. From irregular cycles and painful periods to fertility, pregnancy, menopause and much more, the tools we use at Natural Harmony Reproductive Health provide gentle, effective care to rebalance your body, allowing you to feel your best.
