Find the one that's right for you.", "sitename": "Student Health Center", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "- Graduate and returning students: - Wednesdays, 1:30-3 p.m. - Thursdays, 2:30-4 p.m. - Undergraduate: - Fridays, 10-11:30 a.m. - Fridays, 1:30-3 p.m. Often the personal issues that bring us to counseling (e.g., stress, anxiety, or depression) have more to do with how we relate to others than we think. Healthy Connections Group will help members explore the relationship between their interpersonal style and their emotional well-being. Members will be encouraged to experiment with new behaviors, which can foster more meaningful connections with others and enhance emotional health. Students need to already be a client of CAPS or have been referred to group after intake appointment. Cost: These groups are based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills. The goal of these groups is to help participants feel more balanced and in control of their lives. The skills focus on improving relationships, managing emotions, and getting through distressing moments. The groups are broken into three skills training modules - Emotion Regulation, Distress Tolerance, and Interpersonal Effectiveness - which are 6-8 sessions each. One or more will be offered each semester, and Mindfulness skills are included in each, to help you bring your attention to your experiences and stay in the present moment. Emotion Regulation skills help you to decrease vulnerability to negative emotions, increase positive emotions, and tolerate emotions. Distress Tolerance skills teach new coping skills to help get through high-distress situations without making things worse and to decrease the use of unhelpful or unhealthy ways of coping. The Interpersonal Effectiveness skills teach you to communicate more assertively so that you can achieve your goals, maintain relationships, and maintain your self-respect. These groups focus on teaching and discussion about the application of the skills or difficulties using them. Students need to already be a client of CAPS or have completed the CAPSNow appointment before starting group. Clients in these special population groups need to be in individual counseling services, either at CAPS or with a community provider, during the time period they are attending the group. Cost: This Sexual Assault Crisis Service (SACS) group will be a closed group with rolling referrals to begin at the start of a new module. These modules will be based on Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) skills with the goal of integrating distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness into their repertoire of coping skills. Each module will be 4-6 sessions. There will be room for group processing related to the experience of being a survivor of sexual or relationship violence and how this impacts functioning. The module format will ground group members in ways to navigate their experience as survivors. This group will ideally supplement individual therapy by providing the skills required for ongoing emotional stabilization.
