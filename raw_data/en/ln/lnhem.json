With the quality of life and longevity impacted by chronic illness for a staggering percentage of the population, holistic practices that claim to optimise health and overall wellbeing are on the rise. One such system gaining popularity is Ayurveda, an ancient Indian healing system with origins dating back to 1500 BC. The word Ayurveda may summon images of massage treatments, herbal teas, and facials, but for many, Ayurveda is a way of life. Herbs, diet, massage, meditation, and yoga are just some of the practices used by Ayurveda to achieve balance between the mind, body, and spirit. CBD is another buzzword in the wellness sphere, which has been hailed as a natural way to relieve chronic [ pain](https://alphagreen.io/medical-cannabis-uk) and improve conditions like insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Although a relatively recent development in the West, cannabis has been used ritualistically since the origins of the Ayurveda, featured in 80 traditional Ayurvedic formulas. In this article, we take a look at how CBD and the Eastern practice of Ayurveda could be integrated into modern medicine, as the tide changes from illness to wellness and prevention rather than cure. What is Ayurveda First, let's take a more in-depth look into this age-old system of healing. Ayurveda, pronounced ai-uh-vei-duh, is the world's oldest health system, thought to have originated in India over 5,000 years ago. It first started as an oral tradition where Ayurvedic knowledge was passed from person to person as a guide on how to balance the mind and body to achieve radiant health. Still widely practised in India today, it is safe to say the ancient health system of Ayurveda has withstood the test of time. This ancient wisdom was discovered in the sacred texts, known as the [ Vedas](https://www.ancient.eu/The_Vedas/), which also contained the first recordings of yoga. Ayurveda is regarded as the sister science to yoga, and just like yoga, it is beginning to make waves in the West as people seek more natural ways to heal. The central principles of Ayurveda are centred around the importance of maintaining the balance of the mind, body, and spirit to prevent disease and optimise quality of life. It recognises that we're unique, changing beings; therefore, our diet and lifestyle should match out needs, offering a personalised and holistic approach to health. Just as yoga provides a mind-body workout within a spiritual framework, Ayurveda looks beyond just the physical benefits of medicine by acknowledging the interconnectedness of all things to support physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. Unlike yoga, you may not have heard of Ayurveda before, however, elements of the tradition have made their way into the mainstream. [ Turmeric](https://alphagreen.io/supplements/cooking/buy/Ingredients_filter-turmeric.html) is an Ayurvedic herb that is still a go-to in many Indian households for its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Since turmeric's, or more specifically, curcumin's [ scientific backing](https://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/fulltext/2020/01000/turmeric__potential_health_benefits.9.aspx), this golden spice has made its way out of the spice rack and into turmeric lattes, health shots, cocktails, and even face masks. The healing power of herbs and plants are central to Ayurveda, and products that contain Ayurvedic staples like turmeric, [ ashwagandha](https://alphagreen.io/adaptogen) and shatavari are slowly making their way into the mainstream in the West. Though the practices and philosophy of Ayurveda are vast, they are rooted in the simple principle that we are made up of a unique combination of the five basic elements: ether, air, fire, earth, water. Central to Ayurveda are the three mind-body types which are made up of the five basic elements. They are called [ doshas](https://www.joyfulbelly.com/Ayurveda/article/dosha/1), and they express unique blends of physical, emotional, and mental characteristics. Your unique dosha helps you choose optimal diet and lifestyle choices to achieve and maintain a vibrant and joyful state of health. Ayurveda stipulates that these five essential elements govern the law of the universe as well as every being within. Just like all animals, we need to adjust and adapt to the outside environment to find internal balance. Although it is a complex system, the central premise rests on the simple yet profound principle of balancing opposites. For example, many intuitively balance the hot, dry qualities of summer with cool, hydrating foods like salads and smoothies, just as the cold, dry qualities of winter are balanced with heavier, warming food, like spiced soups and stews. Herbal remedies, diet, exercise, amongst other lifestyle practices, are utilised to balance opposites to prevent disease and to optimise quality of life and longevity. An Introduction to the Doshas Central to Ayurvedic philosophy is the three doshas; Vata, Pitta, Kapha, which are said to account for individual differences in physical characteristics and temperament. The doshas are derived from the five elements, with Vata governed by air and space, Pitta governed by fire and water, and Kapha governed by earth and water. Each element has biological energies which govern physical and mental processes. Your [ prakriti](https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/earth-wind-fire) is your dosha that is established at birth, and this can become imbalanced by various internal and external influences like the seasons, diet, and routine. It is said that by identifying your dosha, you can determine which herbs, foods, exercises, meditations, and lifestyle choices can keep you in a state of mind-body harmony. The three doshas and their characteristics are: Vata \u2014 Qualities \u2014 cold, light, subtle, mobile, dry, scattering, rough - Body type \u2014 Typically of a slender build, with long fingers, thin lips and fine hair - In balance \u2014 Creative, enthusiastic, engaging, sleep soundly, regular digestion - Out of balance \u2014 Scattered, spacey, anxious, dry skin, cracking bones, irregular digestion, constipation, insomnia, bloating - Diet \u2014 Warming, oily, heavy food like stews curries, and soups to ground and balance cold, mobile, light qualities of air. Limit the number of cold, icy drinks, and replace them with warm water and hot tea. Good quality oils should be included in the diet (olive, sesame, avocado) to help with digestion with raw, cold, and dried food kept to a minimum. - Lifestyle \u2014 Vatas should stick to a consistent routine where they can, particularly when it comes to sleep and mealtimes. Vatas should avoid cold and windy conditions, as well as dry climates. Pitta \u2014 Qualities \u2014 hot, oily, intense, sharp, light - Body type \u2014 Typically of a medium / athletic build, with warm tones in their skin and hair - In balance \u2014 Sharp minded, high achieving, strong appetite, strong digestion, contented, steady temperament - Out of balance \u2014 Short-tempered, jealous, digestive issues like acid reflux, skin issues like acne, rosacea and rashes, hot flashes - Diet \u2014 Cooling foods like salads and mint to counteract hot qualities of fire. Pittas should consume lots of milk, grains, and vegetables and limit their intake of hot spice, red meat, fried food, pickles, vinegar, and caffeine. - Lifestyle \u2014 Pittas tend to enjoy high-intensity workouts and competitive sports; however, they should balance this with grounding and contemplative activities like meditation and restorative yoga. They should take time to rest from work to avoid burnout. Kapha \u2014 Qualities \u2014 stable, soft, slow, heavy, sweet, cold - Body type \u2014 Typically heavier build with big, loving eyes, thick eyelashes, and full lips - In balance \u2014 Generous, affectionate, loyal, strong, good-natured - Out of balance \u2014 Slow, sluggish digestion, resistance to change, lethargy, procrastination, depression - Diet \u2014 Warm, light, dry, foods, like lightly cooked vegetables, hot spices, and raw fruit & vegetables to counteract the heavy qualities of Kapha. Mucus forming food like dairy and sugar should be kept to a minimum, as well as cold, dense, and heavy food like ice cream. - Lifestyle \u2014 To avoid the heavy qualities of Kapha, lots of movement and exercise is encouraged to energise the body and mind. It's important to make time for fun and to change up the routine now and again. An Ayurveda doctor or therapist will use various tests to help identify an individual's prakriti and dominant dosha. This is the recommended method, but there are also numerous online [ quizzes](https://shop.chopra.com/dosha-quiz/?sso_code=eyJpdiI6InJoSFI2aWlrSFlTQXJEZ0tBOW5XXC93PT0iLCJ2YWx1ZSI6IjdOQTIxcVwvUklkUjRlYXdPTWZvTDRnaFkrcXdOWDFiNzZ1R0JVTEhUOVBvaWFVTForXC9CT1ZaZU5UQkh2OE94YkpGS3gwNTdlcVgwNmwwQUh1XC9nS3hUTjVudFwveXBHVzV2ZGpZVmNMWVwvYk09IiwibWFjIjoiNmFkMmUyNzgwZTYwMWM4ZGI2MTNjMGEwMWQ0Nzc2YjA5N2IwYWVhOTQ2NjgxODIyMjYwMTA3NGUxMTg1YmI1NiJ9) which can indicate which dosha you are. Most commonly, people have two dominant doshas (bi-doshic), or on the rare occasion, they are balanced between all three doshas (tri-doshic). Two fundamental ways to identify imbalance is to observe patterns of [ digestion](https://alphagreen.io/probiotics) and sleep, which is intriguing since gut health and sleep are two of the most discussed subjects in the wellness sphere today. East meets West Modern medicine has been crucial in fighting infectious diseases, but the find-it, fix-it, approach appears to be failing when it comes to mental health and chronic disease. Some examples of chronic diseases include asthma, dementia, Crohn's disease, mood disorders and heart disease, with many leading to long-term medication. A review conducted by [ Public Health England (PHE)](https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/1-4-people-take-addictive-medicines-finds-review/) reported that 1 in 4 people in England takes \"addictive\" prescription medicines such as antidepressants, sleeping pills and opioid painkillers. Many chronic diseases are considered to be incurable but preventable, with [ lifestyle factors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369087/) like obesity and inactivity identified as key risk factors. With this in mind, it's unsurprising then that integrative and holistic treatments are also [ on the rise](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/alternative-medicine-becoming-mainstream#1) in the West. The [ World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2016/chinese-medicine-sustainable/en/) (WHO) recognises that more and more people are seeking out alternative, natural solutions like acupuncture and plant-based medicine to alleviate symptoms and enhance their wellbeing. Problematic from an Ayurvedic perspective is that in the West, we typically only visit the doctor after troubling symptoms have manifested. According to Ayurveda's 6 stages of disease, during stage one of the disease, subtle signs of imbalance like headaches can be detected, which are symptoms that wouldn't necessarily show on a doctor's examination and which are usually repressed by over-the-counter painkillers. By stage five, the disease has begun to break down the tissues and the symptoms are detectable; however, the progression of the disease means it is more difficult to treat. [ According to the WHO](https://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/part2_ch1/en/index12.html), the rise of chronic disease can be attributed primarily to detrimental lifestyle factors, in particular, they highlight the risk of unhealthy diet and excessive food intake, physical inactivity and tobacco use. Therefore, Ayurveda could be useful in helping to identify imbalances earlier on, correcting symptoms with natural remedies before they manifest more serious symptoms which may result in long-term prescription medicines. With cases of chronic illnesses increasing and consequently, the medical, social, and economic burden increasing also, it seems that a revised approach to health in the West is long overdue. Adaptogens and CBD Commuting, smartphones, household chemicals, pollution of the air, noise, and [ visual](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/18/modern-world-bad-for-brain-daniel-j-levitin-organized-mind-information-overload) variety, these are just a few aspects of modern life that can cause distress within the body. Busy lifestyles mean many are time-poor, and as a result, stress-relieving pastimes are often quick fixes, like indulging in high-calorie comfort food, drinking alcohol, and watching TV. In the wellness world, [ adaptogens](https://alphagreen.io/adaptogen) have been touted as the natural way to ease physical and mental stress in the body. Drinks, tinctures, and supplements containing adaptogens cropping up on shelves in health stores everywhere, but are they just another quick fix? Adaptogens were first studied by [ The Soviets](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/food/the-plate/2016/08/long-before-doping-scandals--russians-were-studying-performance-/) during the second world war, when they were looking for ways to help improve the endurance of soldiers, without side effects. Adaptogens are intelligent herbs or roots that have unique qualities which help the body adapt to stress and promote mental balance. Homeostasis is created in the body through interaction with the [ hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis](https://www.integrativepro.com/Resources/Integrative-Blog/2016/The-HPA-Axis#:~:text=The%20hypothalamic%20pituitary%20adrenal%20(HPA,nervous%20system%20and%20endocrine%20system.&text=ACTH%20binds%20to%20receptors%20on,stimulates%20adrenal%20release%20of%20cortisol.), commonly referred to as the \"stress system\". Adaptogens interact with the adrenals and produce a non-specific state of resistance in the body in response to physical, emotional, or environmental stress. By bringing balance to mind and body with opposing qualities, adaptogens work in accordance with the Ayurvedic notion of balance. Many of the well-known adaptogens today are traditionally Ayurvedic herbs which have been used for centuries within the Ayurvedic healing tradition. The four most researched Ayurvedic adaptogens and their benefits are: - Amla \u2014 An Indian gooseberry used for its [immunity-boosting](https://alphagreen.io/immune-system-boost)and calming properties - Ashwagandha \u2014 Also known as Indian ginseng can help ease anxiety, increase energy and strength and promote better sleep. - Shatavari \u2014 A member of the asparagus family, it is known as the root of 100 husbands for its libido and fertility-enhancing properties. - Tulsi \u2014 Otherwise known as Holy Basil, can promote mental clarity by reducing stress and anxiety. - Turmeric \u2014 Used for its potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which can help prevent a variety of diseases. The doshas and complimentary adaptogens: - Vata \u2014 Ashwagandha can pacify anxious Vata symptoms with its grounding properties. It can calm the nervous system and help to focus the mind. - Pitta \u2014 Shatavari has cooling energy which can help balance fiery Pitta symptoms, such as, heartburn, and mood swings associated with premenstrual syndrome - Kapha \u2014 Turmeric has bitter and is mildly heating equalities and can help improve slow Kapha digestion and help to reduce elevated blood cholesterol levels Adaptogens are easy to integrate into your life, commonly taken as supplements or brewed into tea. They are considered to be non-toxic and can be a healthy way to adapt to unavoidable stress without disturbing normal biological functions. Many promising studies show that adaptogens might merit their hype; however, experts caution against using adaptogens as a cure-all. In Ayurveda, healing is a multi-pronged approach, prescribing meditation, diet, exercise, and routine to regain physical and emotional balance. Adaptogens can be a safe way to start managing stress, working in synergy with your body but aren't intended to replace a healthy lifestyle. They may indeed be a preventative method when early signs of chronic stress manifest. Although stressors aren't as palpable as they were during the war when they were first discovered, stress-related health issues like anxiety and depression are [ reported](https://theconversation.com/so-many-in-the-west-are-depressed-because-theyre-expected-not-to-be-79672) to be reaching epidemic proportions in the West. Further investigation is required, but adaptogens might help long-term if they're taken at early signs of imbalance within the body. Ayurveda would prescribe various diet and lifestyle changes to get to the root of the stress rather than merely relieving symptoms. However, for unavoidable stress caused by modern life, herbs may well be useful. Cannabis and Ayurveda With legalisation of marijuana in some states in the US and the booming CBD industry in the UK, the medicinal properties of cannabis for conditions like anxiety, epilepsy and chronic pain have been at the forefront of the conversation when it comes to pant-based and alternative medicine. Ayurveda has a long history with the cannabis plant, it is classified as one of the five sacred plants in the Vedic scriptures, (along with the adaptogen tulsi) and has strong ties to the Hindu deity, [ Shiva](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/mamta-rana/shiva-and-the-cannabis-6941/). However, Ayurveda's relationship with cannabis is multifaceted. For one, marijuana is considered to have toxic properties, so it is not recommended for use in isolation. Instead, marijuana underwent a purification process which traditionally involved soaking the herb in pure water for 24 hours. It was also formulated with calming herbs to neutralise its toxic qualities and treat ailments. An example of Ayurvedic remedies which utilised different parts of cannabis plant include: - Bhang \u2014 A drink made from a paste containing the ground leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant. It is balanced with cooling foods and herbs like milk, yoghurt, and fennel to treat conditions like glaucoma and hypertension and can be combined with other herbs like ginger for digestion and has even been used as an aphrodisiac for the wedding night. - Kshatantak Malam \u2014 A topical application to heal open cuts, burns and wounds made from a combination of ground cannabis leaves, chaff-flower, and onion. - Charas \u2014 Also known as Hashish, is the resin and most potent part of the plant which is smoked. It was occasionally used to treat insomnia and psychiatric disorders, but long-term use was not advised. Ayurveda warns that misuse of cannabis for recreation can cause doshic imbalances and lead to degradation of the mind, body, and soul. Alone, it is regarded as being toxic for the body so instead is recommended to be used in combination with other herbs and balancing ingredients. Because of the anti-marijuana propaganda in the West and subsequent criminalisation of cannabis in India, cannabis is virtually non-existent in Ayurvedic healing today. However, with the recent legalisation of CBD in India, CBD is gradually making its way back into Ayurvedic clinics. CBD is the name for cannabidiol, the non-intoxicating compound extracted from the cannabis plant, most commonly derived from hemp. Just like adaptogens, CBD is non-toxic and non-intoxicating, working in synergy with the body's natural biological functions to create homeostasis in the body. Although CBD is not classified as an adaptogen, it shares many of the same properties and meets all of the criteria laid out by research scientist [ Dr. I. I. Brekhman](https://goop.com/wellness/health/an-herbalist-on-the-healing-power-of-adaptogens/) in 1961: - It is non-toxic in regular therapeutic doses - It produces a non-specific state of resistance in the body to physical, emotional, or environmental stress - It has a normalising effect on the body, helping to restore normal physiologic function that has been altered by stress Endocannabinoid receptors are located throughout the body, which means it helps to regulate a wide range of functions and processes. Just like adaptogens, CBD has been shown work at the cellular level to bring balance to the body, for example, it can adapt to the body to help boost attention and alertness or promote relaxation to bring balance. [ Research has shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877694/) that CBD can help regulate functions, including sleep, pain, mood, and immunity. A breakdown of the review conducted by PHE into the prevalence of \"addictive\" prescription medicines, shows that between 2017 and 2018 - - 7.3 million (17% of the adult population took antidepressants - 5.6 million (13%) took opioid pain medicines - 1.5 million (3%) took gabapentinoids used to treat epilepsy and generalised anxiety disorder - 1.4 million (3%) took benzodiazepines used for sleep problems and anxiety - 1.0 million (2%) took z-drugs used to treat insomnia Although much more research is needed on CBD, it's interesting to note that some of the most reliable [ scientific evidence](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476) has shown CBD's effectiveness for managing anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. With that in mind, CBD could be an interesting research subject for a more integrative approach to preventing disease and reducing prescription drug dependence. Although these drugs are essential to many, they often come with unpleasant side effects and often act as a band-aid for long-term use. Prevention using plant-based medicine like CBD and adaptogens, which are non-addictive and have few side effects may be a better option for many who are experiencing early signs of imbalance. The Ayurvedic framework could help people to identify subtle symptoms of imbalance and subsequently suggest complementary exercises, supplements, diet, and lifestyle changes for long-term relief. CBD and meditation CBD can help facilitate relaxation and can complement mindful practices like meditation. According to Ayurveda, an essential part of the daily routine across all doshas is meditation. The [ benefits of meditation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) cannot be disputed, with research backing its advantages for helping with stress, anxiety, and sleep amongst others. But despite the wonders it can do for our health, many find finding the time and mental space to sit down to go inwards challenging. Given the sensory overload of the modern world, this is hardly surprising, and many people are now turning to CBD for support. The [ growing trend](https://www.pulsarplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CBD-slide-share.compressed.pdf) of using CBD for meditation can be put down to its calming properties and ability to slow down intrusive thoughts allowing meditators to go inward with more ease. According to Ayurveda, restlessness and anxiety are symptoms of a Vata imbalance. CBD's qualities are warm, heavy, and slow, which correspond to the grounding and stabilising effects of Kapha. These qualities can help counteract the mobile, air qualities of Vata and the fiery, irritability of Pitta. Marijuana, or THC products, are not recommended in Ayurveda as they're thought to 'clog' the mind and the subtle energy channels, making them counterintuitive to [ spiritual progression](https://alphagreen.io/psychedelic) and meditation. Integrating modern medicine, CBD and Ayurveda Looking at the relationship between Ayurveda, CBD and modern medicine, there seem to be potential benefits for integrating ancient wisdom and current practices, especially when it comes to stress-related diseases and disorders. As mental health and chronic diseases rise in the West, so does the popularity of more natural, alternative treatments. There are clear benefits to Ayurveda, and although the theories are certainly time-tested, its esoteric and intuitive nature makes it somewhat difficult to study empirically. There are, however, many aspects of Ayurvedic wisdom that are only just being formally recognised in the West. Some examples include: - Understanding that emotional health and physical health are tightly interwoven. There is a growing body of [evidence-based research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1456909/)into the mind-body connection in the West, especially when it comes to stress and stress-related illnesses. - The finding that adaptogenic herbs and roots can help the body find balance and adapt to physical and mental stress caused by external and internal stressors, with no side effects when taken in normal therapeutic doses. - Balance, or homeostasis, in the body is essential when it comes to preventing disease. Ayurveda isn't without its controversies. Many schools of thought are calling for modern medicine to rethink and update its approach to health and wellbeing. Reflecting on and integrating age-old wisdom that has been passed down over many thousands of years appears to be a worthwhile approach, especially when it comes to preventing disease through diet and lifestyle. With WHO reporting that more and more people around the world are using herbs to heal, plant-medicine certainly warrants further investigation. It would be important to create trusted guidelines regarding doses and interactions with other drugs, especially since [ adverse reactions](https://www.nhs.uk/news/medication/review-highlights-danger-mixing-herbal-remedies-prescription-drugs/) have been reported when some herbal medicines, including CBD, when taken in conjunction with prescription drugs. More thorough training in diet and nutrition, as well as formal training in Eastern practices for Western doctors, would be necessary for the integration of herbal medicine. As observed with CBD, regulation when it comes to procurement and manufacturing of raw ingredients in herbal medicine is essential for safety, quality, and efficacy. On the other side of the coin, there are calls for Ayurveda to become more progressive and modern, backed by individuals like American Ayurvedic consultant [ Sahara Rose,](https://www.iamsahararose.com/) and as envisioned by biomedical scientist [ Dr Patwardhan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3149384/). The world has certainly changed a lot over time, with technological progress accelerating in the last 50 years. A life of self-inquiry, yoga, meditation, and self-reflection, plus massages, supplements and multifaceted diet wouldn't necessarily be appropriate for a population of time-poor people. Additionally, by pushing past dogmatic concepts and by having more scientifically backed solutions, Ayurveda could be made more accessible to a broader audience. When it comes to CBD, the previously revered cannabis could be reintegrated into modern Ayurveda as a tool to help bring balance to the body without the previous concern of the 'toxic' qualities. There is also evidence that CBD can be used [ synergistically](https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/adaptogens-and-cbd/) with certain adaptogens. In Ayurveda, herbs are often used in tandem with other herbs to balance out the qualities, though, it is advised to see how individual adaptogens work in isolation and to seek the guidance of a trained herbalist of Ayurvedic consultant when it comes to herbal blends. In modernising Ayurveda, the West should be mindful of the origins of this ancient knowledge system and respect its traditional and spiritual roots. Final Conclusions Ayurveda and CBD could be integrated into modern medicine as preventative methods when it comes to health and overall wellbeing. It is argued that the current system has a limited focus on illness which appears to be inadequate when it comes to tackling the issues of deteriorating mental health and rising chronic disease. Instead, a holistic and personalised approach to healing, like Ayurveda which has a focus on prevention and overall wellbeing could potentially bring a fresh perspective to Western healthcare and perhaps provide treatment for individuals where other drug treatments have failed. With many people already turning to natural remedies like CBD and adaptogens to manage their health, more evidence-based research is needed to ensure herbs and treatments are being administered safely. Ayurveda is currently classed as a pseudoscience and requires more rigorous scientific exploration before it is accepted into the mainstream, but the importance of building natural defences preemptively is key.
