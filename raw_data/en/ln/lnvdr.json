Weleda's Birch Cellulite Oil is a 100% certified natural massage oil for areas of visible cellulite anywhere on the body such as thighs and buttocks. Extracts from organically grown birch, rosemary and butcher's broom stimulate the skin's metabolism, and are blended with active carrier oils, including vitamin rich wheat germ and nourishing jojoba. Invigorating essential oils of grapefruit and cypress provide the fragrance, and also work to uplift the mind, and energise the body. And it really works. +22% Increased elasticity* +21% Smoother skin* *Tested after 28 days Benefits: Elevate your bathroom routine with our Birch Indulgent Bathing Ritual Suitable for vegans.

Reviews (6) - Great stuff Combined with body brushing I saw a significant improvement- I didn't even use 2x for 4 weeks - just once after showering - Great stuff Combined with body brushing I saw a significant improvement- I didn't even use 2x fir 4 weeks - just once. - for cellulite I did a 4 week course of birch oil twice a day, along side birch cleansing juice. my legs feel smoother, suppler and more toned. The smell is also incredible! - Genuinely amazed I was very sceptical as with most things as they don't work . I cannot believe the amazing visible results I have from using this for a week . It smells nice and goes on easy and doesn't leave you greasy for hours . My skins looks and feels different . I bought this discounted on a whim and would happily repurchase at full price . - Wonder product I got this as part of the vegan glossybox, I am fortunate to not have cellulite but I do have very deep stretch marks on my belly, boobs and legs from two babies. This oil has worked miracles, my stretch marks have improved visibly and they feel shallower. Love love love! - My skin looks AMAZING This oil does the trick! Seriously! My skin is visibly smoother - no joke. It smells amazing too... and it goes in well. Total winner! You may also like [Birch Body Scrub "}
