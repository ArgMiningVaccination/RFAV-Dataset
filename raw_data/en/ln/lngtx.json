Salt therapy is a natural remedy that involves inhaling pharmaceutical-grade dry salt in a comfortable, controlled environment. As you sit back and relax, our Salt Chamber halogenerator will disperse microscopic salt particles into the room. You'll inhale these tiny particles deep into your airways and lungs and they will also land on your skin. Suitable for babies, children and adults, salt therapy can help soothe a long list of skin, respiratory and lifestyle conditions. Up to 4 people in our cave at one time.
