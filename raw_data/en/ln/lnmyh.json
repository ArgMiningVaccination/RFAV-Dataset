Integrative Medicine is a philosophy of healthcare that combines the knowledge and practices of conventional Western medicine with evidence-based, complementary medicine to enable individuals to reach their optimal health potential. This dual approach to healthcare involves the doctor's holistic investigation of the patient's physical, psychological, emotional, social, environmental and spiritual concerns. Lifestyle factors such as diet, movement, sleep, stress and environmental exposures are discussed, as they form the foundation of our health and wellbeing. Who is an Integrative Medicine doctor? An Integrative Medicine doctor is a General Practitioner (GP) who has undergone further specialist training through various institutions including: the Australian College of Nutritional & Environmental Medicine (ACNEM), the Australian Society of Lifestyle Medicine (ASLM), the National Institute of Integrative Medicine (NIIM), Bio-Balance Health Australia. In addition, the GP has usually completed a mentorship at a specialist Integrative Medicine clinic under the guidance of an experienced Integrative doctor. What are the advantages of Integrative Medicine? An Integrative Medicine approach focuses on the whole person and aims to identify the root cause(s) of the patient's health problem(s) and tailor treatment accordingly. A more conventional medical approach focuses on the treatment of a patient's presenting symptoms. By addressing and treating the underlying causes, symptoms are often alleviated and general wellbeing also improves. Integrative doctors understand the body as an integrated system rather than a collection of independent organs. A simple example to demonstrate the different approaches may be: a person presents complaining of reflux or heartburn. A traditional medical approach may be to prescribe anti-reflux medication, whereas an Integrative Medicine approach would be to address the underlying causes of the reflux, and address those. What conditions can benefit from Integrative Medicine? An Integrative Medicine approach can be implemented with most presenting health issues, but it is especially useful for the following: | | Skin | | acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea | | Gastrointestinal | | Irritable Bowel Syndrome (diarrhoea/constipation/bloating), reflux/indigestion | | Endocrine | | thyroid disease, diabetes, hormonal imbalance, osteoporosis | | Mental Health | | anxiety, depression | | Women's Health | | heavy/painful periods, pre-menstrual issues, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), menopause, fertility, pregnancy, post-birth | | Autoimmune Disease | | Hashimoto's/Graves, Crohn's, rheumatoid arthritis | | Allergic Disease | | asthma, eczema, hay fever, food intolerances, allergies | | Cardiovascular | | heart disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity | | Children's Health | | behavioural problems, frequent ear/throat infections | | General | | optimisation of health and improvement of the immune system, lethargy/fatigue, weight loss\" What approaches are used in Integrative Medicine? - Integrative Medicine consultations are longer than conventional consultations as Integrative doctors take time to listen to, and ask questions about, the patient's medical history, lifestyle, environmental exposures and genetic risk factors in order to ascertain the root causes of the presenting issue(s). - Individualised investigations into a patient's physiology, biochemistry and hormonal balance may be used to further understand the underlying causes of the patient's concerns and symptoms - Stress reduction/relaxation strategies such as mindfulness, meditation and movement may be recommended according to the patient's needs and interests - Nutrient supplementation may be recommended according to symptoms or if certain essential nutrient levels are found to be deficient or suboptimal, including amino acids, essential fatty acids (e.g. fish oil), vitamins (e.g. vitamin D) and minerals (e.g. zinc) - Herbal/spice supplementation is recommended where appropriate (e.g. St. John's Wort, curcumin, vitex) - Environmental medicine may also be considered, which would include advice on reducing exposure to allergens, pollutants and chemicals in the home, food and environment, as well as liver detoxification.
