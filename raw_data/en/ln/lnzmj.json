This article explains how doublespeak, weasel words, buzzwords, connotations of common terms, and other propaganda tricks are used to promote questionable health practices. Doublespeak and Weasel Words Uninhibited by the ethical restraints of truthful advertising, the proponents of questionable health practices use language in misleading ways. George Orwell's fictional book 1984 popularized the term doublespeak, which referred to language used to manipulate people's minds. As explained by William Lutz, editor of the Quarterly Journal of Doublespeak: Doublespeak is language that pretends to communicate but does not, that makes the bad seem good, the repulsive appear attractive or at least tolerable. It is language that avoids, shifts, or denies responsibility, language at variance with its real or purported meaning. Basic to doublespeak is incongruity; the incongruity between what is said, or left unsaid, and what is; between the word and the referent. It perverts the essential function of language, which is communication, in order to mislead, distort, deceive, circumvent. Doublespeak is the deliberate use of language as a weapon or tool . . . to achieve their ends at the expense of others [1]. Weasel words are used to lessen what may appear to have been promised. The term is derived from the weasel's habit of sucking the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell superficially intact. Carl Wrighter, an expert in the deceptive tactics used in advertising, wrote: Weasel word[s] [have] become more than just an evasion or retreat. They can make you hear things that are not being said, accept as truths things that have only been implied, and believe things that have only been suggested. When you hear a weasel word, you automatically hear the implication. Not the real meaning, but the meaning it wants you to hear.\" [2] An example would be the word \"may\" when claiming that something may help you. Promotional Buzzwords Promoters of \"alternative\", \"complementary,\" \"holistic\" and \"natural\" medicine would like people to believe that their approaches are equal or superior to that of standard medicine. They are not. \"Alternative Medicine.\" An alternative is a proposition or situation offering a choice between two or more things. Modern health care abounds with choices that are equivalent or nearly equivalent in value. It is the duty of responsible health care providers to fully inform patients about the benefits and risks of each. In order to do so, reliable information must be available on the safety and effectiveness of each alternative. Proponents of \"alternative\" health methods imply that they are equivalent or superior to proven methods. But they are not. So-called \"alternative therapies\" are defined by what they are not. They are not part of standard health care. They lack scientific evidence of safety and/or efficacy and often lack a scientifically plausible basis. Yet they are promoted for use instead of science-based care. The alternatives to proven safety and effectiveness are unproven, unsafe, and/or ineffective. Such are not true alternatives. To avoid obscuring the realities of the situation, the term \"alternative medicine\" should be placed in quotation marks. \"Alternative medicine\" proponents object to meeting the standards of consumer-protection law (i.e., the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act), claiming that the science-based regulatory process impedes medical progress. In 1987, the proponents of \"alternative\" cancer therapies clamored for a government investigation that would define a different standard of proof that they could meet. They wished to have testimonials from satisfied customers and marketplace demand accepted as proof that their remedies had value. However, after an extensive investigation, in its 1990 report, the Office of Technology Assessment stated: Regardless of the nature of the treatment . . . it is as true for unconventional as it is for mainstream treatments that in the final analysis, except for those extraordinary treatments whose effects are dramatic, gathering empirical data from clinical trials in cancer patients using valid, rigorous methods is the only means currently available for determining whether a treatment is likely to be of value to cancer patients [3]. Many quacks assert that a \"medical monopoly\" enables organized medicine and/or drug companies to suppress \"alternative\" procedures that are not profitable for the medical profession. But no such monopoly exists. The Sherman Antitrust Act is the cornerstone of United States law against monopolies. Like other business laws, it was enacted to assure fair competition in the marketplace. In health care, enough providers are available to consumers to allow for a measure of marketplace competition. Practicing medicine is not a right but a privilege which, like being licensed to pilot airliners, is granted only to people who can be trusted with people's lives. Both competence and trustworthiness are essential. Positing incompetent or untrustworthy practitioners, or worthless or unproven therapies, as suitable competitors to standard health care is perverse. It is the \"alternative\" medicine promoters who violate business law by engaging in the unfair competition of making claims, such as being able to cure AIDS, cancer, MS, etc. that no ethical provider would make. \"Complementary Medicine.\" Stung by instances in which patients have been lured from life-saving therapy, some promoters of quackery have abandoned the label of \"alternative\" medicine in favor of the more benign-sounding term, \"complementary\" medicine. \"Complementary\" practitioners claim to combine standard and alternative methods to make their approach more complete. However, adding ineffective methods to proven ones does not increase effectiveness. It increases the cost and may make it difficult for patients to differentiate between the effects of standard and questionable treatments. Moreover, many practitioners who label themselves complementary don't provide standard treatment or administer it poorly. They may also employ a \"heads-I-win, tails-you-lose\" strategy in which they claim credit for any positive effects experienced by the patient, and assign blame for any negative effect to the standard treatments. The result may undermine the patient's confidence in standard treatments, reduce compliance with standard care, or lead the patient to abandon standard care altogether. \"Holistic Medicine.\" The word \"holistic\" was coined in 1926 by Jan Christiaan Smuts, philosopher and first prime minister of South Africa, in his book, Holism and Evolution. Smuts observed that objects have properties that cannot be predicted from mere knowledge of their parts. Early advocates of \"holistic medicine\" (sometimes called \"wholistic medicine\") asserted that illnesses should not be studied apart from the people who have them and their social and environmental situations. Medical attention should therefore not be limited to current physical problems but should also be directed toward emotional factors and lifestyles. Good physicians have always tried to understand their patients as whole beings. Unfortunately, since the the 1980s, use of the holistic label has been dominated by nonstandard health-care providers [4], Harold Y. Vanderpool, Ph.D., noted \"holistic hodgepodge\" included methods \"derived from ancient cosmologies, such as Chinese Medicine, and unconventional therapies and approaches to diagnosis that have generated little research and seem patently outlandish.\" [5] Victor Herbert, M.D., J.D., has characterized their approach \"a melange of banalities, truisms, exaggerations, and falsehoods, overlaid with disparagement of not only scientific conclusions but of logical reason itself.\" [6] \"Natural Medicine\" Naturopaths and many other offbeat practitioners describe their practice as \"natural medicine,\" which they assert is safer than treatment with drugs that they assert are artificial or toxic. These words are used to suggest that there are no unpleasant side-effects. such as the hair-loss, nausea, and discomfort associated with some proven cancer therapies. Although many drugs have side effects, drugs will not be FDA-approved unless there is good evidence that their potential benefits exceed their possible risks. Moreover, some questionable remedies have their own side-effects without the established benefits of proven therapies. In the case of the quack cancer remedy laetrile, the term \"non-toxic\" was especially misplaced because laetrile contains naturally-occurring cyanide, which was responsible for the poisoning deaths of cancer patients. Despite their deceptive nature, the words \"natural\" and \"non-toxic\" fool a lot of people. Barrie Cassileth, Ph.D. and colleagues found that the most frequently given response from patients when asked what attracted them to questionable remedies was the allegedly natural, non-toxic qualities of \"unorthodox therapies.\" [7] Mischaracterizations of Standard Medicine Standard medical practices are often referred to as allopathic, conventional, orthodox, traditional, and Western. Each of these characterizations has considerable potential to mislead. \"Allopathy.\" The term allopathy was coined by homeopathy's founder, Samuel Hahnemann during his crusade against the medicine of his day (circa 1810). He derived the word from allos meaning \"other,\" and pathos meaning \"suffering\" and advised giving remedies that would elicit symptoms opposite to those of the patient. Treating symptoms with opposites is based upon the \"humoral theory,\" a concept founded upon ancient Greek cosmology in which disease was thought to be due to an imbalance of humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) and conditions of the body (hot, cold, wet, and dry) and fever was believed to be due to excessive blood because patients were hot and flush. To balance these symptoms, patients were bled. Other \"humoral imbalances\" were treated by purging, puking, and/or blistering. Although a few modern treatments can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale\u2014such as giving a constipating medication for diarrhea\u2014scientific medicine has never been based upon allopathy. A second dictionary meaning for allopathy is: \"A system of medical practice making use of all measures proved of value in the treatment of disease.\" This alternate definition fits standard medicine but is unrelated to the roots of the original term. \"Alternative\" health-care providers label standard medicine \"allopathy\" to make it appear that standard medicine is based upon an ideological principle rather than science. In reality, medicine is pragmatic in that it concerns itself with what works. Some of the confusion about the use of \"allopathy\" as a reference to standard medicine may be due to the fact that Hippocrates, who spawned the humoral theory of disease, is called \"the father of scientific medicine\" and physicians swear to the Hippocratic Oath as their standard of conduct. However, Hippocrates is not called the father of scientific medicine because he originated the humoral theory. It is because he established the concept that diseases are due to natural rather than supernatural causes. He also coined the term physician, derived from, the Greek word for \"nature\" (physikos) to connote that doctors were to perceive diseases as natural phenomena, not as actions of the gods. \"Orthodox\" versus \"Unorthodox\" Medicine. Orthodox literally means \"straight doctrine.\" The term is borrowed from religions where beliefs are supported only by authority. Many promoters of questionable methods wish to portray themselves as victims of an authoritarian power structure rather than promoters of schemes that fail to meet the basic standards of health science. Quacks commonly use the Galileo ploy in which they claim to be misunderstood, persecuted innovators as was Galileo. Galileo was placed under house arrest by church authorities for asserting that the earth was not the center of the universe. In the classic tale, the priests refused to look at the evidence in the telescope. The world has changed since Galileo's time. Today, any serious scientific claim can get a fair hearing in some scientific forum. However, those who seek scientific credibility must be willing to meet scientific standards, and scientific forums are arenas of analytical debate, demonstration of evidence, and skepticism (in the tradition of the Greek word skeptomai, which meant to \"look at something carefully\" and \"examine\" and \"consider\" it). \"Conventional\" versus \"Innovative\" Medicine. Conventional is a synonym to \"orthodox\" but connotes a lack of innovation. It was the term chosen by the OTA as an \"imperfect descriptor\" for approved methods of cancer management [3]. Some proponents of unapproved drugs and devices and unregulated medical care, use the term \"innovative medicine\" to sanitize their practices. The Foundation for the Advancement of Innovative Medicine (FAIM) , established in 1989 \"as a voice for innovative medicine's professionals, physicians, patients and suppliers\" described itself this way: This foundation defines innovative medicine as a treatment or therapy of empirical clinical benefit that is yet outside the mainstream of conventional medicine. Innovative medicine is complementary to conventional medicine, offering alternatives as an individual situation may warrant. FAIM's first goal is the development of a membership to serve as both a forum for exchange and a constituency for change. The second is to educate both those within the field and the general public as to the benefits and issues of innovative medicine. This activity includes the collection of statistical data with which to advocate our position. The third goal is to secure freedom of choice and guaranteed reimbursement for the patients; be it through legislation, litigation or negotiation with state and insurance agencies. And, lastly, in laying the groundwork for a climate receptive to medical innovation, we encourage the\u00b7 research and development of promising new approaches. We firmly believe in the value of innovative medicine. We firmly believe in the freedom of individuals to make educated choices regarding their health and well-being. Please add your voice to ours and help ensure freedom of choice in health care [8]. Standard medical practice allows for responsible innovation. Physicians are permitted to use drugs and devices for purposes for which they have not been approved. They may apply to the FDA for permission to use an investigational new drug or device. Surgeons regularly undertake innovative procedures in their craft, but responsible practitioners do so with the oversight of competent peer review. FAIM advocated freedom from the responsibility of peer review and accountability for its practitioners. A substantial number its leaders had past histories of promoting questionable health care. In 1991, the Life Extension Foundation, a dietary supplement sales company, published a directory of \"innovative medical clinics.\" The book was dominated by notorious promoters of questionable cancer therapies. Here again the term innovation was employed to disguise the dubious nature of these clinics. \"Traditional\" versus \"Nontraditional\" Medicine. Many health writers to refer to standard medicine as \"traditional\" and that which is outside of the mainstream as \"nontraditional.\" But standard reference sources identify \"traditional medicine\" as 'folk medicine and define tradition as: 1: The handing down of information, beliefs and customs by word of mouth or by example from one generation to another without written instruction; 2: an inherited pattern of thought or action (as a religious practice or social custom; 3: cultural continuity in social attitudes and institutions.\" Promoters of nonstandard health care call standard medicine \"traditional\" in order to imply that it is staid, closedminded, authoritarian, and elitist (established by privilege rather than merit). In reality, many quack treatments are rooted in ancient concepts that underlie folk medicine. Among them are diet cures, herbalism, faith healing, mind cures, and metaphysical \"vitalistic\" notions inherent in ayurvedic medicine, Chinese medicine, New Age therapies, chiropractic, and homeopathy. Unlike traditional medicine, science-based medicine is iconoclastic: \"tending to produce iconoclasm or overthrow what is established. (the influence of modern science).\" \"Western\" versus \"Eastern\" Science or Medicine. Some critics of science claim that scientific facts can vary from culture to culture and that asserting that one way of knowing is superior to another is akin to racism. The realities are that physical laws, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, and determinations of clinical safety and effectiveness are not bound by east-west dichotomies. Further, fanciful metaphysical healing systems are not limited to eastern cultures. Homeopathy's vital force, herbalism's Doctrine of Signatures and chiropractic's Innate are as mystical as prana in India or Chinese medicine's chi. Those who espouse the \"western\" versus \"eastern\" science or medicine dichotomy usually compare healing practices based upon prescientific cosmologies with science-based medicine. Here again, prescientific cultures of the west differed little from those of the east in their fanciful cosmologies and magical beliefs. It is also demeaning to imply that eastern cultures have made no contribution to the scientific process. Mesopotamia, India, and China are acknowledged by historians to have made significant contributions to the development of medical science. The word chemistry derived from alchemy, which was transliterated from Kim-Iya, the Chinese name for the alleged herbs of immortality. The alchemists' search for the elixir vitae was rooted in the theories that \"like makes like\" and the notion of a \"life force.\" [9] Vitalism is rooted in monism: \"The view that reality is one unitary organic whole with no independent parts.\" Monism is the basis for practically all ancient cosmologies. Fundamental to monism, are the concepts that \"like \"like makes like,\" and \"like cures like.\" Monism pervaded the ancient world, and provides the basis for primitive belief systems. Monism provides the basis for ancient idolatry. A carved idol is believed to actually become a god once it takes on its likeness. The Biblical third commandment made it a sin to create idols by making such likenesses. Ancient astrologers named the red planet Mars after the god of war because war sheds blood which is red. Animism, a belief in ethereal spirits, which is found in all primitive cosmologies is also rooted in monism: The first assumption of most animists is that reality is all of one piece. That is to say, there is not the same water-tight distinction between human beings and animals, or between animate and inanimate existence. Animals may be ancestors of people, people may change into animals, trees and stones may possess souls, and the mana of a stick may be transferred to man. In fact, in some groups, almost every object is the universe is viewed as possessing some amount of life force\u2014the spiritual, nonmaterial substance without which nothing could exist and that in reality is its true character and secret of its power. This life force, or soul-stuff, exists in greater concentrations in famous men, strong charms, revered fetishes, and powerful gods. In essence, the force is the same everywhere, it is only distributed in different quantities [10]. Remnants of monism can still be seen today. For example, the notion \"you are what you eat\" can be traced to monist animism, and practices such as eating the heart of a tiger for courage, goat genitals or rhino horn (a phallic symbol) for virility. Toward More Accurate Terminology The National Council Against Health Fraud has categorized three problems obscured by the use of doublespeak and weasel words: health misinformation, fraud, and quackery. - Health misinformation is \"untrue or misleading information,\" including erroneous folk beliefs. Marketing research reveals that many people hold health and nutrition misconceptions. These are exploited not only by quacks but even by mainstream advertising. Deeply held misbeliefs can lead to needless injury and death. - Fraud is best defined as \"an intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing another in reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing.\" Not all health-related frauds involve quackery. Billing for medical services not actually rendered is a common example. And not all quackery involves deliberate intent. Some promoters believe that their nostrums are therapeutic. - Quackery is the practices and pretentions of a quack; a quack is \"anyone who promotes medical schemes or remedies known to be false, or which are unproven, for a profit.\" The term can also be applied to products that are promoted with false claims. It is important to distinguish between the use and the promotion of false and unproven practices. Legitimate practitioners sometimes employ placebos; clinical medicine allows for a certain amount of innovation (e.g., off-label use of a drug approved for another purpose) in patient care; and experimental medicine tests unproven procedures as part of medical progress. However, legitimate providers do not promote false or unproven methods in the marketplace as \"alternatives\" or \"complementary\" to approved therapies. Promote means: \"to contribute to the growth or prosperity of; to present for public acceptance through advertising and publicity.\" Advertising is recognizable commercial messages clearly intended to sell something. Publicity involves communications protected as free speech. The latter is widely abused when promotions are disguised as health information. Journalists have a word for the abuses of publicity agents: flackery. The word's origins are obscure, but it may be from flak, the bursting shells of anti-aircraft guns. Flackery is the actions of a flack. A flack is one who provides publicity; a press agent. Quack is short for \"quacksalver,\" meaning literally to quack \"like a duck about his 'salves' and remedies.\" The duck symbolizes quackery because it makes a lot of noise about nothing. It is the promotion of false and unproven methods that causes consumers to buy them. Quacks may be placed into three general categories: charlatans, cranks, or health hucksters. Charlatans are deliberate fakers. Cranks are delusional people who sincerely believe in themselves and their nostrums. Health hucksters are businesspeople who idealize entrepreneurism and who are merely exploiting opportunities offered by the public's interest in health. Stripped of the terms used by the purveyors of quackery to sanitize their nostrums, some may feel at a loss for words to describe their subjects. Here are some suggestions: - British writers often use regular and irregular medicine as differentiating terms. - Standard medicine is a useful term because it implies a standard of practice which is commonly used in legal affairs in which a practitioner may have violated the standard of practice for his/her community. - Mainstream medicine is also an unambiguous descriptor. - Biomedicine is sometimes used to refer to modem medicine founded upon the biological sciences. - Responsible and irresponsible medicine are useful if a writer wants to portray the concept of a willingness versus an unwillingness to be accountable for behavior. - The words allopathic, conventional, orthodox, and traditional should not be used to describe standard medicine because they suggest that standard practice is ideologically driven, authoritarian, rigid, or outdated rather than steadily improving due to scientific discovery. - Approved or unapproved may be used to describe drugs subject to regulation under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. - The American Cancer Society replaced unproven with questionable as its descriptor of methods \"not deemed to have real evidence of value.\" [11] Dubious is a better word to use when there is strong doubt. about the truthfulness of health-related claims. - The words alternative, complementary, integrative, holistic, and natural should be regarded as misleading marketing terms rather than categories of health-related practice. It is best to either avoid their use or place them in quotation marks to indicate that they are problematic. When discussing controversial health issues, we should use the most accurate terminology possible. It is clear that the promoters of quackery have become highly skilled at distorting language to deceive the public. Unfortunately, journalists and educators do not seem to be aware of or care about the significance of the words they use to report on nonscientific health care. Health professionals should not allow themselves to become ensnared by the anti-scientific-medicine semantics used by promoters of quackery. Editor's Note [William T. Jarvis, Ph.D.](https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/quack-busters-leader-william-jarvis-dies-at-eighty/) (1935-2016) was a professor of health promotion and education at the Loma Linda University School of Public Health and founded and served for many years as president of [The National Council Against Health Fraud](https://quackwatch.org/ncahf/). The above article is based on essays on the semantics of quackery that he wrote in 1993 and revised in 1994 and 1995. Since that time, significant developments in the semantics of quackery have occurred. The NIH Office of Alternative Medicine became the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which then was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Quackery isn't just practiced outside of mainstream medicine; it's now significantly promoted as \"integrative medicine\" within U.S. mainstream medicine. Edzard Ernst, M.D., Ph.D. has [expressed alarm](https://quackwatch.org/related/altwary/) about the infiltration of \"integrative medicine\" into academic medical centers and described \"integrative medicine\" as \"a smokescreen behind which enthusiasts of dubious practices try to incorporate their unproven therapies into routine health care.\" [12] Dr. Jarvis's concern about complementary methods undermining standard care was supported by data from the National Cancer Database which showed that people with curable cancers who had complementary care tended to use less standard care and died sooner as a result [13]. \u2014 William M.
