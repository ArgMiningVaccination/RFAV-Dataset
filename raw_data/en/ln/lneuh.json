(a) These g uides set forth the F ederal Tra de Commissi on's cur rent view s about environmental claims. The guides help marketers avoid making environmental marketing claims that are unfair or dece ptive under Sec tion 5 of the FTC Ac t, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45. They do not confe r2any rights on any person a nd do not opera te to bind the FTC or the public. The Commission, however, can take action under the FTC A ct if a marketer makes an environmental claim inconsistent with the guide s. In any such enf orcement action, the Commission m ust prove that the challenged act or practice is unfair or deceptive in violation of Section 5 of the FTC A ct. (b) These guides do not preempt federal, state, or local laws. Co mpliance with those laws, however, will not necessarily preclude Com mission law enforcement action under the FTC A ct. (c) These g uides apply to claims about the environme ntal attributes of a product, pa ckage, or service in connection with the marketing, offering for sale, or sale of such item or service to individuals. These guides also apply to business-to-business transactions. The guides apply to environmenta l claims in labeling , adver tising, promotional mater ials, and all other f orms of marketing in any medium, w hether asserted directly or by implication, through words, symbols, logos, depictions, product brand names, or any other means. (d) The g uides consist of g eneral principles, spe cific g uidance on the use of pa rticular environmenta l claims, and examples. Claims may raise issues tha t are addre ssed by more than one example and in more than one se ction of the g uides. The e xamples provide the Commi ssion's views on how re asonable consumers likely interpre t certain claims. The g uides are based on ma rketing to a g eneral audienc e. Howe ver, w hen a ma rkete r targ ets a pa rticular segment of consumer s, the Commis sion will ex amine how r easona ble member s of that g roup interpre t the adver tisement. Whether a pa rticular c laim is deceptive w ill depend on the net impression of the adve rtisement, label, or other promotional mater ial at issue. I n addition, althoug h many examples present spec ific cla ims and options for qualify ing c laims, the examples do not illus trate a ll permissible claims or qualifica tions under Section 5 of the F TC Act. Nor do they illust rate the only way s to comply with the g uides. Marke ters ca n use an a lternative3approa ch if the a pproac h satisfies the re quirements of Sec tion 5 of the FTC Ac t. All ex amples assume that the described claims otherwise comply with Section 5. Wh ere particularly useful, the Guides incorporate a reminder to this effect. \u00a7 260.2 Interpretation and Subs tantiation of Env ironm ental arketing C laims. of Act prohibits dece acts ctice de ceptive if it is l ikely to misl ead c onsumers ac ting reasonably under the circumstances a nd is material to consumer s' dec isions. S ee FTC Poli cy Statement on Dec eption, 103 FTC 174 (1983) . To deter mine if an a dvertisement is dec eptive, marketers mus t identify all express and implied claims that the advertisement reasonably conveys. Marketers mus t ensure that all reasonable interpretations of their claims are truthful, not misl eading , and supported by a reasonable basis befor e they make the c laims. See FTC Policy Statement Reg arding Adver tising Substantiation, 104 FTC 839 (1984). I n the context of environmental marketing claims, a reasonable basis often requires competent and reliable scientific e vidence . Such evidenc e consists of tests, ana lyses, re search, or studies that ha ve bee n conducte d and eva luated in an objec tive manner by qualified pe rsons and a re generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results. Such evidence should be sufficient in quality and quantity based on standa rds g enerally accepted in the r eleva nt scientific fie lds, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, to substantiate that eac h of the mar keting claims is true. \u00a7 260.3 General Principles. The following general principles a pply to all environmental mar keting claims, including those described in \u00a7\u00a7 260.4 - 16. Claims should comport with all relevant provisions of these guides.4(a) Quali fications and d ptive claims, qualifica tions and disclosures should be c lear, prominent, and unde rstandable . To make disclosure s clea r and prominent, marke ters should use plain lang uage and suf ficiently large type, should place disclosures in close pr oximity to the qualified c laim, and should avoid making inconsistent statements or using distracting elements that c ould underc ut or contra dict the disclosure. (b) Distinction between benef its of p roduct, package, and service : Unless it is clear f rom the context, an environmental marketing claim should specify whether it refers to the product, the product's packaging, a service, or just to a portion of the product, package, or service. In general, if the e nvironmental attribute a pplies to all but mi nor, incidenta l components of a product or pa ckage, the mar keter need not qua lify the claim to identify that fac t. Howeve r, there may be exceptions to this gene ral princ iple. For example, if a marke ter make s an unqualified recyclable claim, and the presence of the incidental component significantly limits the ability to recycle the pr oduct, the cla im would be dece ptive. Exam ple 1 : A plastic pac kage conta ining a new showe r curtain is labeled \" recyclable\" without further e labora tion. Bec ause the context of the claim does not make c lear whether it refe rs to the plastic pac kage or the shower c urtain, the c laim is deceptive if a ny part of e ither the pa ckage or the curta in, other than minor, incidenta l components, ca nnot be re cycled. Exam ple 2 : A soft drink bottle is labeled \"r ecycled.\" The bottle is made e ntirely from recycled mate rials, but the bottle cap is not. B ecause the bottle ca p is a minor, incidental component of the packa ge, the c laim is not deceptive. 5(c) Overstat ement of environme ntal attribute : An environmental marketing claim should not overstate, directly or by implication, an environmental attribute or benefit. M arketers should not state or imply environmenta l benef its if the benef its are ne gligible. Exam ple 1 : An are a rug is labeled \" 50% more r ecycled c ontent than bef ore.\" of rug from 2% r ecycled f iber to 3%. Although the claim is technica lly true, it likely convey s the false impression that the manufa cture r has incr eased signific antly the use of r ecycled f iber. Exam ple 2 : A trash bag is labeled \"recyclable\" without qualification. Because trash bags ordinarily are not separa ted from other trash at the la ndfill or incinera tor for recycling, they are highly unlikely to be used again for any purpose. Even if the bag is technica lly capa ble of be ing recycled, the c laim is deceptive since it asserts an environmental benefit where no meaningful benefit exists. (d) Comparative claims: Co mparative environmental marketing claims should be clear to avoid consumer confusion about the c omparison. Marke ters should have substantiation for the compar ison. Exam ple 1 : An adver tiser notes that its gla ss bathroom tiles contain \"20% more recycled content.\" Depending on the context, th e claim could be a comparison either to the adve rtiser's immediate ly prec eding product or to pr oducts. tiser should have substantiation for both interpreta tions. Otherwise, the a dvertiser should make the ba sis for compar ison clear , for e xample, by saying \" 20% more r ecycled content than our previous bathr oom tiles.\" Exam ple 2 : An adver tiser claims that \"our plastic diaper liner has the most re cycled content.\" T he diape r liner ha s more cycled c ontent, calc ulated as a perc entag e of6weight, than any other on the market, although it is still well under 100%. The claim likely convey s that the product c ontains a sig nificant pe nificantly more re cycled c ontent than its competitors. I f the a dvertiser cannot substantiate these me ssages, the c laim would be dec eptive. Exam ple 3 : An adver tiser claims that its packa ging c reates \"less wa ste than the lea ding national bra nd.\" The adver tiser implemented the sourc e reduction sever al years ago and supported the c laim by calculating the relative solid waste contributions of the two packa ges. The a dvertiser should have substantiation that the compa rison rema ins accurate . Exam ple 4 : A product is advertised as \"environmentally preferable.\" This claim likely conveys that the product is environmentally superior to other products. Because it is highly unlikely that the marketer can substantiate the messages conveyed by this statement, this claim is dece ptive. The c laim would not be dece ptive if the marke ter accompanied it with clear and prominent language limiting the environmental superiority representa tion to the particular a ttributes for which the marke ter ha s substantiation, provided the a dvertisement' s context does not im ply other de ceptive c laims. For example, the claim \"Environme ntally preferable: 50% r ecycled c ontent compar ed to 20% for the leading brand\" would not be dec eptive. \u00a7 260.4 General Environmental Benefit Claims. (a) It is deceptive to misrepr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that a product, pa ckage, or service offers a g eneral environme ntal benef it. (b) Unqualified general environmental benefit claims are difficult to interpret and likely convey a wide range of meanings. In ma ny cases, such claims likely convey that the product,7packa ge, or se rvice has spec ific and f ar-reaching environmenta l benef its and may convey that the item or ser vice ha s no neg ative envir onmental impact. B ecause it is highly unlikely that marke ters ca n substantiate all re asonable interpre tations of these c laims, marketer s should not make unqualified general environmental benefit claims. (c) Marke ters ca n qualify general environme ntal benef it claims to prevent dec eption about the nature of the environmental benefit being asserted. To avoid deception, marketers should use clear and prominent qualifying language that limits the claim to a specific benefit or benefits. Marke ters should not imply that any specific benef it is si gnificant if it is, in fact, ne gligible. I f a qualified general claim conveys that a product is more environmentally beneficial overall because of the pa rticular touted be nefit(s), ma rkete rs should analy ze trade- offs re sulting fr om the benefit(s) to determine if they can substantiate this claim. (d) Even if a marketer explains, and has substantiation for, the product's specific environmenta l attributes, this ex planation will not adequate ly qualify a general environme ntal benef it claim if the adve rtisement implies deceptive c laims. There fore, marke ters should ensure that the advertisement's context doe s not imply deceptive environmental claims. Exam ple 1 : The bra nd name \" Eco-f riendly \" likely convey s that the product ha s far- reaching environmenta l benef its and may convey that the produc t has no neg ative environmental impact. Because it is highly unlikely that the marketer can substantiate these claims, the use of such a brand name is deceptive. A claim, such as \"Eco-friendly: made with recycled ma terials,\" would not be deceptive if: (1) the statement \"made with recycled mate rials\" is cle ar and prominent; (2) the ma rkete r can substantiate that the entire pr oduct or pa ckage, excluding minor, inc idental components, is made f rom recycled mate rial; (3) ma king the product with re cycled mate rials makes the product8more e all; and (4) the adver tisement's context does not imply other deceptive claims. Exam ple 2 : A marke ter states tha t its packag ing is now \" Greener than our pre vious packa ging.\" The pa ckaging w eighs 15% less than pre vious packa ging, but it is not recyclable nor has it been improve d in any other mate rial re spect. The claim is dece ptive because re asonable consumers likely would interpre t \"Gre ener\" in this context to mean that other sig nificant e nvironmental aspe cts of the pa ckaging a lso are improve d over previous packaging. A c laim stating \"G reener than our previous packaging\" accompanied by clear and pr ominent lang uage such a s, \"We've r educe d the weig ht of our by 15%,\" w ould not be dece that the icial over all and the advertisement's context doe s not imply other deceptive claims. Exam ple 3 : A marke ter's a dvertisement f eatur es a pic ture of a laser pr inter in a bird' s nest balanc ing on a tree branc h, surrounde d by a dense forest. In green type, the marke ter states, \" Buy our printer . Make a chang e.\" A lthough the a dvertisement doe s not expressly claim that the product has environmental benefits, the featured images, in combination with the text , likely convey that the produc t has far -reaching environmenta l benef its and may convey that the produc t has no neg ative envir onmental impact. Because it is highly unlikely that the marketer can substantiate these claims, this adver tisement is deceptive. Exam ple 4 : A manufacturer's website states, \"Eco-smart gas-powered lawn mow er fficie ncy 1/10 of a percent. Althoug h the manufa cture r's claim that it has improved its fuel eff iciency9technica lly is true, it likely convey s the false impression that the manufa cture r has significantly increased the mower's fuel efficiency. Exam ple 5 : A marketer reduces the weight of its plastic beverage bottles. The bottles' labels state: \"E nvironmentally -friendly improvement. n our pre vious packa ging.\" The plastic bottles ar e 25 per cent lig hter but otherw ise are no differ ent. The advertisement conveys that the bottles are more environmentally beneficial overall because of the sour ce reduction. To substantiate this claim, the mar keter likely can analyze the impacts of the source reduction without evaluating environmental impacts throug hout the packa ging's life cy cle. I f, howe ver, ma nufac turing the new bottles signific antly alters e nvironmental attributes e arlier or later in the bottles' life cy cle, i.e., manufa cturing the bottles require s more ene rgy or a diff erent kind of plastic, then a more compre hensive a nalysis may be appr opriate. \u00a7 260.5 Carbon O ffsets. (a) Given the complexities of carbon offsets, sellers should employ competent and reliable scientific a nd acc ounting methods to prope rly quantify claimed e mission reductions and to ensure that they do not sell the same re duction more than one time. (b) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a carbon offset represents emission reductions that have already occurred or will occur in the imm ediate future. To avoid deception, marketers should clearly and prominently disclose if the carbon offset represents emission reductions that will not occur f or two y ears or long er. (c) It is deceptive to c laim, directly or by implication, that a car bon offse t repre sents an emission reduction if the r eduction, or the activity that cause d the re duction, was re quired by law. The examp les in this section assume that the certifiers' endorsements meet the criteria1 provided in the Expert Endorseme nts (255.3) and Endor sements by Organizations (255.4) sections of the Endorsement Guides. 10Exam ple 1 : On its website, an online travel agency invites consumers to purchase offse ts to \"neutralize the ca rbon emissions from y our flig ht.\" The pr oceeds from the offse t sales fund futur e proje cts that will not reduce greenhouse g as emissions for two years. The cla im likely convey s that the emission reductions either already have occurred or will occur in the near future. Therefore, the advertisement is deceptive. It would not be dec eptive if the a gency's website state d \"Of fset the c arbon e missions from your flig ht by funding new pr ojects that will beg in reduc ing e missions in two y ears.\" Exam ple 2 : An offset provider claims that its product \"will offset your own 'dirty' driving habits.\" The of fset is based on me thane c apture at a landf ill facility . State law requires this facility to capture all methane emitted from the landfill. The claim is deceptive beca use the e mission reduction would have oc curred re gardle ss of whethe r consumers purchased the offsets. \u00a7 260.6 Certifications and Se als of A pproval. (a) It is deceptive to misrepr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that a product, pa ckage, or service has been endorsed or certified by an independent third party. (b) A marke ter's use of the na me, log o, or sea l of approva l of a third-pa rty certifier or organization may be an e ndorsement, whic h should meet the cr iteria for endorse ments provided in the FTC's Endor sement Guides, 16 C.F .R. Part 255, including De finitions (\u00a7 255.0), Materia l Connections (\u00a7 255.5).111(c) Third-pa rty certification does not eliminate a ma rkete r's oblig ation to ensure tha t it has substantiation for all claims re asonably communicated by the ce rtification. (d) A marke ter's use of an e nvironmental ce rtification or se al of a pproval likely convey s that the produc t offer s a general environme ntal benef it (see \u00a7 260.4) if the ce rtification or se al does not convey the basis for the certification or sea l, either throug h the name or some other mea ns. Because it is highly unlikely that marketers can substantiate general environmental benefit claims, marke ters should not use environme ntal cer tifications or sea ls that do not convey the basis for the c ertifica tion. (e) Marke ters ca n qualify general environme benef it claims convey ed by environmenta l certifications and sea ls of approva l to prevent de ception about the na ture of the environmenta l benef it being a sserted. To a void dece ption, marketer s should use clea r and pr ominent qualify ing language that cle arly convey s that the ce rtification or se al refers only to specific a nd limit ed benefits. Exam ple 1 : An adver tisement for pa int feature s a \"G reenLogo\" sea l and the stateme nt \"GreenLogo for Environmental Excellence.\" This advertisement likely conveys that: (1) the GreenLogo seal is awarded by an independent, third-party certifier with appropr iate expertise in eva luating the environmenta l attributes of paint; and (2) the product ha s far-reaching environmenta l benef its. I f the pa int manufac turer a warded the seal to its own no independe nt, third-party rds, the cla im would be dece ptive. The c laim would not be deceptive if the marketer accompanied the seal with clear and prominent language: (1) indica ting that the ma rkete r awarded the Gre enLogo seal to its own product; and ( 2) clearly conveying that the award refers only to specific and limited benefits. Voluntary consensus standa rd bodies ar e \"or ganizations which plan, deve lop, establish,2 or . . A voluntary consensus standa rds body is defined by the following attributes: (i) openne ss, (ii) balanc e of interest, (iii) due pr ocess, ( iv) an a ppeals proc ess, (v) c onsensus, which is def ined g eneral agreement, but not necessa rily unanimity , and includes a proce ss for attempting to resolve objections by interested pa rties, as long as all comments have been f airly considere d, eac h objector is advise d of the disposition of his or her objec tion(s) and the r easons why , and the consensus membe rs are given an oppor tunity to chang e their vote s after revie wing the comments.\" Memor andum for H eads of Executive D epartments and Ag encie s on Fe deral Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Con sensus Assessment Activities, Februar y 10, 1998, Circular N o. A-119 Revised, O ffice of Mana gement and B udget at www.whitehouse .gov/omb/circulars_a 119. 12Exam ple 2 : A manufacturer advertises its product as \"certified by the American Institute of De gradable Mater ials.\" B ecause the a dvertisement doe s not mention that the Americ an Institut e of D egradable Mater ials (\"AI DM\") is a n industry trade association, the ce rtification likely convey s that it was awa rded by an indepe ndent ce rtifier. To be certified, marketers must meet standards that have been developed and maintained by a voluntary consensus standa rd body . An independe nt auditor applies these standards2 objectively. This advertisement likely is not deceptive if the manufacturer complies with \u00a7 260.8 of the Guide s (Deg radable Claims) beca c ertifica tion on independe ntly-deve loped and - maintained standa rds and a n independe nt auditor applies the standards objectively. Exam ple 3 : A product fe ature s a sea l of approva l from \"The Forest Products I ndustry Association,\" a n industry certifier with appr opriate e xpertise in eva luating the environmental attributes of paper products. Because it is clear from the certifier's name that the produc t has bee n cer tified by an industry certifier, the c ertifica tion likely does not convey that it was awa rded by an indepe ndent ce rtifier. The use of the se al likely is not deceptive provided that the advertisement does not imply other deceptive claims.13Exam ple 4 : A marke ter's pa ckage feature s a sea l of approva l with the tex t \"Certified Non-Toxic.\" The se al is awa rded by a certifier w ith appropriate expertise in evaluating ingredient saf ety and potential toxi city. It applies standar ds develope d by a voluntary consensus standa rd body . Although non- industry members c omprise a major ity of the certifier's boa rd, an industry veto could over ride a ny proposed c hang es to the standar ds. This cer tification likely convey s that the product is ce rtified by an indepe ndent organization. This claim would be dece ptive beca use industry members c an veto a ny proposed changes to the standards. Exam ple 5 : A marke ter's industry sales broc hure f or over head lig hting f eatur es a se al with the text \"EcoFriendly Building Association\" to show that the ma rkete r is a member of that organization. Although the lighting manufacturer is, in fact, a member, this association has not e valuated the environmenta l attributes of the mar keter 's produc t. This advertisement would be deceptive because it likely conveys that the EcoFriendly Building Association eva luated the pr oduct throug h testing or other objec tive standards. It also is likely to convey that the lighting has fa r-reaching e nvironmental bene fits. The use of the se al would not be dec eptive if the ma nufac turer a ccompa nies it with clear a nd prominent qualify ing la nguage: (1) indica ting that the se al refers to the company 's membership only and that the a ssociation did not evaluate the product's e nvironmental attributes; and (2) limiting the general environmental benefit representations, both express and implied, to the particular product a ttributes for which the marke ter ha s substantiation. For e xample, the mar keter could state: \"A lthough we are a member of the EcoFriendly Building Association, it has not evaluated this product. Our lighting is made f rom 100 perc ent re cycled meta l and uses ene rgy efficient L ED tec hnology .\"14Exam ple 6 : A product labe l contains an e nvironmental sea l, either in the for m of a g lobe icon or a globe icon with the text \"EarthSmart.\" Ea rthSmart is an independe nt, third- opriate e xpertise of produc ts. Whil e the mar keter meets Ear thSmart's standards f or reduced c hemical e missions during product usag e, the pr oduct has no other specific environmenta l benef its. Either seal likely convey s that the product ha s far-reaching environmenta l benef its, and that EarthSmart c ertified the product for all of these be nefits. I f the mar keter cannot substantiate these c laims, the use of the se al would be de ceptive. T he sea l would not be deceptive if the marketer accompanied it with clear and prominent language clearly convey ing tha t the cer tification ref ers only to specific a nd limit ed bene fits. For e xample, the marke ter could state next t o the g lobe icon: \"Ea rthSmart cer tifies that this product meets Ear thSmart standards for reduc ed che usag e.\" tively , the claim would not be de ceptive if the Ear thSmart environmental sea l itself stated: \"Ea rthSmart Certified for reduc ed che mical emissions during pr oduct usage.\" Exam ple 7 : A one-quart bottle of window cleaner features a seal with the text \"Environment Approved,\" granted by an independent, third-party certifier with appropr iate expertise. The certifier g rante d the sea l after evalua ting 35 e nvironmental attributes. This seal likely convey s that the product ha s far-reaching environmenta l benef its and that Environment Approve d cer tified the produc t for all of the se bene fits and there fore is likely dece ptive. The sea l would likely not be dec eptive if the ma rkete r accompanied it with clear and prominent lang uage clearly convey ing tha t the seal re fers only to specific and limited benefits. For examp le, the seal could state: \"Virtually all15products impact the environment. For details on which attributes we evaluated, go to [a website that discusses this produc t].\" The referenced e iled summa ry of the exami ned environmental attributes. A reference to a website is appropr iate bec ause the additional information provided on the website is not nece ssary to prevent the advertisement from be ing misleading. As always, the marketer also should ensure that the adve rtisement does not imply other de ceptive c laims, and that the certifier's criteria are sufficiently rigorous to substantiate all material claims reasonably communicated by the ce rtification. Exam ple 8 : Grea t Paper Company sells photocopy paper with packa ging tha t has a sea l of approval from the No Chlorine Products Association, a non-profit third-party association. Gr eat Pape r Company paid the No Chlorine Produc ts Association a reasonable fe e for the ce rtification. Consumers would re asonably expect that marke ters have to pa y for c ertifica tion. Theref ore, the re are no ma terial c onnections betwe en Gr eat Paper Company and the No Chlorine Produc ts Association. The cla im would not be deceptive. \u00a7 260.7 Compostable Claims. (a) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is compostable. (b) A marketer claiming that an item is compostable should have competent and reliable scientific evidence that all the materials in the item will break down into, or otherwise become part of, usa ble compost (e.g ., soil-conditioning mater ial, mulch) in a saf e and timely manner (i.e., in appr oximately the same time a s the materia ls with which it is compost ed) in a n appropr iate composting facility, or in a home c ompost pil e or de vice.16(c) A marke ter should clea rly and prominently qualify compostable c laims to the ex tent necessary to avoid dece ption if: (1) the item ca nnot be composted saf ely or in a timely manner in a home compost pile or de vice; or ( 2) the c laim misl eads r easona ble consumer s about the environmenta l benef it provided when the item is dispos ed of in a landfill. (d) To avoid dec eption about the limited availability of municipal or institutional composting facilities, a ma rkete r should clea rly and prominently qualify compostable c laims if such fac ilities are not available to a substantial majority of consumer s or communities where the item is sold. Exam ple 1 : A manufa cture r indicate s that its unbleached c offee filter is c ompostable. The unqua lified claim is not dece ptive, provided the ma nufac turer ha s substantiation that the filter can be converted safely to usable compost in a timely manner in a home compost pile or device . If so, the extent of local municipal or institutional composting facilities is irrelevant. Exam ple 2 : A garden center sells grass clipping bags labeled as \"Com postable in California Municipal Ya rd Trimming s Compost ing F acilities.\" When the ba gs brea k down, howeve r, they release toxins i nto the compost. The cla im is deceptive if the prese nce of these toxi ns preve nts the compost from being usable. Exam ple 3 : A manufa cture r make s an unqualified c laim that its packag e is compostable. Although municipa l or institut ional composting f acilities exist wher e the pr oduct is sold, the pac kage will not brea k down into usable compost in a home c ompost pil e or de vice. To avoid dec eption, the manufa cture r should clea rly and prominently disclose that the package is not suitable for home composting. Exam ple 4 : Nationally marke ted lawn a nd leaf bags state \"c ompostable\" on e ach ba g. The bags also feature text dis closing that the bag is not designed for use in home compost17piles. Yard tr immings prog rams in many communities compost these bag s, but such programs ar e not ava ilable to a substantial majority of consumer s or communities where the bag is sold. The claim is dece ptive beca use it likely convey s that composting facilities are available to a substantial majority of consumers or comm unities. To avoid deception, the marketer should clearly and prominently indicate the limited availability of such pr ograms. A mar keter could state \" Appropria te facilities may not exi st in y our area,\" or provide the a pproxi mate per centa ge of c ommuniti es or c onsumers for which such prog rams ar e ava ilable. Exam ple 5 : A manufa cture r sells a disposable dia per tha t states, \"This diaper can be composted if y our community is one of the 50 that ha ve composting facilities.\" The claim is not dece ptive if composting f acilities are available as cla imed and the manufacturer has substantiation that the diaper can be converted safely to usable compost in solid waste composting facilities. Exam ple 6 : A manufacturer markets yard trimmings bags only to consumers residing in particula r geographic areas ser ved by county yard trimming s composting pr ograms. The bags meet spec ifications for the se prog rams and a re labeled, \" Compostable Yard Trimmings B ag for County Composti ng Prog rams.\" T he cla im is not dece ptive. Because the bags are compostable where they are sold, a qualification is not needed to indicate the limited availability of composting facilities. \u00a7 260.8 Degradable Claims. (a) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or radable, oxo-deg radable, oxo- biodegradable, and photodegradable claims. (b) A marketer making an unqualified degradable claim should have competent and reliable scientific e vidence that the entire item will completely brea k down and r eturn to nature (i.e., decompose into elements found in nature ) within a re asonably short period of time a fter customary disposal. (c) It is deceptive to m ake an unqualified degradable claim for items entering the solid waste stream if the items do not completely decompose within one y ear after customar y disposal. Unqualified degradable claims for items that are customarily disposed in landfills, incinerators, and re cycling facilities are dec eptive bec ause the se loca tions do not present conditions in which complete de composition will occur within one y ear. (d) Degradable claims should be qualified clearly and prominently to the extent necessary to avoid dec eption about: (1) the pr oduct's or pa ckage's ability to deg rade in the environment wher e it is customarily disposed; and (2) the rate and extent of deg radation. Exam ple 1 : A marke ter advertises its trash bag s using a n unqualified \" degradable\" claim. The marketer relies on soil burial tests to show that the product will decompose in the presence of water and oxygen. Con sumers, however, place trash bags into the solid waste stre am, which c ustomarily terminates in inciner ation fac ilities or landf ills where they will not degr ade w ithin one y ear. The c laim is, therefor e, dec eptive. Exam ple 2 : A marke ter advertises a commerc ial ag ricultural plastic mulch f ilm with t he claim \"Photodegradable,\" and clearly and prominently qualifies the term with the phrase \"Will break down into small pieces if le ft uncove red in sunlig ht.\" The a dvertiser possesses compe tent and re liable scientific e vidence that within one y ear, the produc t The Guide s' trea tment of unqualified de gradable claims is intended to help pre vent3 deception and is not int ended to e stablish perfor mance standards to e nsure the de gradability of products whe n littered. 19will break down, after being expos ed to sunlight, into sufficiently small pieces to become part of the soil. Thus, the qualified claim is not dece ptive. Be cause the claim is qualified to indicate the limited extent of breakdow n, the adve rtiser ne ed not meet the c onsumer expectations for an unqualified photodegradable claim, i.e., that the product will not only break down, but also will decompose into eleme nts found in nature. Exam ple 3 : A marke ter advertises its shampoo as \"biode gradable\" without qualifica tion. The advertisement makes clear that only the shampoo, and not the bottle, is biodeg radable. The ma rkete r has c ompetent and r eliable sc ientific evide nce demonstrating that the shampoo, which is customarily disposed in sewage systems, will break down and de compose into eleme nts found in nature in a reasonably short period of time in the sewag e system environment. The refore, the claim is not dece ptive. Exam ple 4 : A plastic six -pack ring carrier is mar ked with a small diamond. Sever al state laws r equire that the ca rriers be marke d with this sy mbol to indi cate that they meet certain deg radability standards if the carriers a re littere d. The use of the diamond by itself, in an inconspicuous loca tion, does not constitute a deg radable claim. Consumers are unlikely to interpret a n inconspicuous diamond sy mbol, without m ore, a s an unqualified photodegradable claim.3 Exam ple 5 : A fiber pot containing a plant is labeled \"biodegradable.\" The pot is customarily buried in the soil along with the plant. Once buried, the pot fully \"Trace contaminant\" and product a rea conce rned. What constitut es a tra ce amount or backg round leve l depends on the substanc e at issue, a nd require s a ca se-by -case ana lysis. 20decompose s during the g rowing season, a llowing the r oots of the plant to g row into the surrounding soil. The unqualified c laim is not deceptive. \u00a7 260.9 Free-Of Cla ims. (a) It is deceptive to misrepr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that a product, pa ckage, or service is free of, or doe s not contain or use, a substance. Such c laims should be clear ly and prominently qualified to the e xtent nece ssary to avoid dece ption. (b) A truthful claim that a pr oduct, pac kage, or se rvice is free of, or doe s not contain or use, a substance may never theless be de ceptive if : (1) the pr oduct, pac kage, or se rvice contains or uses substance s that pose the same or similar environmenta l risks as the substance that is not present; or (2) the substance has not been associated with the product category. (c) Depe nding on the context, a free -of or does-not-c ontain claim is appropr iate eve n for a product, pa ckage, or se rvice that contains or use s a trac e amount of a substance if : (1) the leve l of the spec ified substance is no more than that which w ould be found a s an ac knowledg ed tra ce contaminant or ba ckground leve l; (2) the substanc pr esenc e does not c ause ma terial ha rm4 that consumers ty pically associate with that substance; and ( 3) the substanc e has not be en adde d intentionally to the product. Exam ple 1 : A packa ge of t-shirts is labele d \"Shirts made with a c hlorine-f ree bleac hing proce ss.\" The shirts, howe ver, a re ble ached with a proc ess that re lease s a re duced, but still signific ant, amount of the sa me har mful by products assoc iated with chlorine bleac hing. T cla im pr fits beca use re asonable consumers21likely would interpre t it to m ean tha t the product's ma nufac ture doe s not cause a ny of the environmenta l risks posed by chlorine ble aching . A substantiated cla im, however , that the shirts were \"bleached with a process that releases 50% less of the harmful byproducts associate d with chlorine blea ching \" would not be de ceptive. Exam ple 2 : A m anufacturer advertises its insulation as \"formaldehyde free.\" Although the manufa cture r does not use f ormaldehy de as a binding a gent to produce the insulation, tests show that the insulation sti ll emits t race amounts of f ormaldehy de. The seller ha s substantiation that formaldehyde is present in trace amounts in virtually all indoor and (to a lesser extent) outdoor environments and that its insulation emits l ess forma ldehy de than is typically prese nt in outdoor environments. Fur ther, the se ller has substantiation that the trac e amounts of f ormaldehy de emitted by the insulation do not cause mate rial har m that consumers ty pically associate with formaldehy de. I n this contex t, the trac e leve ls of formalde hyde emissions likely are inconseque ntial to consumers. Ther efore, the se would not be dec eptive. \u00a7 260.10 Non-Toxic Claims. (a) It is deceptive to misrepr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that a product, pa ckage, or service is non-tox ic. Non-toxic claims should be clea rly and prominently qualified to the e xtent necessary to avoid dece ption. (b) A non-toxi c claim likely convey s that a produc t, packa ge, or se rvice is non-tox ic both for humans and for the environment generally. Therefore, marketers making non-toxic claims should have competent and reliable scientific evidence that the product, package, or service is non-toxic for humans and for the environment or should clearly and prominently qualify their claims to avoid dec eption.22Exam ple 1 : A marke ter advertises a cleaning pr oduct as \" essentially non-tox ic\" and \"practically non-toxic .\" The advertisement likely conveys that the product does not pose any risk to humans or the envir onment, including house hold pets. I f the c leaning product poses no risk to humans but is tox ic to the environme nt, the claims would be de ceptive. \u00a7 260.11 Oz one-Safe and O zone-Friendly Claims. It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product, package, or service is safe for, or friendly to, the ozone lay er or the atmosphere . Exam ple 1 : A product is labele d \"ozone-fr iendly .\" The claim is dece ptive if the produc t contains any ozone-depleting substance, inc luding those substanc es listed as Class I or Class I I chemica ls in Titl e VI of the Clean A ir Act Ame ndments of 1990, Pub. L . No. 101-549, and othe rs subsequently desig nated by EPA as ting es. 2 : An aer osol air fre shener is labeled \" ozone-frie ndly.\" Some of the pr oduct's ingredients ar e volatile org anic c ompounds (VOCs) that may cause smog by contributing to ground-leve l ozone formation. The c laim likely convey s that the product is saf e for the atmosphere as a w hole, and, ther efore, is dec eptive. \u00a7 260.12 Recyclable Claims. (a) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is recyclable. A product or pa ckage should not be marke ted as re cyclable unle ss it can be collecte d, separ ated, or otherwise r ecove red from the wa ste strea m throug h an esta blished recycling program for reuse or use in m anufacturing or assembling another item.23(b) Marke ters should clea rly and prominently qualify recyclable c laims to the ex tent necessary to avoid deception about the availability of recycling programs and collection sites to consumers. (1) When rec ycling facilities are ava ilable to a substantial majority of consumer s or communities where the item is sold, marketers c an make unqualified re cyclable c laims. The term \"substantial majority,\" as used in this context, me ans at least 60 percent. (2) When rec ycling facilities are ava ilable to less than a substantial majority of consumers or comm unities where the item is sold, marketers should qualify all recyclable claims. Marke ters may alway s qualify recyclable c laims by stating the perc entag e of consumers or communities that have a ccess to facilities that rec ycle the tions in streng th depending on facility availability . The lowe r the leve l of ac cess to an a ppropriate facility is, the more strong ly the marke ter should emphasize the limited availability of re cycling for the product. F or example, if re cycling facilities are ava ilable to slightly less than a substantial majority of consumer s or communities where the item is sold, a markete r may qualify a recyclable claim by stating: \"This product [package] may not be recyclable in your ar ea,\" or \"Rec ycling facilities for this product [packag e] may not exi st in y our area.\" If recycling facilities are available only to a few consumers, marketers should use stronger clarifications. For examp le, a marketer in this situation ma y qualify its recyclable c laim by stating: \" This product [packag e] is recy clable only in the few communities that have a ppropriate recycling facilities.\" (c) Marke ters ca n make rec c laims for a pr oduct or pa ckage if the e ntire product or pa ckage, excluding minor inc idental components, is re cyclable. F or items that are Batteries labe led in acc ordanc e with the Mer cury-Containing a Management Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14322(b), are deemed to be in compliance with these Guides. The RIC, formerly known as the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. (SPI) code, is6 now cove red by ASTM D 7611. 24partially made of recyclable c omponents, markete rs should clea rly and prominently qualify the recyclable c laim to avoid dece ption about which portions are recyclable. (d) If any component significantly limits the ability to recycle the item, any recyclable claim would be dec eptive. An item that is made f rom rec yclable ma terial, but, bec ause of its shape, size, or some othe r attribute, is not ac cepte d in rec ycling prog rams, should not be marke ted as recyclable.5 Exam ple 1 : A packaged product is labeled with an unqualified claim, \"recyclable.\" It is unclea r from the ty pe of pr oduct and other context whether the c laim refe rs to the produc t or its package. The unqualified claim likely conveys that both the product and its packa ging, e xcept f or minor, incidental c omponents, can be recycled. Unle ss the manufacturer has substantiation for both messages, it should clearly and prominently qualify the claim to indicate w hich portions are recyclable. Exam ple 2 : A nationally marketed plastic yogurt container displays the Resin Identifica tion Code (RI C) (which c onsists of a desig n of ar rows in a tria ngular shape6 containing a number in the center and an abbreviation identifying the component plastic resin) on the front labe l of the conta iner, in close pr oximity to the product na me and log o. This conspicuous use of the RIC constitutes a rec yclable c laim. Unless rec ycling facilities for this container a re available to a substantial major ity of consumer s or communities, the manufac turer should qua lify the claim to disclose the limited25availability of recycling programs. If the manufacturer places the RIC, w ithout more, in an inconspicuous loca tion on the container (e.g., embedde d in the bottom of the container), it would not constitute a recyclable claim. Exam ple 3 : A container can be burned in incine rator f acilities to produce heat a nd power . It cannot, howe ver, be recycled into another product or pa ckage. Any claim that the containe r is rec yclable w ould be dec eptive. Exam ple 4 : A paperboard package is m arketed nationally and labeled either \"Recyclable wher e facilities ex ist\" or \"Rec yclable - Che ck to see if rec ycling facilities exist i n your area.\" Re cycling prog rams for these pa ckages are ava ilable to some consumer s, but not available to a substantial majority of consumer s nationwide. B oth claims are dece ptive because they do not adequa tely disclose the limited availability of re cycling prog rams. To avoid dec eption, the marke ter should use a clearer qualifica tion, such as one suggested in \u00a7 260.12(b) (2). Exam ple 5 : Foam poly styrene cups ar e adve rtised as \" Recy clable in the f ew communities with facilities for foa m poly styrene cups.\" A half-dozen major metropolitan areas have established collection sites for recycling those cups. The claim is not deceptive be cause it clear ly discloses the limited availability of re cycling programs. Exam ple 6 : A package is labeled \"Includes some recyclable material.\" The package is composed of four layers of different materials, bonded together. One of the layers is made f rom rec yclable ma terial, but the other s are not. Whi le prog rams for recycling the 25 perc ent of the pa ckage that consists of re cyclable ma terial a re available to a substantial majority of consumers, only a few of those programs h ave the capability to26separ ate the r ecyclable la yer from the non-r ecyclable la yers. The claim is dece ptive for two rea sons. First, it does not specify the portion of the pr oduct that is rec yclable. Second, it does not disclose the limited availability of facilities that can process multi- layer products or mater ials. An appropr iately qualified laim would be rcent of the materia l in this packa ge is rec yclable in the f ew communiti es that ca n proce ss multi -layer products.\" Exam ple 7 : A product c ontainer is labe led \"r ecyclable.\" The mar keter adver tises and distributes the product only in Missouri. C ollection sites for re cycling the containe r are available to a substantial majority of Missouri residents but are not yet available nationally . Because prog rams ar e ava ilable to a substantial majority of consumer s where the produc t is sold, t he unqualifie d claim is not dece ptive. Exam ple 8 : A manufa cture r of one -time use ca mera s, with dealer s in a substantial majority of communities, opera tes a take -back prog ram that c ollects those ca mera s throug h all of its dealer s. The manuf actur er reconditions the ca mera s for a nd thr ough dece ptive, even thoug h the ca mera s are not rec yclable thr ough conventional c urbside or dr op-off recycling prog rams. Exam ple 9 : A manufa cture r adve rtises its toner ca pr inters as \"Rec yclable. Contac t your loca l dealer for de tails.\" Althoug h all of the c ompany 's deale rs recycle cartridg es, the de alers are not located in a substantial major ity of communities where cartridg es are sold. Ther efore, the c laim is deceptive. The manufa cture r should qualify its claim consistent with \u00a7 260.11(b)(2). The term \"used\" refers to parts that are not new and that have not undergone any 7 re-manufacturing or reconditioning. 27Exam ple 10 : An aluminum can is labeled \"Please Recycle.\" This statement likely convey s that the ca n is recy clable. I f collec tion sit es for recycling these c ans ar e available to a substantial majority of consumer s or communities, the marke ter doe s not need to qualify the claim. \u00a7 260.13 Recycled Co ntent Claims. (a) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is made of recycled c ontent. Recy cled c ontent includes re cycled r aw rial, as we ll as used,7 reconditioned, and re-manufactured components. (b) It is deceptive to re prese nt, directly or by implication, that an item contains rec ycled content unless it is composed of mate rials that have been r ecove red or otherwise dive rted fr om the waste stream, either during the manufacturing process (pre-consumer), or after consumer use (post-consumer ). If the sourc e of r ecycled includes pre -consumer materia l, the should have substantiation that the pre -consumer materia l would otherwise ha ve entered the waste stream. R ecycled content claims may - but do not have to - distinguish betwee n pre- consumer a nd post-consumer ma terials. Where mar a nd post-consumer ma terials, it should have substantiation for a ny express or implied claim about the percentage of pre-consumer or post-consumer content in an item. (c) Marke ters ca n make unqua lified claims of re cycled c ontent if the entire product or package, excluding minor, incidental components, is made from recycled ma terial. For items that are partially made of recycled mate rial, the mar keter should clear ly and prominently qualify28the claim to avoid deception about the amount or percentage, by weight, of recycled content in the finished produc t or pac kage. (d) For products that conta in used, rec onditioned, or re- manufa cture d components, the marke ter should clea rly and prominently qualify the re cycled c ontent claim to avoid dec eption about the nature of such components. No such qualification is necessary where it is clear to reasonable c onsumers fr om context t hat a pr oduct's re cycled c ontent consists of used, reconditioned, or re-manufactured components. Exam ple 1 : A manufa cture r collec ts spill ed ra w mater fr om the orig inal manufa essing , the manufa cture r combines the spills and scraps with virgin material for use in production of the same product. A recycled content claim is deceptive since the spills and scraps are normally reused by industry within the original manufacturing process and would not normally have entered the waste stream. Exam ple 2 : Fifty perc ent of a greeting c ard's fiber w eight is composed from pape r that was diverted from the waste stream. O f this material, 30% is post-consumer and 20% is pre-consumer. I t would not be dece ptive if the marke ter claimed that the ca rd either \"contains 50% recycled fiber\" or \"contains 50% total recycled fiber, including 30% post- consumer f iber.\" Exam ple 3 : A paper board pa ckage with 20% re cycled f re cycled c ontent was c omposed of over run newspa per stock ne ver sold to customers. B ecause the ne wspape rs neve r reached consumers, the claim is dece ptive.29Exam ple 4 : A product in a multi-component pa ckage, such a s a pape rboar d box in a shrink-wra pped plastic c over, indica tes that it has rec ycled pa ckaging. T he pape rboar d box is ma de entirely of recycled ma terial, but the plastic cover is not. The claim is deceptive beca use, without qualification, it sug gests that both components are recycled. A claim limited to the paper board box would not be dece ptive. Exam ple 5 : A manufa cture r make s a pac kage from laminated lay ers of foil, plastic, and paper , althoug h the lay ers are indistinguisha ble to consumers. The label cla ims that \"one of the thre e lay ers of this packag e is made of recycled plastic.\" The plastic lay er is made entirely of recycled plastic. The claim is not deceptive, provided the recycled plastic layer constitut es a sig nificant c omponent of the e ntire pac kage. Exam ple 6 : A frozen dinner packa ge is composed of a plastic tra y inside a ca rdboar d box. It states \"pac kage made pac kaging c omponent is one-half the weight of the total package. The box is 20 % recycled content by weight, while the plastic tra y is 40% rec ycled c ontent by weig ht. The cla im is not dece ptive, since the a verage amount of r ecycled mate rial is 30%. Exam ple 7 : A manufa cture r labe ls a pape r greeting c ard \" 50% re cycled f iber.\" The manufa cture r purc hases pa per stock f rom sever al source s, and the a mount of rec ycled fiber in the stoc k provided by each source varie s. If the 50% f igure is based on the annual we ighte d aver age of r ecycled mate rial purc hased f rom the sourc es after accounting f or fiber loss during the paper making production proc ess, the cla im is not deceptive. Exam ple 8 : A packa ged food pr oduct is labeled w ith a three -chasing- arrows sy mbol (a M\u00f6bius loop) without ex planation. B y itself, the sy mbol likely convey s that the30packa ging is both re cyclable a nd made e ntirely from re cycled mate rial. Unless the marketer has substantiation for both messages, the claim should be qualified. The claim may need to be further qualified, to the e xtent nece ssary , to disclose the limited availability of re cycling prog rams and/or the per centa ge of r ecycled c ontent used to make the pac kage. Exam ple 9 : In an off ice supply catalog, a manufa cture r adve rtises its printer artridg es conta r aw mate rials and 40% reconditioned parts. The claim is deceptive because reasonable consumers likely would not know or expect that a cartridge's recycled content consists of reconditioned parts. It would not be dec eptive if the ma nufac turer c laimed om rec onditioned parts.\" Exam ple 10 : A store sells both new and used sporting goods. One of the items for sale in the store is a ba seball helmet that, a lthough use d, is no differe nt in appear ance than a brand new item. T he helmet bears an unqualified \"Recycled\" label. This claim is deceptive beca use re asonable consumers likely would believe tha t the helmet is made of recycled r aw mate rials, when it is, in fac t, a used item. An a cceptable cla im would bear a disclosure c learly and prominently stating tha t the helmet is used. Exam ple 11 : An automotive dealer, automobile recycler, or other qualified entity recovers a service able e ngine from a wrecked ve hicle. Without repairing , rebuilding , re- manufacturing, or in any way altering the engine or its components, the dealer attaches a \"Recycled\" label to the engine, and offers it for sale in its used auto parts store. In this situation, an unqualified recycled content claim likely is not deceptive because The ter m \"re building\" me ans that the de aler dismantled and constructe d the8 transmission as nece ssary , clea ned all of its interna l and external par ts and eliminated rust and corrosion, restored a ll impaired, defe ctive or substantially worn pa rts to a sound condition (or replaced them if necessary), and performed any operations required to put the transmission in sound working condition. 31reasonable c onsumers in the automotive conte xt likely would understand tha t the eng ine is used and has not undergone any rebuilding. Exam ple 12 : An automobile parts dealer, automobile recycler, or other qualified entity purcha ses a tra nsmissi on that has bee n rec overe d from a sa lvaged or e nd-of- life vehic le. Eighty-five pe rcent of the transmission, by weig ht, was re built and 15% constitutes new materia ls. After r ebuilding the transmission in accor dance with industry prac tices, the8 dealer packages it for resale in a box lab eled \"Rebuilt Transmission,\" or \"Rebuilt Transmission (85% re Tr (85% r ecycled built parts).\" Give n consumer pe rception in the automotive context, these claims are not dece ptive. \u00a7 260.14 Refillable Claims. It is deceptive to misrepr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that a packa ge is ref illable. A marke ter should not make a n unqualified re fillable cla im unless the markete r provides the means for refilling the package. The marketer may either provide a system for the collection and refill of the pa ckage, or of fer for sa le a pr oduct that consumer s can pur chase to refill the orig inal packa ge. Exam ple 1 : A container is labeled \" refillable three times.\" The manuf actur er ha s the capability to refill re turned c ontainers a nd can show that the containe r will withstand being refilled at least three times. The manufa cture r, howe ver, ha s established no32collection program. T he unqualified claim is deceptive because there is no me ans to return the container to the manufa cture r for refill. Exam ple 2 : A small bottle of fabric softener states that it is in a \"handy refillable container .\" In the same ma rket a rea, the manufa cture r also sells a lar ge-sized bottle that consumers use to refill the smaller bottles. The claim is not deceptive because there is a reasonable mea ns for the c onsumer to re fill the smaller conta iner. \u00a7 260.15 Renewable Ene rgy Claims. (a) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is made with re newa ble ene rgy or that a se rvice uses re newa ble ene rgy. A marke ter should not make unqualified renewable energy claims, directly or by implication, if fossil fuel, or electricity derived from fossil fuel, is used to manufacture any part of the advertised item or is used to power any part of the advertised service, unless the marketer has matched such non-renewable energy use with renewable energy certificates. (b) Research suggests that reasonable consumers may interpret renewable energy claims differently than ma rketers may intend. Unless marketers have substantiation for all their express and reasonably implied claims, they should clearly and prominently qualify their renewable energy claims. For instance, ma rkete rs may minimi ze the risk of dec eption by specify ing the source of the re newa ble ene rgy (e.g., wind or solar e nergy). (c) It is deceptive to make an unqualifie d \"made with rene wable e nergy\" claim unless all, or virtually all, of the sig nificant manuf actur ing pr ocesse s involved in making the product or package are powered with renewable energy or non-renewable energy matched by renewable energy certificates. When this is not the case, ma rkete rs should clea rly and prominently specify33the per centa ge of r enew able e nergy that power ed the sig nificant manuf actur ing pr ocesse s involved in making the product or pa ckage. (d) If a ma rkete r generates re newa ble elec tricity but sells renew able e nergy certificates f or all of that ele ctricity , it would be dece ptive for the ma rkete r to repr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that it uses renewable energy. Exam ple 1 : A marke ter advertises its clothing line a s \"made with wind power.\" The marke ter buy s wind ener gy for 50% of the e nergy it uses to make the clothing in its l ine. The mar keter 's claim is dec eptive bec ause r easona ble consumer s likely interpre t the claim to mean that the pow er was composed e ntirely of re newa ble ene rgy. If the marke ter stated, \" We purcha se wind ene rgy for ha lf of our ma nufac turing facilities,\" the claim would not be dec eptive. Exam ple 2 : A company purcha ses re newa ble ene rgy from a por tfolio of source s that includes a mix of solar, wind, and other rene wable e nergy source s in combinations and proportions that vary over time. The company uses renewable energy from that portfolio to power a ll of the signif icant manuf actur ing pr ocesse s involved in making its produc t. The company advertises its product as \"made with renewable energy.\" The claim w ould not be deceptive if the marketer clearly and prominently disclosed all renewable energy source s. Alternatively , the claim would not be de ceptive if the marke ter clearly and prominently stated, \"ma de from a mix of re newa ble ene rgy source s,\" and spe cified the renewable sour ce tha t makes up the g reatest perc entag e of the portfolio. The c ompany may calculate which r enew able e nergy source makes up the g reatest perc entag e of the portfolio on an annual basis.34Exam ple 3 : An automobile company uses 100% non-renewable energy to produce its cars. The company purchases renewable energy certificates to match the non-renewable energy that power s all of the sig nificant manuf actur ing pr ocesse s for the se ats, but no other parts, of its cars. If the company states, \"The seats of our cars are made with renewable e nergy,\" the c laim would not be dece ptive, as long as the c ompany clearly and prominently qualifies the c laim such as by specify ing the rene wable e nergy source . Exam ple 4 : A company uses 100% non-r enew able e nergy to manufac turer a ll parts of its product, but powers the a ssembly proce ss entirely with rene wable e nergy. If the marketer advertised its product as \"assembled using renewable energy,\" the claim w ould not be dec eptive. Exam ple 5 : A toy manufacturer places solar panels on the roof of its plant to generate power , and adve rtises that its r, howeve r, sells rene wable e nergy certificates ba sed on the re newa ble attributes of a ll the power it ge nerates. Even if the manufa cture r uses the e lectric ity generated by the solar panels, it has, by selling renewable energy certificates, transferred the right to characterize that elec tricity as re newa ble. The ma nufac turer' s claim is theref ore deceptive. I t also would be dec eptive for this manufactur er to a dvertise that it \"hosts\" a renewable power facility because reasonable consumers likely interpret this claim to mean that the ma nufac turer use s rene wable e nergy. It would not be dece ptive, howeve r, for the manufacturer to advertise, \"We g enerate renewable energy, but sell all of it to others.\"35\u00a7 260.16 Renewable Materials Claims. (a) It is deceptive to m isrepresent, directly or by implication, that a product or package is made with renewable materials. (b) Research suggests that reasonable consumers may interpret renewable materials claims differently than ma rketers may intend. Unless marketers have substantiation for all their express and reasonably implied claims, they should clearly and prominently qualify their renewable materials claims. For examp le, marketers may minimize the risk of unintended implied claims by identify ing the materia l used and e xplaining w hy the mater ial is renew able. (c) Marke ters should also qualify any \"made with rene wable ma terials\" c laim unless the product or package (excluding minor, incidental components) is made entirely with renewable materials. Exam ple 1 : A marketer makes the unqualified claim that its flooring is \"made with renewable ma terials.\" Re asonable consumers likely interpre t this claim to m ean tha t the flooring also is made with re cycled c ontent, rec yclable, a nd biodeg radable. Unless the marketer has substantiation for these implied claims, the unqualified \"made with renewable ma terials\" c laim is deceptive. The marke ter could qualify the claim by stating, c learly and prominently , \"Our flooring is made fr om 100 perc ent bamboo, which grows at the sa me ra te, or fa ster, than we use it.\" The ma rkete r still is responsible for substantiating a ll remaining express and re asonably implied claims. Exam ple 2 : A marketer's packaging states that \"Our packaging is m ade from 5 0% plant- based renewable materials. Because we turn fast-growing plants into bio-plastics, only half of our product is made f rom petroleum- based ma terials.\" B y identify ing the materia l used and explaining why the material is renewable, the marketer has minimized the risk36of unintended c laims that the product is made w ith recy cled c ontent, rec yclable, a nd biodegradable. The marketer has adequately qualified the amount of renewable materials in the product. \u00a7 260.17 Source Re duction Claims. It is deceptive to misrepr esent, dire ctly or by implication, that a product or pa ckage has been r educe d or is lower in we ight, volume, or toxicity. Marke ters should clea rly and prominently qualify source reduc tion claims to the ex tent nece ssary to avoid dece ption about the amount of the sourc e reduction and the ba sis for any compar ison.
