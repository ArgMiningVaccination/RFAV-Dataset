Vasquez Rules Coordinator MAC AND TSOA SERVICES NEW SECTION WAC 388-106-1900 What definitions apply to MAC and TSOA services? The following definitions apply to MAC and TSOA services: \"Care plan \" means the plan developed by the depart - ment in TCARE or GetCare that summarizes the services described in WAC 3 88-106-1915 th at you chose to receive. \"Care receiver \" means an adult age fifty-five and over who has been authorized f or MAC or TSOA services. \"Caregiver \" means a spouse, relative, or friend (age eighteen and over) who has primary responsibility for the care or supervision of an adult who meets eligibility criteria and does not receive d irect, publi3c, or pr ivate payment such as a wage for the caregivi ng services they provide. \"Caregiver assistance services \" are services that take the place of those typically performed by an unpaid caregiver in support of the care receiver' s unmet needs for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activ - ities of daily living (IADLs). \"Caregiver phases \" means the phases a caregiver expe - riences as the needs of the care receiver change, which in turn changes the responsibilities and tasks of caregiving. The change in responsibilities and tasks impacts the relationship between the caregiver and the care receiver. There are five phases showing the change in relationship roles from primar - ily family member to primarily caregiver. \"Family caregiver\" means the same as \"caregiver.\" \"GetCare \" means a statewide web-based information system that includes a client m anagement component for use by area agencies on aging (AAA ) and other aging and disabil - ity network partners. \"GetCare assessment \" i s a p r o c e s s d u r i n g w h i c h t h e department gathers information for an individual without a caregiver in the following areas : functional needs, diagnoses and conditions, behavior health supports, oral health, and nutritional health to assist the individual with choosing step three services. \"GetCare screening \" i s a p r o c e s s d u r i n g w h i c h t h e department gathers information for an individual without a caregiver in order to determine risk scores. The information covers the following areas: function needs, fall risk, avail - ability of informal help, memory and decision-making issues, and emotional well-being. The risk scores are used to deter - mine if the individual is referred for a full GetCare assess - ment. \"Health maintenance and therapies \" are clinical or therapeutic services that assist the care receiver to remain in their home or the caregiver to r emain in their caregiving role and provide high quality care. Services are provided for the purpose of preventing further deterioration, improving, or maintaining current level of functioning. \"Identity discrepancy \" means a negative psychological state that occurs when the activ ities and responsibilities that a WSR 17-24-128 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 18-01 Proposed [ 2 ]caregiver assumes with regard to the care receiver are incon - sistent with the caregiver's e xpectations or personal norms concerning these activities and responsibilities. \"MAC \" means medicaid alternative care, which is a fed - erally funded program authorized under section 1115 of the Social Security Act. It enables an array of person-centered services to be delivered to unpaid caregivers caring for a medicaid eligible person who lives in a private residence (such as their own home or a family member's home) and chooses to receive com munity-based services. \"Medicaid transformation project demonstration \" refers to the authority granted to the state by the federal gov - ernment under section 1115 of th e Social Security Act. This waiver is a five year demonstration to support health care sys - tems prepare for and implement health reform and provide new targeted medicaid services to eligible individuals with significant needs. It includes MAC and TSOA programs. \"Personal assistance services \" are supports involving the labor of another person to h elp the care receiver complete activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living that they are unable to pe rform independently. Services may be provided in the care receiver's home or to access com - munity resources. \"RDAD \" means reducing disability in Alzheimer's dis - ease. This program is designed to improve the ability of the person with memory problems to complete activities of daily living while also helping caregiv ers provide assistance to the person. \"Service provider \" means an agency or organization contracted with the department. \"Specialized medical equipment and supplies \" are goods and supplies needed by the care receiver that are not covered under the medicaid state plan, medicare, or private insurance. \"TCARE \" means tailored caregiver assessment and referral, which is an evidence- based caregiver coordination process designed to assist de partment assessors who work with family caregivers to support adults living with disabili - ties. TCARE is designed to tailor services to the unique needs of each caregiver to help redu ce stress, depression, and bur - dens associated with caregiving. TCARE was developed by a research team at the Universi ty of Wisconsin-Milwaukee led by Dr. Rhonda Montgomery in collaboration with over thirty organizations serving family caregivers. The TCARE process is licensed for use by Tailo red Care Enterprises, Inc. \"TCARE assessment \" is a part of the TCARE process during which the department assessors gather responses to all of the TCARE screening questions and additional questions focused on both the caregiver's experience and the care receiver's situation, such as mem ory issues, behavioral needs, assistance needs with activities of daily living and instrumen - tal activities of daily living, and diagnoses/conditions. \"TCARE screening \" i s a p a r t o f t h e T C A R E p r o c e s s during which the department gathers information from the caregiver to determine scores and ranges for the caregiver's identity discrepancy , burdens, uplifts, and depression. The ranges are used to determine if the caregiver is referred for a full TCARE assessment. \"Training and education \" are services and supports to help caregivers gain skills and knowledge to implement ser -vices and supports needed by th e care receiver to remain at home and skills needed by the caregiver to remain in their role. \"TSOA \" means tailored supports for older adults, which is a federally-funded program approved under section 1115 of the Social Security Act. It e nables the deliv ery of person- centered services to: (1) Caregivers who care for an eligible person as defined in WAC 388-106-1910; and (2) Eligible persons as defined in WAC 388-106-1910, without a caregiver.

(2) Based upon the information gathered during the TCARE assessment process desc ribed in subsection (1) of this section, one of three primary goals, as defined in WAC 388-106-1925, is established for your caregiver with at least one strategy identified for meeting that goal. One or more of the five strategies described in WAC 388-106-1930, which are linked to recommended services and supports that have the most potential to help your caregiver continue providing care safely while also addressing their needs as a caregiver, may be recommended to reach the established goal. NEW SECTION WAC 388-106-1925 What are the goals in TCARE? The three primary goals for car egivers identified in TCARE are: (1) Maintain current identity: The goal appropriate for caregivers who experience mode st levels of identity discrep - ancy and stress and are willing and able to continue in their current role. Suggested support services will help caregivers make small adjustments in their personal norms and the man - ner in which they undertake the ir caregiving responsibilities. (2) Embrace caregiver identity: The goa l appropriate for caregivers who are lik ely to benefit fro m embracing a stron - ger identity as a caregiver and r eleasing, to some degree, thei r commitment to a familial identity. Suggested support ser - vices will encourage the caregiv er to accept a greater identity with the caregiver role. (3) Reduce caregiver identity: The goal appropriate for caregivers who are engaged in a level of caregiving that requires emotional or physical resources beyond their capa - bility. Suggested support serv ices will encourage caregivers to explore ways to reduce workload and stress related to their caregiving role.

Program limits are established in WAC 388-106-1915. (1) The five strateg ies in TCARE are: (a) Strategy A: Change personal rules for care, which entai ls encouraging and helping your caregiver to change or adjust their personal rules or norms. (b) Strategy B: Reduce or minimize work load, which fo cuses on reducing the amount or intensity of your care - giver's work load and therefore aligns your caregiver's behav - iors with their expectations. (c) Strategy C: Support positive self-appraisal, which fo cuses on offering positive affirmation and assuring your caregiver that the behaviors that they must engage in as a caregiver are consisten t with their norms. (d) Strategy D: Reduce generalized stress, which focuses on giving your caregiver tools and skills to cope with daily stresses of caregiving. (e) Strategy E: Improve overall health, which encourages your caregiver to seek appropriate hea lth services. (2) Each service is mapped to a strategy(s) that may sup - port your caregiver's needs. A service may be mapped to m ore than one strategy. (3) Assessors assist you and your caregiver to understand the evidence based strategies and recommended services, choose the services to meet the identified goals, and create an individualized care plan. NEW SECTION WAC 388-106-1931 What are the TCARE screening measures? The following six TCARE screening measures and response options will be p resented to your caregiver in order to receive step two services and to determine whether a TCARE assessment is needed f or step three services: (1) Identity discrepancy: H ow much do you agree or dis - agree with each statement: (a) The things I am responsible for do not fit very well wit h what I want to do.

(1) The TCARE screening measures are scored with a number value of one through six for the measure on identity discrep - ancy or one through five for t he remaining measures based upon the caregiver's responses. Ranges for each measure determine whether the measure score is high, medium, or low. One high or three medium scores from the table in this subsection, except for the upli fts measure, will make a care - giver eligible for a TCARE a ssessment and step three ser - vices as described in WAC 388- 106 -1915 (3)(a)(ii).

A school district fiscal impact statement is not required under RCW 28A.305.135. A cost-benefit analysis is required under RCW 34.05.- 328. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis may be obtained by contacting Jeff Wise, Department of Health, P.O. Box 47850, Olympia, WA 98504-7850, phone 360-236-4987, TTY 360-833-6388 or 711, email jeff.wise@doh. wa.gov. This rule proposal, or portions of the proposal, is exempt from requirements of the Reg ulatory Fairness Act because the proposal: Is exempt under RCW 19.85.0 25(3) as the rules are adopting or incorporating by reference without material change federal statutes or regulations, Washington state statutes , rules of other Washing - ton state agencies, shorel ine master programs other than those programs governing shorelines of state - wide significance, or, as referenced by Washington state law, national consen sus codes that generally establish industry standards, if the material adopted or incorporated regulates the same subject matter and conduct as the adopting or incorporating rule; and rules only correct typographical errors, make address or name changes, o r clarify language of a rule without changing its effect. Explanation of exemptions: See cost-benefit analysis, which may be obtained from the department of health. The proposed rule does not impose more-than-minor costs on businesses. Following is a summary of the agency's analysis showing how costs wer e calculated. The department used a minor cost threshold of one percent of the average annual payroll of one hundred thirty-three residential treat - ment facilities in Washington state, which is $6,623. The pro - posal would require a handwashing sink in medication rooms, and clarified that certain facilities must have a restraint or seclusion room, depending on the services pro - vided. Most facilities requiring such a room already have one in place. The construction costs for such a room and for a sink in medication rooms was determined to be approximately $24,000. Because these are cons truction costs, the depart - ment amortized them over a period of ten years, which is $2,400 per year, on average. Wh en amortized, the annual cost does not exceed the minor cost threshold. There are also pos - sible administrative costs to update policies and procedures which the department estimat es to be not more than $650.

(2) In all cases in which a member of the public is mak - ing a request, it shall be the obligation of the public records officer, or person to whom the request is made, to assist the member of the public in identifying the public record requested. )) (1) Any person wishing to request access to pub - lic records of Lake Washingto n Institute of Technology, or Washington State R egister, Issue 18 -01 WSR 18-01-074 [ 39 ] Proposedseeking assistance in making such a request should contact the public records offic er of the college at: Public Records Officer Attn.: Administrative Services Lake Washington Institute of Technology 11605 132nd Avenue N.E. Kirkland, WA 98034 425-739-8201 publicrecords@lwtech.edu (2) A public records request must be for identifiable records. A request for all or sub stantially all records prepare d, owned, used, or retained by the college is not a valid request for identifiable records, provided that a request for all recor ds regarding a particular topic or containing a particular key - word or name shall not be considered a request for all of the college's records. (3) A request should be made in writing on the Public Records Request form, or by letter, fax, or email addressed to the public records officer. The request should include the fol - lowing information: (a) The name of the pers on requesting the record; (b) Address of the requestor; (c) Other contact information, including telephone num - ber and any em ail address; (d) The date and time of day of the request; (e) Identification of the public records adequate for the public records officer or desi gnee to locate the records; (f) If the matter requested is referenced within the cur - rent index maintained by the public records officer, a refer - ence to the requested records as it is described in such curren t index; (g) If the requested matter is not identifiable by reference to the current index, an appropria te description of the record requested.

For these purposes, \"bot request\" means a request for public records that the college reas onably believes was automati - cally generated b y a computer pr ogram or script. AMENDATORY SECTION (( Copying. )) Charges for public records. ((No fee shall be charged for the inspection of pub - lic records. The district may impose a reasonable charge for providing copies of public records and for the use by any per - son of agency equipment to copy public records but such charges shall not exceed the amount necessary to reimburse the district for its actual costs incident to such copying. No person shall be released a record so copied until and unless the person requesting the copi ed public record has tendered payment for such copying to the appropriate district employee. All charges must be paid by money order, cashier's check, or cash in advance. )) (1) Cost. Calculating the actual costs of charges for providing public records is unduly burdensome because it will consume scarce college resources to conduct a study of actual costs, and it is difficu lt to accurately calculate all costs directly incident to copying records, including equipment and paper costs, data storage costs, electronic production costs, and staff time for copying and sending requested records. Instead of calculating actual costs of charges for records, the college president or designee shall establish, maintain, a nd make available for public inspection and copying a statement of costs that the college charges for providing photocopi es or electronically produced copies of public records, and such charges for records shall not exceed the maximum default charges allowed in RCW 42.56.120 (2)(b). The college may also use any other method authorized by the Public Records Act for imposing charges for public records including, but not limited to, charging a fl at fee, charging a customized ser vice charge, or charging based on a contract, memorandum of understanding, or other agree - ment with a requestor. The college may waive charges assessed for records when the public records officer deter - mines collecting a fee is not cost effective. (2) Payment. Payment may be made by cash, check, or money order to Lake Washingto n Institute of Technology. The college may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed ten percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request, including a customized s ervice charge. If the college makes a request available on a p artial or installment basis, th e college may charge for each part of the request as it is pro - vided. If an installment of a r ecords request is not claimed or reviewed, the college is not obli gated to fulfill the balance o f the request. The college will close a request upon thirty days when a requestor fails by the payment date to pay in the man - ner prescribed for records, an installment of records, or a required deposit.

Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The proposed changes update and modernize WAC 246-210-290. The revi - sions more clearly describe and clarify the methodology used for projecting future need for h ospice services. These projec - tions are used in the CoN hospice services application review process. The proposed changes establish consistent, timely and efficient decision making by the department, and will result in increased patient acce ss to affordable, quality healt h care, consistent with the intent of chapter 70.38 RCW. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The current CoN hospice rules went into effect in March 2003, and require moderniza - tion. The proposed revisions ar e necessary to remain current and in alignment with national industry standards, guidelines, best practices, and statewide demographic shifts. The rules will provide increased access to end of life care and support services to populations in need of such services. The pro - posed rules support the statutory goals of chapter 70.38 RCW by making sure that patients h ave access to affordable, qual - ity health care. Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW 70.38.135. Statute Being Implemented: RCW 70.38.115. Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision.

A school district fiscal impact statement is not required under RCW 28A.305.135. A cost-benefit analysis is required under RCW 34.05.- 328. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis may be obtained by contacting Katherine Hoffman, 111 Israel Road S.E., P.O. Box 47852, Tumwater, WA 98501, phone TTY 360-833-6388 or 711, email katherine. hoffman@doh.wa.gov. The proposed rule does not impose more-than-minor costs on businesses. Following i s a summary of the agency's analysis showing how costs were calculated. There are no costs associated with this rule. The rule does not impose any regulatory burden on providers, nor does it change, modify, add cost or otherwise alter th e certificate of n eed application process. With respect to the reduction in average daily census (ADC), the methodology assumes that existing hospice agen - cies will maintain their curren t volumes. The ADC identified in the final step of the methodology has been lowered from thirty-five to twenty-five. The department does not restrict an existing hospice's ability to recr uit staff and to increase the number of patients they wish to serve but if a need is present and demonstrated in the calculati ons, this is a clear indicatio n that the agency is not growing in line with population growth. Reducing ADC makes it easier for new applicants to enter the Washington hospice service market, benefiting both the con - sumer and provider. Additionally, reducing ADC does not affect existing providers since they already \"hold steady\" in the market, and a reduction in ADC allows new providers to serve the excess, or patients w ho are not being served. Reduc - ing ADC causes projected need in less populated areas to be demonstrated earlier, thereby increasing access to services. With respect to the addition of exception language, hospice service providers must meet all o ther existing criteria as part of the application process, including numeric need. The sup - plementary documentation and analysis that would accom - pany an exception request may result in additional but nomi - nal administrative burden, including gathering publicly avail - able data and other material . While this may require applicants to extend efforts beyond the usual and ordinary CN application process, applicants are aware of planning area access issues well befo re their letter of intent is submitted, and are appropriatel y prepared to put forth arguments to sup - port exception requests. The nominal additional costs that may be voluntarily incurred by providers is far outweighed by the public benefit of increased access in areas where there is need for hospice services, ev en though that need may not be apparent through numeric measures.

Calculate the following (( four)) two statewide predicted hospice use rates using (( CMS and )) department of health (( data or other available data sources. )) survey and vital statistics death data:WSR 18-01-084 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 18-01 Proposed [ 44 ](i) The (( predicted )) percentage of (( cancer )) patients age sixty-five and over who will use hospice services. This percentage is calculated by dividing the average number of ((hospice )) unduplicated admissions over the last three years for patients (( the age of )) sixty-five and over (( with cancer )) by the average number of past three years statewide total deaths age sixty-five and over (( from cancer )). (ii) The predicted percentage of (( cancer )) patients under sixty-five who will use hospice s ervices. This percentage is calculated by dividing the average number of (( hospice )) unduplicated admissions over the last t hree years for patients under the age of sixty-five (( with cancer )) by the (( current statewide total of )) average number of pa st three years state - wide total deaths under sixty-five (( with cancer. ( i i i ) T h e p r e d i c t e d p e r c e n t age of noncancer patients sixty-five and over who will use hospice services. This per - centage is calculated by dividi ng the average number of hos - pice admissions over the last three years for patients age sixty-five and over with diagnos es other than cancer by the current statewide total of deat hs over sixty-five with diagno - ses other than cancer. (iv) The predicted percentage of noncancer patients under sixty-five who will use h ospice services. This percent - age is calculated by dividing th e average number of hospice admissions over the last three years for patients under the age of sixty-five with diagnoses other than cancer by the current statewide total of deaths under sixty-five with diagnoses other than cancer )). (b) Step 2. Calculate the aver age number of total resident deaths over the last three years for each p lanning area by age cohort . (c) Step 3. Multiply each hos pice use rate determined in Step 1 by the planning areas average total resident deaths determined in Step 2 , separated by age cohort . (d) Step 4. (( Add the four subtotals derived )) Using the projected patients calculated in Step 3 (( to project )), calculate a use rate by dividing projected patients by the three-year his - torical average population by county. Use this use rate to determine the potential volume of hospice (( services in each planning area )) use by the projected population by the two age cohorts identified in Step 1, (a)(i) and (ii) of this subse c- tion using OFM data . (e) Step 5. (( Inflate the potential volume of hospice ser - vice by the one-year estimated population growth (using OFM data). )) Combine the two age co horts. Subtract the most recent three-year average hospice capacity in each plan - ning area from the projected vol umes calculated in Step 4 to determine the number of projected admissions beyond the planning area capacity. (f) Step 6. (( Subtract the current hospice capacity in each planning area from the above projected volume of hospice services to determine unmet need. )) Multiply the unmet need from Step 5 by the statewide average length of stay as deter - mined by CMS to determine unmet need patient days in the projection years. (g) (( Determine the number of hospice agencies in the proposed planning area which could support the unmet need with an ADC of thirty-five. (8))) Step 7. Divide the unmet patient days from Step 6 by 365 to determine the unmet need ADC.(h) Step 8. Determine the nu mber of hospice agencies in the planning areas that could support the unmet need with an ADC of twenty-five. (9) If the department becomes aware of a facility closure fifteen calendar days or more prior to the letter of intent sub - mission period, the department will update the methodology for the application cycle. If a closure occurs fewer than fif - teen calendar days prior to the letter of intent submission period, the department will not update the methodology until the next year. (10) In addition to demonstrating numeric need under subsection (7) of this section, (( hospice agencies )) applicants must meet the (( other )) following certificate of need require - ments (( including WAC 246-310-210 - )): (a) under WAC 246-310-210; (b) WAC )) under WAC 246-310- 210; (c) structure and process of , and WAC 246-310-240 - )) under WAC 246-310-230; cost containment under WAC 246- 310-240 . (((9) If two or more hospice agencies are competing to meet the same forecasted net n eed, the department shall con - sider at least the following factors when determining which proposal best meets forecasted need: (a) Improved service in geographic areas and to special populations; (b) Most cost efficient and fi nancially feasible service; (c) Minimum impact on existing programs; (d) Greatest breadth and de pth of hospice services; (e) Historical provisi on of services; and (f) Plans to employ an exper ienced and credentialed clin - ical staff with expertise in pain and symptom management. (10))) (11) To conduct the superiority evaluation to determine which competing applications to approve, the department will use only the criteria and measures in this sec - tion to compare two or more applications to each other. (a) The following measures must be used when compar - ing two or more applic ations to each other: (i) Improved service to the planning area; (ii) Specific populations including, but not limited to, pediatrics; (iii) Minimum impact on existing programs; (iv) Greatest breadth and depth of hospice services; and (v) Published and publicly available quality data. (b) An application will be denied if it fails to meet any criteria under WAC 246-310-210, 246-310-220, 246-310- 230, or 246-310-240 (2) or (3). (12) The department may gran t a certificate of need for a new hospice agency in a planni ng area where there is not numeric need. (a) The department will consid er if the applicant meets the following criteria: (i) All applicable review criteria and standards with the exception of numeric n eed have been met; (ii) The applicant commits to serving medicare and med - icaid patients; and (iii) A specific population is not being served; orWashington State R egister, Issue 18 -01 WSR 18-01-093 [ 45 ] Proposed(iv) The population of the county is low enough that the methodology has not projected n eed in five years, and the population of the county is not sufficient to meet an ADC of twenty-five. (b) If more than one applicant applies in a planning area, the department will give preference to a hospice agency that proposes to be physically locat ed within the planning area. (c) The department has sole discretion to grant or deny application(s) submitted under this subsection. (13) Any hospice agency grant ed a certificate of need for hospice services must provide services to the entire county for which the certificat e of need was granted. (14) Failure to operate the hospice agency (( in accor - dance with )) as approved in the certificate of need (( stan- dards )) may be (( grounds )) for revocation or suspen - sion of (( an)) a hospice agency's certificate of need, or other appropriate action.

Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The department is amending its rules based on the formal recommendations of the federal National Marine Fisheries Service Eulachon Recovery Plan in order to reduce the bycatch of eulachon smelt which is listed under the Endangered Species Act as a threatened species. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The reason is based on the recommendation of the federal National Marine Fisheries Service Eulachon Recovery Plan. Statutory Authority for Adoption: and 77.12.047. Statute Being Implemented: None.Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision. Name of Proponent: WDFW, governmental. Name of Agency Personnel Responsible for Drafting and Implementation: Dan Ayres, 48 Devonshire Road, Mon - tesano, WA 98563, 360-249-4628; and Enforcement: Chief Steve Bear, 1111 Washington Street, Olympia, WA 98501, 360-902-2373. A school district fiscal impact statement is not required under RCW 28A.305.135. A cost-benefit analysis is not required under RCW 34.05.328. The proposed rule changes do not affect hydrau - lics. The proposed rule does not impose more-than-minor costs on businesses. Following is a summary of the agency's analysis showing how costs were calculated. The analysis is based on the cost to individual boat owners/operators of fol - lowing the rule once it is implemented. The rule requires the use of LED lights on shrimp trawl gear which individually costs approximately $1,300 per net. Based on local revenues for the shrimp trawling industry, this is a de minimis cost to boat owners/operators during an average season.

Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The proposed changes amend WAC 246-310-715, 246-310-720, 246-310- 725, and 246-310-745 by reducing the current adult elective PCI volume standards for institutions from three hundred to two hundred, and for individual practitioners from seventy- five to fifty to promote safe an d effective elective PCI based on the most recent clinical research and literature. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The existing CN rules went into effect in December 200 8 and require updating. The existing rules provide that all elective PCI programs must comply with annual volume standards of three hundred elec - tive PCI procedures per year and seventy-five elective PCI procedures per physician. Recent consensus clinical research and literature establish an institutional volume standard of two hundred elective PCI proce dures per year, and fifty elec - tive PCI per physicia n. The proposed revisions are necessary to remain current and in alignment with national industry standards, guidelines and best practices, as well as the most recent clinical research. The pr oposed rules support the statu - tory goals of chapter 70.38 RCW by making sure that patients have access to safe, affordable, quality services, while bene - fiting communities and protecting patients by assuring stan - dards of care to maintain co mpetence and excellence in ser - vice delivery. Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW 70.38.135. Statute Being Implemented: RCW 70.38.115. Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision. Name of Proponent: Department of health, governmen - tal. Name of Agency Personnel R esponsible for Drafting: Katherine Hoffman, 111 Israel Road, Tumwater, WA 98501, 360-236-2979; Implementation and Enforcement: Janis Road S.E., Tumwater, WA 98501, 360-236-2956. A school district fiscal impact statement is not required under RCW 28A.305.135. A cost-benefit analysis is required under RCW 34.05.328. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis may be obtained by contacting Katherine Hoffman, 111 Israel Road S.E., P.O. Box 47852, Tumwa 360-236-2321, TTY 360-833-6388 or 711, email katherine.hoffman@doh.wa.gov. The proposed rule does not impose more-than-minor costs on businesses. Following i s a summary of the agency's analysis showing how costs were calculated. There are no costs associated with this rule. The rule does not impose any regulatory burden on providers, nor does it change, modify, add cost or otherwise alter th e certificate of n eed application process. Reducing elective PCI procedure volumes for insti - tutions and providers is consistent with nationally recognized standards and statewide trends, benefits communities and protects patients by setting standards of care to maintain competency and excellence in s ervice delivery. A full analy - sis of life expectancy and val ue of resulting improved health after elective PCI weighed agai nst the overall cost of provid - ing the service is beyond the scope of this analysis, but shoul d be a consideration when evaluating the overall impact of reducing elective PCI volume t hresholds. However, the rela - tive benefit of more favorable outcomes at facilities with updated minimum volume standards outweighs both the financial and societal costs of the potential decline in access and quality resulting from rigid, outdated volume thresholds. Additionally, existing adult elective PCI providers will be able to maintain current volumes while making it easier for new applicants to enter the se rvice market, benefitting both the consumer and providers. Reducing institutional and oper - ator volumes will likely not aff ect existing adult elective PCI providers since these providers already \"hold steady\" in the market, and lowering volume standards allows new providers to serve the excess, or patients who are not being served, increasing access and assuring that patients are receiving high quality, cost effective care. For these reasons, this rule does not impose more than mi nor costs on businesses as defined by RCW 19.85.020(2). December 14, 2017 John Wiesman, 12/19/08) General requirements. The appli - cant hospital must: (1) Submit a detailed analysis of the impact that their new adult elective PCI services will have on the Cardiovas - cular Disease and Interventi onal Cardiology Fellowship Training programs at the University of Washington, and allow the university an opportunity to respond. New pro - grams may not reduce current volumes at the University of Washington fellowship training program. (2) Submit a detailed analysis of the projected volume of adult elective PCIs that it anti cipates it will perform in year s one, two and three after it begins operations. All new elective PCI programs must comply with the state of Washington annual PCI volume standards of (((three )) two hundred) by the end of year three. The projected volumes must be suffi - cient to assure that all physicians working only at the appli - cant hospital will be able to meet volume standards of (( sev- enty-five )) fifty PCIs per year. If an appl icant hospital fails to meet annual volume standards, the department may conduct a review of certificate of need a pproval for the program under WAC 246-310-755. (3) Submit a plan detailing how they will effectively recruit and staff the new program with qualified nurses, cath - eterization laborato ry technicians, and in terventional cardiol - ogists without negatively affecting existing staffing at PCI programs in the same planning area. (4) Maintain one catheterization lab used primarily for cardiology. The lab must be a fully equipped cardiac cathe - terization laboratory with all appropriate devices, optimal digital imaging systems, life su staining apparati, intra-aortic balloon pump assist device (IABP).

(2) \"Current capacity\" means the sum of all PCIs per - formed on people (aged fifteen y ears of age and older) by all ((CON )) certificate of need approved adult elective PCI pro - grams, or department grandfathered programs within the planning area. To determine the current capacity for those planning areas where a new program has operated less than three years, the department wi ll measure the volume of that hospital as the greater of: (a) The actual volume; or (b) The minimum volume standard for an elective PCI program established in WAC 246-310-720. (3) \"Forecast year\" means the fifth year after the base year.(4) \"Percutaneous coronary interventions\" means cases as defined by diagnosis relate d groups (DRGs) as developed under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) contract that describe catheter-based interventions involving the coronary arteries and great arteries of the chest . The department will exclude all pediatric catheter-based ther - apeutic and diagnostic interve ntions performed on persons fourteen years of age and younger are excluded. The depart - ment will update the list of DRGs administratively to reflect future revisions made by CMS t o the DRG to be considered in certificate of need definitions , analyses, and decisions. Th e DRGs for calendar year 2008 applications will be DRGs reported in 2007, which include DRGs 518, 555, 556, 557 and 558. (5) \"Use \"PCI use rate,\" equals the number of PCIs performed on the residents of a planning area (aged fif - teen years of age and older), per one thousand persons. (6) \"Grandfathered programs\" means those hospitals operating a certificate of need approved interventional car - diac catheterization program or heart surgery program prior to the effective date of these rules, that continue to operate a heart surgery program. For hospitals with jointly operated programs, only the hospital where the program's procedures were approved to be performed may be grandfathered. (7) The data sources for adu lt elective PCI case volumes include: (a) The comprehensive hospital abstract reporting sys - tem ( CHARS ) data from the department, office of hospital and patient data; (b) The department's office of certificate of need survey data as compiled, by planning area, from hospital providers of PCIs to state residents (including patient origin informa - tion, i.e., patients' zip codes and a delineation of whether th e PCI was performed on an inpati ent or outpatient basis); and (c) Clinical outcomes asse ssment program (COAP) data from the foundation for health care quality, as provided by the department. (8) The data source for popul ation estimates and fore - casts is the office of financial management medium growth series population trend reports or if not available for the pla n- ning area, other population data published by well-recog - nized demographic firms. (9) The data used for evaluating applications submitted during the concurrent review cycle must be the most recent year end data as reported by CHARS or the most recent sur - vey data available through the department or COAP data for the appropriate application year. The forecasts for demand and supply will be for five year s following the base year. The base year is the latest year tha t full calendar year data is av ail - able from CHARS. In recognition that CHARS does not cur - rently provide outpatient volume statistics but is patient ori - gin-specific and COAP does provide outpatient PCI case vol - umes by hospitals but is not currently patient origin-specific, the department will make available PCI statistics from its hospital survey data, as necessary, to bridge the current out - patient patient origin-specific data shortfall with CHARS and COAP.WSR 18-01-100 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 18-01 Proposed [ 50 ](10) Numeric methodology: Step 1. Compute each plannin g area's PCI use rate calcu - lated for persons fifteen years of age and older, including inpatient and outpatient PCI case counts. (a) Take the total planning area's base year population residents fifteen years of age and older and divide by one thousand. (b) Divide the total number of PCIs performed on the planning area residents over fi fteen years of age by the result of Step 1 (a). This number represents the base year PCI use rate per thousand. Step 2. Forecasting the demand for PCIs to be performed on the residents of the planning area. (a) Take the planning area's use rate calculated in Step 1 (b) and multiply by the planning area's corresponding fore - cast year population of residents o ver fifteen years of age. Step 3. Compute the planni ng area's current capacity. (a) Identify all inpatient procedures at (( CON )) certifi - cate of need approved hospitals within the planning area using CHARS data; (b) Identify all outpatient procedures at (( CON )) certifi - cate of need approved hospitals within the planning area using department survey data; or (c) Calculate the differen ce between total PCI proce - dures by (( CON )) certificate of need approved hospitals within the planning area reported to COAP and CHARS. The difference represents outpatient procedures. (d) Sum the results of (a) and (b) or sum the results of (a) and (c). This total is the pla nning area's current capacity which is assumed to remain constant over the forecast period. Step 4. Calculate the net n eed for additional adult elec - tive PCI procedures by subtract ing the calculated capacity in Step 3 from the forecasted dema nd in Step 2. If the net need for procedures is less than (( three )) two hundred, the depart - ment will not approve a new program. Step 5. If Step 4 is greater than (( three )) two hundred, calculate the need for additional programs. (a) Divide the number of pro jected procedures from Step 4 by (( three )) two hundred. (b) Round the results down to identify the number of needed programs. (For example: (( 575/300 = 1.916 )) 375/ 200 = 1.875 or 1 program .)

The processing of MIE products are the same as other food pro - cessing under the Washington Food Processing Act (chapter 69.07 RCW). This rule provides additional details on MIE definitions, MIE endorsement, initial application, application approval, specific MIE labeli ng, allowable MIE product WSR 18-01-108 Washington Sta te Register, Issue 18-01 Proposed [ 54 ]types, processing requirements, and inspection and enforce - ment procedures, including a penalty matrix for MIE viola - tions. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The department was directed by the 2017 legislature to adopt rules regulating the processing of MIE products. The rules must be written and interpreted to be consistent with the rules adopted by the Washington state liquor and cannabis board (WSLCB) and the Washington state department of health. The department has been conducting contract inspections on MIE operations for WSLCB since June 2014 and the rules provide the transi - tion of the enforcement of MIE p roduction to the department by April 1, 2018. Statutory Authority for Adoption: RCW 69.07.020, 69.07.200, Chapter 69.07 RCW. Rule is not necessitated by federal law, federal or state court decision. Name of Proponent: Washington state department of agriculture, governmental. Name of Agency Personnel R esponsible for Drafting: Claudia G.

A school district fiscal impact statement is not required under RCW 28A.305.135. A cost-benefit analysis is not required under RCW 34.05.328. The Washington state department of agriculture is not a listed agency under RCW 34.05.328 (5)(a)(i). This rule proposal, or portions of the proposal, is exempt from requirements of the Regulatory Fairness Act because the proposal: Is exempt under RCW 19.85. 025(3) as the rules are adopting or incorporating by reference without material change federal statutes or regulations, Washington state statutes, rules of other Washing - ton state agencies, shorel ine master programs other than those programs governing shorelines of state - wide significance, or, as referenced by Washington state law, national consen sus codes that generally establish industry standards, if the material adopted or incorporated regulates the same subject matter and conduct as the adopting or incorporating rule; rule content is explicitly and specifically dictated by statute; and rules adopt, amend, or repeal a proce - dure, practice, or requirem ent relating to agency hearings; or a filing or related process requirement for applying to an agency for a license or permit. Is exempt under RCW 19.85.025(3), 19.85.040(1), and 34.05.310 (4)(e). Explanation of exemptions: The proposed rule adopts either the actual language or by reference provisions of exist - ing laws and regulations, in cluding chapter 69.07 RCW (Washington Food foods); chapter 314-55 WAC (marijuana licenses, application process, Part 101.4 (Food Labeling\u2014Desi from Labeling); the Food Allergen Labeling and Consum er Protection Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-282, Title II); and 2 1 C.F.R., Part 150 (Fruit But - ters, Jellies, Preserves, and Related Products). The proposed rule also adopts a penalty matrix for MIE violations of the Washington Food Processing Act. The department need only consider costs incurred by businesses for compliance with the rule (RCW 19.85.040(1)). Fines , penalties, or defense costs associated with enforcement ac tions for failure to comply with the rules are similarly not costs that need to be consid - ered when analyzing the economic impact.

WSR 18-01-116 PROPOSED RULES DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH SERVICES (Children's Administration) [Filed December 19, 2017, 11:56 a.m.] Original Notice. Preproposal statement of inquiry was filed as WSR 17- 21-107 Title of Rule and Other Identifying Information: The department is proposing to amend WAC 388-145-1325 What is required to apply for a group care facility license?, 388- 145-1805 Are there special requirements for serving milk?, and 388-148-1320 When will the department grant me a fos - ter family license?, and to create new WAC 388-148-1321 May I request a provisional expedited foster family license? The department is proposing new language to the WAC sections listed above to provide licensing instructions regard - ing fingerprinting group care staff, background checks for household members under the age of sixteen, provisional expedited foster care licen ses, and food requirements. The department will require an in-state background check for sixteen and seventeen year olds, as was the previ - ous practice of the department prior to October 19, 2017. Also related to background check s, the new legislation allows for the department to conduct an in-state background check on those under sixteen years of age residing in a foster home, when it is warranted to ensure child safety. This is a new practice, and has been include d in this proposed WAC revi - sion. The proposed language for WAC 388-148-1321 was also amended to require an in-state background check rather than a finger-print based background [check] for sixteen and seventeen year olds in homes applying for provisional expe - dited foster f amily license.Washington State R WSR 18-01-116 [ 65 ] ProposedHearing Location(s): On January 23, 2018, at 10:00 a.m., Office Building 2, Department o f Social and Health Services (DSHS) Headquarters, 1115 Washington, Olympia, WA 98504.

Purpose of the Proposal and Its Anticipated Effects, Including Any Changes in Existing Rules: The department is proposing to amend WAC 388-145-1325 to align the division of licensed resources (DLR) W AC with legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2016, that requires fingerprints of group care agency employees that care for the division [developmental] disabilities administration (DDA) children. Since any DLR facili ty could potentially take placement of a DDA child, it was decided to fingerprint all DLR licensed group care facility staff. The proposed changes to WAC 388-145-1805 were based on recommendations from the children's administra - tion regional medical consultants. The revised WAC will clarify that neither f ormula nor breast milk can be warmed in a microwave oven. Th ese changes are to ensure child safety. The department is proposing to amend licensing regula - tions in WAC 388-148-1320 and to create WAC 388-148- 1321 in order to meet the new legislative requirements from the 2017 session. The proposed changes to WAC 388-148-1320 allow the department to complete an in-state back - ground check on household members under the age of sixteen when warranted to ensure child s afety. The intent of creating WAC 388-148-1321 was to descr ibe the criteria and process for a prior foster parent to obt ain a provisional expedited fos - ter care license. Reasons Supporting Proposal: The proposed revision to WAC 388-148-1320 and the creation of WAC 388-148-1321 are to implement the new 2017 legislative requirements. The proposed language changes to WAC 388-148-1320 are to increase child safety by allowi ng for the department to com - plete an in-state background ch eck on youth under the age of sixteen years when warranted to ensure child safety. WAC 388-148-1321 will allow foster parents that were licensed in the previous five years and who meet the other eli - gibility requirements to be i ssued a provisional expedited license, much earlier than the cu rrent practice of obtaining a full foster care license. Th is will increase placement resources by allowing foster pl acements to be made in homes with an expedited license, wh ile those homes continue to complete the full fo ster care license. The proposed revision to WAC 388-145-1325 is to align the DLR WAC with legislation that went into effect on Janu - ary 1, 2016, that requires group care agency employees to complete a fingerprint based background check when caring for DDA youth. Again, because any DLR licensed agency could take placement of a DDA youth, the decision was made to fingerprint all employees at all DLR licensed group care facilities. The proposed revision to WAC 388-145-1805 is to pro - vide an additional safety requirement by clarifying that nei - ther formula nor breast milk can be warmed in the microwave oven. This WAC change is specific to infant and child safety. Statutory chapter 20, Laws of 2017, which will create a new sectio n in chapter 74.15 RCW.

The proposed rule does not impose more-than-minor costs on businesses. Following is a summary of the agency's analysis showing how costs were calculated. All two hundred forty-three DLR licensed group care and child placing agen - cies were emailed specifically a sking whether or not there would be a cost to the agency related to the proposed WAC revisions.
