Now more than ever it's important to have a healthy immunity. Your immune system relies on your body's overall health to maintain its effectiveness. Stress, exposure to disease, poor nutrition all can increase your risk of getting sick. Once a pathogen is able to enter the body, it's up to your body's cells to protect you. Acupuncture helps these disease-fighting cells to work their best and protect you from illness. HOW DOES ACUPUNCTURE HELP? First, acupuncture treatments reduce stress, which is a major factor in the immune system's ability to fight off infection. Acupuncture stimulates and balances the immune system to create a strong line of defense against any pathogens you may come across. Acupuncture increases the amount of your body's immune cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and T-cells. It also enhances the immunity of those with immune-related illnesses by encouraging these cells to reproduce and boost the body's defenses. Acupuncture is unique in that it boosts the immune cells themselves to result in a more effective and long-lasting remedy for immune issues. It reduces the symptoms, speeds up the healing process, and regulates the immune response system. It improves your cells' ability to \"communicate\" with another and therefore increases the abilities of your defense system. Acupuncture treats a variety of conditions and is especially helpful in reducing your susceptibility to many illnesses. "}
