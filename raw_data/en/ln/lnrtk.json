miles from the city of Seattle, is a progressive, accredited, nonprofit uni-versity, internationally recognized as a pioneer in the study of natural health arts and science education and research. Since its inception, the University has based its educational, clinical and research programs on the following key principles: Treatment of the whole person Prevention of disease Teaching patients how to take responsibility for their own health Enhancing each individual's inherent healing ability, using natural, nontoxic therapies Over the years the University has broadened its mission to integrate Western scientific standards with traditional natural healing methods from around the world. The University has expanded and strengthened the academic and clinical education of naturopathic medicine practitioners. It has developed unique academic degree programs in acupuncture and Ori-ental medicine, ayurvedic sciences, nutrition, exercise science and wellness, herbal sciences, culinary arts, midwifery, integrated human biology, and counseling and health psychology, as well as specialized nondegree programs that reflect its founding philosophy. The education of graduate natural health practi- tioners and highly qualified undergraduate students at Bastyr University emphasizes development of the scientific understanding of the structure and function of the human body and the disease process, balanced with a profound appreciation for, and ability to acti-vate, the unique self-healing ability inherent in every human being. The University's educational approach is an integrated one, offering traditional didactic instruction combined with innovative and interdisci-plinary problem-based learning in rigorous academic and clinical environments. The learning experience emphasizes academic excellence, the development of individual talents and mastery of critical competencies. Students learn under the guidance of outstanding faculty. More than 90 percent of the University's health sciences core faculty members have earned terminal degrees, and many are successful private practitioners who contribute a wealth of practical experience to classroom and clinical instruction. Laboratory experiments, demonstrations, clinical experience and case-oriented instruction help stu-dents develop practical, patient-oriented skills and understanding. Student clinicians are also trained to recognize when other modes of treatment are in the best interests of the patient and to make appropriate referrals to colleagues in other health care professions. Bastyr University is dedicated to educating indi- viduals to meet the health and well-being needs of the 21 st century. Through practice and research, Ba- styr graduates will further develop ways to integrate scientific and traditional healing methods in support of the innate healing power of the individual as part of the greater human community. BaStyr uNiverSity viSioN StateMeNt As the world's leading academic center for advanc- ing and integrating knowledge in the natural health arts and sciences, Bastyr University will transform the health and well-being of the human community. BaStyr uNiverSity MiSSioN StateMeNt We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recognizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsi-cally inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service. BaStyr uNiverSity valueS CompassionCommunityIntegrityConnection to NatureWhole Systems Health BaStyr uNiverSity core theMeS As an accredited university, Bastyr engages in on-going self-assessment of its programs, student success, faculty, staff, physical capacity, long-term planning and resources. That process involves the development of core themes and goals that are used to characterize the University's priorities and provide the framework for continuous improvement. As stated in its 2013 Year One Report to the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universi-ties, the University's core themes and goals are: Core Theme One: Academic AchievementGENERAL INFORMATION4 General InformatIon ~ I ntroduCtIon Goal A - Bastyr University offers a rigorous and relevant curriculum. Goal B - Bastyr University has a highly quali- fied faculty with excellent teaching skills. Goal C - Bastyr University supports student success and program completion. Core Theme 2: Research in the Natural Health Arts and Sciences Goal A - Bastyr University Research Institute will formalize a comprehensive strategic plan that articulates its growth plan over the next decade. Goal B - Faculty are encouraged and supported to pursue research/scholarly activity and dis-seminate findings. Goal C - Students are encouraged to partici- pate in research training/scholarly activity. Core Theme 3: Clinical T raining and Commu- nity Health Goal A - All clinical programs provide clinical training that prepares competent entry-level health professionals. Goal B - All clinical programs provide high- quality services to the community. Core Theme 4: Interdisciplinary Integration Goal A - Support the fundamentals of the insti- tution-wide interdisciplinary integration by strengthening faculty training, infrastructure and policies in support of Core Theme Four. Goal B - Students gain the knowledge, skills and attitudes to work collaboratively with a variety of health professionals to improve the health of patients and the human community. These four core themes align with the Bastyr University mission statement: \"We educate future leaders in the natural health arts and sciences. Respecting the healing power of nature and recog-nizing that body, mind and spirit are intrinsically inseparable, we model an integrated approach to education, research and clinical service.\" Education, research and clinical services constitute the founda-tion upon which Bastyr University stands, and the interdisciplinary integration of these three primary areas of focus describes the approach the University uses to achieve mission fulfillment. BaStyr uNiverSity Strategic plaN To fulfill its mission and vision and fully meet core theme objectives, the University must think and act strategically. Following a campus-wide, itera-tive and broadly inclusive process, the University's Board of T rustees in December 2008 adopted and committed itself to the following core strategic initiatives:Strategic Initiative #1: Convene essential gen- erative conversations that inform the cultivation of practitioners and influence policy decisions that contribute to restoring the world's intrinsic health. Strategic Initiative #2: Determine what academic programs are essential to a robust and universal education in the natural health arts and sciences and ensure that each program is focused on the achievement of excellence. Strategic Initiative #3: Attract, support and retain world-class faculty and staff in the natural health arts and sciences. Strategic Initiative #4: Attract, support and retain world-class students representing different cultures. Strategic Initiative #5: Our methods of and access to instruction are innovative enough to attract the most diverse and qualified students, while maintain-ing the highest standards of academic, research and clinical excellence. Strategic Initiative #6: Establish a secure base of financial support and appropriate physical assets, so we can invest in and support those things that ensure we will always lead the way in education, research and clinical practice of the natural health arts and sciences. Bastyr University has played a key part in es- tablishing the credibility of science-based natural medicine and initiating the current transforma-tion of the health care system. In order to retain the University's leadership role in promoting the benefits of natural medicine, we will continue to improve and transform the institution into a fully developed, well-financed mature academic center for the natural health arts and sciences. gloBal coMpeteNcieS at BaStyr uNiverSity Bastyr University has developed global competen- cies in three major areas to help students succeed in their chosen fields in the natural health arts and sciences. These three major areas are communication skills, critical thinking and professional behavior. Students fulfill these global competencies through the curriculum of their chosen programs and in their interactions with the Bastyr community. If students are having difficulties with any of the global compe- tencies, they are encouraged to seek assistance from their instructors and the T utoring Center. Faculty members may recommend remediation for students as appropriate. Communication Skills: Five global competen- cies are listed under communication skills: writing, listening, speaking, information literacy and public speaking. 5 General InformatIon ~ I ntroduCtIon Critical Thinking: Six global competencies are listed under critical thinking: synthesis and integration, reflective evaluation, problem solving, analytical skills, intuitive skills, and research skills. Professional Behavior: Five global competencies are listed under professional behavior: medical and professional ethics, compassionate caring behaviors, respectful communication, personal health and well-ness, and professional boundary skills. legal Structure of BaStyr uNiverSity Bastyr University is a nonprofit, tax-exempt corpora- tion founded for the purpose of serving as an effective leader in the improvement of the health and well-being of the human community through education, research and community health care. The Articles of Incorpora-tion are filed in the state of Washington.

STUDENTS the StudeNt Body Bastyr University students constitute a diverse group of learners. The average age of the 1,035 stu-dents enrolled at the University in the fall of 2012 was 30, with a range in age from 17 to 70. The demographics across various programs are fairly similar. More than four-fifths of the students are women. About half of the student body is from the Pacific Northwest, and in fall 2012, 48 U.S. states were represented. International students are an important part of the Bastyr community. In 2012-2013, 78 foreign national students, representing 31 countries, were enrolled. StudeNt participatioN The major focus of student participation is the Bastyr University Student Council. The council determines how student activity fees are spent, ap-points students to various committees, represents student interests to the administration and allied professional organizations, and continually seeks to promote the University and meet the needs of students. The Student Council, like the University as a whole, relies upon student participation to create a more effective learning environment. The Student Council's constitution may be found online at MyBU. The Student Council hosts numerous events during the year, including a talent show and Bastyr Community Day. The council has made significant contributions to the University, including sponsor-ing community events, furnishing additional study space, remodeling the movement room and spon-soring the student exercise room, providing remote viewing for classrooms, as well as equipment for the library and other University departments. Each student is required to pay a $25 student ac- tivity fee every quarter. These funds are administered by the Student Council and used to support student 7 General InformatIon ~ s tudent affaIrs activities, organizations, programs and services. With these funds, events like Bastyr Community Day, expansion of the herb garden, and free or par-tially subsidized concerts, lectures and workshops are made available to students. The funds are also used to purchase equipment for the University for general student body use, such as additional computers for the library, a laptop with LCD projector and video equipment. The Student Council recognizes official student organizations. In the past several years these orga-nizations have included the following: 12-Step GroupAction AfricaAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians Rock HealthWashington Association of Naturopathic Physicians (WANP) Yoga ClubSTUDENT AFFAIRS The division of student affairs at Bastyr University provides support and services for students to meet personal and professional goals. The student affairs staff at Bastyr University con- sists of the dean of students' office, admissions, financial aid, the registrar's office, the Student Re-source Center, student housing, the Counseling Center, the T utoring and American Disability Act (ADA) Center, marketing and media, career and alumni services, as well as services for international and veteran students. Student Policies and Procedures are available online at MyBU. deaN of StudeNt S/vice preSideNt for StudeNt affairS The dean of students' office supervises student affairs and professional staff, plans and conducts orientation and commencement activities, advises student organizations, oversees the Student Resource Center, facilitates communications within and among the University's constituencies, and resolves grievances. office of adMiSSioNS The Office of Admissions works with all prospec- tive students for degree and certificate programs at the University. In addition, the admissions office coordinates campus tours, information sessions, webinars, campus visits and off-campus events to highlight the academic opportunities at the University. regiStratioN The Office of the Registrar maintains student aca- demic records, manages course scheduling, handles academic registration and evaluation, records grades, produces transcripts and grade reports, and provides academic advising and evaluation. The office also provides international and veteran student services. Bastyr University operates on the quarter system. The University's quarter is 11 weeks long. (Summer quarter classes are generally eight weeks; summer clinic is 11 weeks.) Eleven hours of class constitute one credit hour, and 22 hours of lab/practicum constitute one credit hour. Registration for continuing students takes place in the spring for summer and fall quarters and in the fall for winter and spring quarters. Continuing students register for courses and clinic shifts by submitting a registration form. The registration forms must be re-8 General InformatIon ~ s tudent affaIrs ceived before the Office of the Registrar will register a student for classes or clinic shifts. New students are automatically registered for their fall quarter courses, beginning in late spring and after they have paid their confirmation deposit. Nonmatriculated students may register for courses after matriculated students have been registered. Priority for courses is given to matricu-lated students. Students taking a course that is required for their major have preference over those taking the course as an elective. If a student has withdrawn from her/his program, s/he may take subsequent program courses only with permission from the dean of the school from which the student has withdrawn. Students may elect to audit a course or change their status in a course from grade to audit beginning the first week of the quarter through the second week of the quarter. However, after the first week of the quarter, standard refund policies apply. After the second week, a student may not change from a graded option to an au - dit option or from an audit option to a graded option. Course add/drop forms are available on MyBU. Classes may be added or dropped from a student's schedule through the add/drop period (ending the close of the first week of each quarter). After the first week of the quarter, all withdrawals will be noted with a \"W\" grade on the transcript (except in the case of weekend intensive classes or nontraditionally scheduled classes that have not yet begun). Assigned clinic shifts may be traded during the shift change period. Elective clinic shifts may be added during that same period. Clinic shift drops are accompanied by financial penalties. (Please see the Office of the Reg-istrar for additional information.) Withdrawal from classes is not permitted during the final three weeks of a quarter (see the financial policies section for the refund policy and page 158 for a refund schedule). For courses with concentrated scheduling (not evenly spaced throughout a quarter), the timing of additions or drops varies. (In no case may students drop or withdraw from a course after the course instruction has ended.) Students must check with the registrar for specific deadlines. fiNaNcial aid Prospective students, current students and alumni all work with the financial aid office on financial planning for their education. Students have access to a full range of state and federal financial aid programs. The financial aid office also distributes information about a wide variety of private scholar-ships available throughout the academic year.StudeNt reSource ceNter (Src) The Student Resource Center, located in the main hallway near the dining commons on the Kenmore campus, is a central location where students can obtain information and assistance about student-related concerns, details on the student activity schedule and ask general questions. Students can also obtain lockers and identification cards at this center. StudeNt houSiNg The University offers on-campus housing in Kenmore in the Student Village, which opened in summer 2010. The village consists of 11 buildings, housing 12 students each in single-suite rooms. These LEED-certified buildings are green-construct-ed and designed to enhance the student experience while also reducing traffic congestion. Full infor-mation, including photos, pricing and move-in dates, are available on the website or via email at housing@bastyr.edu. Off-campus postings for local apartments and home share opportunities are also available on the website and are updated often. couNSeliNg ceNter The Bastyr University Counseling Center assists students with confidential personal and school-related counseling concerns. Short-term individual and couples counseling is provided by the center's director and staff counselors and is available through-out the academic year to students from all programs. A brochure describing the center's services is pro-vided to new students at the beginning of each year. Informational brochures may also be obtained in the Counseling Center, rooms 54-62 in Kenmore. Counseling is also available through Bastyr Center for Natural Health. MarketiNg & M edia The Department of Marketing and Media works to increase the visibility of Bastyr University, co - ordinating all of the communications and public relations efforts for the University. The marketing office serves to recruit patients and students to the clinic and University and assists in producing all campus promotional materials and publications, in - cluding the website. The media and public relations office is the liaison between University representa-tives and members of the media and is responsible for handling proactive campaigns to gain publicity for the University.9 tutoriNg ServiceS T utoring opportunities consist of sessions in which faculty-approved student tutors provide help to stu- dents in most course areas of the curriculum. Small group tutoring workshops are organized when help-ful. Audio taping and note-taking programs are also available to students. Students should make their request to the T utoring and ADA coordinator, located in Kenmore but serving students at both campuses. career aNd aluMNi ServiceS The Career and Alumni Services Office is a resource for both students and alumni. The office supports stu-dents with a wide variety of services to help them with their career paths and professional development so that they can reach their career goals and be successful. The office regularly holds informational workshops, brown bag events and panels related to career success. It also provides one-on-one counseling sessions for building and strengthening resumes and cover letters, preparing for job interviews, assisting students in determining their career path, and assisting recent graduates with the transition from student to professional. Bastyr is committed to supporting its graduates and helping them stay engaged with the University and fellow alumni. The alumni services office offers a number of resources and opportunities specifically for alumni, including an alumni tuition benefit; lifelong library borrowing privileges; alumni gatherings and social networking events; retention of the University email address; an online public directory of alumni; professional opportunity listings on the web; student-alumni mentorship opportunities; and discounts on continuing education, as well as campus space rentals for meetings and retreats. Further, the alumni services office sponsors numer- ous workshops and brown bag events that provide alumni opportunities for continued and professional growth. aMericaNS With diSaBilitieS act (ada) ServiceS Bastyr University will provide reasonable aca- demic or other accommodations for students with known disabilities to the extent and according to the definitions provided by the Americans with Disabili-ties Act, Section 504. Individuals with disabilities must formally request accommodation under the ADA in order for the University to provide reason-able accommodations. Please see MyBU for more information.iNterNatioNal StudeNt S The U.S. Custom and Immigration Service (USCIS) has approved Bastyr University to accept and enroll international, nonimmigrant students. Student I-20 forms are issued by the University upon admission. For more information, consult the Admissions section in this catalog or contact the admissions office. The University registrar as-sists currently enrolled international students with USCIS regulations. health care ServiceS Every registered student is eligible and encour- aged to make use of the services at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. Students may also register their partners, spouses and dependent children for a nominal fee each quarter. A copay is due at the time of each visit, as is typical with most health plans. Lab fees, dispensary items and certain medi-cal procedures are billed separately. Contact Bastyr Center for Natural Health for more information or to make an appointment at 206.834.4100. The University contracts with an outside com- pany to provide a student injury and sickness plan at a special rate for all Bastyr students and dependents. You may receive a brochure with registration and pricing information at the Office of Student Affairs. You will enroll and do business specifically with the company, not with Bastyr. Also, Bastyr University has contracted with Firebird International Insurance group to offer a mandatory student accident and sickness plan for international students. All F-1 stu-dents must participate in this plan or provide proof of comparable coverage. Additionally, a domestic or international student participating in coursework outside of the U.S. may sign up and pay for this same coverage before travelling. uNiverSity food ServiceS The Bastyr University Dining Commons offers a variety of whole-foods-focused meal and snack options. During the academic year, breakfast and lunch are available Monday through Friday. Dinner options are also available Monday through Thursday while classes are in session. Breakfast and lunch are served on most weekends. The Dining Commons is closed during breaks between quarters. Both the campus bookstore and the Bastyr Center dispensary carry snacks and beverages. General InformatIon ~ s tudent affaIrs10 health , iNjury & i NSuraNce Bastyr students are responsible for maintaining their health both on a daily basis and as a result of injury or illness. The Student Health Plan is a well-ness plan offered through Bastyr Center for Natural Health. It is not an insurance plan so students are encouraged to individually obtain health insurance to cover themselves while students at the University. U.S. students are not required to carry health insur-ance but are strongly advised to do so. The insurance requirements for international students are included in materials sent directly to international students. The University does not carry insurance on stu- dent health or property. Bastyr is not responsible for illness, injury or other loss suffered by a student while participating in University-related activities, whether the activities occur on or off campus. Students assume the risk of illness, injury or other loss that results from participation in any on- or off-campus event, including any injury that hap-pens during travel to or from the activities. Bastyr is not responsible for providing transportation for students to clinic shifts, internships, jobs, social events, volunteer service activities or any other off-campus activity. Students are responsible for making their own travel arrangements and for all associated costs and risks.

This must be done either online or by paper form within two weeks of the start of the student or employee's first quarter. This information allows us to manage our parking availability, give incen-tives to carpoolers, track our carbon footprint and offer several services such as quarterly bike rentals. In addition, we have a shuttle service on weekdays throughout each quarter between the main campus and Bastyr Center for Natural Health (BCNH). The University subsidizes this service, so it is only $1 per trip or $30 for unlimited service for the entire quarter. Punch cards are also available. Campus parking fees are $48/quarter for those who park on campus three or more days per week. Parking two days or less per week costs $24 per quarter. Carpooling two or more times per week is also $24 per quarter. Parking one day or less per week is free. These fees help defray the large expenses of build- ing and maintaining our parking stalls. Automatic inclusion of parking fees with tuition or by payroll deduction is strongly preferred, but payment by cash or check is accepted if automatic deduction is not possible. Parking citations range from $10 to $100 depend- ing on the seriousness of the infraction. Citations are generally given to those who have not registered their transportation information, those who do not have current Bastyr identification on their cars and those who are incorrectly parked. Parking fines are due within two weeks. After two weeks, the fine is automatically charged to the student's account. For more information on transportation and parking issues, please see the Campus Resources on MyBU. Security You are our eyes and ears as we all work together to keep our University safe.

Naturopathic medicine students are required to purchase diagnostic equipment by week one of winter quarter of their first year when enrolling in Clinical Skills Lab 2 at an estimated cost of $1,000-$3,000. liviNg expeNSe fuNd diSBurSeMeNt of fiNaNcial aid Bastyr University uses electronic disbursement services (EDS) to issue living expense disbursements for financial aid. Students receiving funds through financial aid for living expenses are required to enroll in EDS, providing the University with ap-propriate bank account information in order to process disbursements. Disbursements will be sent to EDS participants generally within two to four business days after the first day of the quarter. If a student does not participate in the EDS program, the University will process a paper check within the regulatory time frame, which is approximately 14 days after the credit balance occurs on the student's account. refuNdS Dropping all classes by or before the end of the first week of classes entitles a student to a 100 per-cent tuition refund. An add/drop fee is charged after 13 the first week has ended. Any clinic drops are accom- panied by financial penalties. (See clinic registration staff in the registrar's office for more information.) Refund calculations for drops or withdrawals from classes after the first week of the quarter are found on the last page of the catalog. For those students receiving federal financial aid, the federal calcula-tion for the return of Title IV funds is required, and refunds will be returned on behalf of the student to the federal government. Amounts are determined by federal regulations. Students who receive state financial aid may also have funds returned to the state based on each state's refund policy. Students with financial problems that will affect the payment of tuition and/or fees should contact the finance office at once to make satisfactory ar-rangements. The deadline for contesting a charge on a student account is 90 days from the close of the quarter in which the charge is applied or 90 days from the actual posting, whichever is later. Financial policies, like all policies of the Uni- versity, are subject to change and revision by the management and/or Board of T rustees of the Uni-versity. Notice of changes is published on MyBU. FACILITIES caMpuS Bastyr University's primary academic and ad- ministrative facilities are located in Kenmore, Washington. The 51-acre campus adjoins Saint Ed-ward State Park (with hiking trails leading down to Lake Washington) and includes a 186,000 square-foot building, playfields and forested areas. The campus includes classrooms, research and teaching laboratories, exam rooms, an auditorium, a chapel, meeting rooms, faculty and administrative offices, a library, a bookstore and dining commons.

This LEED Platinum-certified housing complex enables up to 132 students to reduce their carbon footprint by living on campus. Please see the Office of Student Affairs for more information or email housing@bastyr.edu with questions. In September 2012, the University will inau- gurate a new campus in San Diego, California. Bastyr University California resides in a 19,500 square-foot, two-story, leased facility in the Sor-rento Valley. The campus includes classrooms, research labs, a library, a teaching clinic and study areas. The surrounding area includes hiking trails, coastal wilderness preserves, research facilities, and the University of California, San Diego campus and amenities. BaStyr ceNter for Natural health the teachiNg cliNic of BaStyr uNiverSity Bastyr Center for Natural Health (Bastyr Center or BCNH) is the largest natural health clinic in the Northwest. As the teaching clinic of Bastyr University, Bastyr Center provides patient services and student training in a professional clinical setting that emphasizes a natural approach to health care. Bastyr Center serves the health care needs of a diverse patient population, which includes young people, growing families and senior citizens from throughout the Puget Sound area. Bastyr Center schedules ap-proximately 35,000 patient visits annually. Services at Bastyr Center include naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, nutrition counseling, homeopathy, mental health counseling and physical medicine. In an effort to meet the health care needs of patients and to enhance the educational experience for students, Bastyr Center provides specialized care options throughout the year. Specialized care options include an immune wellness program for people living with HIV/AIDS, ADHD treatment and wellness care, diabetes and cardiovascular wellness care, pediatric wellness care, women's wellness care, and senior wellness care. In 2006, Bastyr Center moved to a newly reno- vated building in Seattle's Fremont/Wallingford neighborhood to provide an enhanced environment for promoting health and healing for patients, staff and students. The expanded Bastyr Center features a Chinese herbal medicine dispensary and a larger natural medicine dispensary, offering a wide selec-tion of natural health care products and a variety of gift items. Bastyr Center was the first natural health care clinic in the region to receive LEED-CI Certifica-tion from the U.S. Green Building Council for compliance with high environmental standards. LEED-CI is the recognized standard for certifying high-performance green interiors that are healthy and productive places to work, less costly to operate and maintain, and have a reduced environmental footprint. The University recently obtained ad-ditional space in the building and is in the process of adding several classrooms and making other improvements. General InformatIon ~ f aCIlItIes14 Bastyr Center is located at 3670 Stone Way North in Seattle. Parking is available onsite for patients and on the street for students, faculty and staff.

Summary policies and procedures that apply to undergraduates are described in the catalog under \"Bastyr Undergraduate Programs\" beginning on page 33. Students are advised to consult the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual, Student Policies and Procedures, and current applicable modules of the Student Clinician Handbook on MyBU for complete information on all academic policies and procedures. acadeMic hoNeSty All Bastyr students are responsible for abiding by the University policy on academic honesty. Academic work is evaluated on the assumption and expectation that all work submitted for a grade is the student's own, unless designated otherwise. Present-ing another's work as one's own is unacceptable and considered academically dishonest. Cheating and plagiarism are considered forms of academic dishon - esty, and students found responsible for such acts are subject to disciplinary action, including dismissal. The policy is outlined in full in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. acadeMic StatuS - p roBatioN , SuSpeNSioN aNd diSMiSSal Students may refer to the following as an overview of University policy regarding academic standing, probation, suspension and dismissal. The full policy is published in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual located on MyBU. The University uses the following terms to denote academic status: Good standing Academic warning Probation Final probation General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures15 Suspension Dismissal Notice of acadeMic StatuS Each quarter the registrar provides the dean or dean's designee with a list of students who do not meet program or graduation standards. The dean, dean's designee and/or school/department Student Progress Committee reviews each student's record according to specified program standards published in the University Catalog. A change of status, with the exception of dismissal, is the decision of the dean and/or the school/department Student Prog-ress Committee. Depending on the nature of the academic deficiency, the categories above are not necessarily followed sequentially. A student whose status is anything other than good standing may be required to sign a learning contract and/or conform to other academic sanctions. Students under academic warning or on proba- tion, final probation or suspension must complete at least two successive quarters with no academic dif-ficulty and fulfill all prescribed terms and conditions in order to qualify for a change of status. A change of status is the decision of the school/department Student Progress Committee and/or the dean or dean's designee, who will notify the registrar's office accordingly. acadeMic proBatioN Notice of Probation The dean or dean's designee sends notice of academic probation to the student's University email address and via U.S. mail to the student's local mailing address. Notices will be sent no later than close of business on the Friday of the second week of the quarter. The date of the postmark on the envelope and the date stamp of the e-mail serve as the date of notice. Reasons for Academic Probation A graduate program student may be placed on academic probation under the following circum-stances: The student's cumulative GPA falls below program standards The student's GPA for the quarter falls below program standards, even though the student's cumulative GPA is above that required for graduation. The student earned a grade lower than the minimum required by the school or program in a required course, internship or clinical rota-tion. The student's record shows that s/he has failed a course more than once or that the student has a number of incompletes and/or withdrawals that the dean or dean's designee considers to be of concern. An undergraduate student may be placed on academic probation under the following circum-stances: The student's cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. The student's GPA for the quarter is below that required for graduation, even though the stu-dent's cumulative GPA is above that required for graduation. The student earned a grade lower than the minimum required by the school or program in a required course, internship or clinical rota-tion. The student's record shows that s/he has failed a course more than once or that the student has a number of incompletes and/or withdrawals that the dean or dean's designee considers to be of concern. Conditions During Academic Probation A student placed on academic probation will be required to meet with a faculty advisor to develop an academic improvement plan that the student must complete in order to be removed from academic probation. The academic plan may require the student to do one or more of the following: Earn a designated minimum grade in all courses while on probation Reduce the number of credits taken while on probation Participate in academic initiatives such as tuto- rials and workshops aimed at improving study approaches Obtain permission from the faculty advisor for taking incompletes in or withdrawing from classes Fulfill other requirements outlined by the school/program and/or faculty advisor Duration of Academic Probation A student is generally placed on academic proba- tion for one quarter. If the dean, dean's designee and/or Student Progress Committee determine(s) that General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures16 the student has not satisfied the conditions of the probation, the student will be: Given written notice (as outlined above) re- garding circumstances for the continuation of probation. Placed on suspension (see below) or recom- mended for dismissal (see below). The dean or dean's designee will notify the stu- dent each quarter that the student remains on probation and whenever the student's academic status has changed. appeal of proBatioN A student placed on academic probation may not appeal the decision unless s/he is able to provide spe-cific documentation demonstrating a factual error. The student must submit documentation outlining the factual error(s) and relevance to the probation decision to the dean or dean's designee within five (5) business days of the postmark date of the notice of probation or continuation of probation. The dean or dean's designee will respond to the appeal within 10 working days, and his/her decision is final and cannot be appealed. acadeMic SuSpeNSioN Notice of Suspension The dean or dean's designee sends notice of academic suspension to the student's University email address and via U.S. mail to the student's local mailing address. Notices will be sent no later than close of business on the Friday of the second week of the quarter. The date of the postmark on the envelope and the date stamp of the email serve as the date of notice. Reason for Academic Suspension Academic suspension is used when the dean or dean's designee, based on input from the school/department Student Progress Committee, believes the student will benefit from a period of time away from his/her program track and that the student has sufficient opportunity to be successful upon his/her return from suspension. The terms of suspension are unique to each student and will be established by the dean or dean's designee. A suspension will last at least one quarter, and a student may be required to receive remedial academic assistance before being readmitted. Removal from a course or clinic shift may be war- ranted in the case of a student's failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expec-tations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member. Removal from a course or clinic shift constitutes a failure of that class or shift and is not eligible for remediation. In addition, failure to adhere to such course or clinic shift expectations may result in immediate suspen-sion or recommendation to the provost for dismissal. Suspended students must petition the dean for reinstatement. They may be required to meet with the dean or dean's designee and must show that all terms of the suspension have been met before receiv-ing approval to return to the University. If a student is unable to demonstrate that s/he has adequately resolved the issue(s) that led to the suspension, the student may be recommended to the provost for dismissal. Appeal of a suspension may be made to the pro- vost only in the event of factual error. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five (5) working days of the postmark date of the suspension notice. The appeal must specify and include the al-leged documented inaccuracy and the relevance of the fact(s). The provost will respond to the appeal within 10 working days. The decision of the provost is final and cannot be appealed. acadeMic diSMiSSal Dismissal for Academic Deficiencies or Policy Violations Each school at Bastyr University has a student progress committee that follows University dis- missal policy. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted to the provost for consideration. The provost makes all decisions regarding student dis-missal. Except in the case of academic dishonesty (see policy #09-C49 in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information) or a stu-dent's failure to adhere to instructions, procedures and/or professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member, academic dismissal must be preceded by at least one written warning from the school/department notifying the student of the problem area(s) and providing an adequate time period for response and/or improvement before taking further action. Academic probation is one such warning. In the event the terms of the written warning are not met and a recommendation for dismissal is being considered by the school/department, the student will be required to meet with the Dean of Students. General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures17 The provost or his/her designee will send the student notice of academic dismissal by email to the student's University email address and via certified U.S. mail, requiring confirmation of receipt, to the student's local mailing address. Except in the case of dismissal for academic dishonesty or behavior that compromises the safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member (which may be sent any time during the academic year), notices will be sent no later than close of business on the Friday of the fifth week of the quarter. The date of the postmark on the envelope and the date stamp of the email serve as the date of notice. A student may be dismissed from Bastyr under the following circumstances: After the second consecutive quarter of being on probation (including summer if enrolled) After the third quarter of being on probation (including summer, if enrolled); the quarters need not be consecutive Failing to fulfill the conditions of the established learning contract, academic improvement plan or academic probation Failing the same class twice Failing two clinic shifts Receiving three failures in the same quarter Having a history of poor academic performance relevant to the appropriate department Violating University academic honesty policy Being removed from a course or clinic shift due to student's failure to adhere to instructions/procedures/professional expectations that may lead to the compromised safety of a patient, student or staff or faculty member Student Status After Notice of Dismissal Unless a student elects to appeal his/her dismissal, s/he will be dropped from all classes for which s/he is registered at the time of dismissal. If a student elects to appeal his/her dismissal, the dean or dean's designee will determine whether the student will be allowed to register for classes or continue other activities during the appeal process. Students are advised to consult with the registrar and financial aid office regarding the timing of their dismissal appeal and its implications on class registration refund and student aid policies. Appeal of Dismissal A student may appeal a decision for dismissal only if s/he is able to provide specific evidence demonstrating a factual error in the dismissal deci-sion process. The written appeal must be made to the provost within five (5) working days of the date of the dismissal notice. The appeal must specify and include the alleged documented inaccuracy and the relevance of the fact(s). The provost will respond within 10 working days of receipt of the appeal and can only consider an appeal based on an error of fact. The decision of the provost is final and cannot be appealed. liMit S oN StudeNt credit loadS Bastyr University degree programs are described under each school or department listing in the Ba - styr University Catalog. The recommended didactic curriculum for each year and track of the degree program is specified. Elective courses and clinic credits are expected over and above the required didactic courses. Capable students may choose to exceed the full- time recommended enrollment in order to include important electives or special interests in their pro-grams. However, the following are the maximum credit loads for which students may register in each program in any given quarter: Bachelor of Science (all programs) ................. 20 credits Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology ...... 24 credits Master of Science in Midwifery (all tracks) .... 30 credits Master of Science in Nutrition (all tracks) ..... 24 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture ................ 25 credits Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ...................................... 25 credits Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine ..................................................... 30 credits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine ................. 30 credits Students who are seeking degrees in multiple programs must plan their registrations carefully so that they do not exceed the stated limits. Students enrolled in dual programs may use the credit limit of either program. In extraordinary cases, very capable students may be allowed to exceed the maximum for their programs upon approval by their department chairs. Department chairs indicate their approval by signing student registration or add/drop forms and noting the credit load being approved. Any approved in-crease may not exceed 10 percent of the above totals. atteNdaNce policy Course and Lab Attendance PolicyBastyr University does not have a universal course and lab attendance policy. However, faculty mem-bers may establish attendance requirements for their General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures18 course(s) or lab(s). Some state licensing boards and the Veteran's Administration require 90 percent attendance. Students receiving financial assistance from the Veteran's Administration or students who need to meet state licensing board requirements are responsible for notifying the faculty of their need to document attendance. When a student has an excused absence, the fac- ulty member may require that the student complete an assignment to make up for the time missed. An absence is considered excused if the student has a legitimate personal emergency, a serious illness or a documented birth (midwifery program students), as long as the student calls the faculty member(s) or leaves a message for the faculty member(s) with the faculty services department regarding the situation in advance (24-hour voicemail is available). Faculty may require documentation upon return from the excused absence. It is the student's responsibility to meet with the faculty member to discuss the absence and make up work upon return. Not meeting the stated attendance requirements for the class may affect the student's final grade, and a student may be required to take the course again. In addition to possible consequences for absences, habitual tardi-ness may be taken into account by faculty as part of the course grade and/or may be reported to the dean of students for disciplinary action. Students cannot register for two courses or labs that are scheduled at overlapping times. Credit can only be applied to a single course at any one given time. Students cannot attend a course without be-ing registered for it and must attend the section of a course or lab for which they are registered. Failure to follow this policy may result in loss of course credit or a course grade of no show (NS). Clinic Attendance PolicyAll student clinicians are required to attend at least 80 percent of each assigned quarter shift in order to receive a grade of Achieved Competency (AC). Holidays and emergency closures of the clinic do not figure into the total quarter attendance. A student who does not attend at least 80 percent of the shift (two excused absences) will receive a failure grade for that shift and lose all accumulated patient contacts and hours for that shift. The entire shift would need to be taken again. Exceptional circumstances resulting in a third absence may be approved at the discretion of the supervisor. Four or more absences will result in an automatic failure for that shift. Please note that 100 percent of the required clinical hours must be completed before recommendation for graduation. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. Religious or Spiritual HolidaysThe University's policy is to attempt to accommo- date the observance of religious practices. Religious absences will not count against any attendance requirement, but students are responsible for the information and material covered. Students ob-serving such holidays are required to notify faculty during the first week of classes as well as find sub-stitutes for clinic shifts affected. Students should follow reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students with religious restrictions against attending classes on weekends need to contact their program chairs, in advance, when such conflicts occur. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed. Convention, Conference, Seminar and Work- shop Attendance Policy Occasionally, there may be professional conven- tions or conferences offered during the academic year that programs encourage their students to at-tend. Students who wish to attend such events must receive advance permission from their instructor(s) if there is an attendance requirement for the class or an exam or project due during that time. Students are responsible for the information and material missed. Students who receive permission must ar-range with faculty to take missed quizzes and exams immediately upon return, as outlined in the policy on rescheduled examinations in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. Students must also comply with clinic absence policies. Please refer to the Student Clinician Handbook - Global Module for further details. uNiverSity cloSure In the event of unplanned school closures for weather or community emergencies, students are required to make up missed course requirements or clinic contact hours. Should the duration of the closure be too long or too late to make up missed requirements/hours in the time allotted, the Uni - versity reserves the right to extend the quarter and/or academic year to allow for additional make-up time. Please see the inclement weather policy/pro- General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures19 cedure on MyBU for more information regarding University closure. criMiNal BackgrouNd checkS Bastyr University requires national background checks for all students enrolling in clinical training courses. Background checks must be completed prior to any student contact with patients at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, an affiliate clinic, or a practicum or preceptor site. Students will also be required to immediately notify the dean or department chair of their program and their clinical training program supervisors if charged with and/or convicted of a felony after the background check has been conducted. Students should also note that Bastyr University requires that all felonies be disclosed at time of application for admission. Failure to comply with these disclosure requirements may result in immediate dismissal from the University. See \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. policy oN tB teStiNg aNd hepatitiS B iMMuNizatioNS These policies were enacted to protect the health and safety of employees and students who may be exposed to certain biohazards in the campus and clinic working environments. Tuberculosis ScreeningAll faculty, staff and students who work or have shifts at Bastyr Center for Natural Health are re-quired to be screened annually for tuberculosis (TB), and are responsible to provide documentation of their results. Screening results can be submitted directly to the Facilities and Safety Office on cam-pus, room 38, or to the TB Results box, outside the Medical Records service window at the clinic. Bastyr provides two TB testing clinics each year, and all are encouraged to have their screening per-formed in sync with these week-long clinics, called TB Weeks. T wo screening options are available: T uberculosis Skin Test (TST) or QuantiFERON blood test (QFG). Students pay $10 toward the cost of their TST during the TB Week clinic, or $20 if you make a spe-cial appointment at Bastyr Center. QFG is available at Bastyr Center for an approximate cost of $110. If a chest x-ray is necessary, Bastyr University agrees to pay $37.50 toward this cost. Other locations are available with low cost options. Questions regarding TB screening or requests for forms can be addressed to the campus facilities and safety office or to the safety manager at the clinic. Hepatitis B ImmunizationsAll ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students, AOM and ND faculty and staff at Bastyr Center, and faculty or laboratory and operations assistants who are category I (those who have daily exposure to blood or body fluids) and category II (those who have occasional exposure to blood or body fluids) are required to either take the hepatitis B immunization series, provide documentation that they have had such immunizations in the past 10 years, or sign a waiver refusing the immunizations along with a release of liability form. Bastyr University agrees to pay 50 percent of the cost of the hepatitis B immunization series for students. Note: All students are required to pay in full the cost of testing antibody levels for any of the agents listed above, if they choose to check for individual immunity, prior to waiving or taking any immu-nizations. Commencement of the immunization series (or submission of a waiver) and TB screening shall oc-cur before the first day of work for all faculty and staff, and before ND, AOM and clinical nutrition students begin their clinic shifts. Hepatitis immuni-zation forms/waivers are distributed to students in one of their required clinical courses. Hepatitis im-munization questions can be directed to the Blood Borne Pathogen Safety Officer. Anyone who has elected to waive the immuniza- tion series has the option to change that election, at any time, and take the immunization series. degree aNd certificate requireMeNt S To earn a degree at Bastyr University, a degree candidate must have completed the prescribed curriculum (refer to the specific academic program section), earned passing grades in all required courses and clinic shifts, satisfied the requirement for total degree or certificate credits, and been recommended for graduation by the faculty. To be eligible to graduate with a master's degree or graduate-level certificate, the candidate must have a minimum GPA of 3.0; a bachelor's degree candidate must have a minimum GPA of 2.0. Students in the articulated bachelor's/master's AOM degree program must fol-low the degree requirements of that school. General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures20 A student is held to degree requirements in ef- fect at the time of initial matriculation unless legal or accreditation standards mandate a change to an existing degree or certificate program. Those degree and certificate requirements are published in the edition of the Bastyr University Catalog that is in effect at the time of first matriculation. In rare circumstances, a course may be deleted from the required curriculum and/or curriculum substitu-tions may be made at the discretion of the school or the University. A student who is readmitted after an absence of more than one calendar year may be held to the requirements in effect at the time of his/her return or may elect to graduate under degree or certifi-cate requirements specified in a subsequent Bastyr University Catalog with written permission of the program dean/chair. Under no circumstances are the requirements from an earlier catalog applied. Students in the ND and MSAOM programs must complete their degrees within six years. (In extraor-dinary circumstances, a one-year extension may be approved for ND students.) Students in the MSA, MS Midwifery and MS nutrition programs must com - plete their degrees within five years. There is no time limit on the completion of undergraduate programs. Students in all degree and certificate programs must have discharged satisfactorily all financial obli-gations to the University (tuition, fees, library fines, and all other charges), including the graduation fee, for each program in which a degree or certificate is to be awarded. For students who have not met their financial obligations at the time of graduation, the earned degrees and certificates are posted to their records, but diplomas and official transcripts are held until the financial obligations are cleared. degree aWard deadliNeS The awarding and posting of degrees at Bastyr University are governed by specific deadlines. These deadlines affect the actual awarding of degrees. Stu-dent participation in commencement ceremonies is governed by a separate policy. The dates for final examinations each quarter and for commencement ceremonies are published in the Bastyr University Catalog and the registrar's quarterly calendar. For all bachelor's, master's and professional doc- toral degrees awarded by Bastyr University: All coursework must be completed by the last day of the quarter for graduating students. Any In Progress (IP), Incomplete (I) or Partial Competency (PC) grades in coursework or clinic shifts must be replaced with passing grades no later than the last day of the quarter. If a student has any outstanding course or grade requirements on the last day of the quarter, his/her degree will be posted at the close of the subsequent quarter. gradiNg policieS Grades are assigned based on the grading system of the department/program offering the course rather than by the academic program in which the enrolled student is matriculated. Core courses required for an academic program will be graded according to the normal grading policy for that program. Naturopathic Medicine/Dietetic InternshipBastyr University provides a competency-based learning format in the classroom for students in the naturopathic medicine program, clinic courses and the dietetic internship program. A competency-based evaluation of student work and performance is structured on the premise of demonstrating competence of a well-defined set of information and/or skills. With a competency system of grading, a student is aware of the learning objectives and core com - petencies for each course and clinic shift, knows how knowledge and understanding of these objec-tives and competencies are measured, and has the opportunity to demonstrate mastery by means of quizzes, exams, papers and/or practical application. The competencies established for each course reflect the goals and objectives of the appropriate program of study. Program and department chairs in the professional programs, in consultation with the faculty, determine the requirements and standards that students must meet in order to earn a grade of Achieved Competency, Partial Competency, Repeat Competency (NM program only) or Failure. Naturopathic Medicine Degree Program, Dietetic Internship and Clinical Shifts AC - Achieved Competency PC - Partial Competency RC - Repeat Competency (NM program only) F - Failure I - Incomplete - Personal emergency or seri-ous illness W - Withdrawn AW - Administrative Withdrawal General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures21 IP - In Progress - for clinic shifts, preceptor- ships, clinic entry, theses, didactic courses and internships N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived ACHIEVED COMPETENCY (AC): A grade of AC indicates the student has gained the defined knowledge, information, skills and core competen-cies and has met the learning objectives as defined in the syllabi. Students must attain a level of achieved competency (AC) in all courses, clinic shifts and in-ternships. AC grades are not factored into the GPA. PARTIAL COMPETENCY (PC): A grade of PC indicates that an aspect of the learning objectives or core competencies has not been achieved and there is need for further study to earn the required AC. Faculty determine the date by which a PC grade must be converted; however, PC grades must be converted no later than the end of the break of the subsequent quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete a PC contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. Grades of PC that have not been converted to AC grades by the deadline revert to F grades. The course, lab, clinic shift or internship must then be repeated. PC grades do not translate into partial credit on transcripts and are not factored into the GPA. REPEAT COMPETENCY (RC): A grade of RC applies only to the naturopathic degree program and indicates that a PC grade was not converted to a grade of AC via remediation in a major discipline within a required module. Although the student demonstrated competency in some of the disciplines within the module, the student did not demonstrate competency in other disciplines and must repeat competencies in those disciplines in order to earn an AC. An RC grade must be converted to AC in order for the student to progress within the curriculum. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. While the student is retaking the module in which competency must be achieved, the grade of RC will appear on the student's official transcript. FAILURE (F): A grade of F indicates failure to meet the minimum level of competency for learn-ing objectives or core competencies. A student who receives a failure in a required course, lab, clinic shift or internship must repeat that course, lab, clinic shift or internship. WITHDRAWN (W): Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the registrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met). INCOMPLETE (I): A student who is doing sat- isfactory work in a course but cannot complete the work because of a serious illness or personal emer-gency may receive an I grade by filing an incomplete grade request form (approved by the instructor) with the Office of the Registrar. Incomplete grades may only be awarded in the last three weeks of the quarter (after the course withdrawal period has ended) or af-ter at least 70 percent of the class has been completed (in the case of hybrid or courses with fewer than 11 weeks). Faculty determine the date by which an I grade must be converted; however, I grades must be converted no later than the end of the break subsequent to the quarter in which the grade was received. Students may be required to complete an I grade contract with the faculty member. Upon conversion of the grade, the instructor must submit a grade change form to the registrar's office. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL (AW): A student who is suffering from a serious illness or experiencing a personal emergency and is unable to withdraw from term-based classes within the appropriate time frame may be awarded an AW grade by the registrar. The AW grade is awarded for all incomplete courses in a given quarter. (See \"Administrative Withdrawal\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information.) IN PROGRESS (IP): IP grades are indicated for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, clinic preparation, theses, internships and clinic entry courses in which work may extend beyond the end of a quarter. If not converted to a passing grade, IP grades may be converted to an F grade. NO GRADE (N): N grades are assigned to indicate that a student is awarded no credit for a course but did not fail that course. N grades are administrative grades and are assigned only by the registrar. N grades are not refundable. CHALLENGE EXAMINATION (CE): Please see \"Challenge Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. NO SHOW (NS): NS grades are assigned to in- dicate that a student did not attend class. NS grades are not refundable, and no credit is given. General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures22 AUDIT (AU): Students generally audit a course for their personal enrichment. No credit is given, and no academic grade granted. Courses taken for audit cannot serve as a prerequisite for a subsequent course. WAIVED (WV): Courses are generally waived if a student has demonstrated competency in a particular subject matter but does not have the appropriate level of coursework from an accredited institution to allow a transfer of credit. There is no credit attached to a waived course, and a student is required to make up the corresponding credits waived with additional elective credits. Undergraduate Degree ProgramsFor the undergraduate degree programs, a student must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA in order to remain in good standing. Undergraduate students in the Department of Acupuncture and Oriental Medi-cine must maintain a 2.5 GPA in their first year and a 3.0 GPA in their second year. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. The letter grading system for acupuncture and Oriental medicine*, nutrition, exercise science, herbal sciences, integrated human biology and health psychology undergraduate programs is as follows: A - 95 percent-100 percent or 4.0 A- - 90 percent-94.9 percent or 3.7 B+ - 87 percent-89.9 percent or 3.3 B - 83 percent-86.9 percent or 3.0 B- - 80 percent-82.9 percent or 2.7 C+ - 77 percent-79.9 percent or 2.3 C - 73 percent-76.9 percent or 2.0 C-* - 70 percent-72.9 percent or 1.7 D+* - 67 percent-69.9 percent or 1.3 D* - 63 percent-66.9 percent or 1.0 D-* - 60 percent-62.9 percent or 0.7 F - Below 60 percent or 0.0 AC - Achieved Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach and practical courses PC - Partial Competency - for clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practicum, outreach and practical courses I - Incomplete - personal emergency or seri-ous illness W - Withdrawn -Withdrawal form must be completed, signed and filed in the reg - istrar's office at least three weeks before the end of a given quarter. The W grade is transcripted for all course withdrawals after the first week of the quarter (with the exception of courses that have not yet met).AW - Administrative Withdrawal IP - In Progress - for didactic courses, clinic shifts, preceptorships, community practi-cum, outreach, clinic preparation, clinic entry, senior year projects and practical courses N - No Grade CE - Challenge Examination NS - No Show AU - Audit WV - Waived For explanation of grading terms, see above.*It should be noted that while a C-, D+, D and D- grades are passing, some courses require a C grade for professional standards. Graduate Degree Programs: (MACP The grading system used for graduate degree programs is identical to the undergraduate system, as shown above, except for the following: There is no grade of D+, D or D- for a graduate student, and the IP grade applies also to ongoing work on a thesis. For an explanation of grading terms, see the listing under the professional degree programs. For the graduate degree programs, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. Any required course in which a student receives a grade of F must be repeated. Grade ChangesThe grades of PC, IP and I are considered tem- porary grades and designed to be changed. The grades of AC, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- and F are considered permanent grades and can be changed only if a faculty error was made at the time of issuance. The faculty member must submit documentation demonstrating the error to the reg-istrar. Students are not allowed to submit additional work after the quarter has ended with the intent to raise an A- through F grade. The option of \"extra credit\" work must be written into the syllabus and collected prior to quarter's end. Grade of F or PC in Sequential Courses If a student has an F grade, or a PC that converts to an F grade, in a sequence course, the student will not be allowed to continue study in the next sequential course. If a PC grade is not remediated by 5 p.m. on the Friday at the end of the first week of the quarter, the student will be withdrawn from the course. General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures23 iNdepeNdeNt Study policy Independent study allows individual students to study areas of interest not included in the regular curriculum, with the aid of an instructor or a selected resource person. Registration forms for independent study are available from the Office of the Registrar. The deadlines for registration, pay-ment and grading of independent study courses are the same as those for regularly scheduled courses. Required courses may not be taken as independent study. One credit of independent study is expected to be the equivalent of approximately 30 hours of work. Students may take an independent study course only if they are in good academic standing. ND students may request to do an independent study after they have completed at least 50 credits of their degree program. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine and nutrition students must have com-pleted at least 30 credits of their degree program. Integrated human biology students must have com-pleted at least 60 credits of their degree program. Psychology students must have completed at least 45 credits of their degree program. Students may apply a maximum of five (5) credits of independent study toward the completion of their degree program. Students pursuing two majors as an undergradu-ate may apply a maximum of ten (10) credits by independent study, five (5) toward each program. traNSfer , W aiver aNd SuBStitutioN policy Requests for transfer or waiver of credit must be submitted and reviewed within 12 months of a student's matriculation date or before the quarter in which the student is required to complete the course, whichever comes first. Courses taken prior to entry at Bastyr can only be transferred to Bastyr during a student's first year of attendance. After the first year, previous courses taken can only be considered for waiver of required Bastyr courses, and elective cred-its must be taken to make up the waived credit. If this timeline is not followed and a course is waived/transferred after the start of the quarter in which a student is registered for that course, the standard course refund policy will apply. The courses under consideration for waiver or transfer should generally be no older than seven years. Waivers and transfer credit will not be awarded for courses submitted for transfer after the quarter in which the student is expected to take the course at Bastyr University. If an enrolled student wishes to complete a program requirement at another institution with the intent to transfer or waive the course at Bastyr, the student must request approval in advance by submitting a petition to waive, substitute or transfer credits along with the course description from the other institution. Courses submitted for transfer that have not received prior approval are not guaranteed transferability. coMpeteNcy exaM Competency examinations are available when there is evidence on a student's official transcript of coursework completed in an area of study but the competencies, level of material or accreditation of the institution granting the original credit is in question. Competency examinations are also avail-able when the age of the coursework exceeds the guidelines in the transfer credit policy. Competency examinations are not available when the coursework in question was completed at Bastyr University. If a student satisfactorily completes the exam, the student will be awarded transfer or waiver credit in accordance with the transfer credit policy. Please see \"Competency Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. traNSfer T ransfer credit recognizes coursework from another accredited institution as satisfying a Bastyr required course. T ransfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at another accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specific Bastyr course, and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required course in Bastyr's pro-grams. T ransfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit can only be granted within the first year of attendance. T ransfer credit may be granted from institutions that are accredited by regional accrediting agencies recognized by the American Council on Educa-tion Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation and from institutions that are profes-sionally accredited by the CNME, ACAOM and MEAC. Students who apply to Bastyr University with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts evaluated by an in-dependent evaluation service. The evaluation report General InformatIon ~ a CademIC PolICIes and ProCedures24 must be issued by an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) accredited evalua-tion service. Credits from schools outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nationally established norms. Waiver A waiver does not grant credit; it only eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. Students are required to complete the equivalent number of credits approved via the waiver with elective credits. A petition to waive may be requested when formal train-ing, coursework or experience has been earned at an accredited or unaccredited institution. A student must provide documentation showing that the competen-cies of the Bastyr University course have been met. In some cases a competency or challenge exam may be required before the waiver will be granted. Students are advised to refer to policies governing competency or challenge examinations in the Aca - demic Policy and Procedure Manual. The waiver decision rests with the chair of the department responsible for teaching the curriculum. Appeals may be made to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled, whose decision is final. SuBStitutioN In some cases, students may request to substitute one Bastyr University course for another Bastyr course if the courses are the same in terms of content, level and credit and meet or exceed the academic objectives and competencies of the required course. Substitution both grants credits and eliminates the necessity for taking the required course. For additional information regarding transfer, waiver or substitution of credit, please contact the advising/evaluations unit in the registrar's office.

The center also coordi-nates course offerings for the Center for Spirituality, Science and Medicine. CENTER FOR SPIRITUALITY , SCIENCE AND MEDICINE The Center for Spirituality, Science and Medicine (CSSM) was created in November 2009 to support Bastyr University's commitment to multidisci - plinary exploration of the deep questions at the heart of spiritual and scientific inquiry. As an expression of Bastyr's mission and vision, CSSM hosts courses and conversations devoted to illuminating the interfaces, connections and congruence between spirituality, General Informa t Ion ~ Interd IsCIPlInary studIes ~ sPIrItu al Ity, sCIenCe and medICIne27 science, nature and medicine. CSSM shares re- sources and develops collaborative relationships with organizations and individuals who work on the frontiers of this exploration. Its primary ambition is to contribute to the cultivation of wisdom and wholeness in the practice of medicine. CENTER FOR STUDENT RESEARCH The University established the Center for Student Research (CSR) in 2010 as the central institutional point of contact for students who desire to do formal scientific research at Bastyr University. The CSR informs students about ongoing research projects at Bastyr and links students to appropriate faculty mentors depending on the research interest. It also provides funding, through competitive awards, for faculty-student research projects. These grants have provided the necessary support for students to complete required master's theses as well as conduct research outside their program curricula. Encourag-ing the ambitions of the University's aspiring student researchers is one way Bastyr maintains its leadership role in natural health arts and sciences research. LIBRARY Established in 1980, the Bastyr University Library comprises a vital multimedia collection focusing on the natural health arts and sciences. The library serves the Kenmore, Washington, campus, the Ba-styr Center for Natural Health, in Seattle, and the California campus in San Diego. Scholarly resources include state-of-the-art da- tabases, e-journals, anatomy models, DVDs and a specialized print collection. Library staff, experts in medical resources and in the subject area of complementary and alternative medicine, promote intellectual curiosity by encouraging questions and inquiry. Students in all programs receive focused in-struction in research-oriented classes and individual instruction tailored to their needs. The main campus library, in Kenmore, features distinctive two-story- high windows, creating a bright, welcoming space for studying.

The registrar's office will check the prerequisites of nonmatriculated students entering into undergradu-ate courses before registering them for the course. poStBaccalaureate preparatory prograM Students who have earned a bachelor's degree may apply for admission to a postbaccalaureate preparatory program. These programs are designed for students who are planning to apply for the Master of Science (MS) in Nutrition program or the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program at Bastyr University and intend to enroll in courses at the University totaling six (6) or more credits per term while fulfilling prerequisite requirements. Post-baccalaureate preparatory programs are individually designed to permit students to meet outstanding prerequisite requirements and must be completed within one year. Students enrolled in a preparatory program must meet standards of satisfactory prog-ress and minimum standards of admissibility for the degree program in which they wish to matriculate. Bastyr University offers only a limited selection of prerequisite coursework. For detailed information, contact the admissions office. Students enrolled in the postbaccalaureate prepa- ratory program are eligible for financial aid. Please contact the financial aid office for an application packet or additional information. prerequiSite WaiverS Some prerequisite course requirements may be waived based on a documented learning experience. Applicants who wish to request such a waiver must submit a completed petition to waive a prerequisite form to the admissions office.29 these students, matriculation is contingent on suc- cessful completion of the requirements outstanding at the time of acceptance. They must return a non-refundable deposit within two weeks of receipt of the acceptance letter to hold a place in the class. The deposit is credited toward tuition at registration. Ap-plicants have six business days from the University's receipt of their deposit in which to request return of the deposit. Following this time, deposits are nonrefundable, even if applicants decide to reapply and enroll in a subsequent year. Offers of admission are made for a specific quarter of a specific year. For most degree programs, stu-dents are admitted only in the fall quarter. An admissions file may be examined by the student (with the exception of confidential recom-mendations) only after acceptance and enrollment. Files remain the property of the University, and information contained within cannot be returned to or copied for the student. Certain items submitted for admission to the University are not considered to be part of a student's permanent academic record. Those items are therefore purged from the file upon receipt by the registrar's office. depoSit S All candidates for admission who have been accepted into a program at Bastyr University are required to pay a nonrefundable deposit ($200 for degree programs, $100 for certificate programs 1) to hold a place in the entering class. The deposit is credited toward the student's first quarter tuition. Applicants should be aware that the University may, without notice and at the discretion of the admissions committee, offer to another student the place of any applicant whose deposit has not been submitted within the specified time. Accepted students who wish to take a summer course (i.e., general or organic chemistry), must pay a separate $100 nonrefundable deposit to hold their place in the summer class. This summer quarter deposit is credited toward the student's summer tuition. Continuing students are not required to pay a deposit for summer courses. Currently enrolled students who have been ac- cepted into an additional program at the University are not required to pay a deposit. 1For fall 2014, the deposit will be $300 for graduate professional programs, $200 for undergraduate, certificate and postbaccalaure- ate programs.General admIssIons applicatioN priority deadliNeS Bastyr University accepts applications on a rolling basis until all available spaces are filled. Application dates are as follows: November 1 ND Early Decision 1 February 1 ND Priority MSMW Priority MSN Priority March 15 All other programs 1Applicants who have three or fewer outstanding prerequisites may apply by the early decision deadline. The early decision deadline is nonbinding. Applications received after the dates noted above are considered on a space-available basis. Applicants who wish to apply for a quarter other than fall should first check with the admissions office to see if they qualify to begin courses out of sequence. Applications for the Dietetic Internship program must be postmarked by the February deadline set by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. iNtervie WS Interviews are required for clinical, professional and certificate programs. Applicants are required to interview at the campus to which they are applying. Telephone interviews may be granted in exceptional circumstances. SelectioN factorS Bastyr University is committed to providing quality education in the natural health arts and sciences. We encourage individuals from underrep-resented minority groups to apply. The University supports equality of educational opportunity and, therefore, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, marital status, gender, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, age, religion, creed, veterans' status or handicap in admission or access to its programs and activities. For detailed program information, refer to the required skills and abilities section (if applicable) in the appropriate school section. acceptaNce Following completion of the application process, a letter of acceptance is sent to those students se-lected. Those students who are making satisfactory progress toward the completion of their prerequisite requirements may be accepted with conditions. For 30 deferral of eNrollMeNt Applicants who have accepted their offers of ad- mission may request a deferral of their application for up to one year. The admissions committee re-views the request and will either approve or deny the request. If re-admitted the following year, deferred application students must pay the deposit for their program to hold their spot in the class. If students fail to make this deposit, the deferral is rescinded and the initial deposit forfeited. graduate -level traNSfer credit S aNd advaNced StaNdiNg StatuS Students who have completed professional doc- toral programs may be considered for advanced standing status. Students who have attended, but not graduated from, similar graduate or professional programs may receive transfer credit for individual courses but are not considered advanced standing students. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a re-gional accrediting agency that is recognized by the American Council on Education Commission on Recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation or from an institution accredited by the CNME, ACAOM or MEAC. Graduate and professional students must complete at least two-thirds of their credits at Bastyr University. Specific information regarding transfer and advanced standing status policies for the naturo-pathic medicine program is included in that school's section (page 67). Specific information regarding transfer policies for AOM programs is included in the acupuncture and Oriental medicine section (page 83). Midwifery transfer policies are available under the program description (page 43). uNdergraduate aNd coMMuNity college traNSfer credit S aNd reStricted courSeS Bastyr University accepts undergraduate transfer credits earned at any regionally accredited college or university, provided the courses are similar in content and taught at the same level as courses within the curricula of Bastyr University. As the University is an upper-division, degree-completion institution, all undergraduates are transfer students. A maximum of 135 quarter credits or 90 semester credits may be transferred toward an undergraduate degree, and students must complete a minimum of 45 quarter credits at Bastyr to earn a University undergraduate degree. Ninety quarter or 60 semester credits may be transferred from a community college. An additional 10 credits may be accepted from a com-munity college in the following areas if the content of the courses is determined to be equivalent to the required courses at Bastyr University: organic chemistry, biochemistry, anatomy and physiology, microbiology, botany, physics, statistics, develop-mental psychology, abnormal psychology, social psychology and psychology of personality. Once a student has matriculated into Bastyr, additional credits over 90 will not be transferred from a com-munity college. All entering undergraduate students are required to have at least a 2.75 cumulative grade point average, with a grade of C (2.0) or better in all required courses. Exceptional applicants who do not meet this minimum requirement will be reviewed on a case by case basis. T ransfer students who hold an approved direct-transfer associate de-gree from a Washington state community college are given priority consideration in accordance with the Washington Inter-College T ransfer and Articu- lation agreement. Admission to Bastyr University is competitive. All applicants are evaluated on the basis of academic records, narrative statement and applicable experience. Undergraduate students may transfer a maximum of three quarter credits of one-credit physical edu-cation courses toward the required 180 graduation credits. A maximum of 15 vocational, technical, CLEP or military credits may be applied to the elective credit total. Noncollege courses, such as remedial composition, intermediate algebra and English as a second language, are nontransferable. For further information refer to the Academic Policies section starting on page 14 and the \"T rans- fer of Credit to Bastyr University\" policy in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. applicaNt S WhoSe firSt laNguage iS Not eNgliSh All applicants for whom English is a second lan- guage must present evidence of proficiency in the English language in one of the following ways: Official TOEFL exam results on the Internet- based test (iBT) with a score of 79 with a minimum of 20 in the speaking section, 213 on the computer-based test Two quarters or semesters of enrollment in liberal arts courses taught in English, totaling at least 15 quarter credits (10 semester credits) of college transferable credits (not including vocational coursework or English as a second language), completed at an accredited U.S. or Canadian school, with GPA of 3.0 or greater General admIssIons31 (no single course less than a C- grade or 1.7 on a 4.00 scale) (Please note that the Admis-sions Committee reserves the right to request further English proficiency documentation or the TOEFL results if desired.) Completion of Level 6 from any ACE Lan- guage Institute in the United States within the last two years from date of expected entry into a Bastyr University program TOEFL scores more than two years old will not be accepted. The Bastyr University code for the TOEFL exam is #9839. Admitted students whose first language is not English may also be required to take additional elective credits and/or training to improve their language skills. iNterNatioNal StudeNt S To be eligible for enrollment at Bastyr University, all international student applicants must submit an application, application fee, letters of recommenda-tion (if needed), documentation of sufficient funds (see below), official transcripts or an evaluation sent from a foreign credential evaluation service, a copy of their passport and a current photograph. Applicants who speak English as a second language are required to submit official exam results outlined in the section Applicants Whose First Language Is Not English. (See above.) Official transcripts from any college or university outside the United States must be translated and evaluated, course-by-course, by an independent evaluation service. There is a charge for this evalua-tion. The service will forward the evaluated transcript to Bastyr University at the applicant's request. Housing is available on a first-come, first-served basis in our Student Village on the Kenmore campus. Apartments and houses are also available for rent near the Kenmore campus, Bastyr Center for Natural Health in Seattle and Bastyr University California. International students must enroll as full-time, degree-seeking students and comply with all re - lated immigration policies for the F-1 student visa program. Federal laws require that international students maintain adequate health insurance while attend-ing Bastyr University. All admitted F-1 students will be required to purchase coverage through Ba-styr University or submit a waiver form providing documentation of comparable insurance coverage valid in the United States for the duration of study.f-1 S tudeNt viSaS A nonimmigrant student and his/her spouse and/ or children may be admitted into the United States in the F-1 classification during their course of full-time study. This does not include those applicants who hold dual citizenship, are lawful permanent residents (or have received confirmation from the U.S. Custom and Immigration Service [USCIS] of an adjustment of status to Lawful Permanent Resident), have a valid business visa, or, if by blood percentage, are 50 percent or more North American Indian. However, Bastyr University requires official documentation of such status. Students with cur-rent F-1 visas transferring to Bastyr University must forward a copy of their current I-20. docuMeNtatioN of SufficieNt fuNdS International students must provide complete and accurate documentation of sufficient funds in order to qualify for a student visa. The total of these funds must cover the cost of the first year of school, books, insurance and living expenses. Official bank statements as proof of liquid assets are required to document suf-ficient funds. A signed affidavit of support (available from the admissions office) is required if the bank state-ment/account proving the availability of required funds is not in the student's name. The amount required to cover expenses for the first year is dependent upon the program of study. If you have dependents who will apply for F-2 visas, the cost of living expenses for the spouse and/or children must be provided. The current cost of total expenses for each student and the cost of living per each dependent is listed on the 1-20 docu-mentation worksheet, which is part of the application packet for international students. fiNaNcial aSSiStaNce aNd eMployMeNt International students are not eligible for U.S. federal or state-funded student aid programs but may obtain private loans with a U.S. citizen or resident as a cosigner. Canadian students also have access to the Canadian federal student loan program and most provincial loans. Documentation of sufficient fund-ing is required for F-1 students because off-campus employment is prohibited by the USCIS during the first year of study. International students are limited to no more than 20 hours a week of on-campus employment while school is in session and may work full-time during vacation periods, as long as they have maintained status and intend to register for the follow - ing term. Bastyr University has a very limited amount of international employment money available. General admIssIons32 fiNaNcial aid The role of the financial aid office at Bastyr Univer- sity is to assist students in obtaining the funding they need to reach their educational goals. Bastyr University participates in the full range of state and federal student financial aid programs. Student eligibility is determined following the state and federal regulations that apply to each particular aid program. Graduate students primarily rely on federal edu- cational loan programs, including Federal Direct unsubsidized and Graduate PLUS loans, and the Perkins loan program. Employment opportunities are provided by the federal and state work-study programs. Additional support is provided by scholarship pro- grams administered by Bastyr University from both endowed programs and University resources. Undergraduate students are also eligible for all of the programs mentioned above except Graduate PLUS loans, but parents of dependent undergraduate students may apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS loan. Undergraduate students may also be eligible for subsidized Federal Direct Stafford loans and federal grants (Pell grants and Federal Supplemental Educa-tional Opportunity grants). Washington state residents may be eligible for a Washington State Need Grant. Private loan programs also provide a supplemental source of funding to students. These loans require a positive credit history and/or a co-signer with good credit. All international students are eligible for Uni - versity-funded scholarships and grants as well as on-campus employment from University funds. Financial Aid Deadlines: There are no formal University deadlines. However, undergraduate students are encouraged to apply by April 1 in order to receive consideration for several external grant programs with early deadlines. All students are encouraged to apply for financial aid at least 90 days before the first quarter of attendance. Detailed information on application procedures, program costs, and financial aid funding are pub-lished annually in the Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook. The Bastyr University Financial Aid Handbook and financial aid application are located on the Bastyr website and the MyBU student portal. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Federal student aid regulations mandate that students who wish to be considered for financial aid must be making satisfactory progress in a degree or certificate program. This requirement applies to the entire period of enrollment at Bastyr University, even though students may not have received finan-cial aid for some periods of enrollment. Satisfactory academic progress is currently reviewed at the end of each spring quarter. It is also students' responsibility to monitor their own progress. All students must meet the published academic standards for their individual programs. Students placed on suspension or limited suspension are not eligible for financial aid. Undergraduate students awarded a State Need Grant must complete at least 50 percent of the credits for which they received funding for that quarter. Failure to complete the required number of credits each quarter will result in cancellation of subsequent disbursements. Satisfactory academic progress is monitored at the end of each quarter for this program. See the student portal (MyBU) under Financial Aid menu option for the complete satisfactory aca-demic progress policy for financial aid eligibility. Required Return of Federal Financial Aid The University is required to return federal Title VI funds when a student fully withdraws during the first 60 percent of any quarter. Please see the student portal (MyBU) under financial aid for the complete policy. Required Return of State Financial AidThe University is required to return state finan- cial aid when a student fully withdraws during the first half of any quarter. Please see the student portal (MyBU) under financial aid for the complete policy. Gainful Employment ComplianceAs of July 1, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education will require institutions who participate in the student financial assistance programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, to report certain information about students enrolled in their Title IV eligible programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized oc-cupation. At this time, the regulations only apply to the certificate programs in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Holistic Landscape Design. The following links to our website will provide that information: Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine www.herbal1.bastyr.eduCertificate in Holistic Landscape Design www.landscape.bastyr.eduGeneral admIssIons33 bastyr under Graduate ProGrams BASTYR UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS MiSSioN StateMeNt for uNdergraduate prograMS The mission of the Bastyr University bachelor's de- gree completion programs is to help each student build a strong foundation of basic knowledge and skills, as well as foster a greater understanding of health of body, mind and spirit. viSioN StateMeNt for uNdergraduate prograMS Bastyr University bachelor's degree completion pro- grams provide students with opportunities to develop competency in basic skills such as written and verbal communication, critical thinking and the ability to work cooperatively with others. The degree completion programs also provide students with opportunities to develop competency in the fundamental theories, models, core knowledge and skills of their major field of study. The degree completion programs uniquely empha- size the importance of holism and the natural health arts and sciences. The programs provide students with opportunities to develop a deeper understanding of the interconnections between body, mind and spirit and learn to foster wellness in themselves and others through approaches found in the natural health arts and sciences. uNdergraduate educatioN at BaStyr uNiverSity As Bastyr University continues to develop un- dergraduate degree offerings, we strive to maintain consistency across all programs in terms of admis-sions requirements, shared courses, double majors and undergraduate student support. The under-graduate experience at Bastyr encompasses a range of academic programs, which are coordinated by the Undergraduate Committee. Admissions require - ments, the structure of interdisciplinary courses, double majors and general policy issues affecting undergraduates are all considered by this committee. The Undergraduate Committee works closely with the admissions office to ensure that applicants who meet all basic criteria are admitted to the University and to the undergraduate program of their choice.the uNdergraduate MajorS Exercise Science and Wellness (For curriculum see page 50.)

Nutrition and Culinary Arts (For curriculum see page 54.) Nutrition with DPD (For curriculum see page 52.) Nutrition and Exercise Science (For curriculum see page 53.) full-tiMe expectatioNS The undergraduate curricula are designed for full- time participants. Students may complete a program on a part-time basis but should recognize that there may be scheduling conflicts between required cours-es. It is the responsibility of a student who wishes to complete a program on a part-time basis to work with an advisor to arrange an appropriate schedule. Special sections will not be offered to accommodate the needs of part-time students. douBle MajorS for uNdergraduate StudeNt S Bastyr University will allow students to complete two majors, provided students are in good standing at the time they wish to declare their second major. The second major cannot be declared until the second quarter of attendance. However, students may start attending courses required for the second major in their first quarter of attendance. Students must submit a declaration of double major form to the registrar's office at the time the major is declared. Students are required to have their program of study approved by the appropriate chair(s) and/or dean(s) at the time the double major is declared. There are no predetermined schedules for the double majors. It is the student's responsibility to create appropriate schedules for double major com-binations. Students must meet quarterly with the undergraduate advisor in the registrar's office for as-sistance in tracking the progress of the two majors. Students are advised that declaring a double major will increase the amount of time it takes to graduate. 34 The minimum amount of time to complete any double major is three years. If the required courses for any quarter exceed the limit on student credit loads as outlined on page 17 of the Bastyr University Catalog, the student must obtain permission from the academic chairs of both majors. Students earning a double major must usually complete no fewer than 220 credits. The credit re-quirement total for double majors is determined by the total of the prerequisite basic proficiency, science and general education credits, the major core credits in both programs and any elective credit requirement with defined parameters for one or both majors (for example, two activity credits required for exercise science and wellness majors). Where duplication exists between the two majors, the student is not required to make up the credits represented by the duplication.

DEPARTMENT OF BASIC SCIENCES The Department of Basic Sciences offers a Bach- elor of Science with a Major in Integrated Human Biology. The department also provides courses for most of Bastyr University's programs. The basic sciences curriculum is designed to meet the specific competencies and learning objectives within each program. The basic sciences department's mission is to promote an optimal learning environment in which Bastyr University students can develop a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will serve their continued development in their chosen fields of endeavor. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to systematically integrate the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and func-tion. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expres-sion of Bastyr University's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become totally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. Bachelor of ScieNce With a Major iN iNtegrated huMaN Biology The innovative integrated human biology program is designed to connect concepts from physiology, anatomy, cell biology and genetics, rather than separating the concepts into courses by discipline. This distinct approach allows students to achieve a unified understanding of the structure and function of the human body. The curriculum encourages both individual and collaborative learn-ing and fosters the development of communication skills. The program emphasizes scientific process and research skills through inquiry-based labs and re-search-methods courses. Interested students will also have an opportunity to work with a faculty mentor to complete an original research project. Students may also take elective coursework in psychology, nutrition, herbal sciences and other disciplines that provide a broad perspective on human health. The integrated human biology degree provides a firm foundation in biological science and fosters the development of critical thinking skills that are an excellent foundation for careers in medicine and research. adMiSSioN For general information on the admissions pro- cess, please refer to the Admissions section in this catalog.

Promote birth as a normal process requiring a minimum of intervention. Function within the health care system, con- sulting and referring appropriately. Qualify for licensure or registration in a variety of jurisdictions, including certification by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). Promote midwifery through state, provincial and national professional organizations, the political process, research activities and policy development. Work in partnership with the women they serve in a way that promotes personal responsibil-ity, validates knowledge and experience, and encourages lifelong learning. Promote the Midwives Model of Care. prograM overvie W Bastyr's direct-entry midwifery program trains students in all aspects of midwifery practice, prepar - ing them to offer safe, high-quality maternity care to women and their families. The rigorous, proven curriculum makes use of state-of-the art technologies and a well-qualified, approved network of clinical training sites, includ-ing the opportunity for foreign clinical experience. The curriculum meets all of the core competencies and skills as identified by the Midwives Alliance of North American (MANA) and the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). Studies in related fields such as epidemiology, nutrition, pharmacology, genetics, embryology, counseling and education as well as anti-racism training build skills necessary for the practice of culturally versatile competent midwifery. The department welcomes students who have previous midwifery training or practicing mid - wives who have not attended a formal midwifery educational program and/or want to earn a degree. All students in the program must meet the transfer credit requirements and complete at least two-thirds of the program and all of the practicum while en-rolled at Bastyr. Graduates qualify for national certification as a Certified Professional Midwife (CPM) and, depend-ing on regional requirements, may sit for licensure or provincial registration. required aBilitieS aNd SkillS for MidWifery prograM adMiSSioN The Department of Midwifery welcomes ap- plicants who are differently-abled. Applicants will have the opportunity to discuss the impact that their limitations may have on both their ability to success-fully complete the midwifery program at Bastyr and their ability to practice midwifery after graduation. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is designed to protect persons with disabilities from discrimination. It recommends that the essential functions necessary for performing the proposed job or schooling be fully described so that the candidate can determine if he or she can perform these functions. The following is a list of the essential functions of a midwife and a midwifery student in our program: Observation A midwifery applicant should be able to: Use reflective skills to perform self-evaluation of midwifery knowledge and skills and precep-tor/site evaluation of clinical skills and suitable learning environment. Observe/ visually assess a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Communication A midwifery applicant should be able to: Speak to, hear and understand clients and their families. Perceive non-verbal cues and, describe changes in mood or emotion. Communicate sensitively and effectively with clients using verbal, non-verbal and written methods regarding clinical issues. Communicate verbally and in writing with classmates, instructors, staff, preceptors and professional colleagues. Motor A midwifery applicant should be able to: Perform general clinical skills for conducting a complete physical examination, including pelvic assessments.44 sChool of natural health arts and sCIenCes Perform fine motor skills such as suturing, start- ing IVs, , injecting, performing venipuncture. Lift and reposition clients. Correctly administer medications. Execute motor skills necessary in emergency treatment such as resuscitation and control of hemorrhage. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantita- tive A midwifery applicant should be able to: Read, understand/interpret and apply technical and scientific material. Memorize facts and test successfully for them. Solve complex problems by synthesizing knowledge obtained from books, classes and clinical experiences. Write coherent essays. Research topics relevant to midwifery practice and present findings. Develop and exercise clinical judgment and decision-making skills. Behavioral and Social Attributes A midwifery applicant should be able to: Maintain own mental and physical health. Function effectively under stress. Display flexibility in the face of uncertainty. Demonstrate compassion, maturity, integrity, motivation and interest. Not use illegal or legal medications, drugs, or alcohol that may impair judgment. While in a clinical site, preceptor at all times of the day or night for work as a midwifery student. Work long and irregular hours, sometimes with little break, or for days at a time. The ADA allows employers, schools or adjunct clinical faculty to ask if applicants can perform these essential functions. They can ask applicants to describe or demonstrate how they will perform an essential function. They can also test applicants for aptitude, physical agility, intelligence and spe-cific skills. Bastyr and Department of Midwifery staff are available to help applicants, students and precep-tors propose reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities. MidWifery MaSter 'S, coMBiNed Bachelor 'S/MaSter 'S prograM The Master of Science (MS) in Midwifery is avail- able to students who already hold a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college/university and who complete the program prerequisites prior to en-tering the program. The combined Bachelor/Master of Science (BS/MS) in Midwifery option is available to students who have completed at least two years at the undergraduate level (60 semester or 90 quarter credits), including the basic science and proficiency prerequisites and general education requirements. Both degrees are awarded simultaneously at the completion of the program. BleNded curriculuM Model One of the most exciting aspects of the program is its blended curriculum. This hybrid delivery system allows students to remain in their communities and commute to the Bastyr campus three times each quarter. Each cohort of students (determined by year of entry) attends the same onsite weeks together, which allows for the face-to-face learning experience that is vital to midwifery training and allows students to build strong relationships with classmates and faculty. When not physically on campus, students use the Internet classroom to correspond with classmates and instructors, conduct post discussions, turn in homework and take tests. MidWifery curriculuM The midwifery program addresses both the art and science of midwifery by integrating theory with clinical experience. The Midwifery Care courses are the foundation of the program. All courses build skills necessary for the practice of midwifery through the use of case questions, skills-practice labs, role-playing, discussion, student presentations and research projects. Clinical skills and judgment are honed during practicum with practicing midwives. The midwifery curriculum is enhanced by studies in related fields such as epidemiology, nutrition, pharmacology, genetics, embryology, counseling and education. cliNical experieNce The Department of Midwifery places all students in qualified clinical training sites. The program replicates the age-old apprenticeship model in which students work side-by-side with experienced preceptors who are licensed midwives and other professionals. Students are placed with preceptors in the community to integrate the skills learned in the classroom. At least two years of clinical training is required at a minimum of two clinical sites in North 45 sChool of natural health arts and sCIenCes America. Optimal training sites include homebirth settings, birth centers, clinics and hospitals. Department staff works closely with each student to arrange these clinical placements. Students must live within a one-hour commute of a qualified preceptor site and may be required to relocate tem-porarily in order to meet graduation requirements if the community in which they reside does not have adequate clinical training opportunities. Personal flexibility and the support of family members are essential to manage possible separation and eco-nomic challenges. In quarter two, prior to being placed in an ap- proved clinical site, students are required to complete a non-credit-bearing course titled Introduction to Practicum. This course includes an introduction to clinical tracking and requirements necessary for the midwifery program's clinical placements as well as an orientation designed to prepare students to work effectively in a midwifery clinical preceptorship. The clinical practicum begins in the third quarter of the program. Students may begin Practicum slowly, primarily observing for the first few months. Student participation in their preceptorships mir-rors what they are learning in the classroom. Basic clinical skills, such as performing blood draws, IVs, physical and pelvic exams, pap smears, neonatal resuscitation, etc., are all taught in the classroom first. Students will be required to obtain training in adult CPR, have a TB test, be rubella immune and pass a criminal background check. A fee will be charged in MW4810 for the background check. Students returning from a leave of absence will be required to have clinical skills assessed and may need remedial skills training before becoming eligible for a practicum assignment. Students may obtain their clinical experience in gynecology/family planning clinics, prenatal/post-partum clinics, homebirth settings, birth centers and hospitals in North America as well as overseas. (See Graduation Requirements below for specifics about clinical training requirements.) Students may work with licensed midwives, certified professional mid-wives, certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, foreign midwives, naturopathic doctors, physician assistants or physicians. Preceptors must be prac-ticing legally and serve a large enough obstetrical/gynecological population to adequately instruct, supervise and evaluate students' clinical training. The Department of Midwifery screens and approves all potential clinical preceptors before students are placed in clinical training sites. adMiSSioN For general information on the admissions process, please refer to the Admissions section in this catalog.

The department's vision is to be the leader in advanc- ing a holistic view of nutrition and exercise through excellence in education, research and clinical practice.48 The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Science prepares graduates to critically evaluate sci- entific literature and to incorporate current research and advances in nutrition and exercise science. The nutrition program within the Department of Nutri-tion and Exercise Science is unique in its emphasis on whole foods and multicultural, political and ecological dimensions of food. These aspects of nutrition, blended with biochemistry and physiol-ogy, reflect the University's natural health sciences philosophy. The concept of food as medicine and the con- cept of diet as a critical component in healing are fundamental to natural therapeutics, optimal health and whole-person healing. The Exercise Science and Wellness program approaches health and wellness from a holistic perspective unique to Bastyr Uni-versity. This focus on overall wellness, combined with the science behind it, provides students with a broad education in health and wellness from a preventative viewpoint. The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence offers bachelor's of science degrees with majors in nutrition, exercise science and wellness, nutrition and culinary arts, and nutrition and exercise science. In conjunction with the Bachelor of Science in Nu-trition, the department offers a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) that meets the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) academic requirements leading to eligibility to apply for a dietetic internship. There are three Master of Science offerings in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Science: the Master of Science in Nutrition (T raditional), the Master of Science in Nutrition with Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) and the Master of Science in Nutrition and Clinical Health Psychol-ogy (CHP). In addition, the Dietetic Internship based on the Academy's standards of education is offered to provide performance requirements for entry-level dietitians through supervised practice. For information about each of these programs, refer to the following pages: Bachelor of Science with a Major in Exercise Sci- ence and Wellness page 50 Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition page 49 Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition and Culinary Arts page 53 Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition and Exercise Science page 53 Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition with DPD page 51 Master of Science in Nutrition ( T raditional ) page 55 Master of Science in Nutrition and Clinical Health Psychology page 56 Master of Science in Nutrition with DPD page 58 Dietetic Internship page 60 required aBilitieS /SkillS for NutritioN / exerciSe ScieNce prograM StudeNt S A nutrition and/or exercise science student must be able to demonstrate appropriate communication skills; intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quan-titative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. A student should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. Communication: A student must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with others, including with patients if the student is in a clini-cal program and with preceptors in a practicum or internship. Ability to communicate respectfully and thoughtfully, even in situations of disagreement or stress, is important. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The stu-dent must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in both oral and written form. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, which is a critical skill for nutritionists or exercise scientists in both clinical and research settings, requires all of these intellectual abilities. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A student must possess the emotional health required for full uti-lization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the academic and clinical program, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with others. A student must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. The student must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in clinical, practicum and research problems the student may face. Compas-sion, a caring attitude, interpersonal skills, emotional maturity and initiative are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and education processes.sChool of natural health arts and sCIenCes49 UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence offers four bachelor's-level undergraduate programs that are consistent with the overall focus and mission of the department. After initial selection of a degree program, stu- dents must receive approval from the chair of the department in order to change programs. expected learNiNg outcoMeS The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Science has established the following expected learning outcome categories for all its Bachelor of Science programs: Biological/medical sciences Quantitative and qualitative reasoning Research Critical thinking skills Communication General health and wellness Nutrition Whole foods Exercise science Professionalism Promotion of the University's and the depart- ment's missions and visions Bachelor of ScieNce With a Major iN NutritioN The Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutri- tion prepares students for positions such as dietetic technicians and nutrition educators, under the su-pervision of health care professionals, or for graduate work in related health science fields. adMiSSioNS For general information on the admissions pro- cess, please refer to the Admissions section in this catalog.

Bachelor of ScieNce With a Major iN exerciSe ScieNce aNd WellNeSS The Exercise Science and Wellness program provides a strong foundation in traditional exercise physiology, supplemented by study in nutritional, mental and emotional aspects of wellness. One of the primary goals of the program is to prepare graduates to sit for the certi-fication examinations of the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. This preparation is accomplished through the rigorous scientific study and subsequent application of physiological changes and adaptations that occur during various modes of physical activity in clinical, preventative and performance settings. A graduate of the Exercise Science and Wellness major may develop a career as cardiac/pulmonary rehabilitation physiologist, exercise physiologist, group exercise coordinator, exercise specialist, corporate well-ness manager, strength and conditioning coach or personal trainer. adMiSSioNS The admissions standards and prerequisites are the same as those outlined on page 49 for the un-dergraduate nutrition program with the exception that Microbiology is not required for Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Exercise Science appli-cants. Consequently, eight natural science credits are required (rather than five). graduatioN requireMeNt S Please see the graduation requirements for the undergraduate nutrition program on page 49.

Bachelor of ScieNce With a Major iN NutritioN With didactic prograM iN dieteticS (BSN/dpd) The Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) is a term used by the Academy of Nutrition and Di- etetics (the Academy) to describe a program that is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Educa-tion in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), which meets academic competencies. Currently, in the United States, the registered dietitian (RD) is the only professional credential in nutrition recognized by all 50 states and with reciprocity in five countries. Verified completion of the DPD and a minimum of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution enable a student to apply for a dietetic internship, to write the registration examination to become an RD after completing the Dietetic Intern-ship and to become an RD after successfully passing the registration examination. The mission of the program is to graduate stu- dents who will promote nutrition and well-being through food that sustains the individual, the com-munity and the earth. adMiSSioN requireMeNt S aNd prerequiSiteS Application for admission to the BSN/DPD at Bastyr University is separate from application to the degree programs. BSN/DPD application packets can be requested from the Bastyr University Office of Admissions at the beginning of spring quarter between the junior and senior year. Acceptance requires the following prerequisites in addition to those for the Bachelor of Science with a Major in Nutrition: public speaking (if general or speech com-munication, then must provide evidence of public speaking practice; this requirement is independent of any curriculum standards of the student's prior institution) and current enrollment at Bastyr Uni-versity. To be eligible for acceptance into the BSN/DPD, students must have completed their junior year and must meet all prerequisites for the BSN completion degree. To be competitive for priority admission into the BSN/DPD, the following GPAs are recommended (cumulative from all colleges and universities attended): 3.25 Cumulative overall GPA - total of all courses3.25 Cumulative science GPA - biology, organic chemistry, anatomy and physiology, microbiol-ogy and biochemistry courses only 3.00 Cumulative nutrition GPA - all nutrition courses A minimum of 150 hours of volunteer and/or paid work experience is required prior to being admitted to the BSN/DPD. Documentation of hours with signature of sponsor is required. Specific information and forms for documenting these expe-riences is available from the admissions department. The following is a breakdown of the volunteer and/or paid work hours required for admission: Minimum of 50 hours clinical nutrition (in- patient hospital and/or long-term care) Minimum of 50 hours food service management Minimum of 50 hours community nutrition graduatioN requireMeNt S In their final year, it is recommended that BSN/ DPD students meet with the DPD director for aca-demic advising each quarter prior to registration to sChool of natural health arts and sCIenCes52 discuss academic progress and as part of the Dietetic Internship application process. A total of 300 hours of volunteer and/or paid work experience is required to graduate from the BSN/DPD (inclusive of the 150 hours obtained prior to admission to the pro-gram). The following is a breakdown of those hours: Total of 100 hours clinical nutrition (in-patient and/or long-term care direct patient contact) Total of 100 hours food service managementTotal of 100 hours community nutrition Leadership by participation in the Bastyr Univer- sity Student Nutrition Association (SNA) is strongly encouraged, and becoming a student member of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is required. A signed verification statement is required to enable students to be eligible for entry into an ac-credited dietetic internship. In order to receive a signed verification statement, 300 nutrition-related volunteer and/or paid hours must first be com-pleted, signed and verified by the DPD director. Second, students must pass the DPD exit exam with a passing grade of 70 percent. Third, students must complete all the required coursework with a graduating cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion of the DPD program does not guarantee acceptance into a dietetic internship. All other policies and procedures related to the BSN/DPD program are located on MyBU under the Department of Nutri-tion and Exercise Science. accreditatioN The Bachelor of Science Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) at Bastyr University is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) (120 South Riv-erside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL, 60606-6995, 800.877.1600, ext. 5400, acend@eatright.org), a specialized accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

GRADUATE PROGRAMS The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence offers three master's-level graduate programs that are consistent with the overall focus and mission of the department. The first option is the Master of Science in Nutrition (MSN/T raditional), which culminates in a research thesis. The second option is the Master of Science in Nutrition and Clinical Health Psychology (MSN/CHP), which combines training in nutrition and clinical health psychology. The third option is the Master of Science in Nutri-tion with the Didactic Program in Dietetics (MSN/DPD). This option provides the academic part of the requirements to become a registered dietitian. The MSN/DPD at Bastyr University is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutri-tion and Dietetics (ACEND) (120 Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, 60606-6995, 800.877.1600, ext. 5400, email: acend@eatright.org), a specialized accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. sChool of natural health arts and sCIenCes55 After initial selection of a degree program, a student must receive approval from the chair of the department in order to change programs. expected learNiNg outcoMeS The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Sci- ence has established the following expected learning outcome categories for all its master's of science programs: Biological/medical sciences Quantitative reasoning/critical thinking/re- search Nutrition Whole foods Natural medicine Communication Physical activity Promotion of the University's and the depart- ment's missions and visions MaSter of ScieNce iN NutritioN (traditioNal ) The purpose of the Master of Science in Nu- trition (T raditional) is to provide students with a solid overview of nutritional science, theory and research in preparation for future doctoral study or for employment in research and development, public policy, or the prevention and wellness field.

If a student completes the credit requirements for the degree but requires more time to complete the thesis, that student will have two options. Option 1 - The student can register for Thesis Con- tinuation. Thesis Continuation is a 0.0 credit \"course\" that maintains the student's enrollment at Bastyr Uni-versity. The fee for Thesis Continuation is equivalent to the tuition for one credit. The registration and payment deadlines for Thesis Continuation are the same as those published for regular registration activities. Students who do not register for Thesis Continuation or fail to pay the fee are not permitted to utilize faculty time or other University resources. Option 2 - The student can apply for a leave of ab- sence from the University until s/he is ready to complete and present the thesis. Students may consult with the Office of the Registrar or see Student Policies and Pro-cedures for details about applying for a leave of absence. Students on a leave of absence are not permitted to utilize faculty time or other University resources. When the student is ready to complete and present the thesis, s/he will need to register for Thesis Continuation.sChool of natural health arts and sCIenCes56 The following curriculum table lists the ten- tative schedule of courses each quarter.

The internship pro-vides an interactive set of educational experiences in which participants perform the Nutrition Care Process in a variety of settings, demonstrate profes-sional skills, perform continuous self-assessment and develop collaborative relationships to achieve desired outcomes. The program includes didactic coursework via seminars, group projects and indi-vidual self-enrichment experiences. Interns gain experience in medical nutrition therapy, community nutrition and food service ad-ministration. Interns develop insight into the unique nutritional needs of populations from all stages of the life cycle and in various degrees of health through rotation sites that include acute care and outpatient clinics, WIC programs and food service departments. The Bastyr University Dietetic Internship has a concentration in natural medicine and whole food nutrition. Interns have the opportunity to practice with clinicians in the naturopathic program and in the acupuncture and Oriental medicine program at the University's teaching clinic, Bastyr Center for Natural Health. Interns create whole-food menus and consider the environmental impacts of food choices. The internship is a full-time program (minimum of 40 hours per week) meeting the requirements for 1200 minimum supervised practice hours. The program also includes didactic hours, enrichment hours, and hours for orientation and evaluation, as well as vacation and holidays. Interns are required to register for 15 graduate credits, which may be applied toward the elective requirements of the Master of Science in Nutrition degree at Bastyr University upon acceptance into the master's program. The graduate course content is structured to complement the supervised practice component of the internship. The internship gradu-ate courses follow, listed in the order taken: Cat.

The U.S. Department of Labor defines naturo- pathic physicians as doctors who \"diagnose, treat, and help prevent diseases using a system of practice that is based on the natural healing capacity of individuals. May use physiological, psychological or mechanical methods. May also use natural medi-cines, prescription or legend drugs, foods, herbs, or other natural remedies.\" Most naturopathic physicians provide natural medicine primary care through office-based, pri-vate practice. Many receive additional training in disciplines or modalities such as acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Naturopathic diagnosis and therapeutics are supported by scientific research drawn from peer-reviewed journals from many disciplines, including naturopathic medicine, conventional medicine, European complementary medicine, clinical nutri-tion, phytotherapy, pharmacognosy, homeopathy, psychology and spirituality. Information technology and new concepts in clinical outcomes assessment are particularly well-suited to evaluating the effec-tiveness of naturopathic treatment protocols and are being used in research, both at naturopathic medical schools and in the offices of practicing physicians. Clinical research into natural therapies has become an increasingly important focus for naturopathic physicians.SCHOOL OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINEsChool of naturoP athIC medICIne64 prograM outcoMeS A naturopathic medicine graduate of Bastyr University's School of Naturopathic Medicine will: Demonstrate an appropriate level of knowledge in both basic medical and clinical sciences.

The following policy has been adapted from the American Association of Medical Colleges guidelines to ensure that prospective students have the physical and mental capacities to perform the required duties of a naturopathic physician. A candidate for the naturopathic medicine degree must be able to demonstrate appropriate observational and communication skills, motor function, intellectual-conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, and behavioral and social maturity. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in certain of these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Observation: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to microbiologic cultures and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, cell blood count [CBC], etc.), reposition a patient, carry out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and read electrocardiograms (ECGs) and X-rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients. Examples of emergency treatment required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne67 of intravenous medication, application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, a critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing work loads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and educational processes. adMiSSioNS criteria The admissions committee of the naturopathic medicine program determines the processes and procedures that guide the selection of candidates for the naturopathic program. The committee reviews undergraduate and graduate (if applicable) academic records and performance in the required prerequisite courses. The personal statement, references, resumes and in-person interviews are also evaluated for evidence of the abilities and skills required of naturopathic physicians. The interview also explores the candidate's awareness of the practice of naturopathic medicine. Bastyr University's naturopathic medicine program is academically challenging. While no minimum GPA is specified, the mean GPA for entering students in the last five years has exceeded 3.3.iNtervie WS Qualified applicants who submit complete ap- plications and meet the prerequisites may be invited to interview. Applicants are expected to interview at the campus to which they apply, either in Kenmore, Washington, or San Diego, California. A limited number of exceptions are made to accommodate special circumstances. traNSfer StudeNt S Bastyr University accepts transfer students from natu- ropathic, medical, osteopathic and chiropractic schools and other accredited professional programs on a space-available basis. For transfer consideration, credits must be earned from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting agency or from an institution accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). T ransfer students are considered for admis-sion in accordance with the following general guidelines: Applicants must meet the same entrance re- quirements as candidates for the first-year class. Applicants who wish to transfer credits from prior coursework must demonstrate satisfactory completion of courses that are equivalent in con-tent and quality to courses given at the University. Satisfactory completion equals a grade of achieved competency, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. Applicants must provide an official transcript from the college or program from which the transfer is being requested, demonstrating that they are leaving in good academic standing, and they should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. Transfer applicants must submit a $75 transfer evaluation fee. advaNced StaNdiNg StatuS BaSed oN prior Medical educatioN Applicants who have completed professional programs may be considered for advanced stand - ing status. Those applicants who graduated from accredited chiropractic, medical or osteopathic col-leges may be eligible for advanced standing in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. All advanced standing students must complete at least two-thirds of the program and do all of their clinical work at Bastyr University. They are eligible for a maximum of 103 credits toward advanced standing. In those instances where the maximum number of advanced standing transfer credits is granted, it will take a minimum of three years (11 quarters) to complete the program. Placement de-sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne68 pends upon the amount of coursework completed in the original program, similarity of the course content and credits, age of the courses and perfor-mance in these courses. A student must provide documentation which shows the competencies of the Bastyr University course have been met. Course waivers and/or credit transfers are considered only for those courses in which applicants demonstrate a grade of achieved competence, a C or above, or a 2.0 or above. An exam to determine competency may also be required. Advanced standing applicants must complete all of the course and credit require-ments in effect at the time of their enrollment in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program. Final waiver and/or transfer credit decisions rest with the dean of the school in which the curriculum is taught. Advanced standing is determined on a case- by-case basis and depends on the type of degree program completed, the courses taken and the number of years in practice. Applicants who are eligible for advanced standing must submit a $75 advanced standing evaluation fee. Applicants must submit a catalog of course descriptions for the years they attended their pro-fessional program and should be prepared to submit additional documentation to support a thorough evaluation. If an advanced standing student is found to be deficient in some area(s) of study, s/he may be required to complete additional courses at Bastyr University. For more information on advanced standing status admission policies and procedures, contact the admissions office. BaSic ScieNceS curriculuM WithiN Naturopathic MediciNe Basic science modules within the naturopathic medicine program provide integration across sci-ence disciplines and with clinical coursework. First year basic science modules provide a foundation of core principles in anatomy, histology, embryology, biochemistry and physiology that are integrated in the context of body systems. Second year modules use the systems approach to integrate the principles of pathology, immunology and infectious diseases. Throughout the curriculum, science concepts are applied to clinical situations through integrated case discussions. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr Uni-versity's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to become to-tally absorbed in an integrated approach to learning and understanding. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers science courses that satisfy prerequisite requirements, including courses in General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry. couNSeliNg aNd health pSychology curriculuM WithiN Naturopathic MediciNe The counseling and health psychology cur- riculum serves naturopathic medical students in understanding and effecting change in the emo-tional, mental and spiritual dimensions of human functioning. The naturopathic medicine program includes six core counseling and health psychology courses. These courses are designed to build the following competencies: Study of the nature and process of healing Development of therapeutic counselor charac - teristics and communication skills Development of comfort in the role of counsel- ing physician and a sense of counseling style and skill Ability to select and implement holistic coun- seling interventions and strategies Ability to assess and stimulate psychological wellness Ability to understand and utilize the body/ mind/spirit interaction in the healing process Ability to assess psychological functioning and make clinical judgments regarding the appropriateness of treating individuals in na-turopathic practice Ability to make appropriate psychological refer- rals Naturopathic principles and cross-cultural per- spectives are woven throughout all counseling and health psychology courses in the naturopathic medicine program. For additional counseling and health psychol- ogy courses available as electives to matriculated students, please see the course listings in this catalog or the current quarterly schedule of classes.sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne69 DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE PROGRAM BotaNical MediciNe (For Department of Botanical Medicine Mission and Vision, see page 75.) Botanical medicine is a core modality for naturo- pathic physicians to use in optimizing the health and well-being of their patients. Medicinal plants have been used as food and medicine by all peoples on all continents. The importance of plants to humans has been recorded in cave paintings 60,000 years old. A contemporary renaissance in herbal medicine weds traditional use and wisdom with modern analytical methodologies for optimal medical applications for today. Empirical knowledge of plant therapeutics is based on Western and holistic thought rather than reductionist paradigms and is linked with contempo-rary scientific knowledge. The core curriculum in botanical medicine for naturopathic medical students covers fundamental plant identification and nomenclature, pharmacog-nosy, therapeutic actions, extraction principles, dosage considerations, contraindications, toxicology, herb-drug interactions, clinical applications and treatment regimens. Clinical therapeutics draws from traditional uses, naturopathic formulae and use, and from in-ternational scientific and clinical research, as well as advances in phytotherapy. Several of the materia medica courses are linked with a laboratory experience in the botanical medicine lab on campus. Completion of the required curriculum, along with the required clinical experience, prepares the student for effective and safe clinical utilization of preventive and thera-peutic botanicals. A variety of botanical medicine elective and special topic courses are offered to students in the naturo-pathic medicine program and other programs, along with independent study options. The Bastyr garden is managed by the botanical medicine department, with support from the Uni - versity and donations. It is maintained primarily by a staff garden supervisor and work-study students. The botanical medicine department continues to build an herbarium, although the vast University of Washington herbarium is used as one of Bastyr's teaching venues. The department supports a botanical medicine lab to expand class experience and provide a space for students to continue exploring their work and passion for herbs.hoMeopathic MediciNe Homeopathic medicine is a broad therapeutic modality that is integral to naturopathic medicine. Homeopathy is based on the law of similars. This principle states that a substance that is capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure an ill patient presenting a similar pattern of disease symptoms. Homeopathic medicines stimulate a person's inherent defense mechanism. The entire range of mental, emotional and physi-cal symptoms is considered with each patient. A single medicine is then chosen that addresses the complex pattern of the patient, while emphasizing the uniqueness of the individual. The homeopathic curriculum at Bastyr Univer- sity includes the basic principles and philosophy of homeopathy, materia medica of commonly used homeopathic medicines, use of the homeopathic repertory, taking a homeopathic case, homeopathic case analysis and practical therapeutics for common medical situations. phySical MediciNe Physical medicine is an integral part of naturo- pathic medicine. It includes various modalities such as hydrotherapy, osseous and soft-tissue manipula-tion, sports medicine and therapeutic exercise. The course of study and clinical training in physical medicine enable students to develop a solid foun-dation for entry into the practice of naturopathic medicine. The curriculum offers sufficient hours in manipulation to satisfy the state of Washington's licensing requirement as a naturopathic physician. The physical medicine curriculum begins by teaching students the art of touch and palpation, introduction to basic Swedish massage techniques and soft-tissue manipulation, and then progresses to osseous manipulation. SuMMer MaSSage iNteNSive Bastyr University and Bellevue Massage School Center for Healing Arts offer students a summer massage training program that allows them to ap-ply coursework taken at Bastyr University toward the Washington state requirements for massage licensure. This course cannot be audited. Students interested in further information may meet with their academic advisor in the registrar's office or with their department's program supervisor to discuss the program availability and the course prerequisites. sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne70 Naturopathic MediciNe cliNic eNtraNce prerequiSiteS Naturopathic medicine students must complete and achieve competency in all required classes prior to entering clinical training. Questions about didac-tic prerequisites for clinical ND training should be addressed to the registrar's office on campus. Students must also have completed TB screening, received a hepatitis B vaccination or signed a waiver, have a current CPR card, and submit to a national criminal background check. The criminal background check will be conducted prior to enrolling in clinical shifts. For more information, see \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual. cliNic requireMeNt S Students in the four-year program will begin clinical training in their first year. Students in the five-year program will begin clinical training in the fall quarter of their second year. Clinical training begins with observation, in which the student fol-lows supervisors through their rotations. The next year clinical training builds to active observation, with clinical skills demonstrated by the student and evaluated by the supervisor. The training supports the students to gradually and continually develop and expand their clinical skills and competence throughout their roles as novice, intermediate and experienced student clinicians. Students are required to successfully complete a minimum of 1,208 hours of clinical training. graduatioN requireMeNt S The curriculum of the naturopathic medicine program requires completion of 305.5 credits for graduation. This includes 245.5 core course credits, eight elective credits and 52 clinical credits. Students must achieve competency (grade of AC) in all 305.5 credits required in the curriculum. Students must complete all required clinical competencies in order to graduate. Students must complete at least two-thirds of their credits in residence at Bastyr University. electiveS Students in the naturopathic medicine program are required to complete eight elective credits (in-cluded in the 305.5 credit totals) during their course of study. Up to five of these credits may be satisfied by independent study. It is recommended that elective credits be spread out over the length of the student's program. Courses designated as elec-tive and special topics may fulfill this eight-credit requirement, as well as additional clinic shifts dur-ing the student's clinical training. A maximum of five elective credits from any one discipline may be used to satisfy the naturopathic medicine program elective requirement. The rule of a five-credit maxi-mum does not apply to elective credits being taken to satisfy waived credits. Elective credits covering waived course credits may be from any discipline. A student may take elective credits from any program/department. Naturopathic MediciNe prograM trackS Students who are accepted into the program and decide not to complete the program in four years must choose one of the following approved options: Extended Track-Option Extended Dual-Degree OptionAt the time of enrollment, most naturopathic medicine students are registered for the four-year track. Students who wish to change to an extended track must complete the ND change of status form (available in the registrar's office) and then meet with an advisor/evaluator, room 249. Changes may affect financial aid packages as well as the sequencing of courses. Naturopathic medicine students wanting to add a second program must switch to the extended dual track. As long as a student remains on an approved program track, there will be no course-scheduling conflicts. Students must remain on track in order to graduate on time. Students may not register off track or register ahead of track without approval from the dean's office. For additional information regarding combining naturopathic medicine with acupuncture and Oriental medicine, counseling psychology or midwifery, please contact the admissions office.

This requires a formal application to the acupuncture and Oriental medicine program through the admissions department, followed by a joint interview by both the AOM and Doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine (ND) schools. ND students who are considering applying to the School of AOM as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of attendance. The dual-degree program requires that students have successfully completed their preclinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the AOM program must switch their naturopathic program to the five-year track in order to carry a combined program load. Students with advanced medical training, e.g., DC, DO or MD, must successfully complete the first year of study in their original program before acceptance into dual status. Dual program applicants are able to utilize their basic science coursework in the natu-ropathic program toward their MSA or MSAOM. Please note that some states require Chinese herbal training for acupuncture licensure. Please see the School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine master's program description for complete informa-tion on degree and licensing requirements. dual-degree elective credit S ND/MSAOM students must complete ten elec- tive credits. ND/MSA students must complete 13 elective credits. For all dual-degree students, five of the elective credits must be from disciplines other than OM or CH. If a dual-degree student has waived a required course from either program, core course credit from the opposite program cannot be used to cover the waiver. Use of core credits would result in a shortage of overall credits.

Naturopathic MediciNe /MidWifery dual degree Students in the Bastyr University naturopathic medicine program who are academically in good standing have the opportunity to apply to the Master of Science in Midwifery (MSMW) program in February of their second year of the four-year track. This requires a formal application to the Department of Midwifery through the admissions department, followed by an interview for qualified applicants by the admissions committee of the Department of Midwifery. ND students who are considering applying to the Department of Midwifery as their second program are strongly encouraged to be enrolled as four-year track students during their first two years of atten-dance. In essence, this dual-degree program requires that students have successfully completed their preclinical ND training before they add a second degree program. Students who are accepted into the Midwifery program must subsequently switch their naturopathic program to the extended track in order to carry a combined program load. Please see the department of midwifery's program overview for complete information on education objectives and blended curriculum model. Because this model entails mandatory intensive onsite atten-dance, dual-degree students will need to have ND courses that meet during those times videotaped with the assistance of the ND department. Bachelor of ScieNce With a Major iN herBal ScieNceS BotaNical MediciNe departMeNt MiSSioN We inspire students and colleagues to carry forward the traditions and enrich the knowledge of botanical medicine with integrity. BotaNical MediciNe departMeNt viSioN We facilitate learning about plants and plant- centered medicine, guiding students to apply this knowledge toward growing, harvesting, manufacturing and clinical practice. The inclusive range of knowledge runs from traditional wisdom to contemporary scientific information, emphasizing critical and creative thought and discovery. The Bachelor of Science with a Major in Herbal Sciences is designed to provide a thorough, scientifi-cally rigorous and inspiring exploration of herbalism and its applications. The curriculum of the herbal sChool of naturoP athIC medICIne76 sciences major does not include the diagnosis and treatment of disease, but rather introduces the stu-dent to concepts of disease prevention and health maintenance using medicinal herbs. The curriculum addresses economic, historical and sociopolitical perspectives regarding herbal sciences. Addition - ally, issues related to herbal product manufacturing and quality assurance/quality control introduce the analytical aspects of herbs and herbal products. This program offers a substantial breadth of perspectives and approaches in the herbal sciences. The program is based upon scientific inquiry in the herbal sciences. Students take courses in Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Botany during the first year of this program. Beginning in the first year and heavily concentrated in the second year are courses exploring various as-pects of the herbal sciences. Introduction to Herbal Sciences, Herbal Preparations, and Herbal Medicine History and T raditions lay a foundation in the junior year. In Research Methods for Herbal Sciences, students learn to interpret scientific literature on me-dicinal herbs. In Ethnobotany, the door opens to the connection between people and plants in indigenous cultures, old and new. The senior year includes Phar-macology, Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Actions of a core of Materia Medica, deepening the knowledge base. Northwest Herbs and First Aid for Herbalists lend hands-on experiences. In additional courses, stu-dents become familiar with environmental, economic and political issues surrounding the herbal sciences. There are electives available that cover a wide array of topics including diverse field courses. Additionally, students are required to complete a 44-hour practicum with herbal manufacturers, herb growers, wildcrafters, practitioners or researchers. Upon completion of this program, each student is uniquely qualified to enter the herbal industry, enter a clinically based program or pursue further education in a related field. adMiSSioN For general information on the admissions pro- cess, please refer to the Admissions section in this catalog.

A candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. Observation: A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient mo- tor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients such as CPR and application of pressure to stop bleeding and the opening of obstructed airways. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the sense of touch and vision. Observation and motor skills must be in coor- dination with each other in order to safely practice many of the diagnostic and clinical techniques specific to Oriental medicine. A combination of ob-servation and motor skills are required for acquiring diagnostic information from patients as well as for the clinical portion of the training which includes the safe insertion and manipulation of acupuncture needles, cupping, moxibustion, etc. Communication: A candidate should be able to speak, to hear and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communica-tions. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Commu-nication includes not only speech but reading and sChool of tradItIonal World medICInes83 writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, which is a critical skill for health care practitioners, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relation-ships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exer-cise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to dis-play flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admissions and education processes. age of courSe Required chemistry and biology courses not taken within seven years of matriculation into the program are subject to review by the admissions committee.

If not, additional coursework may be required after the admissions committee review.cliNic The core of the program's clinical training takes place at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, the University's teaching clinic. Bastyr Center is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary clinic providing quality training for students in all of the University's programs. Within the acupuncture and Oriental medicine clinic, students receive clinical training in acupuncture and Chinese herbs. In addition to training at the University clinic, students have the opportunity to train at several community medical sites that provide clinical experience in working with diverse populations. The clinical training program begins in the first year and is comprised of three observation shifts, one preceptorship and either 14 (MSA) or 16 (MSAOM) student clinician shifts. The three ob-servation shifts can be completed in any of the five quarters preceding clinician status. All observation hours, shifts and interim observation hours must be completed prior to starting as a student clinician, in spring of the second year. The preceptorship shift may be performed in either the observation or clinician phase of training. A minimum of one observation shift must be completed in order to do a preceptorship. Students in the MSAOM program or the CCHM program also take eight Chinese herbal shifts and two Chinese herbal dispensary shifts in the latter portion of their program. On a space available basis, students are welcome to take additional clinic shifts for elective credit. However, elective shifts cannot be used to make up missing hours in core shifts due to prior or future absences. For admission as a clinician to the AOM student training clinic at Bastyr Center for Natural Health, a student must complete and achieve competency in all required classes prior to entering clinical training. Questions about didactic prerequisites for clinical AOM training should be addressed to the registrar's office on campus. Students must also: Complete a TB screening Have received a hepatitis B vaccination or signed a waiver Complete current CPR for health care provider certification Complete successful passage of the clinic entry written and practical exam Have certification in Clean Needle Technique Submit to a national criminal background check The criminal background check will be con- ducted prior to enrolling in clinical shifts. For more sChool of tradItIonal World medICInes85 information, see \"Background Checks\" in the Aca- demic Policy and Procedure Manual, Student Policies and Procedures section of MyBU. exterNal cliNic Shift Please be aware that the opportunity to be placed at one of the external clinics offered through Bastyr University is contingent on the student's ability to provide documentation of a vaccination his- tory. If this documentation is unavailable or out of date, students will need to update their vaccines at either local health centers or through their per-sonal physicians. The community clinic rotations are outstanding clinical experiences in working with underserved and special patient populations, including developing skills working with medical translators. Students who are unable to provide vaccine documentation will NOT be eligible for this rotation, and clinical training may be restricted to the Bastyr student clinic. Students are also required to submit to a national criminal background check. For more information, see \"Background Checks\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual, Student Policies and Procedures section of MyBU. chiNa StudieS Students in good academic standing are encour- aged to apply for advanced studies in China and may earn eight (8) clinical credits. Students are placed at Chengdu University of T raditional Chinese Medi-cine or Shanghai University of T raditional Chinese Medicine. Permission to attend is at the discretion of the Department of AOM and depends on a number of additional factors, such as interpersonal skills, maturity and depth of clinical skills. For an application, see the AOM clinic section. Students who plan to study in China are required to take the one-credit elective OM6820 Clinic Entry for China in summer quarter of their third year, immediately preceding their China trip.

BaSic ScieNceS curriculuM WithiN acupuNcture aNd orieNtal MediciNe Basic science courses within acupuncture and Oriental medicine include Anatomy and Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. These courses serve as a foundation for an understanding of the hu-man body and provide students with the necessary skills and competency to pursue coursework in the AOM program. In addition, a portion of the AOM Anatomy and Physiology course is taught in Bastyr's cadaver anatomy lab, thus giving students the unique opportunity to study anatomy in greater depth. Basic science courses in the doctoral program include Pathology of Cancer, Pharmacology and Advanced Living Anatomy. The basic sciences faculty encourages and expects students to advance beyond the simple learning of scientific facts and to integrate systematically the information from basic science disciplines into a unified model of human organization and function. This educational scheme requires students to assume an active role in the learning process and encourages them to adopt this inquisitive behavior for a lifetime. Problem solving, clinical cases and examples are an integral part of the basic science curriculum. This educational process is an expression of Bastyr University's basic philosophy of a holistic approach to human behavior, health and therapeutics. The basic sciences faculty encourages students to pursue an integrated approach to learning and understand-ing. Instructors are readily available to facilitate this process on an individual basis. The department also offers General Chemistry in a summer intensive format, which is a prerequisite requirement for the AOM program. couNSeliNg aNd health pSychology curriculuM WithiN acupuNcture aNd orieNtal MediciNe The counseling and health psychology curricu- lum trains students in understanding and effecting change in the emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions of human functioning.

Students accepted into the combined Bachelor/ Master of Science degree program receive their bachelor's degree upon graduation from the master's program. If a student voluntarily or involuntarily leaves the program prior to completion of the mas-ter's, she/he may be eligible for a bachelor's degree if the student has a combined upper and lower division quarter credit total of 180 credits (specific course requirements also apply. See the dean for further information.) Furthermore, a student must have a minimum of 45 quarter credits in residence at Bastyr University. In order to receive a license to practice acupunc- ture in the majority of states a student must earn either an MSA or MSAOM degree, pass the NC-CAOM licensing exam and meet any additional state requirements. Several states require Chinese herbal medicine training for licensure (e.g., CA, FL, NM, TX). Students graduating with an MSA degree may need to consider taking the CCHM program as a postgraduate option to meet this requirement. 1Credits do not include prerequisites/corequisites. Students may enter their course of study either into the combined BS/MS programs or directly into the MS programs. (The programs described below include required curriculum for the Bachelor of Science programs.) electiveS The Department of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine continually develops and adds to its special topics and elective course curriculum.

MaSter of ScieNce iN ayurvedic ScieNceS overvie W Based on 5000-year-old medical traditions of India, ayurvedic practices predate written records and were handed down via oral tradition. Ayurveda combines the Sanskrit words for life (ayur) and science or knowledge (veda) and translates into \"the science of life.\" Ayurvedic medicine is a com-plete system of medical therapies that focuses on preventive and rejuvenative therapies to balance body, mind and soul. Ayurveda includes a vari-ety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities such as nutritional counseling, herbal medicine, massage therapy and other forms of bodywork, internal cleansing and immune system support. It may also be described as the original natural medicine. However, ayurveda is different from other CAM modalities since it employs an entire system of unique diagnostic, preventive and disease management tools, and practices. As the popularity of ayurveda grows, the need for highly qualified practitioners trained by accred-ited institutions offering a rigorous academic and clinical curriculum that mirrors the education that ayurvedic doctors receive in India is necessary to ensure that practitioners in this country are qualified to provide the complete ayurvedic medical system. Bastyr University has developed the first regionally accredited master's degree program in ayurvedic sciences in the United States. The master's in ayurvedic sciences prepares the graduate to complement his/her health care professional skills with ayurvedic healing system modalities for physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and social health. It would allow graduates to apply the ayurvedic healing framework when considering disease and its management. It would also allow graduates to utilize ayurvedic preventive tools in terms of lifestyle, nutrition and body work. expected learNiNg outcoMeS Graduates of the ayurvedic sciences master's program will have the skills to: Assess an individual's Prakruti (balanced state) and Vikruti (imbalanced state). Advise preventive measures using dietary and lifestyle recommendations based on ayurvedic principles of the Prakruti/Vikruti paradigm. Do a complete clinical assessment using ayurvedic methods including pulse diagnosis to determine patient's current imbalances.

A candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably indepen-dent manner. Observation: A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the sense of vision and somatic sensation. These are enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Motor: Candidates should have sufficient mo - tor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients such as CPR and application of pressure to stop bleeding and the opening of obstructed airways. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the sense of touch and vision.Observation and motor skills must be in coor- dination with each other in order to safely practice many of the diagnostic and clinical techniques specific to ayurvedic practices. A combination of observation and motor skills are required for acquir-ing diagnostic information from patients as well as for the clinical portion of the training. Communication: A candidate should be able to speak, to hear and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with pa-tients. Communication includes not only speech but reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. Intellectual-Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, which is a critical skill for health care practitioners, requires all of these intellectual abilities. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relation-ships of structures. Behavioral and Social Attributes: A candidate must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of her/his intellectual abilities, the exer-cise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients. Candidates must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They must be able to adapt to changing environments, to dis-play flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients.

This prerequisite requirement for entry into the sChool of tradItIonal World medICInes91 program ensures that students possess a sound scientific foundation on which to build knowledge of ayurvedic principles. In addition, completion of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university is required. No specific major is advised. Strong preparation in the sciences, a broad background in the humanities and liberal arts is encouraged. Pre-requisite coursework is used to determine a student's preparation for the program. No credit is given for prerequisite coursework earning a C- or lower. These courses or their equivalents are required prior to the start of the program: Organic Chemistry ................................................. 1 course Anatomy and Physiology ....................................... 2 courses Biochemistry ........................................................... 1 course Introduction to Western Pathology/Disease Processes/ Pathology ........................................................... 1 course Introduction to Botany 1 ........................................ 1 course Research Methods .................................................. 1 course Psychology .............................................................. 1 course 1Bastyr dual-degree students may substitute BO9128 (Plant In- dentification and Medicinal Field Botany) to fulfill the program entry prerequisite for Introduction to Botany. Other recommended courses: Public Speaking English Composition Pharmacology age of courSe Required chemistry and biology courses not taken within seven years of matriculation into the program are subject to review by the admissions committee. Additional coursework may be required. traNSfer credit aNd advaNced StaNdiNg T ransfer credit is granted for a Bastyr required course only for coursework completed at an ac-credited institution recognized by the American Council on Education Commission on Recogni-tion of Postsecondary Accreditation. T ransfer credit grants credit for the Bastyr course and eliminates the need for the student to take that course. A petition to transfer may be requested by students who, at another accredited institution of higher education, have satisfactorily completed coursework that is the same in terms of content, level and credit as a specific Bastyr course, and meets or exceeds the academic objectives and competencies of a required course in Bastyr's programs. T ransfer credit will generally not be granted for classes that are part of another earned degree or for classes that are taught at a different academic level. For courses taken prior to matriculation into Bastyr, transfer credit can only be granted within the first year of attendance. Students who apply to Bastyr University with credit from institutions outside the U.S. are required to have international transcripts evaluated by an in-dependent evaluation service. The evaluation report must be issued by an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) accredited evalu-ation service. Credits from schools outside the U.S. are evaluated according to nationally established norms. Competency examinations are available when there is evidence on a student's official transcript of coursework completed in an area of study, but the competencies, level of material or accreditation of the institution granting the original credit is in question. Competency examinations are also avail-able when the age of the coursework exceeds the guidelines in the transfer credit policy. Competency examinations are not available when the coursework in question was completed at Bastyr University. If a student satisfactorily completes the exam, the student will be awarded transfer or waiver credit in accordance with the transfer credit policy. Please see \"Competency Examinations\" in the Academic Policy and Procedure Manual for more information. acadeMic StatuS aNd graduatioN requireMeNt S Students must maintain a minimum of a 3.0 GPA to be in good academic standing and complete a minimum of 75 1 credits at Bastyr University. Academic sanctions occur when the quarterly or cumulative GPA drops below the minimum level or when a student receives PC, D or F grades. Students with a quarterly GPA below the minimum will be placed on academic warning status. Students who receive a PC, D or F in any one quarter, regardless of GPA, may be placed on probation status. Academic tutoring and support is available to assist students to return to good academic standing. 1Credits do not include prerequisites/corequisites. electiveS Elective choices could include Bastyr courses in nutrition, psychology and botanicals as well as ad-ditional ayurvedic courses in subjects such as Vedic Astrology, Vedic Vastu and additional yoga therapy work.sChool of tradItIonal World medICInes92 If not enrolled in the Master of Science in Ayurvedic Sciences (MSAS) program, students must be in good academic standing and meet prerequisite requirements to take courses within the MSAS cur-riculum for elective credit.

All students in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program (ND), Master of Science in Acupuncture program (MSA), Master of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine program (MS-AOM), Master of Nutrition program (MSN/CHP and MSN/DPD), Certificate in Chinese Herbal Medicine program (CCHM), and BS Didactic Program in Dietetics (BSN/DPD) receive clinical training at Bastyr Center for Natural Health - Team Care. The program deans/chairs or their designates in conjunction with the clinic medical director oversee the clinical education and training of the students and work closely with each program's lead administrator. The clinical training in Team Care is modeled upon mentorship. The average faculty/student ratio is 1:6, which includes three primary clinicians and three observing clinicians. Each student pair is assigned to a room throughout the quarter. Each clinic shift begins with case preview during which the students present to the supervisor their prepara - tions for the patients they will see that day. During each patient visit, the supervisor spends time in the room with the student team and the patient. Also, during each visit, the supervisor and student team discuss the patient in the consult rooms, reviewing the assessments and treatment recommendations. Each clinic shift concludes with case review where all the students and supervisors meet jointly to discuss selected cases seen that day. Clinical course numbers and descriptions for each program's required and elective clinical offerings are found in the course description section of the catalog under the appropriate program heading. The narrative section of the catalog provides further information regarding clinical training under each program and curriculum section.Students in each program receive a Bastyr Center for Natural Health Student Clinician Handbook prior to entering clinical training. This required manual serves as the student's clinic textbook and contains information on clinical education requirements, policies and procedures, learning objectives and clinical competencies. External clinical training opportunities have been developed for each program in order to provide a broader educational experience for students. At each external site, Bastyr faculty supervises the student clinicians. For a description of these sites, see Bastyr Center facilities listing on page 14 in this catalog. Students have a preceptorship requirement in which they work with a variety of licensed, prac-ticing health care professionals in various practice settings. These placements provide students with valuable clinical experience. The combination of external training sites, the preceptor experience and clinical rotations in the main clinic assures diversity in each student's clinical experience. Bastyr Center for Natural Health has a well-estab- lished CNME-credentialed naturopathic residency program, with positions both at Bastyr Center for Natural Health and numerous external sites. Currently, there are eight naturopathic residency positions at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. These programs are highly competitive and attract gradu-ates from other educational institutions as well as from Bastyr. The residency programs at Bastyr are closely supervised programs of mentorship. Each resident progresses from a purely observational role into an independent role over the course of the year. This progression is monitored and facilitated by a faculty mentor and by the director of the Office of Graduate and Community Medicine. A second year of residency offers clinical supervision and continued skill development. All residents have multiple opportunities to do rotations in other lo-cal clinics. The director of the Office of Graduate and Community Medicine is responsible for the administration, development and expansion of the naturopathic residency program. The University is committed to the goal of providing residency op-portunities for every graduate.97 Curriculum and course changes in the 2013-2014 Bastyr University Catalog are applicable to students entering during the 2013-2014 academic year.

established in keeping with federal refund requirements for students withdrawing from school: Week of the % Refund % Refund for Quarter for Course Complete Withdrawals1 Withdrawals2 1st 100% 100% 2nd 5th 25% 60% 6th 25% 50% 7th through 8th 0 0 Refunds related to course and full withdrawal from summer quarter are different and published in the summer quarter academic calendar, available on MyBU. After the first week of the quarter, course withdrawals are accompanied by a \"W\" grade on the transcript (except in the case of courses that have not yet begun). 1All courses (including weekend intensive courses) follow this refund schedule. Courses may not be dropped after the course has ended (example: week-end intensive and non-traditionally scheduled courses). Courses may only be added in the first week of the quarter (with the exception of weekend intensive courses). In order to manage patient sched-uling, the University strongly discourages students from dropping clinic shifts. Students who drop a clinic shift before the quarter may be assessed a fi-nancial penalty. Once the quarter has begun, there is no refund for shift withdrawals (except in the case of family or medical emergencies). Please see the clinic registration staff, in the registrar's office, for more information regarding clinic shift changes. 2Calculated by hand.federal refund requIrements159 1In fall quarter only, first-year naturopathic medicine classes begin a week earlier to accommodate a few study days distributed during the quarter when there are no scheduled classes. 2Students earning PCs in Naturopathic Medicine modules in year one and two will need to return to campus before the start of the following quarter to complete remediation exams and exercises. 3During interim clinic, all clinic services run normally. Interim clinic is required; exceptions must be approved in advance. Students staff the shifts in which they were registered in the quarter just ended. 4During clinic closure, the clinic does not offer patient visits, but appointment phones and dispensary are open (except when one of the clinic closure days falls on a paid holiday). Appointment phones and dispensary hours may be altered from their standard operating hours. The clinic is closed on all official University holidays. 5Bastyr Community Day is focused on the health and well-being of members of the Bastyr community. Activities are sched- uled for the afternoon and classes and clinic shifts are cancelled from noon to 5 p.m. so that members of the community can participate. 6Although religious holidays are NOT official University holidays, the University's policy is to attempt to accommodate the observance of religious practices. Students are responsible for the material covered but will not have religious absences count against any attendance requirement. Students observing such holidays are required to notify faculty during the first week of classes and find substitutes for clinic shifts affected. Students should follow the reschedule exam procedures in the event an exam falls on a religious holiday. Major religious holidays in the coming academic year that occur when the University is in session are 12/5, 4/18, 4/20 and 7/29. Bastyr University schedules clinical training and occasional required courses or intensives on weekends. Students who have religious restrictions against attending classes on weekends must contact their program chair or dean, in advance, when such a conflict occurs. Efforts will be made to resolve such conflicts, but a resolution cannot be guaranteed.

Nothing contained in this catalog shall constitute a contract, expressed or implied, between applicants or students and Bastyr University. The administration shall, at all times, retain the authority to withdraw from the University any student who fails to attain and maintain established levels of academic or clinical performance or who does not exhibit the personal and professional conduct required for the practice of medicine or related disciplines. In meeting its professional educational requirements, Bastyr University is committed to its obligation to maintain a healthy environment commensurate with the standards set by federal, state or local regulatory agencies in the normal operations of its classrooms, laboratories and clinical and research facilities. Students should be aware, however, that people training for health care professions may be exposed to diseases and potentially toxic environments to a much greater extent than the general public.
