Once the bruising and inflammation have faded, the appearance of rejuvenation is often remarkable. But many people have reservations about the long-term effect of severing nerves and blood vessels, and the accumulation of scar tissue. Or they may simply not like the idea of having their face cut. Rather than deadening tissue or cutting it, why not rejuvenate your facial muscles and skin naturally through increased circulation of blood and lymph with cosmetic acupuncture? Cosmetic Acupuncture, facial acupuncture or an Acupuncture Facelift is a non-surgical procedure that will help rejuvenate and revitalize your whole body. It will improve blood and energy circulation, nourish your skin and may help to diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, sagging jowls and chin, and dull skin. Cosmetic Acupuncture is based on the principals of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Classical Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years to treat many conditions and illnesses. The effectiveness of acupuncture has been related to the manipulation of the energy points on the body to balance and to remove blockages in the meridians (channels of blood and energy), in order to achieve health and to prevent diseases. Most Naturopathic Doctors and Chinese Medical practitioners have a clear understanding of the meridian system or energy pathways of the body. Through the use of fine disposable acupuncture needles, naturopathic doctors can help balance the energy within these pathways to restore and maintain health. Facial acupuncture Cosmetic acupuncture's focus much broader, proceeding from the assumption that only a healthy body and mind can sustain a smooth face and glowing complexion. Single use, high quality disposable hair-thin Seirin acupuncture needles are therefore inserted not only into the face, but also at points elsewhere in the body, where the flow of energy (known as Qi in Chinese medicine) can be stimulated in order to treat the underlying factors that contribute to the aging process. The superficial insertion on the face will increase the local circulation to the face and stimulate collagen production, which will fill out the lines and give firmness to the skin for a healthy, glowing complexion and also as the movement of energy improves, a greater amount of energy and blood are circulated to the face, nourishing, hydrating, toning and diminishing the appearance of wrinkles, giving a younger, more youthful appearance to the face. \"WHARE QI GOES, BLOOD FLOWS\" Facial Acupuncture may also have the added benefit of stimulating the body's production of collagen, a major structural protein that provides strength to the skin. A decline of collagen with aging is one of the main causes of sagging and puffiness in the face. "}
