Program Description and Relationship to System-Level Goals A. Briefly describe within a few paragraphs the degree program under consideration, including (a) level; (b) emphases, including majors, concentrations, tracks, or specializations; (c) total number of credit hours; and (d) overall purpose, including examples of employment or education opportunities that may be available to program graduates. The UCF College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) is proposing to implement a formal PhD academic program in Biomedical Engineering (BME) (CIP code: 14.0501). It is a strategic goal of the CECS to establish a BME program aimed at significantly enhancing its growth, reputation and ranking, to meet strong demand from motivated students, that typically includes a significant proportion of women, minority and students with disabilities, and to promote productive research collaborations with the UCF College of Medicine (UCF-COM) at the Lake Nona campus and, more generally, with biomedical researchers throughout UCF and Central Florida. The CECS has established a successful Bioengineering Minor that complements BS degrees in Engineering and Computer Science. The CECS has collaborated with the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences at UCF to establish a companion Bioengineering Minor that was launched in 2019 and the Medicine-Engineering Double Degree (MEDD) program established in 2016 for pre-med students. The MSBME program was launched in Fall 2016 and is housed in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Department. The MAE department has an extensive history of biomedical engineering funding and research and production of theses and dissertations. UCF and the MAE Department have invested substantial resources in preparation of the PhD in BME program in terms of recruitment of a strong core of twelve (12) BME faculty that will support this proposed program. We have followed the successful path that led to the creation of the PhD in Aerospace Engineering that was developed organically from a Masters in Aerospace Engineering to a PhD in Aerospace Engineering in response to student and industry demand. The PhD in Aerospace Engineering was launched in the MAE Department in Fall 2019. The groundwork for the proposed PhD in BME program started with the creation of the minors in bioengineering in CECS (2011) and BSBS (2019), with the creation of our MSBME program launched in Fall 2016, with the investments made by the university in the hiring of the Bionic Materials, Implants & Interfaces (Bioniix) and Disability, Aging and Technology (DAT) cluster faculty based in MAE and in the investment in their laboratories (Q. Fu, Hwan Choi, Joon Park), as well as with the hiring of five BME faculty members in MAE (H. Huang, R. Steward, S. Song, L. Perotti, and W. Shen) over the course of 2015-2020. The MAE department has invested in the required infrastructure and research space. The proposed PhD program does not place an additional burden on instructional delivery as the BME curriculum and BME supporting courses have been developed and are currently being delivered under the MSBME program and the PhD in Mechanical Engineering program as part of electives within those programs. The proposed PhD in BME program aligns with the UCF strategic mission to be a leading research university and with the SUS BOG Strategic Planning Goals that specifically identifies biomedical engineering as a key enabling industry that: (1) provides jobs with high average annual salaries, and (2) fits within the overarching strategy of building a stable Florida economy based on knowledge and innovation. The proposed PhD in BME will be offered through and housed in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. The aim is to formally establish a strong research-based graduate program that is focused on biomedical engineering applications. Biomedical engineering is distinct from biomedical science. The latter typically addresses medical issues on the scale of cells, biomolecules, atoms and nanoparticles, for example for application to drug discovery. Such a program already exists and is well-established at UCF at the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences (https://med.ucf.edu/biomed/) at the Lake Nona Campus of the UCF College of Medicine. The proposed biomedical engineering PhD program addresses medical issues at the level of tissues, organs, and the body as a system, with the application of engineering methodologies in surgical and cancer treatment planning, device development for improved and novel diagnosis, and for development of assistive and rehabilitative technology. Page 3 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 The MAE department currently has twelve (12) faculty members (Alain Kassab, Olusegun Ilegbusi, Sam Song, Hansen Mansy, Qiushi Fu, Hwan Choi, Luigi Perotti, Joon Park, Wen Shen, and Sudeshna Pal) who are actively engaged in research and teaching in BME and who shaped the current proposed program. These current MAE faculty members, referred to as the BME faculty from this point forward in the proposal, are engaged in wide range of BME research that includes research in computational fluid mechanics for cardiovascular and lung cancer treatment-planning, bioacoustics device development for patient monitoring and bedside diagnosis, and mechanical force-induced biochemical responses, image guided surgery and soft robotics, biomechanics of rehabilitation and neural control of movement, biomechanics of falls, mobility and mitigation of fall risks and development of gait assistive device, and lab on chip biomedical research. This research portfolio benefits from partnership with the UCF COM, local hospitals and medical industry programs, and it is supported by local and national funding agencies. The PhD in BME will require completion of 72 hours at the graduate level beyond the BS (a combination of 5000, 6000, and 7000 level classes) and the successful defense of a PhD dissertation. The proposed program is in concordance with the UCF Graduate School policies and requirements of PhD program (http://catalog.ucf.edu/content.php?catoid=4&navoid=255). The PhD in BME program requires: (1) 57 hours coursework beyond the BS (comprised of a minimum of 27 hours of formal coursework exclusive of Independent Study (BME 6908), dissertation, and doctoral research hours, and 15 hours Doctoral Dissertation. At least one-half of the credit hours used to meet program requirements must be in 6000-level or 7000-level courses, including the allowed number of research and dissertation hours (2) Successful completion of the BME PhD Qualifying Examination (inaugurated in the MAE Department in Fall 2019 and currently administered Fall/Spring as an option for students pursuing the PhD in Mechanical Engineering who are engaged in BME research). (3) Successful completion of the Candidacy examination. (4) Successful defense of the doctoral dissertation. (5) Completion of four (4) zero credit hour MAE Seminars. Because biomedical engineering is highly interdisciplinary and covers many areas of science and engineering, the specialized training of PhD in BME is best suited by a curriculum that has a strong foundation of required courses complemented by a rich number of Representative Electives which enables tailored education that best suits the research specialization of the PhD student. The curriculum consists of a core set of 7 required courses (21 hours) that have been approved by the BME faculty and an additional 12 elective courses (36 hours). The additional 12 elective courses could include independent study and directed research but must include a minimum of 6 hours of formal coursework chosen from a selection of graduate elective courses. The details of the curriculum are provided in the curriculum section of this proposal and the list of required courses is provided below: BME 5216C: Mechanics of Biostructures I (3 hours) of Biostructures hours) (3 hours) BME 5742C: Modeling Techniques and Methodologies in Bioengineering (3 hours) ESI 5219: Engineering Statistics (3 hours) or STA 5206: Statistical Analysis (3 hours) It should be noted that a substantial portion of the proposed PhD in BME required courses are shared with the current MSBME program delivered in MAE and that all additional courses required for the PhD program, for example, BME 6231 - Continuum Biomechanics (3 hours), have been formally approved at the State level, provided BME designation, and are currently delivered as part of the BME course offering at the MAE Department. We have fashioned and prepared the required curriculum as we hired our BME faculty in preparation of this proposal. Furthermore, the procedures and policies for the PhD Qualifying Examination BME option (to be described in detail later in the proposal) have been crafted and approved by the BME faculty and by the MAE faculty at large. The BME PhD Qualifying Examination has been administered as an option to our Mechanical Engineering PhD students who are engaged in BME research and who consequently may select Page 4 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 this topic for the PhD Qualifying Examination since Fall 2019. To date five students have passed this examination and two more are scheduled to take it in Fall 2021. The proposed PhD in BME degree offers the following gateways into the program: (1) a PhD in BME for students with formal training in engineering or biomedical engineering who have earned an MS degree and are seeking higher level graduate education and research training. (2) a PhD in BME with a MSBME along-the-way to engineering students who are admitted into the PhD program with a BS in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering or a closely related discipline. The proposed PhD in BME degree will further strengthen academic and medical industry partnerships at UCF by training graduates with professional skills enabling them to gain employment in the biomedical engineering industry or to successfully seek competitive positions in the biomedical industry or post-doc and faculty positions at SUS institutions or research and teaching universities across the country. We provide ample evidence of this in the needs and demand section of this program proposal. B. Please provide the date when the pre-proposal was presented to CAVP (Council of Academic Vice Presidents) Academic Program Coordination review group. Identify any concerns that the CAVP review group raised with the pre-proposed program and provide a brief narrative explaining how each of these concerns has been or is being addressed. Thursday, October 5, 2017, the Dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science, Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos, received an email notice from Dr. Paige Borden, Associate Provost at UCF, informing us that the Pre-Proposal for a PhD in Biomedical Engineering was discussed and approved for development by the statewide Council of Academic Vice Presidents' Academic Coordinating Committee with no concerns. Four universities did make comments that were provided back to our Dean and the BME PhD pre-proposal committee as we were advised to continue the proposal process. In quotes below are the comments reproduced from Dr. Borden's email who shared these comments in particular: \"FIU and the FSU/FAMU engineering deans had no concerns and all agreed that additional, doctoral-trained Biomedical Engineers would be a positive.\" \"UF - Also no concerns. UF has an excess of applicants and is only able to accept a fraction of their volume. There will definitely be applicant demand for any new program.\" C. If this is a doctoral level program please include the external consultant's report at the end of the proposal as Appendix D. Please provide a few highlights from the report and describe ways in which the report affected the approval process at the university. The consultant's report, provided in Appendix D, was prepared by Dr. Ted Conway who is currently a Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Florida Tech. Dr. Conway is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (FAAAS) and an Elected Member of the College of Fellows in the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (FAIMBE). He was the Inaugural Head of the Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences Department (2017 - 2020) and the Inaugural Head of the Biomedical Engineering Department (2014 - 2017) at Florida Tech. Prior to returning to Florida he had a permanent appointment with the National Science Foundation (NSF) as the Program Director (2008 - 2014) for the: 1) General & Age Related Disabilities Engineering Program (GARDE); 2) CBET-National Robotics Initiative (NRI); 3) CBET-Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Program (BRIGE); and 4) Science and Technology Center (STC): Emergent Behaviors of Integrated Cellular Systems (EBICS) in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Engineering (CBET) Division of the Engineering Directorate. Quoted below is the summary provided by Professor Conway upon review of the PhD in BME program proposal: \"Overall, this is a well thought out graduate degree program. The UCF PhD Program in Page 5 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Biomedical Engineering will build on current resources in both the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Medicine. This program is needed to fulfill the current and emerging research and teaching requirement for Universities and local, national and international industries. The proposed academic program is strong and will provide a strong research, educational and mentoring environment for students interested in pursuing an advanced degree in Biomedical Engineering.\" Furthermore, Dr. Conway stated in his report that \"The BME PhD program that is being proposed at UCF will complement the other BME PhD programs within the State of Florida and is aligned with many of the top Universities in other states that offer similar programs. The variety of teaching and student mentoring modes (in-class presentation, virtual presentations, face-to-face and virtual student meetings, etc.) take advantage of 21st Century communication tools. It is well established that BME programs across the United States are the most diverse with respect to students' gender, ethnicity, disability status, etc. The proposed UCF BME PhD Program will leverage and build upon this diversity of students to create an inclusive environment that maximizes the opportunity to generate solutions to problems that currently exist in the Biomedical Engineering research community.\" The report was reviewed the Dean of CECS, Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos, and the CECS Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, Dr. Ali Gordon, and was reviewed by Dr. John Weishampel who is the Senior Associate Dean of the College of Graduate Studies. The report by the external consultant reinforced the commitment at UCF for the creation of a much-needed PhD in BME program. D. Describe how the proposed program is consistent with the current State University System (SUS) Strategic Planning Goals. Identify which specific goals the program will directly support and which goals the program will indirectly support (see link to the SUS Strategic Plan on the resource page for new program proposal). The proposed PhD in BME program aligns with UCF strategic mission to be a leading research and partnership university and with the SUS BOG Strategic Planning Goals that specifically identifies biomedical engineering as a key enabling industry that: (a) provides jobs with high average annual salaries, and (b) fits within the overarching strategy of building a stable Florida economy based on knowledge and innovation. The PhD in BME program aligns itself with the Board of Governors three SUS Strategic Planning Goals 2025_System_Strategic_Plan_2019.pdf (flbog.edu) Goal 1: Excellence. The PhD in BME program will directly support the SUS strategic planning goals of increasing the number of degrees in STEM fields, increase research and commercialization activities by strengthening the pipeline of researchers pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical engineering, and achieving excellence in quality and reputation of scholarship, research, and innovation in BME research at UCF in the targeted areas of biofluids and biomechanics. The proposed PhD in BME is complementary to our existing BME minors and the MSBME program housed in MAE as well as the well-established BME research programs in MAE that, in close partnership with the UCF-COM faculty and professional medical partners at Orlando's healthcare delivery systems, focuses on problems at the interface of engineering and medicine aimed at improvements in health monitoring and treatment planning. Current research is funded by the NIH, American Heart Association, the NSF, Orlando Health, and non-profit charitable foundations dedicated to addressing health related problems will benefit and grow in scope with formal BME training of graduate students with a rapidly increasing research enterprise to support expected program growth. The proposed PhD in BME program directly responds to the SUS Board of Governors continued expectation that state universities provide academic programs of the highest quality, to produce world class, consequential research, and to reach out and engage Florida's communities and businesses in a meaningful and measurable way. Page 6 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Goal 2: Productivity. The proposed PhD in BME program will directly support the SUS strategic planning goals of increasing the number of degrees in STEM fields, increase research and commercialization activities by strengthening the pipeline of researchers pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical engineering, and achieving excellence in quality and reputation of scholarship, research, and innovation. This program supports the SUS BOG goal of enabling Florida to become more competitive in the national and global economy as the proposed PhD in BME degree will increase the educational attainment levels that can be obtained by the large pool of Central Florida residents seeking education and subsequent employment in BME. Therefore, UCF is responding directly to the BOG directive that \"state universities must respond by awarding more degrees in specific high demand programs, particularly the STEM disciplines.\" Goal 3: Strategic Priorities for a Knowledge Economy. The proposed PhD in BME (CIP: 14.0501) is identified in the Florida SUS Board of Governors Programs of Strategic Emphasis (http://flbog.org./pressroom/strategic_emphasis/ and is listed in the CIP code program list https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/Current-PSE-list-approved-by-the-BOG-at-its-September-2020-meeting-PDF.pdf). The proposed PhD in BME program will directly support the SUS strategic planning goals of increasing the number of degrees in STEM fields, increase research and commercialization activities by strengthening the pipeline of researchers pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical engineering, and achieving excellence in quality and reputation of scholarship, research, and innovation. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Florida remains among the states with the highest BME employment, therefore students who complete our program will 1) increase the percentage of graduates who continue their education in Florida and 2) increase the percentage of students employed in Florida. In addition, the following SUS goals will be indirectly supported: increase community and business workforce and increase levels of community and business engagement. The proposed PhD in BME program also aligns itself with strategic goals of UCF to become a top 50 major metropolitan research university (Office of the President | Dr. Alexander N. Cartwright (ucf.edu) and https://www.ucf.edu/strategic-plan/implementation/). In particular, our proposed PhD in BME program aligns with the following UCF aims: Achieving international prominence in key programs of graduate study and research. The MAE department aims at national and international prominence in its research and educational programs. MAE faculty are highly research productive, carry out well-funded and impactful research programs, publish in high quality scientific journals, and are visible at the national and international levels in participating and organizing professional conferences and symposia. MAE graduate students have an established track record of securing positions in academia and industry upon graduation. The addition of a PhD in BME program will expand the department's reputation of distinction and excellence by formalizing its activities in the area of biomedical engineering research and education, preparing highly-trained graduates to meet the demands of this growing industry in Florida and nationwide. Building an inclusive environment with a culture of compassion at its core. Biomedical Engineering programs nationwide attract talented and highly motivated female and minority students. Moreover, UCF's College of Engineering and Computer Science, which has nearly 13,500 students, is the fourth college of choice in the US for Hispanics. The MAE department has a Fall 2020 enrollment of nearly 4,500 students (3,980 UG and 401 G), and MAE faculty engaged in BME research have successfully recruited from this pool Hispanic and female students in their research programs. Many students have been awarded prestigious national fellowships, for example Andres Ceballos won UCF's first NIH Graduate Fellowship in 2014 and Kelly Cox won an NSF Graduate Fellowship in 2013. Over half of our current MSBME program is comprised of female graduate students. The PhD in BME program will allow us to further attract and recruit many more talented students who are under-represented in STEM. Recently, the MAE Department and the MAE BME Director led the proposal for the establishment of the Biiionix Cluster in partnership with the UCF COM and played a leading role in the three-year recruiting effort of seven faculty members for the cluster including two junior female faculty members and the senior cluster lead who is a female of African descent (https://med.ucf.edu/biionix-cluster/). Page 7 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Becoming America's leading partnership university by partnering internally and externally to serve and positively impact our community. The MAE Department's well-established collaborations and partnerships with local industry such as Siemens, Lockheed Martin, and the Center for Advanced Turbine Education and Research (CATER) and the Siemens Energy Center are examples of the successful outcome and impact of such partnerships. The MAE faculty has established biomedical engineering research collaborations and partnerships with the UCF College of Medicine and local industry partners such as Orlando Health, Advent Health, and Nemours. The proposed PhD in BME will promote the expansion of these partnerships and the establishment of new partnerships with medical professionals in the five large health delivery systems, and with the BME industry in the Central Florida region and beyond to support the educational and research experiences of our students. E. If the program is to be included in a category within the Programs of Strategic Emphasis as described in the SUS Strategic Plan, please indicate the category and the justification for inclusion. The Programs of Strategic Emphasis Categories are: Critical Workforce: Education Health Gap Analysis Economic Development: Global Competitiveness Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Please see the Programs of Strategic Emphasis (PSE) methodology for additional explanations on program inclusion criteria at the resource page for new program proposal. The field of biomedical engineering combines fundamental principles and skillsets of engineering to the biomedical field with the goal to improve and advance human health. Therefore, the interdisciplinary PhD in BME program (CIP: 14.0501) at UCF falls under SUS Programs of Strategic emphasis categories and is identified specifically on line 480 of the downloadable spreadsheet to be found at the SUS BOG site (Current PSE list, approved by the BOG at its September 2020 meeting (XLSX)). Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM): The proposed PhD in BME program curriculum covers subjects that span: (1) Science: anatomy, physiology, biology and chemistry, (2) Technologies: instrumentation, medical imaging and segmentation software, and 3D printing, (3) Engineering: fluid and solid mechanics, acoustics, controls, robotics, and 4) Math: ordinary and partial differential equations, computational fluid dynamics, computational solid mechanics, and continuum biomechanics. F. Identify any established or planned educational sites at which the program is expected to be offered and indicate whether it will be offered only at sites other than the main campus. The proposed PhD in BME program will be located on UCF's main campus and will be housed and administered within the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE). The MAE Department Chair, Prof. Yoav Peles, appointed Dr. Alain Kassab as BME program director in Fall 2015. The BME Program Director is responsible for the development and administration of the BME program, the scheduling of courses, and the delivery of the PhD in BME Qualifying Examination option for the Mechanical Engineering PhD Qualifying Examination. The courses for the proposed PhD in BME will be delivered on the main UCF campus except for the two lab sections of Biostructures I and II that are currently delivered at the anatomy lab at the UCF College of Medicine Lake Nona Campus. Page 8 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Graduate courses for the PhD in BME program that have no lab content will be taught on the main campus via video-streaming modality using Panopto and will be available at remote sites via SUS Feeds. There are BME graduate courses (BME 5742C, BME 6286C and BME 6500C) that have lab content and require presence of students on the UCF Main campus, and there two courses (BME 5216C and BME 5217C) have a lab component that requires presence of the students at the UCF-COM Lake Nona Campus, specifically to access the UCF-COM anatomy lab. These courses which have associated lab sections are described below: 1. BME 5216C: Mechanics of Biostructures I (3 hours) has a lab component and is currently offered in close collaboration with the UCF-COM in Fall for our MSBME program and requires presence at the UCF-COM anatomy lab at the Lake Nona Campus. 2. BME 5217C: Mechanics of Biostructures II (3 hours) has a lab component and is currently offered in close collaboration with the UCF-COM for in Spring for our MSBME program and requires presence at the COM anatomy lab at the Lake Nona Campus. 3. BME 6500C: Bioinstrumentation- has a lab component, is offered every Fall for our MSBME program and will require the presence of students at the lab which is located in the Engineering I building of the UCF Main Campus. 4. BME 5742C Modeling Techniques and Methodologies in Bioengineering (3 hours) has a lab component, is offered every Fall for our MSBME program and will require the presence of students at the lab which is located in the Engineering I building of the UCF Main Campus. 5. BME 6286C Applied and Computational Biofluids (3 hours) has a lab component, is offered every Spring for our MSBME program and will require the presence of students at the lab which is located in the Engineering I building of the UCF Main Campus. Institutional and State Level Accountability II. Need and Demand A. Need: Describe national, state, and/or local data that support the need for more people to be prepared in this program at this level. Reference national, state, and/or local plans or reports that support the need for this program and requests for the proposed program which have emanated from a perceived need by agencies or industries in your service area. Cite any specific need for research and service that the program would fulfill. Nationwide, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employment of bioengineers and biomedical engineers grew 27 percent from 2012 to 2019 and is projected to grow 5 percent from 2019 to 2029, faster than the average for all occupations (http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm/). Increasing numbers of technologies and applications to medical equipment and devices, along with the medical needs of a growing and aging population, will require the services of these workers, much faster than the average for all occupations. Demand will be strong because an aging population is likely to need more advanced medical care and because of increased public awareness of biomedical engineering advances and their benefits. Such positions require an advanced degree such as a MS or a PhD. (http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm/). Examples of such positions include engineering design and development (biofluids, bioinstrumentation, biomaterials, biosensors, sensors and controls) of left ventricular assist devices (heart pumps) at Heartware (http://www.heartware.com/) in Ft. Lauderdale, engineering innovative solutions (biomechanics and biomaterials) for knee, hip, shoulder and spine surgery at Exatech (https://www.exac.com/) in Gainesville, and device development (biofluids, biomechanics, bio-instrumentation) at Covidian and Medtronic surgical in Jacksonville Florida. There is a strong demand for individuals with a PhD in BME and there are numerous positions available for well-trained individuals with such advanced training in Academia and industry nationwide. A search on LinkedIn from 7/21/2021 shows 200 current openings for biomedical engineers in Florida alone with the first such posting seeking a PhD in BME. Searches on other Page 9 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 popular job posting sites such as Indeed likewise reveal strong current demand. Examples of such industry job postings seeking PhD in BME applicants that were downloaded from the web on 7/13/2021 include (images of postings taken from the internet are provided in Appendix C): The Metropolitan Orlando area: JS Held and Advent Health. St. Petersburg: John Hopkins Institute for Fundamental Biomedical Research and Hackley-Roberts. Panama City: US DOD National level: Proctor and Gamble. As of May 2020, there were 18,660 Bioengineers and Biomedical Engineers who were employed nation-wide with a mean salary of $98,340 ($47.28 hourly). Florida is one of the states with the highest published employment and wages with an estimated 1,130 employed at average salary of $91.5K/year (http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172031.htm/). The growth of Biomedical engineering positions in the State of Florida from 2019-2020 was nearly 4% (http://www.floridajobs.org/workforce-statistics/data-center/statistical-programs/employment-projections). Specifically, Florida ranks in the top five states with the highest employment of bioengineers and biomedical engineers. Production of a well-trained workforce with PhD level training in research and development to enable the State of Florida to maintain its leadership role and foster the growth of this important industry. Provided below are data provided by the BLS which demonstrate the need and opportunity in the State of Florida and the greater Orlando metropolitan area for the biomedical engineering discipline. Page 10 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, Bioengineers and Biomedical Engineers, at https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm/ (visited May 11, 2021). In addition to the UCF College of Medicine and the five large health delivery programs serving the Orlando metropolitan region, Florida is rapidly becoming a major presence in the fast-growing field of biomedical engineering and biotechnology. On March 1, 2021, the UCF College of Medicine launched a full-service acute care hospital (https://www.ucf.edu/news/ucf-lake-nona-medical-center-opens-full-service-acute-care-hospital/) at its Lake Nona campus. This new teaching hospital provides 24/7 emergency care and comprehensive in-patient, and outpatient hospital services will also afford clinical access to our PhD students engaged in BME translational research. Offering a PhD in BME program naturally serves the needs of this local constituent industry. According to the BioFlorida BioDatabase November 2019 Industry Report (https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.bioflorida.com/resource/resmgr/industry_data/BioDatabase_Industry_Report.pdf /), the number of companies in Florida's biotechnology industry grew 8.5% from 2018 through the first half of 2019 bringing the total number of biotechnology companies to 372 with the addition of 50 new companies. Florida's growth for 2018 is slightly greater than the nation's biotechnology sector which showed a growth rate of 7% over the same period according to Nature Biotechnology. Around 75% of Florida's biotech companies are involved in therapeutics, medical devices or diagnostics with 38% located in Southeast Florida, 22% in greater Tampa Bay, 20% in Gainesville, and 13% in Orlando-all remaining stable. Over the last decade, Florida's biotech companies have increased by 174% whereas US biotech company growth over the past decade has been approximately 65%. It worth noting that biotechnology companies tracked by the Florida BioDatabase are characterized by having a true research and development core that helps fuel the innovation of new products for Florida's growing life sciences industry and does not include numerous biomedical companies that are involved only in manufacturing and/or distribution of products. Examples of such R&D and product development companies include Exatech in Gainesville, Lensar in Orlando, and Mako Plasty, a Florida orthopedic company that was acquired by Stryker for $1.65 billion and is based in Fort Lauderdale. A relatively recent example of the expansion of the biotech industry into Florida is the $14 million expansion of Codivian and Medtronic surgical technology division in Jacksonville which the Jacksonville Business Journal reports will create 175 full-time jobs.

A distribution map of these bioengineering companies compiled by the database is reproduced below: : Page 12 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 The chart below from the UF Sid Martin Florida Biodatabase provides a graphical representation of the growth of BME companies in Florida for the 1981-2013 period including the number of companies founded in Florida over that period. Joshua Bedwell, Director of Marketing at UCF carried out a Marketing Study for the purposes of this proposal, and the data gathered show that the number of PhD degrees in Biomedical Engineering conferred in the 5 programs in Florida grew by 14% from 2013-2019. Nationwide in 2019, there were 1,128 PhD in BME granted by 114 programs and the number of degrees granted grew by 24% nationwide over the 2013-2019 period. The proposed PhD in BME is very competitive in terms of cost, given that the annual cost for tuition at UCF is a little under 1/3 of the $31,440 average cost nationwide (source EMSI and UCF student accounts). The internet search volume for PhD in BME is high nationwide and in Florida so that we expect good search traffic to our corresponding program webpage/s. The UCF Marketing report is consistent with the US BLS and confirms that the job growth rate for biomedical engineering in Florida was above the average job growth rate for other disciplines in 2019. Joshua Bedwell, Director of Marketing, UCF Market Study Report 5/23/2021 B. Demand: Describe data that support the assumption that students will enroll in the proposed program. Include descriptions of surveys or other communications with prospective students. A source of PhD students are applicants to the State of Florida SUS which cannot accept the volume of applicants. Reproducing a quote from the SUS CAVP review of our pre-proposal \"UF - Also no concerns. UF has an excess of applicants and is only able to accept a fraction of their volume. There will definitely be applicant demand for any new program.\" Another source of PhD in BME students is the pool of potential applicants from our own institution. The CECS has 13,500 students and MAE has nearly 4,500 students enrolled respectively. Specifically, a potential source of applicants are those students who are enrolled in our MSBME, CECS Bioengineering minor, BSBS Bioengineering Minor, and those UG and G students engaged in BME research. Another source of students is the CECS/COM Medical Engineering Dual Degree (MEDD) degree program. Page 13 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 According to a summer 2017 student survey carried out for the purpose of the pre-proposal (219 MAE undergraduate respondents), 48.9% would consider applying for the PhD in BME, and 95.9% overwhelmingly support the PhD in BME at UCF to meet students' growing interest. Also, 27.4% considered leaving UCF to pursue this degree if it wasn't offered at UCF. Below are reproduced selected quotes from the respondents: \"I think that it would greatly benefit the university to have such a cutting-edge program.\" \"Please start a BME PhD Program. I am starting my PhD program this fall at UCF (ECE) but I would prefer the BME if available.\" \"I think the biomedical field is one of the most important fields we can continue to substantially improve on. It truly impacts our well-being and our politics. I want there to be further advancement of this cause so that people will not be so sick and suffer under high costs of health burdens\" \"Help me pay for it and I'll be one of your first students. I have a 3.6 GPA so that's that\" \"Having a PhD program would make this school even better than it already is and would attract more bright students to the up-and-coming engineering program here at UCF.\" \"UCF is the only major university in the region without a BME program. This was a long-due initiative.\" A more recent survey carried out in spring 2019 of 110 senior/junior undergraduate students in MAE reported that 18% were interested in obtaining a Doctoral degree in biomedical engineering, 49% were interested in R&D positions in the biomedical industry, and 61% were interested in participating funded research activities in biomedical engineering. A recent spring 2021 survey of current and prospective UCF BME MS students and ME PhD students revealed that 67% of 27 respondents probably or definitely consider having a career in Biomedical Engineering and 58% of 31 respondents were probably or definitely interested in pursuing a PhD in BME. Several students commented that it would be great for UCF to offer a BME PhD. One student commented that \"I would like UCF to introduce BME PhD program as soon as possible so that I can have my PhD in BME\" and another student commented that \"It's high time we have biomedical engineering PhD program.\" Consistently over the past 4 years and over the three surveys of 2017, 2019 and 2021, students have indicated a strong interest and demand in the proposed PhD in BME program. By all indications the program will be well-subscribed by our students at UCF. Data from these surveys are provided in Appendix-C Moreover, the local industry is a source of such students. For example, Prof. Kinzel has a graduate student who is currently enrolled in the MAE PhD program and who is engaged in a federally funded COVID19 research project. This student is a female US citizen and Florida resident, is a full-time employee at Disney and is scheduled to stand for the BME PhD qualifying examination option in Fall 2021. A source of PhD students is also our own MSBME program which has grown from an initial enrollment of 11 in 2016 to 28 in 2021. Currently three such graduates of our MSBME program are enrolled in our PhD in ME program pursuing research in BME, two are being mentored by Dr. Helen Huang and one by Dr. Hwan Choi. These students indicate that they wish to transfer to the PhD in BME program should that become an option in the future. Anecdotally, on Friday September 10, 2021, the BME program director in MAE (Alain Kassab) recently advised an undergraduate student engaged in Dr. Joon Park's research group as a research assistant who is applying to the MSBME program and who indicated he will pursue the PhD in BME at UCF should that become an option in the near future. Page 14 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Currently, there are 12 BME faculty in the MAE Department supporting PhD students, several of whom have indicated that they will petition the UCF Graduate School to transfer into the PhD in BME program as should it be launched upon BOG approval with a target start date of Fall 2022. Moreover, we expect that these BME faculty members will support at least 27 PhD students annually through their research grants by the fifth year of the PhD in BME program. This corresponds to 2.45 PhD students/faculty member. This number may be substantially larger as our research portfolio grows. C. If substantially similar programs (generally at the four-digit CIP Code or 60 percent similar in core courses), either private or public exist in the state, identify the institution(s) and geographic location(s). Summarize the outcome(s) of communication with such programs with regard to the potential impact on their enrollment and opportunities for possible collaboration (instruction and research). In Appendix C, provide data that support the need for an additional program. There are four (4) PhD in BME programs in the State of Florida SUS that serve their region. These are listed in the table below along with their research emphasis. SUS institutions with a PhD in BME program Research Focus Areas FIU (Department of Biomedical Engineering) Engineered Tissue Model Systems, Diagnostic Bio-imaging and Sensor Systems, Therapeutic and Reparative Neurotechnology. (https://bme.fiu.edu/) FSU/FAMU (Department of Chemical and Biomedical engineering) and tissue engineering. (https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/node/404) (https://www.eng.famu.fsu.edu/cbe/about-cbe) UF (J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering) Neural Engineering, Imaging & Medical Physics, Biomaterials & Regenerative, Medicine, Biomedical Informatics & Modeling. (https://www.bme.ufl.edu/) USF (Department of Biomedical Engineering in collaboration with the Morsani College of Medicine) Cell and Tissue Engineering, Neuroscience and Neuro-engineering , Auditory Neuroscience, Neural Bases of Age-Related Hearing Loss, Brain Plasticity Following Injury. Molecular Medicine & Drug Delivery. Biomedical Imaging & Bioelectronics. (Department of Medical Engineering | Home | University of South Florida (usf.edu)) Two BME programs are standalone and in a Department of Biomedical Engineering (UF and FIU) while two are in the Chemical Engineering Departments (FSU/FAMU and USF. Consequently, the curriculum and research emphasis of each program is particularly tailored to the focus that each program has identified and there is little if no overlap with the PhD in BME program proposed at UCF. We have sought letters/emails of support for our program from all SUS institutions and these are provided in the Appendix C. Page 15 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 There are two (2) PhD in BME programs in the State of Florida that are offered by private non-SUS institutions that serve their region. These are listed in the table below along with their research emphasis. Non-SUS private institutions with a PhD in BME program Research Focus Areas FIT Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences program Drug delivery, biomaterials and tissue engineering, and computational methods and machine Learning. Biomedical Engineering > Biomedical Engineering | Florida Tech (fit.edu) Biomedical Engineering, Ph.D. | Florida Tech (fit.edu) University of Miami Department of Biomedical Engineering Imaging Optics Lasers, Biomechanics, Microfluidics, Biomaterials and Tissue, and Neural Engineering, Signals, & Instrumentation. Home | Biomedical Engineering | University of Miami There is some overlap at FIT in the cardiovascular area (one faculty member) and there is another faculty member involved in modeling of neurological diseases such as stroke affect movement and traumatic injury to the brain and eye. FIT has a small program with 6 faculty members, and Dr. Ted Conway, who just stepped down as Chair of the BME program at FIT noted that our proposed program was complementary to that at FIT. There is little overlap in areas (1) and (2) as Imaging is carried out in CS and Optics and Lasers at CREOL at UCF and area (2) is mainly at the tissue level and there is no overlap with our program. There is some overlap with area (3) in the areas of brain computer interface and neural interface and neuroprosthetic devices. However, our faculty members are well-established in this area and the university has invested in a Biionix cluster with 2 BME faculty (Choi and Fu) hired under this university initiative. Our current BME faculty have several NIH grants as well as 2 recent NSF CAREER awards. This is a complementary activity which may open the door for collaborative research between our respective faculties. The PhD in BME program at UCF is unique since it will be housed in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department and in its research and teaching focus in biofluids and biomechanics. It is likewise structurally unique in: (1) offering a PhD in BME as a follow-up to the minor in Biomedical Engineering in CECS and BSBS capitalizing on the BS-MS track, (2) offering an MSBME along-the- way to students enrolled in the PhD in BME program who are carrying out BME-topic research for their dissertations under guidance of PhD in BME program faculty or other qualified MAE faculty advisors, and (3) a PhD in BME that admits qualified students from the level of the BS degree in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering or a closely related discipline. It is noted that at UCF, cell and tissue engineering and neuroscience research and education are carried out at the UCF College of Medicine's Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences (BSBS) which our BME faculty collaborate. The only cell-level research carried out by our BME program is undertaken by Dr. Robert Steward who is supported by NIH and the NSF and whose wet lab is located at the BSBS. His work is at the interface of engineering and the cell as his focus is on the manifestation of hemodynamic induced shear stress on endothelial cell function with applications to cardiovascular disease. While Medical Imaging research is carried out at the CECS Computer Sciences Department Center for Computer Vision Center headed by Prof. Mubarak Shah (https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/) who has provided a letter of support for our program (see Appendix C). As such, the proposed PhD in BME program is predominantly an engineering-based biomedical engineering degree. Page 16 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Moreover, the program features close collaboration with the UCF COM and Orlando regional hospitals and medical professionals. The BME curriculum is taught with the support of the UCF-COM which offers the laboratory section of the course Mechanics of Biostructures I (Fall) and Mechanics of Biostructures II (Spring). This course uniquely features lab sessions at the UCF-COM anatomy lab, and these are delivered by a UCF-COM faculty member, Dr. Emily Bradshaw. Finally, the program offers a biofluids and a biomechanics emphasis that draws upon training in MAE and typical undergraduate BME and engineering programs nationwide. The research program in the PhD in BME will capitalize on existing research collaborations between BME faculty and UCF-COM faculty as well as Orlando Medical Professionals in the areas of: engineering assisted cardiovascular, pulmonary, cancer and orthopedic treatment-planning as well as bio-acoustic diagnostic device development. With the additions of Dr. Helen Huang (joining Spring 2016), Dr. Sam Song (joined Spring 2015), Dr. Luigi Perotti (joined 2017), Dr. Hwan Choi (joined Fall 2018), Dr. Qiushi Fu (joined Fall 2017), Dr. Joon Park (joined Fall 2019), and Dr. Wen Shen (joined Fall 2020), to the faculty, the proposed PhD BME program will also feature medical robotics, image guided surgical planning (image-guided robotic needle biopsies and prostate surgery) as well as gait and rehabilitative research, wearable robotic assistive devices and curriculum experiences (BME 6215 - Advanced Biomechanics). The research program is focused on translational research in partnership with medical professionals and UCF-COM Colleagues and the UCF Biionix and Disabilities and Aging Technologies Faculty Clusters. Recently, in Fall 2020, the BME Faculty and Advent Health University held a joint research seminar and followed up establishing the foundations of research partnerships and education collaborations facilitated by Dr. Mohtashem Samsam Director of Research at Advent Health in Orlando. Proposed PhD in BME Program at UCF Research Focus Areas UCF (in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department) Biofluids: translational research in multiscale computational fluid dynamics for cardiovascular treatment planning, lung cancer treatment planning, upper airways fluid mechanics, bioacoustics for patient monitoring and bedside diagnosis. Lab on a chip and nano-fluidics sensors. Biomechanics: developmental dysplasia of the hip, cellular mechanics and force-induced biochemical responses, image guided surgery, surgical robotics navigation and tracking, soft robotics, and biomechanics of movement rehabilitation and neural movement control for upper and lower body. Wearable and assistive robotics. D. Use Table 1 - Appendix A (1-A for undergraduate and 1-B for graduate) to categorize projected student headcount (HC) and Full Time Equivalents (FTE) according to primary sources. Generally undergraduate FTE will be calculated as 30 credit hours per year and graduate FTE will be calculated as 24 credit hours per year. Describe the rationale underlying enrollment projections. If students within the institution are expected to change majors to enroll in the proposed program at its inception, describe the shifts from disciplines that will likely occur. Referring to Table 1B in Appendix A, the projected student headcount (HC) for Year 1 is 11 generating 8.25 Full Time Equivalents (FTE) calculated as 24 credit hours per year for graduate students. We estimate the average FTE per graduate student to be 0.75 as these students will be in various stages of their PhD studies and will be taking dissertation hours after passing candidacy. It is expected that up to five students will successfully petition to transfer from the current PhD in Mechanical Engineering in which they are currently enrolled. We are coordinating with the College of Graduate Studies to enable this transfer over the course of the first year of the program in accordance with the College of Graduate Studies policies and procedures. Moreover, we expect that we will recruit at least 6 new PhD students by the start the program, expected in Fall of 2022. The headcount and corresponding FTEs are projected to increase over the course of four years to 27 students and 20.25 FTE in year five. Page 17 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 E. Indicate what steps will be taken to achieve a diverse student body in this program. If the proposed program substantially duplicates a program at FAMU or FIU, provide, (in consultation with the affected university), an analysis of how the program might have an impact upon that university's ability to attract students of races different from that which is predominant on their campus in the subject program. The university's Equal Opportunity Officer shall review this section of the proposal and then sign and date Appendix B to indicate that the analysis required by this subsection has been completed. The proposed PhD in BME program does not substantially duplicate the programs at FIU or FSU/FAMU. Our program is focused on biofluids and biomechanics while the program at FIU focuses on engineered tissue model systems, diagnostic bio-imaging, and therapeutic and reparative neurotechnology and the FSU/FAMU program is focused solely on cellular and tissue engineering. Our program course offerings are also different with less than 10% course overlap. As such, our program will not impact the ability of these two programs and their associated universities' ability to attract students of races different from that which is predominant on their campus in their subject programs. The University of Central Florida has a tradition of fostering diversity in its student body, and it is a Minority Serving Institution (MSI). UCF was formally designated in 2019 as a Hispanic Serving Institution (https://diversity.ucf.edu/hsi-homepage/). The CECS is the 4th college of choice for Hispanic students nationwide. In Fall 2020, UCF had a Hispanic/Latino undergraduate enrollment of 17,891 or 29.1%; a Black undergraduate enrollment of 6,290 or 10.24% and a female undergraduate enrollment of 33,847 or 55% of its total student body. UCF is 5th nationwide in awarding degrees to Hispanic/Latino and Black undergraduate students. Diversity and inclusion are an institutional mission at UCF which has a dedicated office for Diversity and Inclusion (https://diversity.ucf.edu/) and Institutional Equity (https://oie.ucf.edu/). National ranking source can be found in \"Diverse: Issues In Higher Education\" that has produced the Top 100 Degree Producers rankings of the institutions that confer the most degrees to minority students. https://diverseeducation.com/top100/pages/index.php Moreover, by its very nature, the BME program is highly successful in attracting females in STEM. According to the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), biomedical engineering ranked in the top 3-choices among the PhD degrees awarded to women in 2021 at 36.9%. (https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engineering-by-the-Numbers-FINAL-2021.pdf ) Moreover, of all the engineering disciplines, biomedical engineering is the discipline which nationwide has granted the highest percentage of PhD degrees in 2021 to under-represented minorities in STEM according to ASEE (https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engineering-by-the-Numbers-FINAL-2021.pdf). As such, the PhD in BME will to a certain extent organically attract a diverse student population. Page 18 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 We are committed to attracting a diverse student body. We have hired highly successful BME faculty members who are under-represented in STEM. Specifically, of the 12 BME faculty members in MAE supporting our PhD in BME program, five (5) are under-represented in STEM faculty (42% of the BME faculty). In particular, three are female (Helen Huang, Wen Shen, and Sudeshna Pal), and two are African American (Olusegun Ilegbusi and Robert Steward). These faculty members serve as role models and attract students from varied backgrounds. Dr. Huang and Dr. Pal currently have NIH funding. Dr. Helen Huang has a current RO1 grant and an NSF CAREER Award and has recently won the Reach for the Stars Award in 2021 at UCF. Dr. Steward has been awarded the NSF CAREER Award and has been awarded a multi-year NIH mentoring grant in which he collaborated with the Associate Dean for Research at the UCF College of Medicine. Dr. Ilegbusi has a history of sustained and substantial NSF funding in BME. Dr. Wen Shen recently joined MAE in Fall 2020, and she is establishing her lab at the NanoScience and Technology Center and is recruiting PhD students. Dr. Sudeshna Pal has a multi-year NIH R25 education grant aimed at expanding our undergraduate and graduate rehabilitation engineering curriculum and to provide immersive experience in rehabilitation engineering for graduate and undergraduate students at local hospitals, clinics, and research and development companies. This enables our outstanding BME faculty to recruit diverse graduate students and serve as role models and mentors to our graduate students. Moreover, these colleagues have a track record of outreach and success in recruiting talented students who come from under-represented groups in STEM. The BME faculty, in general, have a track record of engaging under-represented in STEM students. Currently, our BME graduate students count a substantial number of female, Latino/Hispanic and African Americans. For example, our MSBME program has a nearly 50/50 mix of male to female students. In Fall 2017 the student makeup of the MSBME program was 41% White 30% Hispanic, 12% African American, 12% Asian and 5% international. With a pool of nearly 13,500 students in the CECS and 3,980 undergraduate students in MAE, the PhD in BME offers a unique opportunity to achieve a diverse body of graduate students by active recruitment of women and taking advantage of UCF's large underrepresented in STEM student population. Page 19 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 We will capitalize on regional and national funding opportunities to recruit under-represented groups in STEM. Examples include promoting minority PhD students taking the MSBME along-the-way in the McKnight Fellowship program and obtaining grant support for PhD in BME minority and under-represented in STEM students from the NIH Research Education Program (R25) whose aim is to support educational activities that enhance the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research workforce. Another example is the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program that is part of a general initiative at NSF to broaden participation in interdisciplinary graduate STEM research and education (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21536/nsf21536.htm). At the institutional level, UCF is a member of the Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority participation, and UCF also has an active Multicultural Academic and Support Services which advises all minority engineering students. We will utilize these resources to reach out to qualified and talented minority students. The university's Equal Opportunity Officer has reviewed this section of the proposal and signed and dated the appropriate section of Appendix B, indicating that the analysis required by this subsection has been completed. III. Budget A. Use Table 3 - Appendix A to display projected costs and associated funding sources for Year 1 and Year 5 of program operation. Use Table 4 - Appendix A to show how existing Education & General funds will be shifted to support the new program in Year 1. In narrative form, summarize the contents of both tables, identifying the source of both current and new resources to be devoted to the proposed program. (Data for Year 1 and Year 5 reflect snapshots in time rather than cumulative costs.) Referring to Table 3 in Appendix A, the projected costs for Year 1 are $330,013 and for Year 5 are $626,989. Year 1: The costs incurred in Year 1 are for: (1) $130,013 in E&G funds reflecting salaries for 1.13 person-year for program course delivery, (2) $200,000 for support of graduate PhD students who are GRAs supported on contracts and grants and this amounts to stipend of close to $20K on average. There are no Library costs associated with the proposed PhD in BME program as reported in Appendix B. The MAE department will re-allocate E&G funds to support the course delivery. As shown in Table 4 of Appendix A, the existing E&G funds for the MAE Department are $8,086,988 in FY 2021, and $130,013 in E&G funds will reallocated for the program leaving a balance of $7,956,975 in E&G funds in Year 1. Year 5: The costs incurred in Year 5 are for: (1) $154,262 in E&G funds reflecting salaries for 1.16 person-year for program course delivery, (2) $472,727 for support of graduate PhD students who are on GRA contacts and this number is escalated from year 1 in proportion to the expected increase in PhD students. This is an average of 2.45 PhD student/faculty in year 5 of the program which is achievable without the need to hire additional faculty. There are no Library costs associated with the proposed PhD in BME program as reported in Appendix B. The MAE department will re-allocate E&G funds to support the course delivery. B. Please explain whether the university intends to operate the program through continuing education, seek approval for market tuition rate, or establish a differentiated graduate-level tuition. Provide a rationale for doing so and a timeline for seeking Board of Governors' approval, if appropriate. Please include the expected rate of tuition that the university plans to charge for this program and use this amount when calculating cost entries in Table 3. Tuition for this program will be regular graduate tuition rate as reported by UCF student accounts (https://studentaccounts.ucf.edu/tf-graduate/). At the time of submission, the rate was $369.65 per credit hour for In-State students and $1,194.05 for Out-of-State students. Page 20 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 C. If other programs will be impacted by a reallocation of resources for the proposed program, identify the impacted programs and provide a justification for reallocating resources. Specifically address the potential negative impacts that implementation of the proposed program will have on related undergraduate programs (i.e., shift in faculty effort, reallocation of instructional resources, reduced enrollment rates, greater use of adjunct faculty and teaching assistants). Explain what steps will be taken to mitigate any such impacts. Also, discuss the potential positive impacts that the proposed program might have on related undergraduate programs (i.e., increased undergraduate research opportunities, improved quality of instruction associated with cutting-edge research, improved labs and library resources). The proposed PhD in BME program will initially benefit from transfer of PhD students from the MAE PhD program into the PhD in BME program following UCF Graduate Studies policies and procedures. We have identified such students who wish to transfer once the program is approved (expected transfer in Fall 2022). Dr. Ali Gordon, Associate Dean of Academic Affairs at the CECS, is coordinating this procedure with Associate Dean, Dr. Barbara Fritzsche, at the College of Graduate Studies to enable the potential transfer of these students over the course of year 1 of the program. We have provided the CGS with a list of these students, their status in terms of coursework taken, having passed the qualifying examination or when planning to take the qualifying examination, as well as expected date to take the candidacy examination. We are preparing to have petitions ready for review and potential approval soon after the degree is approved by the Florida BOG. This follows the same path that our recently approved PhD in Aerospace Engineering where 23 PhD students transferred from the ME PhD program to the AE PhD program upon the launch of the PhD in AE in Fall 2019. Beyond the first year, the program will only grow organically by recruiting new graduate students supported by our grants and contracts for BME research. As such, the transfer is within intra-departmental programs and will not significantly affect our ME and AE PhD programs in MAE that currently have a Student Head Count (SHC) of 147 in Fall 2020. Moreover, the PhD in BME program will not negatively impact undergraduate programs but rather will benefit the minors in BME both in the CECS and BSBS colleges at UCF by providing a path to a terminal degree in BME at UCF for our undergraduate students. This should help recruit high quality undergraduates who are often, as previously stated, women and from an under-represented in STEM population. D. Describe other potential impacts on related programs or departments (e.g., increased need for general education or common prerequisite courses, or increased need for required or elective courses outside of the proposed major). Considering the fact that the proposed PhD in BME program will be located in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) but focused in the interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering, students within the PhD in BME program will take electives outside of the department and college that are related to BME. Consequently, PhD in BME students will take additional approved electives from the following departments: Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the College of Science, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, and College of Medicine. Thus, the PhD in BME program does not compete with, but rather enhances, other UCF graduate programs by providing students who will take elective graduate courses offered by the previously mentioned departments. Many elective graduate courses at UCF are seldom populated beyond 10-15 students, therefore, there would certainly be room to accommodate additional students from the PhD in BME program providing an additional benefit of increased FTE production to the departments offering these courses. Moreover, the BME courses offered in the MAE department enrich the department curriculum and offer additional courses for our PhD students to consider in their graduate education. As noted in the curriculum section, all elective courses are currently being delivered at UCF and the departments in CECS have committed to offering these courses (see the letters from CS and ECE for example). Page 21 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 E. Describe what steps have been taken to obtain information regarding resources (financial and in-kind) available outside the institution (businesses, industrial organizations, governmental entities, etc.). Describe the external resources that appear to be available to support the proposed program. In developing the plan for the PhD BME in BME program proposal, we have investigated both government and corporate sources of funding, beyond research grants which our BME Faculty have a track record of successfully earning from the NIH, NSF, AHA, DARPA and the medical industry and other such competitive funding sources. For government funding, training grants are potential opportunities. Many of these require the terminal degree to be the doctoral degree (typical NIH T32, T35, and \"F\" programs) and are available to fund PhD in BME graduate students as well as MSBME along the-way students who will be enrolled in the PhD in BME program. An example of such a grant is the R25, or \"bridge-to-the-doctorate\" program administered by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) which is directed toward minority students and requires the institution with the terminal master's program to partner with an institution offering the doctoral degree (which could be UF or FIT, for example). Thus, this program seeks to provide a \"bridge\" for a qualified master's student to go on to the doctorate at the other institution. The funding is directed to (1) establishing a mentoring program between the two institutions, (2) enhancing the curriculum of the master's institution, (3) providing academic counseling for the master's students, and (4) strengthening the research capability of the master's institutions, through funded collaboration between the two institutions. The award is made to the two-institution partnership. The master's students must have the intention of ultimately obtaining the doctoral degree. The NIH Research Education Program (R25) also has the specific goal to support educational activities that enhance the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce. To this end, this funding opportunity announcement encourages the development of creative educational activities with a primary focus on Research Experiences and Courses for Skills Development. NIH encourages applications from research-intensive institutions that propose to develop recent baccalaureate science graduates from diverse backgrounds underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences so that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue PhD or MD-PhD degrees in these fields. As such, this program is ideally suited to recruit PhD students taking the MSBME along-the-way as well as traditional students who have the career goal to pursue a PhD. The American Heart Association offers Pre-doctoral Fellowships related to cardiovascular function and disease and stroke, or to related biomedical engineering/biotechnology problems. The Biomedical Engineering Society offers both undergraduate and graduate student awards (see www.bmes.org). Graduate PhD students can apply for these awards, which could provide some summer session funding. Given that UCF is designated as a minority serving institution, we will capitalize on opportunities from federal agencies aimed at enhancing minorities and under-represented students in STEM programs in recruiting graduate students for the proposed PhD in BME program. For example, in Florida, the McNair Fellowship offers a tuition waiver and a $25,000 annual stipend for 4 years and aims to promote diversity in our graduate student programs. Another such program is the Graduate FAMU Feeder Fellowships. UCF offers Graduate FAMU Feeder Fellowships financial support to the most outstanding FAMU Feeder Scholars who are admitted to UCF graduate programs. In addition to tuition and health insurance coverage, this fellowship pays a yearly stipend $12,000 for four years for doctoral students. Award recipients are selected in spring by the UCF Diversity Fellowship Committee for awards beginning the following fall term. UCF is member of the GEM consortium (https://gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/) whose mission to enhance the value of the nation's human capital by increasing the participation of underrepresented groups (African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanic Americans) at the master's and doctoral levels in engineering and science. GEM Fellowship applications are open annually and due November 15. The UCF College of Graduate Studies hosts a site with available competitive fellowships for incoming graduate students (https://graduate.ucf.edu/fellowships/). Moreover, the UCF Office of Prestigious Awards (https://opa.ucf.edu/) provides mentoring for students applying annually to the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowships Program (https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). The GRFP welcomes applications from individuals who are pursuing full-time research-based master's and doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and Page 22 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 mathematics (STEM) or in STEM Education and offers an annual stipend of $34,000 and a cost of education allowance of $12,000 to the institution. Our students have been successful in such applications, for example, in 2021 three of our graduate students, Brendan Cavainolo, Jake Carter, and Robert Greene earned NSF GRFP, and in 2020 four of our graduate students, Debraliz Isaac-Aragones, Leslie Simms, Victor Rodriguez and Alex Ruiz, earned the NSF GRFP. We have performed a web-based search for companies emphasizing or with needs in the areas of our initial foci, which are biomechanics and biofluids. The companies The companies with biofluids interest include Goretex, Bard, Boston Scientific, Microfluidics, Medtronic, St. Jude, Abbott Labs, Johnson & Johnson, Biotronik, Xona Microfluidics, Heartware, and Thoratek. Many of these have divisions or offices in Florida. We are also compiling a list of software and imaging companies that have interests in computational fluid dynamics. We have specifically spoken to Medtronic about possible support. Medtronic issued over 100 grants in 2020, some of which were in Florida and to organizations in Jacksonville, where Medtronic has facilities. Medtronic's business activities have increased dramatically in central Florida due to the growing Orlando healthcare systems. It is possible that a partnership with our BME program, perhaps in the form of educational grants for the proposed PhD program, could be fashioned. Finally, central Florida's major healthcare systems are potential sources of financial, facilities and human resources support for the proposed PhD program in BME. The healthcare systems (OrlandoHealth, Advent Health, and HCA) will be key in providing clinical facilities for the PhD research. Physicians and other healthcare professionals will be solicited to serve as mentors for many of our students. Many of these physicians already hold faculty positions in the COM, and some have already served as mentors to medical students pursuing BME-related FIRE (Focused Inquiry & Research Experience) projects as part of the COM curriculum. Most willingly serve on a volunteer basis. This synergy in the support of our PhD program from Orlando Health for example, is clearly stated in Dr. DeCampli's support letter. IV. Projected Benefit of the Program to the University, Local Community, and State Use information from Tables 1 and 3 - Appendix A, and the supporting narrative for \"Need and Demand\" to prepare a concise statement that describes the projected benefit to the university, local community, and the state if the program is implemented. The projected benefits can be both quantitative and qualitative in nature, but there needs to be a clear distinction made between the two in the narrative. BME is an interdisciplinary field that involves the development of new technologies in health care. Developing a PhD in BME at UCF offers a multitude of benefits across UCF, Orlando, and Florida. Nationwide, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) (http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/biomedical-engineers.htm) reports that employment of bioengineers and biomedical engineers grew 27 percent from 2012 to 2019 and is projected to grow 5 percent from 2019 to 2029 at a faster rate than the average rate of growth for all occupations. Increasing numbers of technologies and applications to medical equipment and devices, along with the medical needs of a growing and aging population, will require the services of these workers and many of whom are expected to have advanced degrees PhD in BME (and MSBME). A Linkedin search on 7/21/2021 shows 200 postings. Page 23 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 The first such posting for example with Halkey-Roberts Corp. in St. Petersburg seeks preferably a PhD in BME applicants. Biotech companies in Florida have increased by 174% over the past decade (FloridaBioDatabase.com). PhD in BME will provide highly trained graduates to support the fast-growing biomedical industry in the state. A distribution map of bioengineering companies compiled by the Florida Bioengineering database shows that UCF is well located to answer the needs of the growing bioengineering industry. Central Florida is home to three large hospital networks (Florida Hospital, Orlando Health, and HCA), as well as VA and Nemours in the Medical city. The PhD in BME will help UCF to align with the local biomedical infrastructure, and support the medical delivery, research and education enterprise of these large and important community institutions. The PhD in BME program will also support the growing medical city at Lake Nona, see for example the GuideWell Innovation Center (https://guidewellinnovation.com/) incubator at Lake Nona which seeks to develop Health Technology Start-ups. The PhD in BME will strengthen existing multidisciplinary collaboration within UCF between CECS and COM, as well as multiple research cluster initiatives (Bionic Material and Interface, Disability and Aging, Bioinformatics), therefore enhancing UCF's extramural research funding portfolio. The PhD in BME program will offer more opportunities for the participation of undergraduate research and entice UCF CECS undergraduates to pursue a BME PhD degree at UCF instead of going to other universities, thus organically growing the PhD population. V. Access and Articulation - Bachelor's Degrees Only A. If the total number of credit hours to earn a degree exceeds 120, provide a justification for an exception to the policy of a 120 maximum and submit a separate request to the Board of Governors for an exception along with notification of the program's approval. (See criteria in Board of Governors Regulation 6C-8.014) Not applicable - graduate program. B. List program prerequisites and provide assurance that they are the same as the approved common prerequisites for other such degree programs within the SUS (see link to the Common Prerequisite Manual on the resource page for new program proposal). The courses in the Common Prerequisite Counseling Manual are intended to be those that are required of both native and transfer students prior to entrance to the major program, not simply lower-level courses that are required prior to graduation. The common prerequisites and substitute courses are mandatory for all institution programs listed, and must be approved by the Articulation Coordinating Committee (ACC). This requirement includes those programs designated as \"limited access. If the proposed prerequisites are not listed in the Manual, provide a rationale for a request for exception to the policy of common prerequisites. NOTE: Typically, all lower-division courses required for admission into the major will be considered prerequisites. The curriculum can require lower-division courses that are not prerequisites for admission into the major, as long as those courses are built into the curriculum for the upper-level 60 credit hours. If there are already common prerequisites for other degree programs with the same proposed CIP, every effort must be made to utilize the previously approved prerequisites instead of recommending an additional \"track\" of prerequisites for that CIP. Additional tracks may not be approved by the ACC, thereby holding up the full approval of the degree program. Programs will not be entered into the State University System Inventory until any exceptions to the approved common prerequisites are approved by the ACC. Not applicable - graduate program. C. If the university intends to seek formal Limited Access status for the proposed program, provide a rationale that includes an analysis of diversity issues with respect to such a designation. Explain how the university will ensure that Florida College System transfer students are not disadvantaged by the Limited Access status. NOTE: The policy and criteria for Limited Access are identified in Board of Governors Regulation 6C-8.013. Submit the Page 24 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Limited Access Program Request form along with this document. Not applicable - graduate program. D. If the proposed program is an AS-to-BS capstone, ensure that it adheres to the guidelines approved by the Articulation Coordinating Committee for such programs, as set forth in Rule 6A-10.024 (see link to the Statewide Articulation Manual on the resource page for new program proposal). List the prerequisites, if any, including the specific AS degrees which may transfer into the program. Not applicable - graduate program. Institutional Readiness VI. Related Institutional Mission and Strength A. Describe how the goals of the proposed program relate to the institutional mission statement as contained in the SUS Strategic Plan and the University Strategic Plan (see link to the SUS Strategic Plan on the resource page for new program proposal). As articulated in Section I-D and I-E, the PhD in BME program aligns itself with the strategic goal of UCF to become a top 50 metropolitan research university by becoming America's leading partnership university by partnering internally and externally to serve and positively impact our community, building an inclusive environment with a culture of compassion at its core, and achieving international prominence in key programs of graduate study and research. The PhD in BME aligns itself with the SUS BOG mission and its strategic plan that specifically identifies biomedical engineering as a key enabling industry that: (1) provides jobs with high average annual salaries, and (2) fits within the overarching strategy of building a stable Florida economy based on knowledge and innovation. The PhD in BME program mission statement is articulate below: PhD in BME Mission Statement The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) in keeping with the Mission and Goals of the University of Central Florida and the SUS BOG will be home to a PhD in Biomedical Engineering program exploiting the combined intellectual and physical resources at the University of Central Florida to, (a) serve engineering students pursuing a career in biomedical engineering or a related field, and (b) create new knowledge through cross-college collaborative research between engineering, the biological sciences and the local medical community. The proposed program is designed to support UCF's special mission as a Metropolitan Research University. It will: enhance and enrich our high-quality engineering graduate program offerings, enhance a key thrust in research and graduate education, provide a multiplicity of opportunities for research and educational partnerships with Central Florida medical, industrial, and governmental institutions. As such, the PhD in BME program is also aimed at fulfilling the stated mission of the SUS BOG that directs the State University System of Florida to provide undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, research, and public service of the highest quality through a coordinated system of institutions of higher learning, each with its own mission and collectively dedicated to serving the needs of a diverse state and global society. B. Describe how the proposed program specifically relates to existing institutional strengths, such as programs of emphasis, other academic programs, and/or institutes and centers. Significant research in biomedical engineering has been achieved at UCF with BME research Page 25 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 carried out by faculty in several Departments of CECS. Moreover, the now-famous student-developed prosthetic limb (arm) is a product of BME work carried out by MAE students (http://limbitless-solutions.org/index.php/en/). UCF is strong in robotics and simulation, both products as well as tools of biomedical engineering. A number of National Institutes (NIH), American Heart Association (AHA) and NSF supported studies have been carried out in both the CECS, COM and CREOL. All of these are fundamentally under the moniker of BME. The MAE department has developed a strong BME research portfolio. BME faculty whom we recruited in preparation of our PhD in BME program have been highly productive. For example, Helen Huang established the highly successful BRAIN lab (https://mae.ucf.edu/BRAIN/) has an ongoing $5M NIH RO1 grant and has recently won a 500K 5-year NSF CAREER award in the general area of biomechanics and rehabilitation and interdisciplinary neuroscience. Robert Steward was awarded a 700K 5-year NIH mentoring grant and has won a 500K 5-year NSF CAREER award in the area of the interaction of shear stress on endothelial cell migration and proliferation with applications to cardiac disease. Alain Kassab has been awarded a 3-year transformative grant from the American Heart Association in a collaborative effort with Dr, William DeCampli at the UCF COM and Orlando Health for their work on improving Left Ventricular Assist Device implantation to reduce stroke and a recent two-year grant from Additional Ventures for work on the development of injection jet concept for the Fontan palliative treatment. Moreover, Dr. DeCampli and Dr. Kassab have been continuously funded over the past 10 years by American Heart Association in a collaborative effort in computational hemodynamic studies for congenital heart disease treatment planning. Dr. Sudeshna Pal has a NIH R25 multi-year grant entitled \"A Biodesign Program in Rehabilitation Engineering\" structured to train undergraduate and graduate students in the design, innovation and commercialization process of assistive and rehabilitative medical devices for persons with disabilities. This collaborative project with the UCF COM the College of Nursing. The proposed Biodesign program is designed as a sequence of two courses with an intermediate clinical immersion junior and senior undergraduates and graduate engineering students. Dr. Qiushi Fu has an active 3- year NIH R15 (research enhancement award) to 'strengthen the biomedical research environment of the institution' and 'increase undergraduate research involvement' with funded undergrad RA positions. The research focus of the grant is to understand how to improve the efficacy of hand rehabilitation. Another example is a CREOL/COM/Orlando Health collaborative project, supported by an NIH R21 grant, is looking at continuous measurement of blood viscoelasticity as a measure of coagulation status during open-heart surgery. This project is currently part of a CREOL doctoral student's thesis work, but projects like this could be available to PhD BME students. There are other ongoing multi-year collaborations between Orlando Health/COM/MAE that have been supported by grants from the AHA in the general area of multi-scale computational fluid dynamics for treatment planning of congenital heart disease that has led to several Honors in Major (HIM), MS and PhD Dissertations and numerous journal publications both in the medical and engineering literature. They have also engaged international collaborations with the University of Toronto and Sick Kids Hospital in Canada. These projects have also engaged several undergraduate engineering and UCF-COM FIRE students over the course of several years. An example of the visibility of our collaboration is the 5th International Symposium on Engineering Frontiers in Congenital Heart Disease organized and hosted by Dr. DeCampli and Dr. Kassab June 9 and 10, 2016 at the UCF-COM. Another such collaborative project between Orlando Health/COM/MAE and supported by Orlando Health and the NSF in the area of treatment planning for orthosis utilized to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip has led to MS and PhD theses as well as several publications. This project is now funded by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute. Other examples include NIH funded collaborations between Nemours/MAE in the area of bioacoustic medical sensors led by Prof. Hansen Mansy. MAE faculty engaged in BME research have attracted over $15M in external grants over the past 10 years. There are several examples of successful 2-year COM FIRE projects with MD students that were guided collaboratively by COM/MAE faculty and that have produced publications and led to work beyond the 2-year FIRE project. Medical students with BME background pursuing a FIRE project could have led to a thesis and participation in the MSBME/MD should the program, as proposed, have been in place. Specific examples include Virgil Secanasu (external counter-pulsation of a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt designed to increases coronary blood flow), Christopher Page 26 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Cooper (benchtop studies of Left Ventricular Assist Device), and Benjamin Elsaphazir (pulsatile benchtop studies of LVAD cannula implantation to reduce stroke risk). All three MD students have graduated from the UCF COM and have begun their professional careers. Dr. Kassab and Dr. DeCampli have recruited a number of female UCF-COM students with a BME background for FIRE projects in the cardiovascular field. Although not exhaustive, these are additional examples of vibrant and productive going collaborations that will offer research projects for dissertations. It is fully expected that these collaborations will expand in scope and fully support the research portfolio of the BME program. The UCF Lake Nona Medical Center opened March 1, 2021, bringing full-service, acute care to the growing Lake Nona community in a hospital that will also train the next generation of healthcare providers and support innovative medical research. Located next to the UCF College of Medicine in Orlando's Medical City, UCF Lake Nona Medical Center provides 24/7 emergency care, comprehensive inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and is expected to serve more than 17,000 patients in its first year. The hospital is also the centerpiece of UCF's new Academic Health Sciences Center, that one day will bring many of the university's clinical training programs to Lake Nona and create more interprofessional medical education and research. As an academic hospital, UCF Lake Nona Medical Center will have three missions - patient care, medical education and research as such provides a unique opportunity for collaboration with our BME program and access to clinical data for our PhD students. The Veteran's Administration Hospital in the Medical City is a major clinical, equipment and facility resource for graduate students pursuing research in biomechanics and medical robotics. Other potential collaborators include the Nicholson Center for Research and Simulation, Nemours Children's Hospital, and Advent Health. In 2020, the director of research at Advent Health University, Prof. Mohtashem Samsam and Prof. Alain Kassab organized a research symposium connecting BEM faculty in MAE with medical professionals at Advent Health with the aim of building research partnerships. Our own COM houses a state-of-the-art anatomic pathology teaching laboratory that will serve the program, in particular, MSBME students taking the course Mechanics of Biostructures I and II will have access to the pathology lab to participate in selected pro-section experiences that will be taught by Prof. Emily Bradshaw, who is the COM faculty member currently teaching the Form and Function MD curriculum. C. Provide a narrative of the planning process leading up to submission of this proposal. Include a chronology in table format of the activities, listing both university personnel directly involved and external individuals who participated in planning. Provide a timetable of events necessary for the implementation of the proposed program. The College of Engineering and Computer Science has prepared and planned for the PhD in BME for nearly 10 years beginning the BME minor instituted in 2011, and the appointment by the MAE Department chair of Prof. Alain Kassab Director of BME in Spring 2015. The MAE department began recruiting BME faculty over the period 2015-2020 (Huang, Steward, Song, and Perotti). The MAE department launched the MSBME program in Fall 2016. In Spring 2017, a PhD in BME pre-proposal committee was formed with Alain Kassab (MAE) as Chair, and committee members Robert Steward (MAE), Brian Kim (ECE), Juan Cendan (UCF COM), William DeCampli (UCF COM). A survey of undergraduate students was carried out to provide data supporting the student interest in the proposed PhD in BME program. The committee drafted the pre-proposal which was approved by the SUS CAVP in Fall 2017 without concerns. The MAE Department spearheaded the Prosthetics Interfaces Cluster initiative in 2016 which led to the recruitment of 7 faculty members including the cluster head Dr. Melanie Coathup who is a minority faculty (https://med.ucf.edu/person/melanie-coathup-bsc-phd/). Cluster faculty members (Fu and Choi) joined the MAE Department in 2017-2018 The MAE Department participated in the Disabilities and Aging Technologies Faculty Cluster initiative and added an additional BME faculty 2019 (Park). Dr. Wen Shen was recruited in 2020. The MAE Department and CECS as well as the faculty cluster initiatives provided the necessary resources and laboratory space for recruited BME faculty. Page 27 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 The BME faculty met regularly over the course of 2018-2019 to shape the BME curriculum, determine the core required courses, and fashion the BME PhD Qualifying Examination option for the ME PhD Qualifying Examination procedures and policies. The curriculum was discussed and as it was developed with industry input from Dr. DeCampli Chief of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Co-Director of the Heart Center at Orlando Health and Dr. Mohtashem Samsam Director of Research at Advent Health. Dr. Samsam also materially contributed to the development of the Biostructures I and II courses as well as the specific sequence of pre-section anatomy laboratory experiences provided to our biomedical engineering students. Course Action Requests forms for the new BME courses were submitted and approved at the State level, and the new BME courses were incorporated into the MAE graduate course offering. A five-year BME course offering plan was put into effect in coordination with the MAE Graduate Coordinator and MAE Advising Office. The BME PhD Qualifying Examination was presented to the MAE Graduate Committee, approved by the MAE faculty at its Fall 2019 meeting, and implemented as an option for PhD students in the MAE program pursuing BME research. To date 5 such students passed the BME PhD Qualifying Examination and two more are scheduled for Fall 2020. Over the course of Summer 2019 and Fall 2019, Alain Kassab contacted the library and worked with Terrie Sypolt and Buenaventura Basco, Research and Information Services Librarians, who carried out an extensive library assessment and needs and report provided in Appendix B. The original report was completed in Fall 2019. The Library report was updated in July 2021 at the completion of the PhD in BME program proposal and reviewed by the Head Librarian who signed the report on July 23, 2021. In Fall 2020, the College of Engineering and Computer Science Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs, Dr. Ali Gordon, the MAE Chair, Yoav Peles, and Alain Kassab, met with Dr. Winston Schoenfeld Interim Associate Dean of Graduate Studies to chart and coordinate the timing of the milestones to be met for successful the submission for the proposal with the aim to have a program approved by the SUS BOG for the identified start date of Fall 2022. A PhD in BME in proposal drafting committee was assembled in Spring 2021 to prepare the program proposal. The PhD in BME drafting committee consisted of Alain Kassab, Ali Gordon, Helen Huang, Robert Steward and Qiushi Fu. The external reviewer, Dr, Ted Conway, was identified, formally contacted, and agreed to carry-out PhD in BME program proposal review. Letters of support were sought and obtained internally at UCF within the college of engineering and computer science as well as from the college of medicine and the college of nursing. Letters were sought and obtained from industry. Finally, the College of Engineering and Computer Science Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs, Dr. Ali Gordon, contacted SUS institutions that have PhD in BME programs to expose our proposed program and obtain letters of support. The PhD in BME program proposal draft was completed and provided to Dr. Ted Conway who provided the external review. The program proposal and appendices A-E were reviewed by UCF Graduate studies and the UCF Vice Provost Tim Letzring in August 2021. In Fall 2021, the proposal was submitted for approval by the MAE Graduate Committee, the CECS Graduate Committee, the UCF Graduate Council Curriculum Committee (GPCC), the UCF Graduate Council Program Review and Awards Committee (GPRC), and finally submitted the UCF Administration for approval to submit to the UCF BOT for review at its Fall 2022 meeting.

Program Quality Indicators - Reviews and Accreditation Identify program reviews, accreditation visits, or internal reviews for any university degree programs related to the proposed program, especially any within the same academic unit. List all recommendations and summarize the institution's progress in implementing the recommendations. Please include evidence that teacher preparation programs meet the requirements outlined in Section. 1004.04, Florida Statutes, if applicable. The PhD BME program is aligned directly with the strategic initiatives articulated in the 2017-2022 College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) Strategic Plan. The CECS is committed to growing the size and quality of its graduate program, strengthening partnerships with industry, and serving the state of Florida and beyond. The college identified several interdisciplinary research areas that align with the PhD in BME program such as smart materials and sensors to represent its highest priorities in its desire to accomplish its mission and realize its vision as well as support its desire to strengthen the departmental structure of our college and its research enterprise. The PhD BME program also serves to achieve the CECS strategic goal to grow the size and quality of its graduate program. As a result, two Faculty Cluster Initiatives related to Biomedical Engineering have been established: Bionic Materials, Implants & Interfaces (Bioniix), as well as Disability, Aging and Technologies (DAT). The MAE Department that will be home to the PhD in BME program offers two accredited undergraduate degrees: (1) BS in Mechanical Engineering and (2) BS in Aerospace engineering. A Draft Statement presenting the findings of the recent evaluation by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering & Technology (ABET) based on their virtual visit in Spring 2021 was given and we responded. The department has subsequently received notification that both BSME and BSAE programs have received a full 7-year accreditation that is valid until September 2027 (next regular ABET accreditation review cycle) The Biomedical Engineering MS program in MAE Department has completed an Academic Program Review in 2018-19 with external consultants. The recommendations were (1) continue to target a high-quality diverse pool for graduate student recruitment, (2) enrich curriculum content in biomedical engineering and assure course offering availability, (3) improve student career preparation, (4) increase student financial support. Page 30 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 The MAE department has made progress in addressing the MSBME program review recommendations: The department has since hired two additional faculty members with training and with research programs in biomedical engineering, who also teach undergraduate and graduate courses in traditional mechanical engineering discipline. These faculty members are: (1) Dr. Joon-Hyuk Park teaches classes in robotics and dynamics, (2) Dr. Wen Shen (Female), who teaches in biomaterials. The BME program successfully recruits under-represented in STEM students. Nearly half of our graduate students are female, and they have the opportunity to be mentored by a diverse faculty that includes three (3) females (H. Huang, W. Shen, and S. Pal) and two African Americans (O. Ilegbusi and R. Steward). Three new Biomedical Engineering graduate courses were developed and taught on a regular basis: BME 6231 Continuum (Dr. Fu), and BME 6525 Methods in Neural-Machine Interfaces (Dr. Fu). The BME courses as described in the curriculum are offered once a year as part of the overall MAE Graduate Program 5-year plan of course offerings. This not only enables satisfaction of the MSBME required courses but also lays the groundwork for the delivery of the 7 required courses for the proposed PhD in BME program. These new courses emphasize the application aspects through course projects, therefore enhance student career preparation in both academia and industry. Three recent graduates of the MSBME program are currently PhD students pursuing BME research projects for their dissertations as well as sitting for the BME PhD Qualifying exam option (2 with Dr. Helen Huang and one with Dr. Hwan Choi). Multiple external funding awards (see faculty CVs) have enhanced the MAE research portfolio thereby increasing student financial support (for example, Dr. Huang and Dr. Stewart: NIH RO1, NIHK25 and both with NSF CAREER awards, Dr. Fu: NIH R15). We will also seek additional funding opportunities (NIH R25 and T32, NSF NRT, McNight Fellowships, etc..,..) as indicated in the needs section and in other sections of this proposal. The formal PhD BME program proposal was prepared by the BME faculty in MAE (Kassab, Huang, Fu, and Steward) over the course of several meetings in the Spring and Summer of 2021. The concept of the program, as well as key elements (e.g., courses, qualifying examinations) have been evolving prior to the introduction of the MSBME degree in Fall 2016. All the necessary courses are in place and the curriculum has been presented and approved by the MAE Graduate Committee and MAE Faculty. The proposed PhD BME program proposal was reviewed and approved by the MAE Graduate Program Committee chaired by Prof. Jan Gou. Moreover, the BME Program Advisory Committee (BME-PAC) will serve to review, assess, improve, and revise the curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in achieving the identified program objectives, outcomes, and competencies with regards to career preparation, skills, and professionalism.

A PhD in BME for students with formal training in engineering or biomedical engineering who have earned a BS degree and seek post-baccalaureate training and research experience in biomedical engineering with the option of earning a MSBME along-the-way. B. A PhD in BME for students with formal training in engineering or biomedical engineering who have earned a MS degree and further graduate training and research experience in biomedical engineering. Admissions Requirements The PhD in BME applicants must complete an online application (https://applynow.graduate.ucf.edu/apply/#/) and must meet the minimum UCF standards for admission to the graduate programs at UCF as set out in the graduate catalog (https://catalog.ucf.edu/content.php?catoid=4&navoid=201#university-admission-standards). The applicants must have earned a bachelor's degree or equivalent from a regionally accredited U.S. institution or its equivalent from a foreign institution AND earned a 3.0 GPA Page 32 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 (or equivalent) or better in all work attempted while registered as an undergraduate student working for a baccalaureate degree OR earned a 3.0/4.0 GPA (or equivalent) or better in all work attempted while registered as an upper-division student working for a baccalaureate degree. Consideration will be given to applicants with undergraduate degrees in one of the following areas: BS in Biomedical Engineering (BSBME), BS in Aerospace Engineering (BSAE), BS in Mechanical Engineering (BSME), Materials Science and Engineering or a closely related discipline. Applicants with MS degrees in Biomedical Engineering (MSBME), MS in Aerospace Engineering (MSAE), MS in Mechanical Engineering (MSME), Materials Science and Engineering or a closely related discipline may also apply. Each applicant to a doctoral degree program shall present competitive scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) in the verbal, quantitative, and writing portions. Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation, a resume or a curriculum vitae, and a written essay. The submitted materials will be evaluated in the context of a holistic credential review by the BME Program Director (Alain Kassab) and the MAE Graduate Program Coordinator (Jan Gou) who will make admissions decisions for the PhD in BME program and match applicants with potential PhD advisors/mentors. Admission to the PhD in BME will be granted following current standards and practices for admission to the PhD programs in the CECS and in MAE. Generally, an acceptance decision will be based on the assessment of the applicant's GPA from previous college/university, past work experience, recommendation letters and the statement of interest and objectives. Additionally, the admission decision considers evaluation of other academic indicators such as having completed a senior thesis, a master's thesis, authorship on publications, internship, involvement in scientific research projects, and/or presentations at major scientific meetings and non-academic indicators such as evidence of leadership, extracurricular activities, work or military experience, and/or volunteer activities. The quality of past research experience and training experiences as indicated in recommendation letters will also bear upon the admission decision. For international students, a course-by-course evaluation of the student's official transcript must be submitted to a credential evaluation service recommended by UCF and an official GPA must be provided by the evaluating agency. Currently there are two agencies approved by the UCF Graduate College, and these are: World Educational Services (www.wes.org) and Joseph Silny (www.jsilny.com). International students can visit the Country Requirements page (https://ww2.graduate.ucf.edu/countryrequirements/) to review and submit the correct required documents for admission and evaluation purposes and can find further guidance at the College of Graduate Studies at (https://graduate.ucf.edu/international-applicants//).

Page 33 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Pre-Requisites For students who apply without a Mechanical Engineering BS or Biomedical Engineering BS, the following is list of a minimum requirement of undergraduate coursework that must be successfully completed prior to consideration for admission to the program: Students must have completed the mathematics foundations which includes the Calculus sequence through Differential Equations, Physics with Calculus foundations, and a programming course: Calculus I, II, III Differential equations Physics with Calculus I and II Programming language (Matlab, C, C++, Python, etc.) And students must have completed courses from at least three of the following areas: Statics or Dynamics Thermodynamics, heat transfer, or fluid mechanics Engineering materials, solid mechanics, or biomechanics Engineering mathematics or statistics Electrical circuits, electronics, or signal processing Students that do not meet the above criteria should specify their plans to complete these requirements prior to admission or outline how other non-didactic experiences could substitute for these requirements. Students who do not meet admission requirements may be conditionally admitted, whereby they would be required to articulate this required coursework during their first year of study. Courses taken to meet these requirements would not count towards their graduate degree. Graduation requirements Graduation requirements for the PhD in BME program follow the standards of the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the UCF College of Graduate Studies graduation requirements. Students must maintain a minimum 3.0 graduate program GPA to be eligible to graduate, and only graduate-level credit with a grade of \"C-\" or higher may be used to satisfy degree requirements. Furthermore, to complete all PhD in BME requirements and to be eligible to graduate, students must: 1. Complete 57 hours of coursework beyond the BS degree. 2. Successfully complete the PhD Qualifying examination. 3. Successfully complete the PhD Candidacy Examination and Dissertation Proposal Defense. 4. Complete 15 hours of Doctoral Dissertation 5. Successfully defend the PhD Dissertation. 6. Submit a completed PhD Dissertation. As the PhD in BME is a research-based degree, there is an expectation of presentation of research work at professional conferences and publication of research in scholarly journals. These expectations shall be met by the date of the defense of the dissertation and evaluated by the PhD dissertation committee. Typically, the expectation is that there will be at least one peer-reviewed conference paper and presentation and a peer-reviewed journal manuscript published, under review, or accepted by the time of graduation. The MAE department requires all graduate students to participate in the Department Seminar series in Fall and Spring. PhD in BME students are required to register in four (4) semesters of the MAE zero credit seminar (EML 5090) and make two seminar presentations prior to graduation: one prior to the candidacy and one prior to the Dissertation Defense. Page 34 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 C. Describe the curricular framework for the proposed program, including number of credit hours and composition of required core courses, restricted electives, unrestricted electives, thesis requirements, and dissertation requirements. Identify the total numbers of semester credit hours for the degree. The PhD in BME will strictly adhere to the general requirements of a PhD program as set out in the University of Central Florida Graduate College Catalog Doctoral Program Policies (https://catalog.ucf.edu/content.php?catoid=4&navoid=255). Specifically, the PhD in BME will require completion of a total of 72 hours at the graduate level post-bachelor's degree. These course requirements must satisfy the following: 57 hours comprised of a combination of 5000- and 6000-level classes (with a minimum of 27 hours of formal coursework exclusive of Independent Study, Doctoral Research, and Doctoral Dissertation), and 15 hours of Doctoral Dissertation. at least one-half of the credit hours used to meet program requirements must be in 6000-level or 7000-level courses, including the allowed number of research and dissertation hours. the doctoral dissertation hour requirements (15 hours) may only be satisfied by enrollment in dissertation hours, and these are only available after the student has passed the Candidacy Examination. only courses completed with a grade of \"C-\" or better qualify to satisfy degree course requirements. The PhD in BEM curriculum includes a core requirement of seven (7) classes, and it is provided below: PhD in BME required core courses - 7 courses (21 hours) BME 5216C: Mechanics of Biostructures I (3 hours) BME of Biostructures hours) (3 hours) BME 5742C: Modeling Techniques and Methodologies in Bioengineering (3 hours) ESI 5219: Engineering Statistics (3 hours) or STA 5206: Statistical Analysis (3 hours) Representative Electives (36 hours) minimum of 2 additional formal courses BME 5267 Biofluids (3 hours) Methods in MAE (3hours) EML 5237 Intermediate Mechanics of Materials (3 hours) Finite Elements I (3 hours) II (3 hours) EML I (3 Fluid Dynamics II(3 hours) EML 6712 Viscous Flow (3 hours) EAS 6185 Turbulent flow (3 hours) EML 5291 MEMS Materials (3 hours) EML 6299 Advanced Topics on Miniaturization (3 hours) EMA 5584 Biomaterials (3 hours) EMA 5588 Biocompatibility of Materials (3 hours) EMA 5060.

(3) successful defense of a PhD dissertation. (4) completion of four (4) zero-credit hour MAE Seminars. The PhD in BME Qualifying examination is a proposal-based examination and the procedures have been determined by the BME faculty, approved by the MAE Graduate Program Committee, and by the MAE Faculty. The PhD in BME Qualifying examination was instituted in Fall 2019 and is administered each Fall and Spring semester as an option for ME PhD students engaged in BME research and who were seeking BME training under our current curriculum and structure. The Biomedical Engineering (BME) PhD Qualifying Examination (QE) is structured as a proposal-based examination. This option was selected due to the wide variety of research areas within BME program that places severe challenges to traditional curriculum-based qualifying exams. This format requires students to demonstrate their research skills, particularly surveying the literature and planning experiments with different techniques or modeling. The format offers as well to the faculty on the QE exam committee the opportunity to interrogate the student in his/her understanding of fundamental subject matter required for the successful completion of the student's PhD program. Proposal-based QEs provide students with exposure to grant writing and practice preparing such documents that are useful skills to have later in their careers. Purpose of the BME PhD Qualifying Examination: the intent of BME qualifying examination is to evaluate the topical and technical skills of the student required to conduct the proposed research. There is no requirement of preliminary results and the intent of the draft proposal submitted by the student is at the level of a seed proposal to obtain data whether experimental or numerical or both. This proposal is to be a reflection of the student's work and understanding. This is not a pre-candidacy exam and this exam replaces the question-based traditional PhD qualifying examination and has the same aims. The qualifying examination topic should be distinct enough that it would not be included in the future candidacy exam about the actual PhD research to be undertaken by the student. The BME qualifying exam is as rigorous as the traditional written question-based exams. The student applying to the BME PhD Qualifying Examination should devote the same amount of time and effort to study and prepare properly. Format: The BME Qualifying Exam consists of a proposal prepared and defended by the student. The student will submit a written document on an approved subject and will give an oral presentation of the proposal followed by a question-and-answer session. The proposal will be evaluated by at least 3 faculty members (which does not include the PhD advisor), who will deliberate and vote on a pass or fail recommendation for the student. Each student will have an independent QE committee and two chances to pass the QE. The proposal prepared by the student will focus on a topic that is topically broadly related to their research area but not their PhD research. The student will submit their topic as an abstract (1 page in length) to the committee of three members responsible for their Qualify Exam to confirm the Page 36 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 suitability of the topic. The committee may provide feedback at this point to guide the student and may require modification of the abstract and/or topic. This examination is taken within the first two years into the PhD in BME program and must be successfully completed prior to the Candidacy Examination and Dissertation Proposal Defense. PhD in BME Candidacy Examination and Dissertation Proposal Defense are exams taken place prior to admission to Candidacy Status. It is normally taken near the end of completion of coursework and must be passed before being allowed to enroll in doctoral dissertation (XXX 7980) hours. The student shall identify a dissertation committee consisting of the dissertation advisor, two additional members of the MAE faculty, and an external member all of whom must be on the UCF graduate faculty (https://graduate.ucf.edu/graduate-guide/graduate-faculty-and-graduate-faculty-scholars). The student shall provide a written document of the dissertation proposal which will constitute the written portion of the examination and will be permanently filed in the student's permanent records. The student shall make an oral presentation to the dissertation committee and successfully defend the proposed dissertation topic. All committee members will evaluate and vote as to whether the student has successfully completed the examinations and will formally inform the Graduate Program Coordinator who will update the student's status upon successful completion of the exams. All materials including the approved proposal and other agreements will be kept in the student's file in the program. Students must have passed candidacy and have the candidacy and dissertation advisory committee documentation received and processed by the College of Graduate Studies prior to the first day of classes for the term in order to enroll in dissertation hours for that term. Dissertation Defense is an oral defense of the dissertation presented to the dissertation committee. This defense is made after consultation with the dissertation advisor and reports the outcomes of the doctoral research undertaken by the candidate as outlined in the dissertation proposal. The dissertation draft is to be provided to the committee at least two weeks in advance of the defense and the announcement of the defense (abstract, location, date and time) is to be posted at the CECS website two weeks prior to the defense. The student shall file an intent to graduate form and comply with the Graduate College regulations regarding the formatting and final submission of the dissertation for archival purposes (https://graduate.ucf.edu/thesis-and-dissertation/). D. Provide a sequenced course of study for all majors, concentrations, or areas of emphasis within the proposed program.

F. For degree programs in the science and technology disciplines, discuss how industry-driven competencies were identified and incorporated into the curriculum and indicate whether any industry advisory council exists to provide input for curriculum development and student assessment. The BME curriculum was designed by the diverse BME faculty members recruited from top BME national programs and national research labs over the past 5 years in MAE. The BME faculty also consulted medical professionals with whom they had research collaborations, for example Dr. William DeCampli, MD, PhD at Orlando Health and Dr. Mohtashem Samsam, MD at Advent Health. An example of such interactions is in the framing of the Biostructures I and II courses which were developed in close consultation with Dr. Mohtashem Samsam and aimed to deliver the anatomy and physiology content to bioengineering students. The program aims to train and prepare PhD graduates for successful careers in research and development in the biomedical industry, in academia, and in government research laboratories and agencies. Our PhD graduates will have the advanced ability to apply their knowledge of mathematics, engineering, and science to formulate and solve relevant biomedical engineering problems and conduct high-quality research at the interface of engineering and medicine, the ability to communicate scientific and technical research effectively in writing and oral presentations, and the ability to conduct independent cutting-edge research and contribute to the existing body of knowledge. The MAE Department has an Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) that reviews the curriculum and informs the department and department chair annually regarding industry needs and trends. The IAB is comprised of 16 members who are drawn from the local industry to represent stakeholders who are employers of our students, who provide internship opportunities for our undergraduates, and who may support our senior design I and II capstone courses. Represented industries include large companies such as Siemens Power Generation, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Americas, ABB Inc., Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, and Walt Disney World as medium size companies such as Dotdecimal, Medicomp, and Guard Dog Valves. The IAB meets with the MAE Chair and select faculty representing the department in the course of the academic year to receive an overview of the department status and to discuss issues and provide industry input concerning the department academic program. The following is a tentative advisory committee to be constituted upon the approval of the PhD in BME program. This committee will serve to guide and provide input on the program and will provide a connection for the program to the COM and the local biomedical industry. The following have provided verbally interest in participating in this board that tentatively will consist of: Ted Conway, PhD, Chair BME program FIT William DeCampli, MD, PhD, UCF-COM and Arnold Palmer Hospital TY Hsia, MD, MSME, UCF-COM and Arnold Palmer Hospital Mohtashem Samsam, MD, Advent Health Richard Sandler, MD, UCF-COM and Nemours Hospital Kevin Erhart, PhD, DotDecimal Tony Balda, BS, MBA, CEO and President Medicomp Kevin Erhart and Tony Balda serve on the MAE IAB. The PhD in BME program advisory board may be expanded as the PhD in BME program grows to address additional curriculum and research needs. The PhD in BME program will also be evaluated via the Annual UCF Institutional Effectiveness Assessment process for SACSCOC accreditation. Page 41 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 G. For all programs, list the specialized accreditation agencies and learned societies that would be concerned with the proposed program. Will the university seek accreditation for the program if it is available? If not, why? Provide a brief timeline for seeking accreditation, if appropriate. For degree programs in medicine, nursing, and/or allied health, please identify the courses that meet the requirements in Section 1004.08, Florida Statutes for required patient safety instruction. The PhD in BME is accredited along with all other graduate programs at UCF through the Southern Accreditation of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) process. Moreover, the PhD in BME program is reviewed by the State of Florida through the seven-year program review of the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the MAE Department. There are no PhD in BME program-specific accreditation agencies and learned societies that would be concerned with the proposed program. H. For doctoral programs, list the accreditation agencies and learned societies that would be concerned with corresponding bachelor's or master's programs associated with the proposed program. Are the programs accredited? If not, why? The proposed PhD in BME will be accredited along with all other graduate programs at UCF through the Southern Accreditation of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) process. The masters in BME (MSBME) program as well as the Master in Mechanical Engineering (MSME) and Aerospace Engineering (MSAE) in the home department are also accredited by SACSCOC, along with the PhD in Mechanical Engineering and the PhD in Aerospace Engineering. UCF does not have a Bachelor's in BME program, however, all engineering bachelor degrees at UCF are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET) https://www.abet.org/. The MAE Department recently underwent an ABET review of both of its bachelor degrees BSME and BSAE. It is expected that students admitted into the PhD in BME program who have engineering degrees including a BSBME from other institutions will have obtained these from ABET accredited programs. I. Briefly describe the anticipated delivery system for the proposed program (e.g., traditional delivery on main campus; traditional delivery at branch campuses or centers; or nontraditional delivery such as distance or distributed learning, self-paced instruction, or external degree programs). If the proposed delivery system will require specialized services or greater than normal financial support, include projected costs in Table 3 in Appendix A. Provide a narrative describing the feasibility of delivering the proposed program through collaboration with other universities, both public and private. Cite specific queries made of other institutions with respect to shared courses, distance/distributed learning technologies, and joint-use facilities for research or internships. The courses will be conducted on the main UCF campus and the UCF-COM utilizing classrooms and course delivery facilities currently existing at UCF. Wherever possible, courses will be available at remote UCF sites through the FEEDS distance learning system. As a research-intensive doctoral program requiring specific lab space as well as direct oversight by faculty during the dissertation phase, no queries for were made with respect to collaborating on the program with other institutions.

Use Table 3-Appendix A to display the costs and associated funding resources for existing and anticipated full-time faculty (as identified in Table 2-Appendix A). Costs for visiting and adjunct faculty should be included in the category of Other Personnel Services (OPS). Provide a narrative summarizing projected costs and funding sources. The proposed PhD in BME program benefits from existing UCF faculty members who are either tenured or tenured-earning with lines in MAE and who will support its curricular and research needs. These twelve (12) BME faculty members have been identified throughout the report and are repeated here (Kassab, Ilegbusi, Mansy, Song, Steward, Huang, Choi, Fu, Shen, Park, Perotti, and Pal). The workload by budget classification is 1.13 FTE for Year 1 and it is 1.16 FTE for Year 5 as we do not anticipate additional hires in years 1-5, however the increase does reflect additional FTE for advising on the part of the BME program director. This workload reflects a one course assignment per year for each listed faculty member as well as time for the appointed Biomedical Engineering Program Director (currently Dr. Alain Kassab) and this approximately is equivalent to total a little over a full faculty member's workload. Academic program support for MAE programs (Undergraduate Program Director, Graduate Program Director, Advising Director, Admission Specialist, etc...) is housed within the MAE Academic Advising Office in Engineering 1 Room 381 (https://mae.ucf.edu/advising/). This suite consists of 6 offices, a waiting room, and a conference room. C. Provide in the appendices the abbreviated curriculum vitae (CV) for each existing faculty member (do not include information for visiting or adjunct faculty). The NIH style 5-page CV's of the twelve BME faculty in MAE are provide in Appendix E. These faculty members are listed in section A of the Faculty Participation section of the PhD in BME program proposal. Page 44 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 D. Provide evidence that the academic unit(s) associated with this new degree have been productive in teaching, research, and service. Such evidence may include trends over time for average course load, FTE productivity, student HC in major or service courses, degrees granted, external funding attracted, as well as qualitative indicators of excellence. By all measures and indicators, the MAE Department is currently one of the most highly productive units at UCF and has a track record of excellence and productivity. The MAE faculty currently consists of 38 full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty members including the chair supported by 7 lecturers and instructors. The MAE faculty counts a recent addition, Dr. Wen Shen who joined the department in Fall 2020. The department offers a BS, MS and PhD in Mechanical Engineering and a BS, MS and PhD in Aerospace Engineering and recently launched the MS in BME in Fall 2017. In Fall 2020, the MAE faculty educated a student body of 4,381 comprised of 3,980 ME and AE undergraduates and 401 MS and PhD students. The department has developed an innovative and highly successful heavily subscribed large 2 semester senior design program (over 1,000 students/year) under the guidance and Dr. Mark Steiner and Dr. Kurt Stresau who have secured recurring local industry support (I-Design) for the program that tripled since 2016 and averaged over 300K/year in 2019-2021 (see the historical past 5-years of expenditures graphed below). Moreover, the MAE department is seeking funds from the President's 2021-2022 Strategic Investment Program: Jump Start Fund to obtain a university-supported annual expenditure of $2M for our senior design courses. Quantitative measures of productivity of the MAE faculty are provided below in terms of student head count at the undergraduate and graduate levels, degree productions, external funding, and journal publications: (1) Undergraduate student head count (UGSHC) has been steadily increasing over the years. The undergraduate student head count has more than doubled from 1,830 in AY 2010-2011 to a current enrollment of 3,980 in Fall 2020. Page 45 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 (2) Graduate student head count (GSHC) has also steadily increased over the years. Remarkably, the graduate student count has more than doubled from 170 (118 MS and 52 PhD) in AY 2010-2011 to 401 (254 MS and 147 PhD) in Fall 2020. In AY 2019-2020 the MAE faculty graduated 114 graduate students (the AE PhD is a newly launched PhD program). (3) The MAE PhD graduation productivity is high with a remarkable growth over the past 5 years. This is reflection of the increased research activity and outstanding grantsmanship of our dynamic faculty. Page 46 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 (4) The MAE annual research expenditures have also steadily increased over the past decade nearly doubling from $3.6M in AY 2010-2011 to $6.8M in AY 2020-2021. The MAE faculty has consistently demonstrated a high scholarly productivity currently with an average of 3+ journal papers published per faculty member per year. Although the department undergraduate enrollment grew from 1,830 students in AY 2010-2011 to over 4,400 students in Fall 2021, the MAE department significantly grew both its research and PhD programs and number of graduate degrees awarded. Clearly, the MAE program delivers highly sought-after BS degrees in ME and AE all the while being a highly productive research active department. In AY 2020-2021, on average, a MAE faculty member educated 97 students, produced 3 graduate students, generated 180K in research expenditures, and published 3 journal papers. It is also a measure of the quality of the MAE Department that members of its faculty are Fellows or Associate Fellows of national and international professional societies.

Describe library resources currently available to implement and/or sustain the proposed program through Year 5. Provide the total number of volumes and serials available in this discipline and related fields. List major journals that are available to the university's students. Include a signed statement from the Library Director that this subsection and subsection B have been reviewed and approved. Reproduced below are elements for the memo from Terrie Sypolt and Buenaventura Basco, Research and Information Services Librarians regarding the library report of the PhD in BME program. The complete memo and report are found in Appendix B. There are no projected costs needed to acquire library materials to support the new Biomedical Engineering PhD. Memo To: Dr. Alain Kassab, Professor, Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Dr. Yoav Peles, Chair, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos, Dean, College of Engineering & Computer Science Ms. Tina Buck, Interim Dept. Head, Acquisitions & Collections Ms. Sara Duff, Acquisitions Librarian Ms. Ying Zhang, Assoc. Director, Collection Services & Resource Management Mr. Frank Allen, Interim Director of Libraries Dr. Devon Jensen, Associate Dean, College of Graduate Studies Ms. Emily Stettner, Assistant Director, Graduate Curriculum From: Terrie Sypolt and Buenaventura Basco, Research and Information Services Librarians Subject: Library Evaluation of the Proposal to add a Biomedical Engineering PhD., in the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department Date: October 1, 2019; Updated July 23, 2021 Peer Comparisons When reviewing library support (databases, journal titles, and books) for the proposed Biomedical Engineering PhD, the faculty and I selected the following institutions for comparison: University of Florida Biomedical Engineering, PhD University of Pennsylvania, Bioengineering, PhD Texas A&M University, Biomedical Engineering, PhD Purdue University, Biomedical Engineering, PhD Page 49 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 Summary and Projected Costs for New Library Resources The UCF Libraries' current journal and database holdings will meet the needs for the proposed PhD, and therefore no immediate subscription costs are requested (see full analysis below). The only databases we lack are EMBASE and Scopus that multiple peer institutions have. While EMBASE database would be beneficial, it is not crucial to this program since much of the material is duplicated in Medline. A large percentage of unique material is drug-disease and drug-drug interactions which is not related to our proposed program and therefore not needed by UCF at this time. In the event any new key journal or database becomes critical for the PhD program in the future, additional recurring funding will need to be provided to the libraries to add these resources. Also note that in the unfortunate event library budget shortfalls occur, some existing resource subscriptions may be cut or scaled back. UCF's program is divided between Biomedical Sciences (Molecular Biology, Cancer, Immunity and pathogenesis, metabolic and cardiovascular, and neuroscience) and Biomedical Engineering (medical devices). UCF does need to purchase Cold Spring Harbor Protocols. EBSCO quoted a price of $5,089.00 for the first year with a price increase of 5% each year thereafter. While this is a database needed, it is needed by Biomedical Sciences and NOT Biomedical Engineering. Therefore, we will not charge this to Biomedical Engineering. Should the PhD program begin to develop medical devices and patent them, the program/Biomedical Engineering Department will need to purchase IEC Standards for the medical devices from the Techstreet Store. Since these standards will be housed in their lab, the department will need to purchase those, as needed. Library funds will not be used for these. Book comparison with the peer institutions chosen shows that UCF compares favorably with them and has the books needed to support the PhD program in Biomedical Engineering. We set the foundation for the PhD program when we did the library evaluation for the Masters proposal, when we purchased books and an e-book database for the Masters program. Therefore, we do not need additional funds for books at this time. Our Reference books compare favorably to the chosen peer institutions. We have made a $445.15 one-time purchase for the Encyclopedia of Medical Robotics 4v set 2018 from Amazon. \"The Encyclopedia of Medical Robotics combines contributions in four distinct areas of Medical robotics, namely: Minimally Invasive Surgical Robotics, Micro and Nano Robotics in Medicine, Image-guided Surgical Procedures and Interventions, and Rehabilitation Robotics. The volume on Minimally Invasive Surgical Robotics focuses on robotic technologies geared towards challenges and opportunities in minimally invasive surgery and the research, design, implementation, and clinical use of minimally invasive robotic systems. The volume on Micro and Nano robotics in Medicine is dedicated to research activities in an area of emerging interdisciplinary technology that is raising new scientific challenges and promising revolutionary advancement in applications such as medicine and biology. The size and range of these systems are at or below the micrometer scale and comprise assemblies of micro and nanoscale components. The volume on Image-guided Surgical Procedures and Interventions focuses primarily on the use of image guidance during surgical procedures and the challenges posed by various imaging environments and how they related to the design and development of robotic systems as well as their clinical applications. This volume also has significant contributions from the clinical viewpoint on some of the challenges in the domain of image-guided interventions. Finally, the volume on Rehabilitation Robotics is dedicated to the state-of-the-art of an emerging interdisciplinary field where robotics, sensors, and feedback are used in novel ways to re-learn, improve, or restore functional movements in humans.\" Biomedical Engineering has already transferred funds to cover the cost of this encyclopedia set. Additional reference books that the department could purchase, if they want to do so, include a new edition of Encyclopedia of Medical Devices and Instrumentation (2006) for 2276.00 and Biomedical photonics handbook, v 1 Fundamentals, Devices & Techniques (2015) for $59.96.

Computational Biomechanics Lab (Eng 1, Room 339: 234 sq. ft.) Lab Director: Dr. Luigi Perotti. The Computational Biomechanics Lab focuses on understanding the mechanisms governing macro- and micro-scale biological systems using the tools of continuum and computational mechanics. In particular, we are interested in cardiac mechanics and electrophysiology, and in the assembly and maturation of viral capsids and the morphing/deployable structures they inspire. Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death worldwide, yet its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This lack of understanding limits our ability to diagnose the onset of HF and to identify effective therapies. In this context, computational models are able to interpret patient specific data, expose the causal factors of different types of HF, and provide insights into interventional and pharmacological therapies. One of our main research areas focuses on combining voxel displacement information acquired via DENSE MRI and cardiac microstructure information based on DT-MRI to estimate aggregate cardiomyocyte (myofiber) strains based exclusively on in vivo data. As cardiomyocyte shortening drives cardiac contraction, myofiber strain is a promising biomarker to directly characterize cardiac function and dysfunction. Using the same computational tools, we investigate new bio-inspired structures, such as self-assembling and deployable thin shells, based on the maturation of viral capsids. Starting from a hexagonal template that is easily folded, these structures can be deployed in 3D and evolve to a final shape previously encoded in their flat templates. In order to support this effort, Dr. Perotti and his team have access to several high-end workstations, a Raid-6 Network-Attached Storage (NAS) system, and a 3D printer for quick prototyping and outreach activities.

Include projected costs of special resources in Table 3-Appendix A. None required. The proposed PhD program in BME will have access to many research facilities and personnel at the COM's affiliated hospitals and clinics (such as those of Orlando Health and Advent Health). These personnel, many of whom are affiliated faculty members of the COM, may serve as guest lecturers in the core courses of the program, or mentors for student theses. An example of such facility is the Nicholson Center for Research and Simulation (associated with Advent Health). We have previously had access to an accredited large animal facility at Orlando Health These hospitals house advanced imaging facilities such as catheterization/fluoroscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. There are numerous precedents for collaboration between UCF teachers and researchers, and the physician and allied staff of these hospitals and related healthcare facilities. The use of these facilities has most often occurred \"at cost for research\", or even gratis. For example, Dr. William DeCampli, MD, PhD who is Chief of Pediatric Thoracic Surgery and Director or the Heart Center at Orlando Health as well as Professor of Surgery at the UCF COM and Dr. T.Y. Hsia, MD, MSME, Senior Pediatric Thoracic Surgeon and as Professor of Surgery at the UCF COM both hold secondary joint appointments in the MAE Department and have active research grants from the American Heart Association and Additional Ventures. They closely collaborate with Professor Kassab and other faculty members in MAE and provide the bridge to the clinical aspects for our ongoing cardiovascular research projects. Costs associated with the research in the graduate program are usually covered by grants and may include contributions from the hospitals' foundations. An example is the successful 12-year collaboration between the CECS Department of Mechanical Engineering, COM, and the Heart Center at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. Orlando Health has supported our BME research over the years by supporting graduate students and acquisition of research equipment and medical professionals have collaborated on joint proposals that have been critical in maintaining our BME research and graduate program. It is expected that this partnership will evolve and grow significantly with the advent of our PhD in BME program. We refer to the support letter written by Dr. William DeCampli. No actual direct costs to the proposed PhD program in BME are expected. Given the history of creative collaboration among these institutions, that is, a combination of physician volunteerism and institutional foundation financial support that have enabled many of UCF's teaching enterprises, we expect this will be the case for the proposed program. I. Describe fellowships, scholarships, and graduate assistantships to be allocated to the proposed program through Year 5. Include the projected costs in Table 3-Appendix A. No formal commitment/allocation is made in terms of fellowships, scholarships, and graduate teaching assistantships to be allocated to the proposed program through Year 5. The MAE department has an allocation of Office of Research Fellowships for which our PhD in BME students will be eligible to apply. UCF also has competitive Presidential and Trustee Fellowships to which the Department nominates worthy candidates. The BME Engineering Program Director, Alain Kassab, will work in concert with the MAE Graduate Program Director to nominate such candidates. However, if the program is approved, we will seek with the aid of our CECS Program Development Office (Ms. Robyn Knight, Director) and our PhD in BME Program Advisory Board to seek industry support for annually awarded 2-year Fellowships, and resources to be accessed include Orlando Health and Florida Hospital Health Systems, Nemours Hospital, the VA- Hospital and regional as well as state-wide bio medical engineering industry. Moreover, as noted above, our BME faculty is highly successful in grant proposal award from a variety of national and regional agencies. Our faculty hold NIH RO1 and K25 grants as well as NSF Career Awards and research grants from diverse sources such as the American Heart Association and charitable foundations such as Additional Ventures. The research portfolio of the faculty currently supports PhD students pursuing BME research in the MAE program and it is expected that the future success of grants submitted Page 68 of 68 Form Updated September 2020 by our faculty will expand the number of students supported by the PhD in BME program. Moreover, there are opportunities to support development of the education missio n of the BME program through grant proposal opportunities such as the NIH R25 and T32 solicitations. Dr, Sudeshna Pal currently holds such an award supporting the delivery of a rehabilitation engineering immersive experiencer at UCF. It is anticipated that future successful grant proposals will support MSBME students engaged by MSBME faculty in their sponsored research projects. J.Describe currently available sites for internship and practicum experiences, if appropriate to the program. Describe plans to see k additional sites in Years 1 through 5. Students in the PhD in BME program will be able to utilize multiple cities for internship andpracticum experiences throughout Orlando including the UCF -College of Medicine, The Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, VA Hospital, Nemours Hospital, and various hospitals part of the Orlando Health and Florida Hospital Health Systems. Moreover, there will be opportunities for PhD in BME students to be engaged in clinically relevant experiences at the UCF Lake Nona Medical Center, a partnership academic hospital between the College of Medicine and HCA Healthcare.This facility is located at 6700 Lake Nona Blvd., adjacent to the UCF College of Medicine inOrlando's Medical City, UCF Lake Nona Medical Cen ter provides 24/7 emergency care and comprehensive inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Although, these experiences are not built in the proposed curriculum, there exists the possibility of formalizing such experiences as summer electives in the fu ture once the program is established and the need is identified from student requests, by the BME faculty, and/or by the Program Advisory Board members. Such experiences can receive formal recognition via the graduateinternship special courses designation which is submitted by a student under the guidance of an academic mentor. We also are working with the Faculty Coordinator at the UCF Office of Experiential Learning who works directly with CECS students in gaining internships and co -ops. Moreover, innovati ve enterprises such as Limbitless Solutions (https://limbitless -solutions.org/) a highly successful non - profit, founded at UCF by a MAE PhD student, engage PhD and MS in BME graduate students i n internship and in practicum experiences. Another such site, is the GuideWell Innovation Center ( https://guidewellinnovation.com/ ) at the Lake Nona Medical City that offer not only avenues for internship but also entrepreneurship and innovation through the Health Care spectru m. In addition, local industry such as Nanovation Partners LLC ( https://www.nanovationpartners.com/index.php/pages/our -team/) whose president is Dan Justin (BSM E and MSME graduate of MAE at UCF) is a nanotechnology organization specialized in the development, production and distribution of high purity nanotubes for t he MedTech industry, has provided internship opportunities for our BME students APPENDIX ATABLE 1-BPROJECTED HEADCOUNT FROM POTENTIAL SOURCES(Graduate Degree of headcount in any given year)*Year HCYear FTEYear HCYear 5 HCYear 5 FTEIndividuals drawn from agencies/industries in your service area (e.g., older returning students)21.532.2532.2532.2553.75Students who transfer from other graduate programs within the university**53.754332.2521.510.75Individuals who have recently graduated from preceding degree programs at this university10.7521.532.254353.75Individuals who graduated from preceding degree programs at other Florida public universities10.7521.532.254353.75Individuals who graduated from preceding degree programs at non-public Florida institutions10.7521.532.254353.75Additional in-state residents***0000000000Additional out-of-state residents***0010.750010.7510.75Additional foreign residents***10.7521.532.254353.75Other (Explain)***0000000000Totals118.2516121813.52216.52720.25* List projected annual headcount of students enrolled in the degree program.

The report was originally prepared October 1, 2019 and was updated and signed July 23, 2021. Memo To: Dr. Alain Kassab, Professor, Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Dr. Yoav Peles, Chair, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Dr. Michael Georgiopoulos, Dean, College of Engineering & Computer Science Ms. Tina Buck, Interim Dept. Head, Acquisitions & Collections Ms. Sara Duff, Acquisitions Librarian Ms. Ying Zhang, Assoc. Director, Collection Services & Resource Management Mr. Frank Allen, Interim Director of Libraries Dr. Devon Jensen, Associate Dean, College of Graduate Studies Ms. Emily Stettner, Assistant Director, Graduate Curriculum From: Terrie Sypolt and Buenaventura Basco, Research and Information Services Librarians Subject: Library Evaluation of the Proposal to add a Biomedical Engineering PhD., in the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department Date: October 1, 2019; Updated July 23, 2021 Peer Comparisons When reviewing library support (databases, journal titles, and books) for the proposed Biomedical Engineering PhD, the faculty and I selected the following institutions for comparison: University of Florida Biomedical Engineering, PhD University of Pennsylvania, Bioengineering, PhD Texas A&M University, Biomedical Engineering, PhD Purdue University, Biomedical Engineering, PhD Summary and Projected Costs for New Library Resources The UCF Libraries' current journal and database holdings will meet the needs for the proposed PhD, and therefore no immediate subscription costs are requested (see full analysis below). The only databases we lack are EMBASE and Scopus that multiple peer institutions have. While EMBASE database would be 3 beneficial, it is not crucial to this program since much of the material is duplicated in Medline. A large percentage of unique material is drug-disease and drug-drug interactions which is not related to our proposed program and therefore not needed by UCF at this time. In the event any new key journal or database becomes critical for the PhD program in the future, additional recurring funding will need to be provided to the Libraries to add these resources. Also note that in the unfortunate event library budget shortfalls occur, some existing resource subscriptions may be cut or scaled back. UCF's program is divided between Biomedical Sciences (Molecular Biology, Cancer, Immunity and pathogenesis, metabolic and cardiovascular, and neuroscience) and Biomedical Engineering (medical devices). UCF does need to purchase Cold Spring Harbor Protocols. EBSCO quoted a price of $5,089.00 for the first year with a price increase of 5% each year thereafter. While this is a database needed, it is needed by Biomedical Sciences and NOT Biomedical Engineering. Therefore, we will not charge this to Biomedical Engineering. Information about CSH Protocols: The online source of trusted techniques in molecular and cellular biology Contains new and classic protocols presented step-by-step with recipes and troubleshooting Frequently updated and annotated Interactive, customizable, and fully searchable The development of CSH Protocols is a response to requests from scientists for authoritative information about techniques with a broad editorial scope, delivered through a state-of-the-art online interface. At this site, you will find methods from Molecular Cloning along with selected protocols from many of our best-selling manuals, such as Cells and Antibodies, as well as protocols from Cold Spring Harbor's renowned on-site courses. In addition, you will discover new cutting-edge protocols submitted by and commissioned from laboratories worldwide. A peer-reviewed online journal, CSH Protocols is updated monthly. https://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?action=full&--eqskudatarq=727 http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/ Features include: Step-by-step, uniformly structured formats for ease of use and printing, with clearly linked materials, cautions, recipes, and troubleshooting Customizable, topic-based e-mail alerts for the latest updates in a particular field Personal folders for storing favorite protocols and searches Navigation tools including a specifically designed taxonomy for browsing and a variety of full-text search options A kit search tool for fast access to time-saving resources An online manuscript submission system for authors to contribute new protocols Should the PhD program begin to develop medical devices and patent them, the program/Biomedical Engineering Department will need to purchase IEC Standards for the medical devices from the Techstreet Store. Since these standards will be housed in their lab, the department will need to purchase those, as needed. Library funds will not be used for these. 4 Book comparison with the peer institutions chosen shows that UCF compares favorably with them and has the books needed to support the PhD program in Biomedical Engineering. We set the foundation for the PhD program when we did the library evaluation for the Masters proposal, when we purchased books and an e-book database for the Masters program. Therefore, we do not need additional funds for books at this time. Our Reference books compare favorably to the chosen peer institutions. We have made a $445.15 one-time purchase for the Encyclopedia of Medical Robotics 4v set 2018 from Amazon. \"The Encyclopedia of Medical Robotics combines contributions in four distinct areas of Medical robotics, namely: Minimally Invasive Surgical Robotics, Micro and Nano Robotics in Medicine, Image-guided Surgical Procedures and Interventions, and Rehabilitation Robotics. The volume on Minimally Invasive Surgical Robotics focuses on robotic technologies geared towards challenges and opportunities in minimally invasive surgery and the research, design, implementation, and clinical use of minimally invasive robotic systems. The volume on Micro and Nano robotics in Medicine is dedicated to research activities in an area of emerging interdisciplinary technology that is raising new scientific challenges and promising revolutionary advancement in applications such as medicine and biology. The size and range of these systems are at or below the micrometer scale and comprise assemblies of micro and nanoscale components. The volume on Image-guided Surgical Procedures and Interventions focuses primarily on the use of image guidance during surgical procedures and the challenges posed by various imaging environments and how they related to the design and development of robotic systems as well as their clinical applications. This volume also has significant contributions from the clinical viewpoint on some of the challenges in the domain of image-guided interventions. Finally, the volume on Rehabilitation Robotics is dedicated to the state-of-the-art of an emerging interdisciplinary field where robotics, sensors, and feedback are used in novel ways to re-learn, improve, or restore functional movements in humans.\" Biomedical Engineering has already transferred funds to cover the cost of this encyclopedia set. Additional reference books that the department could purchase, if they want to do so, include a new edition of Encyclopedia of Medical Devices and Instrumentation (2006) for 2276.00 and Biomedical photonics handbook, v 1 Fundamentals, Devices & Techniques (2015) for $59.96.

NTIS (National Technical Information Service) NTIS is the preeminent resource for accessing the latest US government sponsored research, and worldwide scientific, technical, engineering and business related information. NTIS is the central source for the sale of unclassified and publicly available information from research reports, journal articles, data files, computer programs and audiovisual products from Federal sources. Additionally, information is available from international government departments and other international organizations including those from Canada, Japan, the former Soviet Union, Western and Eastern European countries. Coverage: 1964-present. Reaxys Synthesis planning with easily searchable chemistry data, literature and reactions; includes medicinal chemistry. It provides access to chemical property, structure, and reaction data from the Beilstein (organic chemistry), Gmelin (inorganic and organometallic chemistry), and Patent Chemistry databases. The Beilstein database contains information on over 8 million compounds and more than 5 million chemical reactions. It provides comprehensive coverage of reactions, structures, and properties in organic chemistry; as well as references to the literature. For each compound, up to 350 chemical and physical data fields of critically evaluated data are available. The Gmelin database contains information on over 1.4 million compounds, including: coordination compounds, alloys, solid solutions, glasses and ceramics, polymers, and minerals. It provides comprehensive coverage of structures and properties in inorganic and organometallic chemistry; references to the literature and information on reactions (over 900,000) are also included. The Patent Chemistry database contains patents from 1975 and is included in Reaxys. Database Analysis: Comparison shows that databases at UCF compares favorably with other institutions. We do not need to pick up an institutional subscription to NTIS but must be prepared to departmentally purchase the items on a need basis from the NTIS store. While I thought we needed Reaxys , based upon the recommendation of a professor at UF, I have since changed my mind after talking with several other institutions. The following persons from John Hopkins 9 University: Susan M. Vazakas, Biomedical Engineering Librarian, Rob Wright, Medical Librarian, and Stephen Stich, Chemistry Librarian, talked with me as a group. Susan said that all the biomedical engineering faculty need for chemical reactions is SciFinder (Chem Abstracts) and Web of Science BIOSIS Citation Index (BIOSIS Previews), and the safety protocols in Springer Protocols and Cold Spring Harbor Protocols. They could also use the free protocols listed below. Rob White, Medical Librarian, said \"I don't have any experience with Reaxys, and only limited experience searching SciFinder for substances and literature.\" He uses Web of Science and some of the free biomedical protocols listed below. Kathleen Venit, BE Graduate Coordinator, University of Pennsylvania, Bioengineering, said that with their biomedical engineers it is a matter of preference for finding chemical reactions whether one uses Chem Abstracts or Reaxys. Either will contain the substances and reactions biomedical engineers would need in the lab or for projects. Sara Park, Biomedical Engineering Librarian, Duke University said that Reaxys is not needed. The databases UCF has will suffice. She did suggest that, as the PhD program develops, the program may need to purchase IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) Industry Standards for medical devices if the plan is to develop medical devices and patent them. They can be purchased from the Techstreet Store https://www.techstreet.com/publishers/iec?sid=goog&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx_2pnNTT5QIVGYiGCh0d4AD2EAAYAiAAEgK0UvD_BwE. UCF has both SciFinder and Web of Science and the free database PubChem as well as the main protocols in Springer Nature Experiments and several free protocols listed below. Cold Spring Harbor protocols is something we need to consider purchasing. The EBSCOhost platform has it available for $5,089.00 annually. We do NOT need Reaxys for the proposed program Many academic libraries are now dropping SCOPUS as other bibliometric methods are being developed and are freely available such as Taylor & Francis and Web of Science as well as inclusion of SCOPUS information in other databases such as Science Direct. Libraries also are dropping Knovel. Biomedical Sciences need to pick up is Cold Spring Harbor Protocols NOT Biomedical Engineering. (See discussion above.) These protocols deal with molecular biology and topics covered in the Biomedical Sciences PhD. Safety standards for medical devices are covered in the IEC Standards. Should the PhD program begin to develop medical devices and patent them, the program/Biomedical Engineering Department will need to purchase IEC Standards for the medical devices from the Techstreet Store https://www.techstreet.com/publishers/iec?sid=goog&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx_2pnNTT5QIVGYiGCh0d4AD2EAAYAiAAEgK0UvD_BwE.

He was the Inaugural Head of the Biomedical and Chemical Engineering and Sciences Department (2017 - 2020) and the Inaugural Head of the Biomedical Engineering Department (2014 - 2017) at Florida Tech. Prior to returning to Florida he had a permanent appointment with the National Science Foundation (NSF) as the Program Director (2008 - 2014) for the: 1) General & Age Related Disabilities Engineering Program (GARDE); 2) CBET-National Robotics Initiative (NRI); 3) CBET-Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Program (BRIGE); and 4) Science and Technology Center (STC): Emergent Behaviors of Integrated Cellular Systems (EBICS) in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Engineering (CBET) Division of the Engineering Directorate. The creation of the PhD degree program at UCF will build on the successes of the MSBME degree program that is currently housed within the MAE Department. Collaboration with the UCF College of Medicine will further strengthen the program by providing resources that most other PhD BME programs at Universities across the country are not able to offer. Many of the required courses for the PhD program have already been approved for the MSBME program and are currently being offered. This minimizes the need for additional coursework resources that are often necessary to initiate a new graduate program. The structure of the proposed PhD degree program is similar to other PhD programs that are currently offered at UCF with the general structure of initial coursework requirements, Qualifying Exam and Dissertation Defense. The need for this new graduate degree program is well established and will further strengthen the partnerships between UCF and the medical industry by providing employment opportunities for graduates of the BME PhD program. Graduates of the new BME PhD Program will also be highly trained to seek competitive positions as post-doctoral researchers or academic faculty at research and teaching universities. The BME PhD program that is being proposed at UCF will complement the other BME PhD programs within the State of Florida and is aligned with many of the top Universities in other states that offer similar programs. The variety of teaching and student mentoring modes (in-class presentation, virtual presentations, face-to-face and virtual student meetings, etc.) take advantage of 21st Century communication tools. It is well established that BME programs across the United States are the most diverse with respect to students' gender, ethnicity, disability status, etc. The proposed UCF BME PhD Program will leverage and build upon this diversity of students to create an inclusive environment that maximizes the opportunity to generate solutions to problems that currently exist in the Biomedical Engineering research community. Summary Overall, this is a well thought out graduate degree program. The UCF PhD Program in Biomedical Engineering will build on current resources in both the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Medicine. This program is needed to fulfill the current and emerging research and teaching requirement for Universities and local, national and international industries. The proposed academic program is strong and will provide a strong research, educational and mentoring environment for students interested in pursuing an advanced degree in Biomedical Engineering. 1 OMB No. 0925 -0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12 Approved Through 8/31/2015) BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Provide the following information for the Senior/key personnel and other significant contributors.

Personal Statement Over the past six years, I have been developing new MRI-based models to investigate cardiac mechanics and cardiac kinematics. As part of this training and previous research, I have received an American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship (2014-2016) and an NHLBI K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award (2017 - 2020). During this period, I have trained in the Radiological Sciences Department at UCLA, where I applied my computational modeling background to medical imaging data and I learned the basis of MR imaging and how to design, direct, and execute preclinical (swine) studies. As part of the research sponsored by my NHLBI K25 award, I have carried out preclinical (swine) studies involving healthy and infarcted subjects, from the experimental setup, to the approval of the research protocol, to directing and carrying out subject care and MR exams. These studies allowed me to coordinate and lead a large team of investigators across different disciplines, including veterinarians, MR scientists, MR technicians, lab personnel, undergraduate and graduate students. The goal of the study was to apply a new method that I developed to analyze MR images and estimate passive cardiac stiffness during late diastole. This research has allowed me to perfect my computational mechanics models, optimize their coupling with MR data, train in MRI, and learn how to assemble and direct a large investigative team (including about 15 people) to accomplish interdisciplinary research at the boundary between engineering and medicine [e.g., 1,2]. My training in computational mechanics and numerical analysis applied to multidisciplinary and multiphysics problems started during my PhD research, where I developed and utilized advanced numerical tools capable of modeling fluid-structure interaction and complex material response. This continues today [3]. Following my PhD, I pursue my goal to apply my computational and analytical training to problems in biomechanics. Initially, I focused on the analysis and maturation of spherical viruses. Our model provided important insights into the mechanisms underlying the shape changes of the protein capsomers forming the viral shell [4]. Subsequently, I sought the opportunity to join the Cardiac Modeling Group at UCLA to apply computational biomechanics to studying cardiac function in health and disease. During this research, I deeply appreciated how rigorous computational tools combined with medical data offer irreplaceable understanding of cardiac kinematics [1], mechanics [2], and electrophysiology (see contribution C3 below) and can provide insight into new pharmacological and interventional therapies. My PhD and first postdoctoral experience trained me in computational mechanics and in applying my numerical simulation skillset to complex problems in biomechanics. My training in the Radiological Sciences department at UCLA during my AHA postdoctoral fellowship and NHLBI K25 award allowed me to lead, plan, and carry out first-hand acute and chronic preclinical (swine) imaging experiments from beginning to end. The combination of these long training in engineering, MRI, and preclinical experiments provided me with direct knowledge of the complex aspects of cardiac MRI, data acquisition, and how to design new computational tools to extract information and mechanistic insights from the acquired imaging data. The unique blend of skills that I developed are at the frontier between mechanical engineering, bioengineering, and radiological sciences. This skill set positions me as an optimal candidate to carry out and lead the research described in this proposal. [1] I.A. In Vivo Diffusion and Displacement Encoded MRI\".

Contributions to Science 1. CARDIAC KINEMATICS - In the last 4 years I have developed new computational methods to compute microstructurally anchored measures of cardiac strains [1A-1C]. Myocardial strains characterize cardiac function, but are typically measured in an arbitrary reference system that depends on the definition of the ventricle long axis and are not linked to the cardiac microstructure, i.e., the preferential direction of aggregate cardiomyocyte. Together with Dr. Ennis, our goal has been to measure directly the shortening and relaxation of aggregate cardiomyocyte as they are mechanistically responsible for the contraction and relaxation of the ventricles. We were the first group to combine in vivo cardiac motion (using DENSE MRI) and cardiac microstructural data (using cDTI) [1D] to compute myofiber strains (Eff) [1A, 1B]. We have also studied new microstructurally anchored measures of cardiac deformation to quantify both the myocardial response in the direction of the cardiomyocytes and the extracellular matrix response [1B]. As a result of our work, we were able not only to compute microstructurally anchored cardiac strains, but also to investigate the effect of cardiac motion on cardiomyocyte orientation during the cardiac cycle [1C]. This mechanistic link between cardiac motion and cardiac microstructure allows us to measure cardiomyocyte shortening and relaxation, and therefore to link cellular function to global cardiac motion.

PMID: 31432042; PMCID: PMC6701689. 2. CARDIAC MECHANICS - My research on cardiac motion is closely related to my focus on modeling cardiomyocyte electrophysiology (see C3 below) and mechanics to understand ventricular contraction in health and disease. As in my studies on cardiac kinematics, the cardiomyocyte shortening and relaxation remain the mechanistic drivers for ventricular systole and filling. In order to develop subject specific models that can aid diagnosis and therapy planning, my first step has been developing a new computational tool to model the passive response of the myocardium during late filling [2A]. Diastolic function is compromised in numerous cardiac diseases, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the focus of my NHLBI K25 sponsored research. A main goal of my research was to link left ventricular pressure to cardiac motion to compute passive myocardial stiffness, a key biomarker to characterize heart health. One of the main problems with existing models was their inability to compute uniquely the passive myocardium material properties and therefore material properties computed using previous approaches could not be used as biomarkers to understand the onset and progression of cardiac disease. During my NHLBI K25 sponsored research, I have also tested a procedure to acquire left ventricular pressure by catheterizing the left ventricle under MR guidance only [2D], therefore streamlining the process and avoiding the need to perform this procedure using fluoroscopy. Subsequently, I have focused on modeling the active contraction of the cardiomyocyte with a sophisticated model that incorporates the Frank Starling effect [2B], often neglected in other computational approaches. We were also among the first groups to recognize the crucial role of boundary conditions in models of cardiac contraction [2C], while standard approaches often constrain the base of the left ventricle leading to unphysiological cardiac motion. As in the study of cardiac electrophysiology (please see C3 below), our focus has always been on identifying and achieving the validation criteria that our models need to satisfy, as only validated models can have an impact in the clinic.

CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY - My research on complex cardiac computational models began with studying the electrophysiology of arrhythmias. After developing, verifying, and validating a rigorous finite element model to study the normal activation of the heart [3A, 3B], I worked to develop a model of congestive heart failure to investigate the roles of different ion channels and microstructural changes in triggering ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation [3C]. Accurate and rigorous finite element models offer the unique capability to separate the mechanisms leading to arrhythmic conditions and to distinguish specific targets for pharmacological therapies. Our work is among the first to rigorously validate computational models for cardiac electrophysiology, placing a strong emphasis on clear criteria ranging from the restitution curve of the cell models, to the cardiac activation sequence, to the computed ECG, and the ability to initiate ventricular fibrillation under different conditions in the healthy [3A] and diseased heart [3C]. The ECG is the most used and accessible diagnostic tool in cardiac clinical practice but, before our work, only a few researchers computed and reported in the literature an ECG. Our work was the first to correctly compute this critical validation criteria without unphysiological fractionations in models representing healthy patients. Only validated and robust computational tools can provide useful insights for clinical Modeling Cardiac Ventricular Electrophysiology\". PLOS ONE, dispersion in cardiac EP modeling\".

MODELING VIRUS MATURATION AND ASSEMBLY - I have also applied my computational and modeling expertise to other biological systems and, in particular, to the study of viral capsids [4A-4D]. The computational framework and theoretical underpinnings are very closely related to my work in cardiac modeling. Biomechanical models of viral capsids provide unique explanations and predictions of the mechanisms underlying, for example, viral capsid assembly [4A, 4B] and shape changes [4C, 4D]. One of the major novelties in our work is the modeling of protein capsomers conformational pre-stretch or pre-shear [4B]. This mechanism is experimentally observed and, once accurately modeled, provides explanations on why it is used by a class of spherical viruses during maturation. Indeed, capsomer pre-stretch lowers the energy of capsid assembly, provides an organizational principle, and promotes self-correction of assembly errors [4A]. The combination of computational mechanics models and cryo-electron microscopy experimental data led to the discovery of these novel insights into the virus assembly pathway. The application of continuum mechanics theory and computational mechanics framework to largely different systems and scales is proof that these tools offer a versatile and quantitative approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying biological phenomena.

COMPUTATIONAL MODELING - During my PhD and postdoctoral research at Caltech, I have trained in developing new computational methods to solve complex problems and multi-physics applications. First, I have formulated and verified a new finite element model that avoided a common locking phenomenon in plate analysis [5A]. Locking is a vexing problem in computational mechanics since it leads to an overly stiff model response and very inaccurate numerical results. Secondly, I contributed to the development of new mesh-free methods [5B], which are an optimal tool for the analyses of bodies undergoing large deformations such as the heart. Lastly, I studied fluid structure interaction (FSI) in pipes and fiber-composite sandwich structures undergoing underwater shock loading [5C] and the effect of hypervelocity impacts on metal plates [5D]. These complex analyses involve the simultaneous solution of fluid and solid mechanics governing equations and require overcoming several challenges including: 1) communications between the fluid and the solid domains; and 2) adaptive domain refinement to follow and accurately model the propagation of shock waves. The proficiency in computational and continuum mechanics achieved during my studies and demonstrated in peer-reviewed publications in well-regarded journals will be instrumental to carrying out the specific aims of this proposal.

Contribution to Science 1. Electrocortical dynamics of locomotor tasks - Understanding brain dynamics during locomotion can help inform the design of rehabilitation robotic devices and potentially could be used to customize gait rehabilitation therapies for individual patients. I study electrocortical dynamics during locomotor tasks and am developing better methods and sensors for collecting EEG data during dynamic movements. I have found that adding arm effort during rhythmic stepping produced greater spectral fluctuations than legs only stepping. In another study, I found that recumbent stepping uses a different network of brain areas compared to walking and that spectral fluctuations during recumbent stepping and walking both occur at limb transitions, from flexion to extension and swing to stance, respectively. Because EEG signals are highly susceptible to motion artifacts, particularly during walking, that may obscure neural signals, I helped develop a novel method to isolate and measure the movement artifact recorded in the EEG electrodes. I found that isolated motion artifact data have some characteristics like actual EEG data measured from the scalp. Also, Independent Components Analysis (ICA) can separate out most of the artifact-based sources, but not all. This knowledge is critical for accounting for motion artifact in EEG data recorded during walking and has helped to improve the interpretation of EEG results during gait. This work has also led to the development of novel dual-layer electrodes that has been shown to be able to recover high fidelity simulated source signals. I served as the research scientist and helped conceive the experiments, collect and analyze the data, present the findings at conferences, and publish the results. a. Shirazi SY, Huang HJ.

Neuromuscular control of a locomotor task - Arm swing is a natural feature in human gait; however, gait rehabilitation robotic devices typically do not incorporate arm swing. I proposed that using the upper limbs during a locomotor task could improve lower limb neuromuscular recruitment and serve as a basis for selfassisted neurorehabilitation. In healthy individuals and individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury, I found that upper limb effort can enhance lower limb neuromuscular recruitment during a locomotor task, but the effects were limited. Other researchers have since published papers showing that including arm swing while using a robotic gait trainer can help recruit and shape lower limb muscle activation in clinical populations, further providing support for my findings. I served as the primary graduate student researcher and helped conceive the experiment, collect and analyze the data, present the findings at conferences, and publish the results. a.

Minimization of error and effort during motor adaptation of arm reaching tasks - A prevailing thought in motor control is that preferred movements minimize effort, but there were no studies that measured metabolic cost during arm reaching and over the course of motor adaptation. I demonstrated that expired gas analysis could be used to measure significant differences in metabolic cost in arm reaching and during motor adaptation. I found a reduction in metabolic cost when young and older adults adapted reaching movements to compensate for novel force perturbations and also, interestingly, for a visuomotor rotation, that does not involve any force perturbations. I also found that an intermediate arm reaching speed minimizes metabolic cost and that the preferred reaching speed tracks the metabolically optimal reaching speed across different reach distances. Overall, my findings suggest that minimization of effort and error may be general feature of motor adaptation and motor control. These findings have since been used to develop computational models of decision-making in movement and motor control, which have provided additional insight about motor control. I served as the research associate and helped conceive the experiment, collect and analyze the data, present the findings at conferences, and publish the results. a. Shadmehr R, Huang HJ, Ahmed AA.

Development and evaluation of sensors and methodologies for multimodal neuromechanics - To advance the ability to conduct multimodal human movement experiments, sensors are evolving to be thinner and for long-term use. I have shown that a thin dry epidermal electrode can be used to measure long-term EMG signals with high fidelity for limited dynamic lower limb movements but not for walking. I have also shown that thin tunable strain sensors can be used to measure joint movement. Analyzing muscle and brain activity using electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) often rely on signal processing methods, which may lead to divergent results. I found that regardless of the co-contraction index and EMG normalization method used, muscle co-contraction was not employed universally among individuals after stroke. I also found that more reliable methods for digitizing EEG electrode locations reduced the uncertainty of source estimation but less reliable digitization methods did not affect the accuracy of identifying Brodmann areas. I served as a collaborator and PI on these projects, helping to conceive the experiment, analyze and interpret the data, mentor mentees, provide resources, and disseminate findings at science conferences and in publications. a.

Personal Statement. My expertise is in the computational modeling of biomedical systems across dimensional scales, with successful leadership of several bio-systems modeling projects and grants. I am the director of the Biomedical Research and Modeling Laboratory at UCF. I will lead the numerical modelling of cellular mechanics component of the present project, relying on techniques already developed and successfully applied in my lab. I was a leading member of the team that developed PHOENICS, the first commercial multi-purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code in the world for simulation of a wide range of engineering and biomedical processes. I played a lead role in collaboration with the Harvard Medical School (Brigham and Women's Hospital) to pioneer the integration of Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging with CFD for flow profiling of human coronary disease on projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NIH, Johnson and Johnson, and Boston Scientific Company. The integrated system was successfully used by Astra Zeneca for assessment of the efficacy of new drugs for cardiovascular disease, and Boston Scientific for the design of drug-eluting stents. We have extended the biomechanical modeling technique to the respiratory system on a variety of pioneering projects. We pioneered integration of CFD with CT imaging for the first determination of the patient-specific elastic property of human lungs and the simulation of tumor motion in non-small-cell lung cancer. The research led to the invention of patient-specific deformable lung phantom for radiotherapy quality assurance. We have recently applied our approach to microstructural characterization of tissue engineering scaffolds and cellular behavior. The techniques and findings of these previous projects bear direct heritage to the present application. B.

Computational Fluid Dynamics My early research interest was in the development of novel unified numerical methods for simulation of a wide variety of practical problems. Traditionally, software codes based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) had been specialized, with different techniques and codes required for different applications. I was a pioneer member of the team that developed PHOENICS, the first commercial multi-purpose CFD code in the world. I published the first report describing the application of that code. My subsequent research then focused on the universality of the technique embodied in PHOENICS through adaptation and application to a wide variety of complex problems including turbulence phenomena, multiphase flows and materials processing. a.

Modeling of Blood flow in Coronary arteries Having fully established and validated universal application of CFD technique as described above, my research then focused on extending it biomedical systems which traditionally had not been widely simulated. Our primary initial focus was in utilizing CFD to understand the focal nature of athlescerosis. I started by modeling blood flow phenomena in generic coronary arteries, with emphasis on the effect of artery geometry and blood rheology on hemodynamic stress distribution. The success of this effort led to collaboration with Harvard Medical School (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston) on the simulation of blood interaction with optical fluid in laser angioplasty. We also extended the study to investigate light propagation in laser angioplasty. a.

PMID: 10745459 3. Flow Profiling of Coronary Disease The next phase of my research involved extension of our established CFD technique to real human artery. Specifically, in collaboration with researchers from Harvard Medical School (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) I integrated CFD with intravascular ultrasound imaging to reconstruct for the first time in the world, the 3D geometry of the human artery and simultaneously model blood flow in the artery. We thus developed the first in-vivo flow profiling of coronary artery disease in man, an approach that had never been undertaken. Our objective was to use the integrated technique to understand the genesis and progression of human coronary artery disease. We proceeded to use the method to assist in assessing drug efficacy (Astra Zenecca) and stent efficiency (Boston Scientific). We subsequenty extended the model to quantify for the first time, the relationship between the arterial structural dynamics and blood flow characteristics on incipient plaque rupture and the role they play in thrombus formation and myocardial infaction. Specifically, we established the first flow-structure intercation parameter that correlates with medical finding of potential vulnerable plaque to rupture. a.

Biomechanical Modeling of Lung Dynamics and Lung Cancer Targeted radiotherapy relies on accurate representation of breath-induced tumor motion. Our respiratory research has focused on techniques to quantify lung motion through integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and imaging techniques. The first step in the study is the processing of images (4D CT Scan dataset and MRI) in order to reconstruct the true three-dimensional lung geometry. In order to utlize the reconstructed geometry for CFD simulation, it is crucial to determine the biomechanical property (specifically, elasticity) of human lung which did not exist. Lung parenchyma is heterogeneous with non- linear elastic property. Thus we pioneered an inverse technique to integrate imaging with modeling to determine the exact spatial distribution of the elastic property of the lung with and without tumor. We then validated the approach by comparing breath-induced deformation predicted by the technique with values obtained at monitored landmarks by clinical experts. In an ongoing research we have started extending the validated approach to the upper airway to simulate the swallowing and coughing phenomena in patients with head and neck cancer. This ongoing research dovetails into the current proposal. a. Santhanam, A., Min, A., Y., Papp, N., Bhargava, A. Erhart, K.

Tissue and Cellular Mechanics integrating Imaging We have developed a method to integrate imaging with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for biomechanical modeling across dimensional scales ranging from tissues to organs. The algorithm couples CFD with image segmentation for microstructural characterization of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. The method enables control of the scaffold pore structure which largely determines the bone mechanical properties as well as cell growth, proliferation, mobility, and nutrient delivery to the cells. The modeling results which include distributions of pore size, pore elongation and pore orientation were successfully validated with the experimental data. On the macrolevel, our approach has also been used to successfully model upper airway functionality including the effect of cancer of the tongue base on swallow, and cough dysfunction in patients with neurological diseases. a.

Contributions to Science Early detection and identification of diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms is crucial for extending effective treat ment and cure of these diseases to patients. A significant portion of my research career has focused on the design and development of novel diagnostic biomedical devices as rapid screening tools for disease causing pathogens . 1. Biomedical sensors research - My doctoral research at Michigan State University involved design, development and implementation of novel magnetic polymer nanostructure based bio- sensing devices for rapid detection of pathogens. In this research, we demonstrated for the firs t time that magnetic nanoparticles could be embedded within conductive polymer matrices to generate a class of novel magnetic nanostructures with strong magnetic, electrical and electrochemical properties all of which could be exploited in diverse transduc tion modes in sensing platforms. We exploited these novel nanostructures for detection of Bacillus anthracis spores in a lateral flow device and demonstrated that the sensing platform could roughly detect a few hundred spores through electrical resistance changes across silver electrodes . We additionally exploited the electrochemical properties of these novel multi -functional nanostructures and further extended their applicability in the detection of genomic sequences. The electrochemical sensing device could detect a few nanograms of the Bacillus anthracis pag A gene sequence on activated carbon electrodes from the redox signals of the magnetic nanostructures in a 60 min detection time. The strong magnetic properties of these nanostructures were shown to be appropriate for magnetic pre -concentration of specific targets form complex matrices with a maximum capture rate of 97% for bacterial samples. Listed below are selected significant publications and patents resulting from this research. a. Pal, S., Setterington, E. B., Alocilja, E.

Setterington. 2. Biophotonics research - My post -doctoral research at the University of Rochester focused on design, development and implementation of engineered photonic band gap (PBG) devices as optical biosensing platforms for pathogen detection. Optical nanocavities created in PBG devices by breaking their spatial translational symmetry allow s strong trapping of electric field energy at the resonant mode frequency thus rendering these devices with very high sensitivity to environmental changes . In this research, we demonstrated for the first time, that by creating optical nanocavities adjacent to photonic crystal optical waveguides and by placing such cavity coupled waveguide structures in series, the PBG devices allowed multiplexing capability on a single sensor platform. The PBG devices were realized on silicon- on-insulator structures reactive -ion-etching ) and demonstrated excellent sensitivity to small proteins and model viral pathogens. The PBG sensor platforms could detect protein molecules in femtogram levels and a few human papilloma virus like particles from resonance red- shifts. Due to the large free spectral range of the nanocavity coupled PBG waveguide design (as compared to other resonator structures) , its ultra -small dimension and ultra- low sample volume requirement, the design was appropriate for high throughput applications since arrays of PBG structures could be conveniently fabricated on a single chip.

Bio-inspired systems and controls research - In this research at UCF, I have focused on eliciting the fundamental principles of motor control in aerial species such as bats and insects from flight biomechanics. Specifically, I have worked on the following aspects: identified strategies used by aerial species in accomplishing complex maneuvers such as negotiating tight turns during flight, prey pursuit and capture and more; analyzed the flight biomechanics of bats in prey capture using rigid body models; and correlated sensory mechanisms in the aerial species with flight performance. I have also collaborated with faculty at UCF in bio -inspired robotics research, where I have contributed in the dynamic analysis of circular shaped robots that mimic cellular loc omotion.

Personal Statement I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and my research is focused on wearable devices for motor training, rehabilitation and assistive applications. This includes wearable robots for enabling, assisting or augmenting human physical performance and wearable sensors for monitoring and assessing human biomechanical, physiological and psychological states. I have a broad background in mechatronics and robotics, particularly in the areas that involve interactions with a human user. As a member of Disability, Aging and Technology Cluster at UCF, my goal is to enhance utility, accessibility and intelligence of wearable assistive technologies through integration of research, education and outreach. To achieve this goal, I apply the principles of human biomechanics in sensing, actuation, and control of wearable devices. I then develop tools and techniques that well-incorporate those principles, eventually test and validate the approaches through human experiments. I also look to study human movement biomechanics (kinematics, kinetics, muscle activity) in various settings using wearable sensors, with the aim of developing models and metrics for i) assessment of and discrimination between different human behaviors and states in real-world environments, ii) patient monitoring, data mining and diagnosis/prognosis purposes, and iii) effective and adaptive assistive strategies leveraging new sensors, materials and control methods. A DARPA funded project (W911QX-12-C-0042; June 2012 - May 2015) to research load carriage assistive robot laid the groundwork for my research direction on wearables and assistive robots. I collaborated with doctors and clinicians to identify unmet needs in rehabilitation engineering and physical therapy, developed an NSF-funded research proposal (IIS-1527087, Sep 2015 - Aug 2019) to create a robotic device for spine deformity characterization and treatment, and interacted with minority and clinical populations on several human subject studies. During my three years at the Army Research Lab (Aberdeen, MD) as a National Academy of Science Research Associate, I've experienced many cutting-edge wearable technologies brought into the Army. As a result of these previous experiences, I have the expertise, leadership, training and motivation necessary to successfully carry out the proposed research project. B.

Contributions to Science Upper body wearable robots for load carriage application: My research on the design of wearable robots has been targeted for upper body augmentation and rehabilitation, and the incorporation of cable-driven systems and parallel mechanisms. Walking with a heavy load carried over the shoulders is a common daily task across many occupations (e.g., construction workers, soldiers, and firefighters). The heavy torso-borne load not only increases the metabolic cost of walking but also increases the risk of upper-body injuries. The main research question addressed in this work was: Is it possible to reduce the metabolic cost of load carriage by minimizing the dynamic loads exerted on the human body while distributing the load between trunk and hips to reduce the risk of back injuries? Answering this question led to the development of a novel torso exoskeleton, the Second Spine, which provides alternative load pathways to transfer the load from the shoulders to the hips, and the Motorized Second Spine, which compensates for the vertical excursions of a torso-borne load and the resulting dynamic forces exerted on the human body during human (bipedal) locomotion. These functions were then utilized in the Wearable upper-Body Suit (WEBS), the first prototype of a cable-driven powered torso exoskeleton for load carriage application. This device was evaluated on twelve healthy subjects, demonstrating a load distribution capability and an average of 8.6% of metabolic savings while walking with a 25% body-weight backpack. a. J.

Robotic spine exoskeleton for correction of spine deformity: Trunk support is needed for treatment and rehabilitation of people with various neuromuscular disorders, motor deficits, muscle weakness, or spinal diseases/injuries. Torso braces are widely used in practice for this purpose; however, they are mostly rigid, passive, and sensor-less which impose many practical and clinical limitations. We challenged the current practice by addressing this research question: How can we dynamically sense and modulate trunk support in different levels of the torso to improve clinical outcomes of bracing? This led to the development of a novel Robotic Spine Exoskeleton (RoSE), comprising of two Stewart platforms connected in series that allow for sensing and controlling the three-dimensional forces (or positions) applied to the human torso. The device was used to characterize, for the first time, the three-dimensional stiffness of the human torso which has implications on the clinical outcomes of bracing for spinal deformity treatment. a.

Methodologies for real-world human movement biomechanics assessment: Wearable sensors have paved a way to study human movement biomechanics in unconstrained environments, allowing researchers to collect real-world data in outdoor or residential areas. In my previous research, several types of wearable sensors were utilized - wearable motion capture sensors (e.g., inertial measurement units (IMU)), portable wireless surface electromyography (EMG), in-shoe pressure insoles, metabolic measurement mask, heart/breath rate monitor - to research physical activity, task performance and physiological state of Soldiers in the field. Data process and analysis techniques for human movement biomechanics data using wearable sensors, such as joint/segment kinematics, muscle activity, foot plantar pressure, metabolic cost, were developed and validated by gold-standard lab equipment. a.

Contribution to Science I. Characterization of learning and generalization of dexterous manipulation. This project focused on how dexterous manipulations are learned, stored, retrieved, and generalized to different task contexts. We found that once a manipulation task has been learned, changes at the \"effector level\" (i.e., hand orientation or grip type) could be compensated for, but changes occurring at the \"task level\" (i.e., object orientation) cause poor motor learning generalization. This was revealed by using objects that can afford different manipulative actions while providing visual geometric cues. We demonstrated that, while visuomotor transformations based on the object's visual geometric cues about the object's mass distribution were effective on the very first manipulation, subsequent learning of a different manipulation with the same object could interfere with the ability to use such visual cues again. This novel finding strongly suggested the existence of parallel sensorimotor processes underlying planning and learning of dexterous manipulation. Overall, these results have laid the foundation for using neuroimaging techniques to understand how the brain controls the hand to interact with objects and tools. a. Fu Q, Santello M (2012) Context-dependent learning interferes with visuomotor transformations for Gordon AM, Jesunathadas M, Santello M (2014) Learned manipulation at unconstrained contacts does not transfer across M (2015) Learning skilled manipulation: parallel processes underlie retention and interference.

This project examined the mechanisms underlying learning and control of object manipulation by quantifying how digit position and force are coordinated in response to trial-to-trial variability in digit placement. I designed physical grip devices and haptic simulation in virtual environment that allow subjects to choose digit positions while allowing the experimenter to concurrently measure digit forces in response to digit position modulation. Through the use of these unconstrained manipulation and torque production tasks, my work revealed, for the first time in the motor neuroscience literature, that the central nervous system (CNS) plans and controls local variables (i.e., digit forces and positions) in a coordinated fashion on every manipulation to consistently accomplish high-level task goals. These results were interpreted as a hierarchical control framework that is capable of decomposing task-level representations into motor commands to control individual end-effectors. These novel experimental protocols are now being incorporated with brain imaging and brain stimulation approaches to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying the novel framework. a.

I developed a kinematic tracking framework that could quantify the interaction between the human hand and the environment. This framework has been used to study how humans modulate reaching and grasping kinematics in response to object orientation uncertainty. It was found that subjects tended to maximize the chance of initial contact by adjusting the reach approaching angle. This finding has the potential to be used for controlling robotic hands in unstructured environments, because uncertainty caused by unstructured environments is a challenge to real-world robotic applications due to inaccuracy of sensing. I also developed a motion capture framework integrated in immersive virtual reality to evaluate compensatory movement in upper-limb prostheses users. a.

I designed and implemented a hybrid gain myoelectric controller for the SoftHand-Pro, a prosthetic hand built on the concept of mechanical synergies. This controller can switch control parameters based on grasping context detected through real-time estimation of grasp forces, which allows accurate control of grasping force to transport objects with different physical properties. Additionally, I developed contralateral haptic integration training to improve user's ability to transfer haptic information between native hand and close-loop prosthetic systems.

Personal Statement I am a medical robotics expert specialized in delivering engineering technologies to operating rooms. I have been leading many robotic intervention projects from proof-of-concept to human study as a multidisciplinary team leader as well as a hands-on engineer/scientist. My unique interdisciplinary knowledge and experience between engineering and medicine has been a key for solving many practical issues of medical interventions. I am a Tenure-Track Associate Professor in Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Director for Interventional Robotics Laboratory at the University of Central Florida (UCF). My interests focus on robotic interventions, telemedicine, biomedical devices, and soft robotic systems in healthcare and their clinical implementation. I have been developing and clinically implementing medical interventions at world-leading universities and research hospitals over 18 years. I developed my first surgical robot, a bone-mounted spine surgery robot at Imperial College London, UK (~2005). In 2006, I moved to Institute for Computer Assisted Orthopedic Surgery (ICAOS) at Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Pittsburgh to develop a bone-mount robot for minimally invasive knee surgery (1) (NIH R01AR052700). At Johns Hopkins University (2008~2010), I developed an MRI-compatible robotic intervention for targeted prostate intervention in collaboration with Brigham and Women's hospital (BWH) (NIH R01CA111288). I also worked on implementing another robotic prostate intervention in clinical trials at NIH Clinical Center and carried out an MRI artifact study (3) for MRI-guided intervention (R01EB002963). As I gained significant knowledge in MRI-guided interventions, I moved to National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT) at BWH, Harvard Medical School. At BWH (2010~2014), I continued to enhance MRI-guided interventions and developed a robotic needle guidance system for MRI-guided targeted prostate biopsy (3). The robotic intervention was utilized in 45 patient trials resulting in higher cancer detection rate than conventional procedures. The success led to productization of the robotic intervention (NIH R41CA192446). After being an Instructor in Radiology for 4 years, I moved back to an engineering school (Harvard School of Engineering and Science, 2014~2015) to expand my knowledge in soft robotics (4) before coming to UCF in 2015. Since, I continue advance MRI-guided interventions, revive earlier focus of orthopedic robots, explore tele-palpation, and innovate many other medical interventions in collaboration with local hospitals. 1.

Personal Statement My research and training experiences to date have primarily focused on utilizing engineering and biophysical principals to study mammalian cell behavior. To this end, I have developed novel technologies to mechanically stimulate mammalian cells by fluid shear stress and/or stretch. In addition, I also have experience characterizing the mechanical phenotype of cells in response to mechanical and biochemical sitmulation. I have analyzed their structural and morphological responses and developed computational models as well. I have also investigated the effects of cell-generated mechanical forces on cell behavior. Furthermore, my research involves investigating the phenomena of mechanical force-induced biochemical and genetic expression, termed mechanotransduction. Results derived from my works have implications into multiple health fields including cardiovascular disease, tissue engineering, and the neurosciences. My current research expertise has been interdisciplinary in nature as reflected in the mechanical engineering, cell biology, and biophysics papers and conferences I have been able to publish and present, respectively.

Probing the influence of gap junctions on endothelial biomechanics. - The ability to resolve cell-derived biomechanical tractions (cell-substrate forces) and cell-cell adhesion forces (cell-cell forces) has been around for quite some time. However, in regards to cell-cell adhesion forces, while tight junctions and adherens junctions were believed to be the primaryily responsible for cell-cell adhesion force generation work done by my lab demonstrated the role the gap junction Cx43 plays in endothelial biomechanics. Two publications have been yielded from this work thus far. S. Beverung, J. Wu, and R. Steward Jr., \" Lab-on-a-Chip for Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathology\", Micromachnies, 2020. Md.

Steward Jr., \" Probing Endothelial Cell Mechanics through Connexin 43 disruption\", Experimental Mechanics, 2018. 2. Intercellular forces guide endothelial cell reorientation - mammalian cells are well known to reorient under fluid flow, but the role of underlying cell-cell adhesion forces remained unclear. Using a novel method, monolayer stress microscopy I showed cell-cell adhesion forces to decrease under fluid flow and guide endothelial cell alignment. These findings are important as they link cell-cell adhesion forces to cell alignment, which has been shown to be atheroprotective. R. Steward, D. Tambe, C. C. Hardin, R. of Physiology-Cell Physiology, 2015, 308(8): C657-C664. 3. Developed dual force mechanical stimulation technique - Developed novel method to mechanically stimulate mammalian cells in vitro by fluid shear stress and stretch separately and simultaneously. Most studies in cell mechanics generally investigate one mode of mechanical stimulation. However, many mammalian cells, such as endothelial cells, for example experience multiple forces. Outcomes yielded from my work include a mathematical model explaining cellular reorientation in response to coupled modes of mechanical stimulation. R. Steward, C. Tan, C.M. Cheng, P. R.

LeDuc, Probing Cell Structure Responses Through a Shear and Stretching Mechanical Stimulation Technique Cell Biochem Biophys, 56(2-3):115-24, 2010. 4. Mechanotransduction through syndecan-4 - I was part of the group that proposed the transmembrane protein syndecen-4 to be a mechanosensitve protein. When dealing with transmembrane proteins most in the field look at integrins however syndecan-4 has been demonstrated to be present during many mechanics-related processes including cell migration. Therefore cells with and without syndecan-4 were stretched and cells without syndecan-4 were found to have perturbed responses to mechanical stimulation.

Structural reorganization of ECM under mechanical force - Many structural responses are looked at as a function of the cytoskeleton, but how the question of how the cell remodels its external environment under mechanical force remained unanswered. I showed the cell to 1) create a more fibrous extracellular matrix under both fluid flow and stretch and 2) localize ecm fibrils to the cell periphery when reorienting. R. Steward, C.M. Cheng, J. D.

Personal Statement I have a broad background in biomaterials and bioelectronics, with specific expertise in micro/nanofabrication of biomaterials and micro/nanoelectronics based on biomaterials. I developed a series of novel micro/nanofabrication techniques for flexible bioelectronics and drug delivery systems based on various biomaterials, including natural materials, biodegradable materials and synthetic biomaterials. The extracellular matric (ECM)-based neural interface I developed was featured in Microsystem and Nanoengineering. Moreover, I identified the key geometric and mechanical factors affecting the strains at the interfaces of implanted bioelectronics and surrounding tissues. In addition, I have extensive experience on biosensors based on functional materials and phage-based immunoassays on biosensors. My research on wireless phase-based biosensors was published in well-recognized journals on biosensors such as Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical, and Journal of The Electrochemical Society. Furthermore, I created and developed a pulse method for the determination of the resonance frequency of a biosensor made from magnetoelastic materials, which significantly increased sampling rate and signal to noise ratio for the resonant frequency measurement. This pulse detection method was published in Applied Physics Letters. The pulse detection method I developed along with my study of the phage-based immunoassay on the magnetoelastic biosensors enabled real-time detection of pathogens directly on food produce. 1. Y.

My research focuses on the development of methods for enabling biomimetic micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) to address the biological, chemical and mechanical properties of physiological interfaces. I developed a set of unique microfabrication techniques which enabled biomimetic microelectronics composed primarily of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. These techniques preserved fibrous structures of ECM proteins and resulted in remarkably improved biocompatibility compared with conventional devices made from synthetic materials. These techniques have been successfully used to make neural interface devices which exhibit same dimensions, comparable electrical functionalities, and superior biocompatibilities compared with current state-of-art devices made from synthetic materials. a.

My early publications addressed the fact that the pathogen detections are often time-consuming and labor intensive. I created and developed a pulse method for wireless interrogation with a micro-biosensor made from magnetoelastic materials. Compared with traditional interrogation method for large-scale (millimeter or centimeter scale) magnetoelastic biosensors, this pulse method not only significantly increased sampling rate and signal to noise ratio for the resonant frequency measurement, but also eliminated the use of bias magnetic field, resulting in a major reduction of system errors for frequency measurement of magnetoelastic biosensors. Furthermore, I developed a theoretical model which explained the effect of external magnetic field on the resonance of the magnetoelastic biosensors. In addition, I investigated phage-based immunoassays on magnetoelastic biosensors and identified the optimum sensor surface properties to obtain high binding efficiency and high detection sensitivity. The pulse detection method I developed along with my study of the magnetoelastic biosensor allowed real-time detection of pathogens directly on food produce. a. W. Shen, S. Li, M.-K. Park, Z.

Personal Statement I have a broad background in biomechanics, engineering, and physiology, with specific training and expertise in the study of human locomotion as well as prosthetic and orthotic devices. I completed my master's degree at Korea University, focusing on modeling transfemoral amputees with different surgical methods and evaluating the outcome of these surgeries. I then completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, where I focused on the effects of ankle foot orthosis stiffness on walking and musculotendon function for children with cerebral palsy and adults with stroke. Prior to joining the faculty at the University of Central Florida, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. There, I worked on finding optimal ankle power for power prosthesis which can minimize metabolic cost for individuals with transtibial amputation. My research interests have revolved around identifying the interplay between assistive devices and the human musculoskeletal system in order to develop optimal assistive devices. My research group's new research areas are: 1) the analyses of how different exoskeletal designs and controls impact the musculoskeletal systems of individuals with neurological impairments and amputation and 2) developing an energy efficient and real-time variable tunable exoskeletal device that can dynamically interact with the user to provide improvements to function and serve as a rehabilitation modality. Recently, we designed research modules which can change stiffness in an ankle foot orthosis and an ankle prosthesis. We will integrate nanomembrane sensors from Dr. Yeo and implement a machine learning algorithm from Dr. Lei to conduct an finite element analyses to find optimal dimension of the ankle foot orthosis and correlate with experimental data.

Contributions to Science 1. My early publications identified the characteristics of muscle from in-vivo muscle experiments in canine to improve Hill-type muscle model. These muscle characteristics were used in a musculoskeletal model to identify more accurate muscle function during dynamic tasks. As another application of musculoskeletal modeling, I also investigated which surgical methods for transfemoral amputees provide better joint kinetics and kinematics. These publications brought forward important evidence suggesting that surgical treatments which can preserve a larger residual muscle will provide better performance in joint kinetics and range of motion. I served as the primary investigator or co-investigator in all of these studies. 1. Hong, J.H. and Choi, H.

Understanding muscle characteristics and musculoskeletal modeling led me to investigate the effect of ankle foot orthosis on neurologically impaired individuals' musculoskeletal function during walking. I developed a method for fabricating adjustable stiffness ankle foot orthoses using 3D printing technology and methods for monitoring muscle and tendon length using ultrasound, musculoskeletal modeling, and a motion capture system. These studies have found that an appropriate ankle foot orthosis stiffness has the potential to improve pathologic walking and provide muscle stretching exercise on a step-by-step basis. I served as the primary investigator for a majority of these studies. 1. Choi, H., Bjornson, K., Fatone, S. and Steele K.M.

Adjusting active tuning parameters can be another solution for improving walking function for people with disabilities. Transtibial amputees spend greater energy compared with unimpaired individuals walking with passive ankle prostheses because they provide insufficient ankle power. Thus, I investigated to find an optimal power level of powered ankle prosthesis that can minimize metabolic cost. The key finding of this study is providing a greater ankle power than what occurs in an unimpaired individuals' biological ankle can reduce metabolic cost. Applying excessive ankle power led to recruitment of other compensatory musculature leading to increasing metabolic cost. However, the active prostheses are not widely used because they are expensive, bulky, and heavy. Thus, I am also developing bio-inspired, lightweight, and affordable passive prosthetic modules that enables to maximize energy efficiencies. I served as the primary investigator for all of these studies. 1. Ingraham, K.*, Choi, H.*, Gardinier, E., C.D.

This work guided efforts to perform controlled alteration of flow structures in the wakes, which in turn can alter forces the flow exerts on objects. In addition, evidence of creation of three dimensional coherent structures in two-dimensional flows was revealed using advanced flow diagnostics. 1. Williams DR, Mansy HA, and Fotouh A.

A new fluidic oscillator was invented and was capable of handling a wide range of flow rates that cover both the laminar and turbulent regimes. The device showed extended linear behavior while consuming a fraction of the energy needed by previous oscillators. Both experimental and numerical analysis of vortical structures and their instability were key in enhancing the performance of the device. 1. Williams DR, Meade K, Wilson N, and Mansy HA. Spirometer.
