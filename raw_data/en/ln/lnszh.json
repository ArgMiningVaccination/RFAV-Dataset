[Xander Cook](/teacher/xander-cook) Xander Cook Xander started his spiritual path at a very young age. At the young age of six he surrendered to the Language of Light, Speaking in the Tounges of The Divine. From an early age, he was drawn to Native American culture, and connected through ceremonies and immersing in nature and plant medicines. [Karen Rae Cook](/teacher/karen-rae-cook) About Me I grew up in the Midwest in a small farming community. With both sides of my family deeply connected to the land and animals, all things of nature came easy for me. I was sort of a tomboy, some of my best times were fishing, climbing and all types of outdoor activities with my brothers ( and sisters, six of us altogether).

Karen was such a kind and welcoming host and I felt right at home with her! She has a very special gift and her intuition, healing, and sacred spaces she created definitely helped shift some things for me internally. This retreat is perfect for anyone who really would like to dig deep spiritually and connect to themselves/the earth etc. However, Karen is also skilled in many things and was willing to be flexible depending on what we all were in the mood for. The food was healthy and delicious and it was well worth the money to be able to relax and enjoy a nice homemade meal. I will definitely be back! CatherinePosted a year ago on BookRetreatsTruly incredible experience! I chose this retreat because I felt drawn to the location. It wasn't too far in the US for me to travel. I like what the program offered and the tools we got to learn and take home with us. From this retreat, I found a new belief system. Personal transformation and a starting point to begin my healing journey and soul mission. I finally feel like I found my purpose in life and it feels great. It takes an open heart and mind, and someone ready for personal growth to embark on this experience. But one everyone should get the chance to experience. Debra LPosted 2 years ago on BookRetreats I am so glad I was invited to the Holistic Retreat it was an experience like no other. It helped me with issues I had been going through my whole life. Being able to find myself and understand my inner being is something no doctor could help me with. I was able to come home with a no outlook on life and how to cope with things I cannot control which provides healing within itself relief from the day-to-day stress that so many people can't find peace from. I look forward to attending the next Retreat. I am really thankful to the women who developed this wonderful experience to share with others the wonderful healing of a Holistic Retreat. JenniferPosted a year ago on BookRetreatsIt is 100% worth it. I needed healing/wellness focus. It was an opportunity for me to work on things This retreat was nearby, inexpensive, and offered a safe sanctuary for me to focus on spiritual growth and healing. This was a life changing experience for me. Karen was amazing in her ability to zero in on things that I had never told anyone about and offer up healing and safety. I was able to talk about things and felt a huge sense of relief. I felt so deeply connected with the other participants. Since going on the retreat I feel like the burden I've been carrying and working on for a long time was finally relieved from me. I continue to practice the things I learned from Karen every day Go into this with an open heart and mind and it'll be the best gift you can give yourself. It is 100% worth it. I have told friends and family about this experience and I'm making plans to go back soon. Best price guarantee.Hosts must offer the lowest price to be listed on our site.
