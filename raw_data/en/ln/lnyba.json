Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the centre line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360\u00b0. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g. a screw or a rack-and-pinion). 2. For the purposes of 2B, the number of axes which can be co-ordinated simultaneosly for contouring control is the number of axes which affect relative movement between any one workpiece and a tool, cutting head or grindingwheel which is cutting or removing material from the workpiece. This does not include any additional axes whichaffect other relative movement within the machine. Such axes include: a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines; b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces;c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends. 3.

Stated positioning accuracy levels derived from measurements made according to ISO 230/2 (1988) ( 1)o r national equivalents may be used for each machine tool model instead of individual machine tests. Statedpositioning accuracy means the accuracy value provided to the competent authorities of the Member State in which the exporter is established as representative of the accuracy of a machine model. Determination of Stated Valuesa. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated; b. Measure the linear axis accuracies according to ISO 230/2 (1988) ( 1); c. Determine the A-values for each axis of each machine. The method of calculating the A-value is described in the ISO standard; d. Determine the mean value of the A-value of each axis. This mean value \u00c2 becomes the stated value of each axis for the model (\u00c2x \u00c2y...); e. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many stated values as there are linear axes; f. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. or 2B201 has a stated accuracy \u00c2 of 6 microns for grinding machines and 8 microns for milling and turning machines or better, the manufacturershould be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months. 2B001 Machine tools and any combination thereof, for removing (or cutting) metals, ceramics or composites , which, according to the manufacturer 's technical specification, can be equipped with electronic devices for numerical control , and specially designed components as follows: N.B.: SEE ALSO 2B201.

Ceramic substrates, as used in this entry, does not include ceramic materials containing 5 % by weight, or greater, clay or cement content, either as separate constituents or in combination. Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows: a. Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, composite , dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compoundmaterial on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or laser irradiation. N.B. 1 CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes. N.B. 2 Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. N.B. 3 The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture. b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positionedsubstrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating; 2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;EN 31.8.2004 Official Journal of the European Union L 281/933.Laser Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave laser beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating; 4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcingerodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition. N.B. This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates. 5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate theextraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within theprocess chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process. c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of: 1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); 2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and 3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1 030 K (757 \u00b0C) and 1 375 K (1,102 \u00b0C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating. d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasmaspraying. N.B. 1 Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure. N.B. 2 High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 \u00b0C) at 0,1 MPa. e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate. N.B. 1 The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials. N.B. 2 Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition. g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapour deposition or sputter deposition.EN L 281/94 Official Journal of the European Union 31.8.2004CATEGORY 3 ELECTRONICSEN 31.8.2004 Official Journal of the European Union L 281/953A Systems, Equipment and Components Note 1: The control status of equipment and components described in 3A001 or 3A002, other than those described in 3A001.a.3. to 3A001.a.10. or 3A001.a.12., which are specially designed for or whichhave the same functional characteristics as other equipment is determined by the control status of theother equipment.

Outline of CTPcalculation method CTPis a measure of computational performance given in Mtops. In calculating the CTPof an aggregation of CEs the following three steps are required: 1. Calculate the effective calculating rate R for each CE; 2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP) for each CE; 3. If there is more than one CE, combine the TPs, resulting in a CTPfor the aggregation. Details for these steps are given in the following sections. Note 1: For aggregations of multiple CEswhich have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, the calculation of CTP is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of CEssharing memory; second, calculate the CTP of the groups using the calculation method for multiple CEsnot sharing memory. Note 2: CEsthat are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into the CTPcalculation.EN L 281/126 Official Journal of the European Union 31.8.2004TECHNICAL NOTE ON CTP The following table shows the method of calculating the Effective Calculating Rate R for each CE: Step 1: The effective calculating rate R ForCEsImplementing: Note: Every CEmust be evaluated independently.Effective calculating Rate, R XP only \u00f0Rxp\u00de\u00bc1 3/C2/C0 txp no add is implemented use: \u00f0Rxp\u00de\u00bc1/C0 txp mult/C1 If neither add nor multiply is implemented use the fastest available arithmetic operation as follows: \u00f0Rxp\u00de\u00bc1 3/C2/C0 txp/C1 \u00f0tfp add\u00de,1 \u00f0tfp mult\u00de See Notes X & Y Both FP and XP (R) Calculate both Rxp,Rfp For simple logic processors not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations.R\u00bc1 3/C2tlog Where tlogis the execute time of the XOR, or for logic hardware not implementing the XOR, the fastest simplelogic operation. See Notes X & Z For special logic processors not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations.R = R' \u00d7 WL/64 Where R' is the number of results per second, WL is the number of bits upon which the logic operation occurs,and 64 is a factor to normalize to a 64 bit operation.EN 31.8.2004 Official Journal of the European Union L 281/127Note W: For a pipelined CEcapable of executing up to one arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline is full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective calculating rate (R) for such a CEis the faster of the pipelined rate or non-pipelined execution rate. Note X: For a CEwhich performs multiple operations of a specific type in a single cycle (e.g., two additions per cycle or two identical logic operations per cycle), the execution time t is given by: t=cycle time the number of identical operations per machine cycle CEswhich perform different types of arithmetic or logic operations in a single machine cycle are to be treated as multiple separate CEsperforming simultaneously (e.g., a CEperforming an addition and a multiplication in one cycle is to be treated as two CEs, the first performing an addition in one cycle and the second performing a multiplication in one cycle). If a single CEhas both scalar function and vector function, use the shorter execution time value. Note Y: For the CEthat does not implement FP add or FP multiply, but that performs FP divide: Rfp\u00bcl tfp divide the CEimplements add, FP multiply or FP divide, then Rfp\u00bcl tfp reciprocal If none of the specified instructions is implemented, the effective FP rate is 0. Note Z: In simple logic operations, a single instruction performs a single logic manipulation of no more than two operands of given lengths. In complex logic operations, a single instruction performs multiple logic manipulations to produce one or more results from two or more operands. Rates should be calculated for all supported operand lengths considering both pipelined operations (if supported), and non- pipelined operations using the fastest executing instruction for each operand length based on: 1. Pipelined or register-to-register operations. Exclude extraordinarily short execution times generated for operations on a predetermined operand or operands (for example, multiplication by 0 or 1). If no register-to-register operations areimplemented, continue with (2). 2. The faster of register-to-memory or memory-to-register operations; if these also do not exist, then continue with (3). 3. Memory-to-memory.In each case above, use the shortest execution time certified by the manufacturer.EN L 281/128 Official Journal of the European Union 31.8.2004Step 2: TP for each supported operand length WL Adjust the effective rate R (or R') by the word length adjustment L as follows: T P=R\u00d7L , where L = (1/3 + WL/96) Note: The word length WL used in these calculations is the operand length in bits. (If an operation uses operands of different lengths, select the largest word length.) The combination of a mantissa ALU and an exponent ALU of a floating point processor or unit is considered to be oneCEwith a Word Length (WL) equal to the number of bits in the data representation (typically 32 or 64) for purposes of the CTPcalculation. This adjustment is not applied to specialized logic processors which do not use XOR instructions. In this case TP = R. Select the maximum resulting value of TP for: Each XP-only CE(Rxp); Each FP-only CE(Rfp); Each combined FP and XP CE(R); Each simple logic processor not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations; and Each special logic processor not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations. Step 3: CTPfor aggregations of CEs, including CPUs For a CPU with a single CE, CTP=T P (for CEsperforming both fixed and floating point operations TP = max (TPfp,T Pxp) CTPfor aggregations of multiple CEsoperating simultaneously is calculated as follows: Note 1: For aggregations that do not allow all of the CEsto run simultaneously, the possible combination of CEs that provides the largest CTPshould be used. The TP of each contributing CEis to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the CTPof the combination is derived. N.B. To determine the possible combinations of simultaneously operating CEs, generate an instruction sequence that initiates operations in multiple CEs, beginning with the slowest CE(the one needing the largest number of cycles to complete its operation) and ending with the fastest CE. At each cycle of the sequence, the combination of CEsthat are in operation during that cycle is a possible combination. The instruction sequence must take into account all hardware and/or architectural constraints on overlapping operations. Note 2: A single integrated circuit chip or board assembly may contain multiple CEs. Note 3: Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer. Note 4: CTPvalues are not to be aggregated for CEcombinations (inter) connected by Local Area Networks , Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by software .EN 31.8.2004 Official Journal of the European Union L 281/129Note 5: CTPvalues must be aggregated for multiple CEsspecially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory \u2014or multiple memory/ CE\u2014combinations operating simulta- neously utilising specially designed hardware. This aggregation does not apply to electronic assemblies described by 4A003.c. CTP=T P1+C2\u00d7T P2+...+Cn\u00d7T Pn, where the TPs are ordered by value, with TP1being the highest, TP2being the second highest, ..., and TPnbeing the lowest. Ciis a coefficient determined by the strength of the interconnection between CEs, as follows: For multiple CEsoperating simultaneously and sharing memory: C2=C3=C4=...=Cn= 0,75 Note 1: When the CTPcalculated by the above method does not exceed 194 Mtops, the following formula may be used to calculate Ci: Ci\u00bc0;75mp (i = 2,...,n) where m = the number of CEsor groups of CEssharing access. provided: 1. The TPiof each CEor group of CEsdoes not exceed 30 Mtops; 2. The CEsor groups of CEsshare access to main memory (excluding cache memory) over a single channel; and 3. Only one CEor group of CEscan have use of the channel at any given time. N.B. This does not apply to items controlled under Category 3. Note 2: CEsshare memory if they access a common segment of solid state memory. This memory may include cache memory, main memory or other internal memory. Peripheral memory devices such as disk drives, tape drives orRAM disks are not included. For Multiple CEsor groups of CEsnot sharing memory, interconnected by one or more data channels: C i= 0,75 \u00d7 ki(i = ki(i = ..., 64) ..., 256) 0,30 \u00d7 ki(i > 256) The value of Ciis based on the number of CEs, not the number of nodes. where ki= min (Si/Kr, 1), and Kr= normalising factor of 20 MByte/s. Si= sum of the maximum data rates (in units of MByte/s) for all data channels connected to the ithCEor group of CEssharing memory. When calculating a Cifor a group of CEs, the number of the first CEin a group determines the proper limit for Ci. For example, in an aggregation of groups consisting of 3 CEseach, the 22nd group will contain CE64,CE65and CE66. The proper limit for Cifor this group is 0,60. Aggregation (of CEsor groups of CEs) should be from the fastest-to-slowest; i.e.: TP1TP2...TPn, and in the case of largest to smallest; i.e.: CiCi+1 Note: The kifactor is not to be applied to CEs2 to 12 if the TPiof the CEor group of CEsis more than 50 Mtops; i.e., CiforCEs2 to 12 is 0,75.EN L 281/130 Official Journal of the European Union 31.8.2004CATEGORY 5 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SECURITY EN 31.8.2004 Official Journal of the European Union L 281/131PART 1 TELECOMMUNICATIONS Note 1: The control status of components, lasers , test and production equipment and software therefor which are specially designed for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.
