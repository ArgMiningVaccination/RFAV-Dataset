In response to large-scale changes occurring in recent decades in the size and nature offinancial derivative markets, theSystem of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA)and the BPM 5 presented new standards for the treatment of such derivatives. After the 1993 SNA and the BPM 5 were published, markets for financial derivatives evolved to an even greaterextent, and national statisticians requestedclarification and amplification of the publishedstandards. These inquiries led to the creation of the Informal Group on the Measurement ofFinancial Derivatives. This informal group, theIMF Committee on Balance of PaymentsStatistics (the Committee), and the group ofexperts working on the draft of the IMFManual on Monetary and Financial Statisticsproduced discussion papers that were widelydistributed and commented upon in theinternational statistical community. The process of discussion and commentary confirmed the view that financial derivativesshould be treated as financial assets. Trans-actions in financial derivatives, in general,should be reported as separate transactionsrather than as integral parts of the values ofunderlying transactions or as integral parts ofthe values of financial assets to whichderivatives may be linked as hedges. Theprocess also led to two significant changes inprevious statistical standards. One was thechange to a less restrictive view towards theclassification of financial derivatives within the SNA asset boundary. This change permittedthe inclusion of more over-the-counter(or non-exchange-traded) instruments. Asecond, related change was the recognitionof interest rate swaps and forward rate agree-ments as financial assets and the recordingof net cash settlement payments resultingfrom these contracts as financial transactionsrather than investment income flows. Inaddition, it was agreed that a new functionalcategory, financial derivatives, would becreated for the balance of payments and anew instrument, financial derivatives,for the national accounts. These changeswere adopted by the Committee and theInter-Secretariat Working Group on NationalAccounts (ISWGNA) at their October 1997meetings. In November 1997, the IMF StatisticsDepartment released The Statistical Treatment of Financial Derivatives . The ISWGNA and the Committee then asked that the IMF Statistics Department useThe Statistical Treatment of FinancialDerivatives as a base to prepare\u2014for inclusion in the 1993 SNA and the BPM5 \u2014text containing a definitive description of financial derivativesand recommended treatments for them. Aversion suitable for each publication wasprepared, but the wording of the two versions isidentical in many instances. The BPM 5 version, although subject to further review regarding theclassification of financial derivatives as direct investment and reserve assets, was considered and adopted at the October 1998 meeting of theCommittee. At its October 1999 meeting, the Committee made a provisional decision to include financialderivatives in both of these functional categories4and to record such derivatives as separate items. This treatment is consistent with thatdescribed, in the October 1999 release of theprovisional IMF Operational Guidelines on the Data Template for International Reservesand Foreign Currency Liquidity, for financial derivatives classified as reserve assets. This guideline will be reviewed in late 2000 or early2001. The continued classification of financialderivatives within direct investment and reserve assets depends on the results of the review and on country experience in implementing therecommendations with regard to derivativesclassified in direct investment. The text that follows comprises two parts: a new, additional chapter for the BPM 5 and an amendment to material in the existing BPM 5.The new chapter presents information on the functional category of financial derivatives. The underlying features of financial derivativesand treatments appropriate for specificderivatives are described. The amendment tothe BPM 5 shows, by means of shading and strikeout, clarifications and changes to thepublished manual. Only modified paragraphsand tables are shown\u2014in the same order aschapters and paragraphs are shown in the 1993text. The release of this addendum andamendment to the BPM 5 was coordinated with finalization of the parallel revision to the 1993 SNA. (The process of dissemination and adoption for the latter revision was morelengthy.) The revised 1993 SNA was adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission inFebruary 2000. Carol S.

Financial Derivatives Concept and Coverage FD 1. A financial derivative contrac t is a financial instrument that is linked to anotherspecific financial instrument or indicator orcommodity and through which specificfinancial risks (such as interest rate risk,foreign exchange risk, equity and commodityprice risks, credit risk, etc.) can, in theirown right, be traded in financial markets.Transactions in financial derivatives aretreated as separate transactions rather than asintegral parts of the values of the underlyingtransactions to which they are linked. Thevalue of a financial derivative derives fromthe price of an underlying item such as anasset or index. No principal amount thatmust be repaid is advanced, and no invest-ment income accrues. Financial derivativesare used for a number of purposes\u2014riskmanagement, hedging, arbitrage betweenmarkets, and speculation, for example. FD 2. Financial derivatives enable parties to trade specific financial risks to otherentities that are more willing, or bettersuited, to take or manage these risks and thattypically, but not always, do so withouttrading in primary assets or commodities.The risk embodied in a derivative contractcan be traded either by trading the contractitself, as with options, or by creating a newcontract embodying risk characteristics thatmatch, in a countervailing manner, those ofthe existing contract. The latter practice,which is termed offsetability 1, occurs in 1Offsetability should not be confused with an offset, which is the legal right of a debtor to net its claims against the same counterparty. It is recommendedthat positions be recorded on a gross basis whenever possible .forward markets. Offsetability means that it is often possible to eliminate the risk associ-ated with a derivative by creating a new but\"reverse\" contract having characteristics thatcountervail the risk of the first derivative.Buying the new derivative is the functionalequivalent of selling the first derivativebecause the result is the elimination of risk.The ability to countervail the risk in themarket is therefore considered the equi-valent of tradability in demonstrating value. The outlay that would be required to replacethe existing derivative contract represents itsvalue; actual offsetting is not required todemonstrate value. FD 3. There are two broad types of financial derivatives. In a forward contrac t, which is unconditional , two counterparties agree to exchange a specified quantity of anunderlying item (real or financial) at anagreed-upon price (the strike price) on aspecified date . In an option contract , the purchaser acquires from the seller a right tobuy or sell, (depending on whether theoption is a call or a put) a specifiedunderlying item at a strike price on orbefore a specified date. Unlike debt instruments, financial derivatives do notaccrue investment income; nor are principalamounts advanced that must be repaid. FD 4 .The value of a financial derivative derives from the price of the underlying item (the reference price ). Because a future refer- ence price is not known beforehand, thevalue of a financial derivative at maturitycan only be anticipated or estimated. Areference price may be related to acommodity, a financial instrument, aninterest rate, an exchange rate, another10derivative, a spread between two prices, or an index or basket of prices. An observablereference price for the underlying item isessential for calculating the value of anyfinancial derivative. If there is no observableprevailing market price for the underlyingitem, it cannot be regarded as a financialasset. Transactions in financial derivativesare treated as separate transactions ratherthan as integral parts of the values of theunderlying transactions to which they arelinked. Embedded derivatives, however, arenot identified and valued separately fromprimary instruments. (See paragraph FD 6.) FD 5. Financial derivative contracts are usually settled by net payments of cash.Exchange-traded contracts, such as commodityfutures, are often settled before maturity. Cashsettlement is a logical consequence of the use offinancial derivatives to trade risks independ-ently of the ownership of underlying items.However, some financial derivative contracts,particularly those involving foreign currency,are settled by deliveries of the underlying items. FD 6 . For balance of payments purposes, the following types of financial instrumentsare NOT FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES . A FIXED PRICE CONTRACT FOR GOODS AND SERVICES is not a financial derivative unless the contract is standardized so thatthe market risk therein can be traded infinancial markets in its own right. INSURANCE is not a financial derivative. Insurance contracts provide individualinstitutional units with financial protectionagainst the consequences of the occurrenceof specified events. (In many instances, thevalue of this financial protection cannot beexpressed in terms of market prices.) Insurance is a form of financial inter- mediation through which funds are collectedfrom policyholders and invested in financialor other assets. These assets are held astechnical reserves to meet future claimsarising from the occurrence of events specified in insurance policies . That is, insurance is used to manage event riskprimarily by the pooling, not the trading,of risk. CONTINGENCIES , such as guarantees and letters of credit, are not financial derivatives.The principal characteristic of a contingencyis that one or more conditions must befulfilled before a financial transaction takesplace. Contingencies are typically notinstruments that facilitate the trading ofspecific financial risks. An EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE (a derivative feature that is inserted in a standard financialinstrument and is inseparable from theinstrument ) is not considered a financial derivative for balance of payments purposes.If a primary instrument such as a security orloan contains an embedded derivative, theinstrument is valued and classified accordingto its primary characteristics\u2014even thoughthe value of that security or loan may welldiffer from the values of comparablesecurities and loans because of the embeddedderivative. Examples are bonds that areconvertible into shares and securities withoptions for repayment of principal incurrencies that differ from those in which thesecurities were issued. FD 7. In addition, TIMING DELAYS that arise in the normal course of business and may entailexposure to price movements do not, for balanceof payments purposes, give rise to transactionsand positions in financial derivatives. Timingdelays include normal settlement periods forspot transactions in financial markets. FD 8. Financial derivatives that can be valued separately from the underlying items to whichthey are linked are included\u2014whether or not they are traded on an exchange\u2014in the financial account of the balance of payments and in the international investment position.11Forwards FD 9. In a forward contrac t, the counter- parties agree to exchange, on a specified date, aspecified quantity of an underlying item (real orfinancial) at an agreed-upon contract price (thestrike price). This class of financial derivatives includes futures and swaps. Futures are forward contracts traded on organized exchanges . Futures and other forward contracts aretypically, but not always, settled by payments ofcash or provision of other financial instrumentsrather than by actual deliveries of underlyingitems. Futures are valued and traded separatelyfrom underlying items. If a forward contract is a swap contrac t, the counterparties exchange, in accordance with pre-arranged terms, cash flowsbased on the reference prices of the underlyingitems. Forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts are common types offorward contracts. Interest-rate and crosscurrency interest-rate swaps are common typesof swap contracts. (See paragraphs FD 27 andFD 28 for further discussion.) FD 10. At the inception of a forward contract, risk exposures of equal market value areexchanged. Both parties are potential debtors,but a debtor/creditor relationship can beestablished only after the contract goes intoeffect. Thus, at inception, a contract normallyhas zero value. However, as the price of theunderlying item changes during the life of theforward contract, the market value of eachparty's risk exposure will differ from the marketvalue of zero at the inception of the contract.When a change in the price of the underlyingitem occurs, an asset (creditor) position iscreated for one party, and a liability(debtor)position is created for the other. Thedebtor/creditor relationship may change, in bothmagnitude and direction, during the life of aforward contract. Options FD 11. The purchaser of an option contrac t pays a premium to the writer of the option. Inreturn, the buyer acquires the right but not the obligation to buy (call option) or sell (putoption) a specified underlying item (real orfinancial) at an agreed-upon contract price (thestrike price) on or before a specified date. A major difference between forward and optioncontracts is that either party to a forwardcontract is a potential debtor, whereas the buyerof an option acquires an asset, and the optionwriter incurs a liability. However, an optionmay expire without worth; it is exercised only ifsettling the contract is advantageous to thebuyer. The option buyer may make gains ofunlimited size, and the option writer mayexperience losses of unlimited size. FD 12 . Options are written on a wide variety of underlying items\u2014such as equities,commodities, currencies, and interest rates(including caps, collars, and floors). 2 Options are also written on futures, swaps (known asswaptions ), caps (known as captions ), and other instruments. FD 13. In organized markets, option contracts are usually settled in cash, but some types ofoption contracts are normally settled bypurchases of underlying assets. For instance, a warrant is a financial contract that gives the holder the right to buy, under specified terms, acertain number or amount of the underlyingasset (such as equity shares) . If a warrant is exercised, the underlying asset is usually deliv-ered. Warrants can be traded separately from theunderlying assets to which they are linked. Recording of Financial Derivative Transactions and Positions FD 14. The statistical treatment of financial derivatives for the balance of payments and theinternational investment position requirescompilers and statisticians to 2A cap imposes an upper limit; a floor sets a lower limit; and a collar maintains upper and lower bounds on floating-rate interest payments or receipts.12recognize the exchange of claims and obligations at the inception of a derivativecontract as a true financial transaction creatingasset and liability positions that normallyhave, at inception, zero value if the instrument is a forward and value equal to the premium ifthe instrument is an option treat any changes in the values of derivatives as holding gains or losses record secondary market transactions in marketable derivatives, such as options, asfinancial transactions record any payments made at settlements as transactions in financial derivative assets orliabilities (That is, no income arises fromsettlements of financial derivatives.) 3 record, in the international investmentposition, outstanding values of financialderivatives at market prices. Valuation of positions FD 15. A key characteristic of most derivative contracts is that the counterparties makecommitments to transact, in the future and atagreed-upon prices, in underlying items. Thepresent value (or market price) of a financialderivative is derived from the differencebetween the agreed-upon contract price of anunderlying item and the prevailing market price(or the market price expected to prevail),appropriately discounted, of that item. Foroptions, whether they are traded on an exchangeor not, the prices are directly observable becauseoption purchasers acquire assets (the rights tobuy or sell specified underlying items) and the 3 Financial derivative transactions may take place directly between two parties or through intermediaries. In the latter case, there may be implicit or explicit servicecharges. Distinguishing an implicit service change is not usually possible. Therefore, it is recommended that net settlement payments for derivative contracts be recordedas financial transactions. When possible, service chargesshould be recorded separately.prices of those assets must be established. The price of an option depends on the potential pricevolatility of the underlying instrument, the timeto maturity, interest rates, and the differencebetween the strike price and the market price ofthe underlying item. The value of a swapcontract based on a notional principal amount isderived from the difference, appropriatelydiscounted, between expected gross receipts andgross payments. FD 16. Financial derivatives are valued at market prices prevailing on balance sheetrecording dates. Price changes occurringbetween recording dates are classified asrevaluation gains or losses. If market price dataare unavailable, other fair value methods (suchas option models or discounted present values)may be used to value derivatives. Payments at inception FD 17. The purchaser of an option pays a premium to the seller. The full price of thepremium is recorded, by the buyer, as theacquisition of a financial asset and, by the seller,as the incurrence of a liability. Sometimes apremium is paid after the inception of aderivative contract. Then the value of thepremium payment is recorded by the optionpurchaser as an asset that was financed by aloan from the option writer at the time thederivative was purchased. FD 18. The creation of a forward contract does not normally require the recording of atransaction in a financial derivative because riskexposures of equal value are usually beingexchanged. That is, there is zero exposure andzero value for both sides. FD 19. Commissions and fees paid\u2014at incep- tion or during the lives of derivatives\u2014to banks,brokers, and dealers are classified as payments for services . These payments are rendered for services provided within current periods and areindependent of asset and liability relationshipscreated by the derivatives.13Sales of derivatives in secondary markets FD 20. Sales of derivatives in secondary markets\u2014whether the markets are exchanges orover-the-counter\u2014are valued at market pricesand recorded in the financial account as transactions in financial derivatives. Settlement payments FD 21. Net settlement payments are financial transactions that are similar to transactions atthe maturities of other financial instruments. At settlement, either a cash payment is made, or anunderlying item is delivered. When a financial derivative is settled in cash, a transaction equal to the cash value ofthe settlement is recorded for the derivative.No transaction in the underlying item isrecorded. In most instances, when a cashsettlement payment is received, a reductionin a financial derivative asset (a credit) isrecorded. When a cash settlement paymentis made, a reduction of a financial derivativeliability (a debit) is recorded. However, insome circumstances, this practice does nothold. When a contract (such as an interestrate swap) calls for ongoing settlement anda cash settlement is received, there is anincrease in a financial derivative liability (a credit) if, at the time of the settlement pay-ment, the contract is in a liability position.The reverse also applies; that is, when acontract calls for ongoing settlement, a cashpayment is recorded as an increase in anasset (a debit) if, at the time of the settle-ment, the contract is in an asset position. Ifcompilers are unable to implement thisapproach because of market practice, it isrecommended that all cash settlementreceipts be recorded as reductions infinancial assets and all cash settlement pay-ments be recorded as decreases in liabilities. When an underlying instrument is delivered, two transactions occur and bothare recorded. The transaction in theunderlying item is recorded at the market price prevailing on the day of thetransaction. The transaction in the derivativeis recorded as the difference, multiplied bythe quantity, between the prevailing marketprice for the underlying item and the strikeprice specified in the derivative contract. When more than one contract is settled\u2014in cash, at the same time, and with the samecounterparty\u2014some of the contracts beingsettled are in asset positions and some are inliability positions. In this situation, it isrecommended that the transactions berecorded on a gross basis ; that is, the trans- actions in assets are recorded separatelyfrom those in liabilities and are therebyrecorded as separate credit and debit flows.Recording the transactions on a gross basisis preferred to recording them on a net basis ; that is, after the sum of the liability flows issubtracted from the sum of the asset flows,the resulting debit or credit is recorded as asingle amount. 4 However, for practical reasons, there may be no alternative to netrecording. Margins FD 22. Margins are payments of cash or deposits of collateral that cover actual orpotential obligations incurred through financialderivatives\u2014especially futures or exchange-traded options. The required provision of margin reflects market concern over counter-party risk and is standard in financial derivativemarkets FD 23. Repayable margin consists of cash or other collateral deposited to protect a counter-party against default risk . Ownership of the margin remains with the unit that deposited it.Although its use may be restricted, a margin isclassified as repayable if the depositor retains 4 However, the net basis is recommended for transactions in financial derivatives classified as reserve assets .14the risks and rewards of ownership\u2014such as the receipt of income or exposure to holdinggains and losses. At settlement, a repayablemargin (or the amount of repayable margin inexcess of any liability owed on the derivative)is returned to the depositor. In organizedmarkets, repayable margin is sometimes knownas initial margin . FD 24. Repayable margin payments of cash are transactions in deposits , not transactions in financial derivatives. A depositor has a claim onan exchange, brokerage, or other institutionholding the deposit. Some countries may preferto classify repayable margin deposits withinother accounts receivable/payable in order to reserve the term deposits for monetary aggre- gates. When a repayable margin deposit is madein a non-cash asset (such as securities), notransaction is recorded because no change inownership has occurred. The entity (the issuerof the security) on which the depositor has aclaim is unchanged. FD 25. The payment of nonrepayable margin is a transaction in a derivative; the payment is made to reduce a financial liability createdthrough a derivative. In organized exchanges,nonrepayable margin (sometimes known as variation margin ) is paid daily to meet liabilities recorded as a consequence of the daily markingof derivatives to market value. The entity thatpays nonrepayable margin no longer retainsownership of the margin or has the right to therisks and rewards of ownership. A payment ofnonrepayable margin is recorded as a reductionin financial derivative liability (a debit); thecontra-entry is a reduction (probably in currency and deposits ) in a financial asset (a credit). The receipt of nonrepayable margin is recorded as areduction in a financial derivative asset (acredit); the contra-entry is an increase (probablyin currency and deposits ) in a financial asset (a debit). FD 26. Arrangements for margining can be complex, and procedures differ amongcountries. In some countries, repayable andnonrepayable margins are recorded in a single account, and it may be difficult to distinguishbetween the two types. The actual institutionalarrangements (such as the identities of unitsmaking payments and types of instrument used)must be reviewed. The key test is whether themargin is repayable or whether payment of themargin represents an effective transfer ofownership between counterparties to thefinancial derivative contract. Treatment of Selected Financial Derivatives Specific interest-rate contracts FD 27. An interest-rate swap contract consists of a contract to exchange, in one currency and during a specified period of time, cash flowsrelated to interest payments or receipts on anotional amount of principal that is neverexchanged . Such swaps are often settled through net cash payments from one of the counter-parties to another. A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a contract in which the counterparties agree on an interest rate to be paid, at aspecified settlement date, on a notional amountof principal that is never exchanged. FRAs are settled by net cash payments; that is, thedifference between the rate agreed upon and theprevailing market rate at the time of settlementis recorded as a transaction in the balance ofpayments. The buyer of an FRA receivespayment from the seller if the prevailing rateexceeds the rate agreed upon. The sellerreceives payment from the buyer if the prevail-ing rate is lower than the rate agreed upon. Theexistence of active financial markets in thesecontracts results in holding gains and losses.The creation of interest rate swaps and FRAcontracts normally requires no entries in the financial account because there are no exchanges of value at the inception of thesecontracts. Net cash settlement payments forinterest-rate swaps and FRAs are classified inthe financial account as transactions in financial derivatives. Interest-rate swaps usually15involve ongoing settlements during the lives of the contracts; FRAs are usually settled atcontract maturity. Specific foreign currency contracts FD 28. A foreign exchange swap contract consists of a spot sale/purchase of currencies and a simultaneous commitment to a forwardpurchase/sale of the same currencies . A forward foreign exchang e contract consists of a commitment to transact, at a designated futuredate and agreed-upon exchange rate , in a specified amount of specified foreign currencies.A cross currency interest-rate swap contract (also known as a currency swap ) consists of an exchange of cash flows related to interestpayments and, at the end of the contract, anexchange of principal amounts in specifiedcurrencies at a specified exchange rate. There may also be an exchange of principal at thebeginning of the contract. In that case,subsequent repayments that comprise bothinterest and amortization of principal may bemade over time and according to pre-arrangedterms. Streams of interest payments resultingfrom swap arrangements are recorded in the financial accoun t as transactions in financial derivatives, and repayments of principal arerecorded in relation to relevant instruments. FD 29. For foreign currency financial derivative contracts, it is necessary todistinguish between a transaction in a derivativecontract and the requirement to deliver andreceive underlying principal associated with thecontract. In contrast to the creation of other forward contracts, the creation of a foreign currencyfinancial derivative contract does notnormally lead to the recording, in the financial account , of a transaction in financial derivatives. Any initial sale orpurchase of currency is a transaction that isrecorded, at the exchange rate agreed uponby the counterparties, in the other investment category of the financial account .The exchange rate for the forward sale or purchase of currencies through a foreigncurrency derivative contract is agreed uponby the counterparties when the terms of thecontract are established. The derivativecontract acquires value as the prevailingmarket exchange rate differs from theexchange rate agreed upon in the contract. At the time of settlement, the difference between the values (which are measured inthe unit of account and at the prevailingexchange rate) of the currencies exchangedare allocated to a transaction in a financialderivative. In other words, if the value of thecurrency received exceeds that of thecurrency paid, a reduction in a financialderivative asset (a credit) is recorded. Thecontra-debit entry is an increase in anotherasset (probably other investment\u2014assets, currency and deposits ) classified in the financial account. When the value of the currency received is less than that of thecurrency paid, the opposite applies. Thatis, a reduction in a financial derivativeliability (a debit) is recorded. The contra-credit entry is a reduction in another item(probably other investment\u2014assets, currency and deposits ) classified in the financial account . Credit Derivatives FD 30. The financial derivatives described in previous sections are related to market risk , which pertains to changes in the market prices of securities and commodities and to changes ininterest and exchange rates . Other types of financial derivatives are used primarily to tradecredit risk . These credit derivatives , which are designed for trading in loan and security defaultrisk, can be either forward or option contracts . Like other financial derivatives, creditderivative contracts are frequently drawn upaccording to standard legal agreements thatspecify procedures for the provision of margin,which serves as a basis for market valuation.16FD 31. There are a number of common types of credit derivatives. A total return swap consists of swapping of cash flows and capital gains and losses related to the liability of alower-rated creditor for cash flows related to aguaranteed interest rate, such as an interbankrate, plus a margin . A spread option is a contract with value derived from an interest ratespread between higher quality credit and lowerquality credit . For example, if the spread narrows sufficiently, the option holder benefitsfrom exercising the option. A credit default swap consists of swapping, usually on an ongoing basis, the risk premium inherent in aninterest rate on a bond or a loan in return for a cash payment that is made in the event ofdefault by the debtor. Some credit default swap contracts require that one party make only asingle payment to the other in order to be financially protected against the risk of acatastrophe befalling the creditor. Referenceprices for these single-premium contracts, whichare more properly classified as forms ofinsurance rather than financial derivatives, maynot be readily available. Selected Supplementary Information FD 32. Because financial derivatives are risk-transferring instruments, there may beinterest\u2014from analytical and policymakingpoints of view\u2014in presenting transactions andpositions in financial derivatives by type(option and forward) and by category of risk(foreign exchange, interest-rate, and other).PART II OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES AMENDMENTS TO THE FIFTH EDITION (1993) OF THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS MANUAL19Classification and Standard Components VIII. of the Balance of Payments [. . .] Capital and Financial Account [. . .] Financial account (2.B) 176. The classification of standard compon- ents in the financial account is based on these criteria: All components are classified according to type of investment or by functionalsubdivision ( direct investment, portfolio investment, financial derivatives, other investment, reserve assets ). For the category of direct investment , there are directional distinctions (abroad or in thereporting economy) and \u2014for the equity capital, and other capital, and financial derivative components within thiscategory \u2014asset or liability distinctions. For the categories of portfolio investment, financial derivatives, and other investment, there are the customary asset/liabilitydistinctions. Particularly significant for portfolio investment and other investment is the distinction by type of instrument (equity ordebt securities, trade credits, loans, currencyand deposits, other assets or liabilities). Inthis Manual , traditional and new money market and other financial instruments and derivatives are included in portfolio investment .For portfolio investment, financial derivatives , and other investment, there are distinctions by sector of the domesticcreditor for assets and by sector of thedomestic debtor for liabilities. Thesedistinctions serve to facilitate links withthe income accounts, the internationalinvestment position, the SNA, and otherstatistical systems. The traditional distinction, which is based on original contractual maturity of morethan one year or one year or less, betweenlong- and short-term assets and liabilitiesapplies only to other investment . In recent years, the significance of this distinction hasclearly diminished for many domestic andinternational transactions. Consequently, thelong- and short-term distinction is accordedless importance in the 1993 SNA and in the fifth edition of the Manual than previously. However, because the maturity factorremains important for specificpurposes\u2014analysis of external debt, forexample\u2014it is retained, in the fifth editionof the Manual , for other investment . 177. Direct investment \u2014reflecting the lasting interest of a resident entity in one economy(direct investor) in an entity resident in anothereconomy (direct investment enterprise)\u2014coversall transactions between direct investors anddirect investment enterprises. That is, direct investment covers the initial transaction between the two and all subsequent transactions betweenthem and among affiliated enterprises, bothincorporated and unincorporated. Directinvestment transactions occurring abroad and inthe reporting economy are subclassified intoequity capital, reinvested earnings, and other20capital (intercompany transactions), and financial derivatives. For equity capital, and other capital, and financial derivatives, claims on and liabilities to affiliated enterprises and todirect investors are distinguished. Transactionsbetween affiliated banks and between otheraffiliated financial intermediaries are limited toequity and permanent debt capital. (Seeparagraph 372.) 178. Portfolio investment covers transactions in equity securities and debt securities; the latterare subsectored subclassified into bonds and notes and money market instruments. and financial derivatives (such as options) when the derivatives generate financial claims and liabilities . Various new financial instruments, other than financial derivatives, are coveredunder appropriate instrument classifications. Transactions covered under direct investment and reserve assets are excluded. New paragraph 178a. The financial derivative category covers financial instruments that are linked to other specific financial instruments, indicators, or commodities and through which specific financial risks (such as interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, equity and commodity price risks, credit risk, etc.) can, in their own right, be traded in financial markets. Transactions in financial derivatives should be treated as separate transactions rather than as integral parts of the values of the underlying transactions to which they are linked.21Standard Components of the Balance of Payments Credit Debit 1.

Other Services [. . .] Definitions [. . .] 258. Financial services cover financial intermediary and auxiliary services (exceptthose of insurance enterprises and pensionfunds) conducted between residents andnonresidents. Included are intermediary servicefees, such as those associated with letters ofcredit, bankers' acceptances, lines of credit,financial leasing, and foreign exchangetransactions. (For the latter, the spread betweenthe midpoint rate and the buying/selling rate isthe service charge.) Also included arecommissions and other fees related totransactions in securities\u2014brokerage,placements of issues, underwritings, and redemptions; and arrangements of swaps, options, and other hedging instruments;commissions and fees paid for the arrangement of financial derivative contracts; commissions of commodity futures traders; and services related to asset management services, financial market operational and regulatory services, securitycustody services, etc. 6b Service charges on purchases of International Monetary Fundresources are included among an economy'sfinancial service payments, as are charges(similar to commitment fees) associated withundrawn balances under stand-by or extendedarrangements with the IMF. 6bFinancial derivative transactions may take place directly between two parties or through intermediaries. In the latter case, there may be implicit or explicit service charges. It is not usually possible to distinguish implicit service charges. Therefore, it is recommended that net settlement payments of derivative contracts be recorded as financial transactions. However, when possible, service charge components should be recorded separately.28XIV. Income [. . .] Definition and Classification [. . .] 274. Investment income (property income in the SNA) covers income derived from a resident entity's ownership of foreign financial assets earned on the provision of nonproduced capital. Such provision is usually evidenced by the ownership of foreign financial assets. Financial derivative assets do not represent the provision of finance capital; their value derives from changes in the prices of factors used to construct derivative contracts. Therefore, no investment income is earned on financial derivatives. Themost common types of investment income are income on equity (dividends) and income ondebt (interest). Dividends, including stockdividends, are the distributed earnings allocatedto shares and other forms of participation in theequity of incorporated private enterprises,cooperatives, and public corporations.Dividends represent income that is payablewithout a binding agreement between the creditor and the debtor. Among other types of income on equity are (i) earnings of branchesand other unincorporated direct investmententerprises and (ii) direct investors' shares ofearnings of incorporated direct investmententerprises. (The latter type of earnings, whichare not formally distributed, are earnings otherthan dividends.) Shares of reinvested earningsattributed to direct investors are proportionate tothe participation of the direct investors in theequity of the enterprise. Also, in principle,income is imputed to households from net equity in life insurance reserves and pensionfunds and included indistinguishably under within other investment . Interest, including discounts in lieu of interest, comprises incomeon loans and debt securities (i.e., bank deposits,bills, bonds, notes, and trade advances). Net interest flows arising from interest rate swaps also are included (See paragraph 406) . Interest is payable in accordance with a bindingagreement between the creditor and the debtor. [. . . ] Portfolio investment income 280. Portfolio investment income comprises income transactions between residents andnonresidents and is derived from holdings ofshares, bonds, notes, and money marketinstruments and associated with financial derivatives . This category is subdivided into income on equity (dividends) and income ondebt (interest). See Chapter 19 for details onnew financial instruments and treatment of financial derivatives, such as option s. included in portfolio investment. The financial instrument classification scheme for portfolio investmentincome is consistent with that in the financial account and with that in the international investment position. Subsectoring into domesticinstitutional sectors (monetary authorities,general government, banks, and other) is shownunder Selected Supplementary Information. (See the table at the end of Chapter 8.) A varietyof other supplementary disaggregations byforeign sector, etc. may be desirable for specificanalytical purposes.29Structure and Characteristics XVI. of the Capital and Financial Account Coverage [. . .] 308. The standard components of both the current account and the capital and financial account are discussed in Chapter 8. Coverage of the capital and financial account is described in paragraphs 172 through 181, and theclassification of components appears at the endof the chapter. Capital and financial accounttransactions presented in this Manual are the same as those reflected in the capital and financial accounts of the SNA externalaccumulation accounts. However, in the balanceof payments, the primary basis for classificationof the financial account is functional category (i.e., direct investment , portfolio investment , financial derivatives , other investment , and reserve assets ) while the SNA classification is primarily by type of instrument: monetary gold,currency and deposits, loans, etc. (See Chapter 3for details of the relationship between the twosets of accounts.) The structure of the capital and financial account also is generally compatible with other statistical systems of theIMF and is consistent with the classification ofrelated income components of the current account and with the international investment position. [. . .] Financial Account Coverage [. . .]315. However, options and other Financial derivatives are included among financial items; in accordance with the treatment of these items in the SNA. These instruments this treatment is consistent with the SNA treatment of financial derivatives. There are active financial markets in these instruments, and they can be valued byreference to the market prices of the derivativesthemselves or to the market prices of thecommitments real or financial items underlying the derivatives. Thus, Both parties to a derivative contract recognize a financialinstrument asset; one party recognizes a liability and the other recognizes a claim. Alternatively,this value could be viewed as the amount oneparty must pay to the other party in order toextinguish the contract. As a result, derivativessatisfy the definition (see paragraph 314) offoreign financial assets and liabilities. A fulldiscussion of financial derivatives instruments appears in Chapter 19 the chapter devoted to that subject. [. . .] Transactions in assets[. . .] 318. To establish whether a transaction involving a foreign asset is a transactionbetween a resident and a nonresident, thecompiler must know the identities of bothparties. The information available ontransferable claims constituting foreign assets30may not, however, permit identification of the two parties to the transaction. That is, acompiler may not be able to ascertain whether aresident, who acquired or relinquished atransferable claim on a nonresident, conductedthe transaction with another resident or with anonresident, or whether a nonresident dealt withanother nonresident or with a resident. Thus, arecommendation that the balance of paymentsbe confined solely to asset transactions betweenresidents and nonresidents would be difficult orimpossible to implement. Also, the introduction,in the Manual , of a domestic sectoral break- down for the portfolio investment, financial derivative, and other investment components of the financial account makes it necessary to record certain transactions between residentsectors within the economy\u2014although suchtransactions cancel each other for the totaleconomy. As a result, recorded transactions mayinclude not only those that involve assets andliabilities and take place between residents andnonresidents but also those that involvetransferable assets of economies and take placebetween two residents and, to a lesser extent,transactions that take place betweennonresidents. (See paragraph 334.) [. . .] Net recording 324. Two or more changes in a specific asset, or changes in two or more different assets classified in the same standard component, are consolidated in a single entry. This entry reflects the net effect of all the increases and decreases that occur during the recording period in holdings of that type of asset. For example, purchases (by nonresidents) of securities issued by resident enterprises of an economy are consolidated with sales (by nonresidents) of such securities, and the net change is recorded for that item. Net decreases in claims or other assets and net increases in liabilities are recorded as credits; net increases in assets and net decreases in liabilities are recorded as debits.There is one exception: it is recommended that transactions in financial derivatives classified as reserve assets be recorded only as a single amount; that is, after the change in liabilities is deducted from the change in assets. It is recog- nized that, in practice, this approach may be the only means by which transactions in financial derivatives classified in other categories ( direct investment and financial derivatives ) can be recorded. [. . .] Functional types of investment 330. Four Five broad categories of investment, each of which is dealt with in a subsequent chapter, are distinguished. Direct investment The direct investor seeks a significant voice in the management of an enterprise operatingoutside his or her resident economy. To achievethis position, the investor must almostinvariably provide a certain, often substantial,amount of the equity capital of the enterprise.The direct investor may also decide to supplyother capital to further enterprise operations.Because of the direct investor's special relation-ship to the enterprise, his motives in supplyingcapital will be somewhat different from those ofother investors. Thus, the capital supplied by adirect investor will probably exhibit charac-teristic behavior. Direct investment is classified primarily on a directional basis\u2014resident directinvestment abroad and nonresident investmentin the reporting economy\u2014and is subdividedinto equity capital, reinvested earnings, and other capital and financial derivatives. Equity capital and other capital, in turn, are subdividedinto asset and liability transactions. (Relatedincome, however, is shown on a net basis in the current account .)31Portfolio investment Cross-border investment in equity and debt securities (other than direct investment ) is both quantitatively and analytically significant.Such cross-border investment thereforewarrants separate recording and coverage,particularly in view of the trend towards freeinternational movement of capital and thegrowth of new financial instruments and newmarket participants. Coverage of this categoryis expanded to reflect these developments andto include money market debt instruments and financial derivatives, as well as longer-term debt and equity securities. Financial Derivatives The number and the importance of transactions (particularly those taking place outside organized markets) in options and forwards (including swaps) have increased in recent years. The treatment of financial derivatives as a separate functional category reflects their increased importance, as well as the differences between financial derivatives and other types of financial instruments. With financial derivatives, no capital is advanced or repaid; nor is any interest accrued. In the first and second printings of the BPM 5, data on financial derivatives were formerly classified within a subcategory of portfolio investment. Compilers may continue with this approach if activity in financial derivatives is too limited to justify presenting data on these instruments in a separate functional category, but compilers should separately classify data if activity in financial derivatives is significant. Other investment This residual group comprises many different kinds of investments. In practice, it is notfeasible to draw any further functionaldistinctions among the various types becausethe reasons underlying the flows are too numerous and varied. Other breakdowns aretherefore used to distinguish behavioraldifferences among components of this category(i.e., trade credits, loans, currency and deposits,use of Fund credit, loans from the Fund, etc.). Reserve assets These are foreign financial assets available to, and controlled by, the monetary authorities forfinancing or regulating payments imbalances orfor other purposes. Reserve assets consist of monetary gold, SDRs, reserve position in theFund, foreign exchange, and other claims.Changes in the holdings of reserves may reflectpayments imbalances or responses to them,official exchange market intervention toinfluence the exchange rate, and/or other actionsor influences. [. . .] Type of instrument 332. For portfolio investment , the type of instrument is the primary classification (i.e.,equity and debt securities). Debt securities aresubdivided into bonds and notes and money market instruments. and financial derivatives . Although the sectoral subdivision for portfolio investment is secondary, there is no implication that, in certain instances, it may not be of equalinterest to the compiling economy. The sameholds true for financial derivatives and other investment . Domestic sector 333. For assets, the institutional sector of the domestic (resident) creditor and, for liabilities,that of the domestic debtor often are factors thatinfluence transactions in financial items. Thesectoring also improves links with the IMF and32other statistical systems, including the SNA. This Manual distinguishes four sectors\u2014 monetary authorities, general government,banks, and other sectors\u2014for both portfolio investment, financial derivatives, and other investment .8 [. . .] Long- and short-term investment [. . .] 8 See Appendix 2.339. In the categories of direct investment , portfolio investment , financial derivatives, and reserve assets , long- and short-term investments are not formally distinguished.For direct investment , such a distinction is not made because it is essentially determined byarbitrary enterprise decisions and because of thefact that there is no meaningful analyticdistinction between the two maturities forintercompany flows. For portfolio investment, financial derivatives, and reserve assets , formal maturity is not likely to be a significant factoraffecting the behavior of components in thesecategories.33XVIII. Direct Investment [. . .] Direct Investment Capital [. . .] 369. The components of direct investment capital transactions, which\u2014as noted inparagraph 330\u2014are recorded on a directionalbasis (i.e., resident direct investment abroad andnonresident direct investment in the recordingeconomy), are equity capital, reinvestedearnings, and other capital associated with various intercompany debt transactions, and financial derivatives. Equity capital comprisesequity in branches, all shares in subsidiaries andassociates (except nonparticipating, preferredshares that are treated as debt securities andincluded under direct investment -other capital\u2014see paragraph 370), and other capitalcontributions. Reinvested earnings consist of thedirect investor's share (in proportion to directequity participation) of earnings not distributedas dividends by subsidiaries or associates andearnings of branches not remitted to the directinvestor. If such earnings are not identified, allbranch earnings are considered, by convention,to be distributed. Because undistributed(reinvested) earnings result in additions todirect investors' equity in subsidiaries andbranches, these earnings are included as directinvestment capital transactions in amounts equalto (and with opposite sign) the correspondingentries recorded under direct investmentincome. (See paragraphs 278, 288, and 321.) [. . .]New paragraph 370a. The subcategory of direct investment - financial derivatives covers financial derivative transactions between directors and direct investment enterprises unless the transactions are part of the usual banking transactions described in paragraph 372. [. . .] 372. The recording of intercompany transactions that (1) take place between affiliated banks (depository institutions) andaffiliated financial intermediaries (e.g., securitydealers) or SPEs serving solely as financial intermediaries and (2) are recorded as directinvestment capital transactions is limited to those transactions associated with permanentdebt (loan capital representing a permanentinterest) and equity (share capital) investmentor, in the case of branches, to transactions associated with fixed assets. Deposits and otherclaims and liabilities (including financial derivatives) related to the usual banking transactions of depository institutions andclaims and liabilities of other financialintermediaries are classified, as appropriate,within the categories of portfolio investment , financial derivatives, or other investmen t. The stock of foreign assets and liabilities of banksand other financial intermediaries (internationalinvestment position) should be treated in aparallel manner. [. . .]34Extent of Net Recording 375. Direct investment is often referred to as an asset for the economy of the direct investor and as a liability for the economy in which the direct investment enterprise operates. Actually, investor and enterprise have claims on, or liabilities to, each other\u2014although the investor could be expected to have net foreign claims and the enterprise to have net foreign liabilities. It is recommended in the Manual that direct investment transactions in equity capital, and other capital (intercompany debt), and financial derivatives be recorded for assets (claims) and liabilities. Thus, in addition to a netinvestment transaction for each of these components, separate entries are made for the change in claims of direct investors on, and the change in liabilities to affiliated enterprises. These entries are made under direct investment- abroad and vice versa for direct investment- in reporting economy. For recording direct investment in the international investment position, the same entries are made. See the table presenting the standard components of the international investment position at the end of Chapter 23. However, as noted in Chapter 23, the related direct invest- ment income on equity and debt is shown on a net basis for each direction.35XIX. Portfolio Investment Coverage 385. Portfolio investment includes in addition to equity securities and debt securities in the form of bonds and notes and money market instruments. and financial derivatives such as options. Excluded are any of the aforementioned instruments included in the categories of direct investment and reserve assets . The expanded coverage in transactions reflects changes in international financial markets in recent years and includes the introduction of many new financial instruments within the framework of continuous innovation. [. . .] Classification and Definitions 387. The categories of financial instruments classified and defined in the Manual are generally consistent with those in the SNA. The major components of portfolio investment , which are classified under assets and liabilities, are equity securities and debt securities. Both are usually traded (or tradable) in organized and other financial markets. Debt securities are subdivided into bonds and notes and money market instruments. and financial derivatives, including varieties of new financial instruments . [. . .] 389. Debt securities cover (i) bonds, debentures, notes, etc. and (ii) money market or negotiable debt instruments. and (iii) financial derivatives or secondary instruments, such as options, that usually do not extend to actual delivery and are utilized for hedging of risks, investment, and trading purposes . 390. Bonds, debentures, notes, etc. usually give the holder the unconditional right to a fixed money income or contractually determinedvariable money income. (Payment of interest is not dependent upon the earnings of the debtor.) With the exception of perpetual bonds, bonds and debentures also provide the holder with the unconditional right to a fixed sum as a repayment of principal on a specified date or dates. Included are nonparticipating preferred stocks or shares; convertible bonds; and bonds with optional maturity dates\u2014the latest of which is more than one year after issue. 9 This category also includes negotiable certificates of deposit with maturities of more than one year; dual currency bonds; zero coupon and other deep discounted bonds; floating rate bonds; indexed bonds; and asset-backed securities, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and participation certificates. (Mortgages are not classified as bonds but are included under loans.) [. . .] 392. Certain financial instruments give the holder the qualified right to receive an economic benefit in the form of cash, a primary financial instrument, etc. at some future date. These instruments are referred to as derivatives or secondary instruments in that they are linked to either specific financial instruments or indicators (foreign currencies, government bonds, share price indices, interest rates, etc.) or to particular commodities (gold, sugar, coffee, etc.) that may be purchased or sold at a future date. Derivatives also may be linked to a future 9 The conversion (into equities) option may be considered a tradable derivative (i.e., an asset separate from the underlying security). See paragraph 392. Separation of the value of a transaction into the value of the bond and the value of the option may be effected by reference to transactions in similar bonds traded without options.36exchange, according to a contractual arrangement, of one asset for another. The instrument, which is a contract, may be tradable and have a market value. When that is the case, the characteristics of the instrument as a contingent asset or liability (not to be recorded in the balance of payments or in SNA sectoral balance sheets) change and give rise to treatment of the instrument as an actual financial asset or liability in the financial account . Among derivative instruments are options (on currencies, interest rates, commodities, indices, etc.), traded financial futures, warrants, and arrangements such as currency and interest rate swaps. 393. Transactions in derivatives are treated as separate (mainly financial) transactions rather than being included as integral parts of underlying transactions to which they may be linked as hedges. There are several reasons for this treatment, which is consistent with that in the SNA. The counter party to a derivative transaction will be a different transactor than the transactor for the underlying transaction being hedged. Also, the two parties to the derivative transaction may have different motives\u2014 hedging, dealing in the instrument involved, or acquiring the derivative as an investment. Even if both parties are hedging, the hedging may be associated with different financial or other assets. If derivative transactions were included as integral parts of underlying transactions, such treatment would lead to asymmetries of measurement in the balance of payments accounts. For example, the counter party to a derivative contract that hedges an underlying position with a resident may also be a resident. In such an instance, the inclusion of the derivative as part of the underlying transaction would result in the incorrect inclusion of transactions in the balance of payments. Selected Recording Issues 395. The expanded coverage, which includes traditional and new money market and derivative instruments and innovative long-termsecurities, of portfolio investment raises issues concerning the recording of balance ofpayments entries associated with theseinstruments. Such issues are discussed, forselected instruments, in subsequent paragraphs. [. . .] 398. Among money market and derivative instruments and arrangements, the treatments of short-term notes issued under NIFs, options, warrants, swaps, traded financial futures, and forward rate agreements are noted subsequently. [. . .]401. Opt ions are contracts that give the purchaser of the option the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call option) or to sell (a put option) a particular financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specific time span or on a specified date. Some leading types of options are those on foreign currencies, interest rates, equities, commodities, specified indexes, etc. The buyer of the option pays a premium (the option price) to the seller (writer or issuer) for the latter's commitment to sell or purchase the specified amount of the underlying instrument or commodity or to provide, on demand of the buyer, appropriate remuneration. By convention, in this Manual and in the SNA, that commitment is treated as a liability of the seller and represents the current cost to the seller of buying out his contingent liability. 402. Conceptually, the payment of the premium referred to previously includes two elements: the purchase price of a financial asset and a service charge. In practice, it often is not possible to identify the service element separately. If the latter can be distinguished, it should be entered under financial services. If not, it is recommended that the full premium be recorded in the balance of payments as the acquisition of a financial asset by the buyer and as an incurrence of a liability by the seller. Subsequent trading (sales) of options is37recorded in the financial account , as is the exercise or purchase/sale of the underlying financial instrument. If an option actually proceeds to delivery, which is not the usual case, the acquisition or sale of the underlying asset (real or financial) is recorded at the prevailing market price in the appropriate balance of payments component. Offsetting that entry is the actual amount payable or receivable; the difference between that amount and the prevailing market price is reflected in an entry that extinguishes the option contract. If an option contract is closed out prior to delivery, the actual amount payable or receivable is offset by the entry extinguishing the option contract. When initial margin payments and subsequent increases or decreases are payable by the parties to options, the payments should be recorded as both assets and liabilities in the financial account under other investment, currency and deposits in the financial account . Payments into, and withdrawals from, these accounts sometimes may be reflected in transactions in the traded options to which the accounts relate and, if so, are recorded under option transactions in the financial account . 403. Warrants (a particular form of option) are tradable instruments giving the holder the right to buy from the issuer of the warrant (usually a corporation) a certain number of shares or bonds under specified conditions for a designated period of time. Warrants can be traded apart from the underlying securities to which the warrants are linked and thus have a market value. The treatment of warrants is the same as that for other options, and the issuer of the warrant is considered, by convention, to have incurred a liability, which is the counterpart of the asset held by the buyer and reflects the current cost of buying out the issuer's contingent liability. 404. Another variety of tradable warrant (usually issued by investment intermediaries) is a currency warrant, the value of which is based on the amount of one currency required to purchase another currency at or before the expiration date of the warrant. Currency warrants and cross-currency warrants with payments denominated in third currencies should be treated in a similar manner to other warrants. 405. A swap is a contractual arrangement involving two parties who agree to exchange, over time and according to predetermined rules, streams of payment on the same amount of indebtedness. The two most prevalent varieties of swaps are interest rate swaps and currency swaps. An interest rate swap involves an exchange of interest payments of different character (e.g., fixed rate and floating rate, two different floating rates, fixed rate in one currency and floating rate in another, etc.). A currency swap involves an exchange of specified amounts denominated in two different currencies and subsequent repayments reflecting principal and/or interest. (Central bank currency swap arrangements usually undertaken for exchange rate policy purposes and involving the temporary exchange of deposits as of a particular date and the reversal of the transaction at a future date are referred to in paragraph 434.) 406. Balance of payments entries for streams of interest payments associated with swap transactions are recorded, on a net basis, in the current account , and streams of principal repayments are recorded in the financial account . Although neither party to a swap arrangement is considered to be the provider of a service to the other, any payment to a third party involved in arranging the swap is recorded under financial services. 407. A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange a real asset for a financial asset, or to exchange, on a specified date at a predetermined rate, two financial assets. Traded financial futures, including those for interest rates, currencies, commodities, equities, or other indices, are recorded in the financial account in a manner similar to the recording of options. Transactions associated38with nontraded financial futures are likely to occur infrequently and are recorded under the other assets or other liabilities components of other investment . 408. A forward rate agreement (FRA ) is an arrangement according to which two parties agree on an interest rate to be paid, on a specified settlement date, on a notional amount of principal that is never exchanged. At that time, the settlement payment (i.e., the difference between the rate agreed upon and the prevailing market rate at the time of settlement) is recorded as a transaction in the balance of payments. The buyer of the FRA receives payment from the seller if the prevailing rate exceeds the rate agreed upon; the seller receives payment from the buyer if the prevailing rate is lower than the rate agreed upon. These payments are recorded as interest income in the current account of the balance payments. Because there is only a notional (not an actual) underlying asset, there are no entries in the financial account .39XX. Other Investment Coverage 411. Other investment is a residual category that includes all financial transactions notcovered in direct investment, portfolio investment , financial derivatives , or reserve assets (discussed in Chapter 21). Classification 412. As is the case with portfolio investment , assets and liabilities for other investment are classified primarily on an instrument basis. Thesectors of domestic creditor or debtor\u2014thesecondary basis for the classification\u2014aremonetary authorities, general government,banks, and other sectors. (For the definitions ofsectors, see Appendix 2.) In contrast to those for direct investment , and portfolio investment , and financial derivatives, the maturity distinction (long- or short-term) for other investment is a third-level basis of classification. 413. The instrument subclassification for other investment (as is that for portfolio investment ) is closely linked to the SNA categories forfinancial assets. (See Chapter 3.) While therelative importance of types of investmentdiffers considerably among economies, thetypes reflect most of the financial instrumentsand channels utilized for the acquisition ofassets and incurrence of liabilities\u2014other thanfor direct investment, portfolio investment, financial derivatives , and reserve assets . The instrument classification comprises tradecredits, loans (including the use of Fund creditand loans from the Fund), currency and deposits(both transferable and other), and other assetsand liabilities (for example, miscellaneousaccounts receivable and payable).Definitions and Recording [. . .] 421. Deposits comprise both transferable and other deposits. Transferable deposits consist ofdeposits that are exchangeable on demand at parwithout restriction or penalty, freely transferableby check or giro order, and otherwise commonlyused to make payments. Deposits may bedenominated in domestic or foreign currencies. With the exclusion of transferable deposits, other deposits include comprise all claims, including repayable margins for financial derivatives, that reflect evidence of deposit.Typical examples are non-transferable savingsdeposits, time deposits; and shares (evidence ofdeposit),which are legally or practically redeem-able on demand or on short notice, in savingsand loan associations, credit unions, buildingsocieties, etc. 422. Other assets and liabilities cover any items other than loans and currency and deposits. For example, capital subscriptions to international nonmonetary organizations are classified under this category within this subcomponent , as are miscellaneous accounts receivable and payable. In countries where repayable margins for financial derivatives are not classified as deposits, the repayable margins should be recorded as other assets and liabilities. 423. As noted in paragraph 372, transactions (other than those associated with permanent debt and equity investment ) of banks and other financial intermediaries in a direct investment relationship s are included in portfolio invest- ment, financial derivatives , or other investment . Thus, loans and deposits of such institutions areincluded, as described in paragraphs 415 and421, within those components .40XXI. Reserve Assets Concept and Coverage 424. Reserve assets , the fourth fifth major functional category of the financial account , is an important component of balance of paymentsstatistics and an essential element in the analysisof an economy's external position. Reserve assets consist of those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetaryauthorities for direct financing of payment imbalances, for indirectly regulating the magnitude of such imbalances throughintervention in exchange markets to affect thecurrency exchange rate, and/or for otherpurposes. (See paragraphs 425 and 432.) Thecategory of reserve assets, as defined in this Manual, comprises monetary gold, SDRs, reserve position in the Fund, foreign exchangeassets (consisting of currency and deposits, and securities, and financial derivatives), and other claims. (See paragraph 443.) Securities that donot satisfy the requirements of reserve assets are included in direct investment and portfolio investment .[. . .] Classification [. . .] New paragraph 442a. Transactions in financial derivatives (for example, forwards, futures, swaps, and options) that take place with nonresidents should be recorded in reserve assets only if such transactions pertain to the management of reserve assets, are integral to the valuation of such assets, and are controlled by monetary authorities. In addition, such financial derivatives must be highly liquid and settlement payments must be made in foreign currency. Unlike transactions in all other items, financial derivative transactions in reserve assets should be recorded after transactions in liability positions are subtracted from transactions in asset positions. This method of recording will sometimes result in negative net asset positions.41XXIII. International Investment Position [. . . ] Classification 464. Classification of the international investment position (and of changes to the IIP)has two dimensions. (See the table at the end ofthis chapter.) In the rows of the table, theprimary distinction is between assets andliabilities; the difference between the tworepresents the net position. Fully consistent withthe balance of payments financial account , the first IIP subclassification is by function. Assetsare divided into direct investment , portfolio investment , financial derivatives , other investment , and reserve assets ; liabilities are divided the same way (except for reserve assets ). 465. Within the functional categories and in concordance with the income component of the current account and with the financial account in the balance of payments, direct investment is subdivided into equity capital plus reinvestedearnings, and other capital (intercompany debt), and financial derivatives. Claims on, andliabilities to, affiliated enterprises are shownseparately. Portfolio investment is classified primarily by instrument\u2014equity securities anddebt securities and financial derivatives\u2014 and secondarily by appropriate sectors. Financial derivatives are classified by sector. Other investment also is classified first by instrument and then by sector. Included are Other invest- ment covers trade credits, loans, currency and deposits, and other assets and liabilities (such ascapital subscriptions to international, nonmon-etary organizations and miscellaneous accountsreceivable and payable). Reserve assets are largely interchangeable from a functionalstandpoint. (See paragraphs 437 through 443.)[. . .] Valuation of Components [. . .] 468. Portfolio investment (equity securities and debt securities and financial derivatives ) is valued at current market prices at the appropriate reference dates. For equities that are listed in organized markets or are readilytradable, the value of outstanding stocks shouldbe based on actual prices. The value of equitiesthat are not quoted on stock exchanges orotherwise traded regularly should be estimatedby using the prices of quoted shares that arecomparable as to past, current, and prospectiveearnings and dividends. Alternatively, the netasset values of enterprises to which the equitiesrelate could be used to estimate market values ifthe balance sheets of the enterprises areavailable on a current value basis. For debtsecurities that are listed in organized markets orare readily tradable, the outstanding value ofstocks also should be determined on the basis ofcurrent market prices. For debt securities thatare not readily tradable, the net present value ofthe expected stream of future payments/receiptsassociated with the securities could be used toestimate market value. (The net present value ofany future receipt is equal to the value of thatreceipt when discounted at an appropriateinterest rate.) 469. Financial derivatives are valued, for the international investment position, at market prices current on appropriate reference dates. It is recommended that gross asset and gross liability data be compiled by summing,42respectively, the values of all individual contracts in asset positions and the values of all individual contracts in liability positions. 13a If market prices data are unavailable, other fair value methods, such as option models or discounted present values, may be used to value financial derivatives. Principles for valuation of financial derivatives in the investment position are, in some respects, less definitive than for other portfolio investment instruments. There are ongoing efforts by national and international accounting bodies to define standards for the measurement and recording of derivatives. Thus, in the Manual , a thorough treatment of derivative valuation is not attempted\u2014 particularly in view of continued innovations in this area. Rather, brief valuation guidelines that are consistent with those in the SNA and applicable to a number of existing derivatives are presented subsequently. 470. Traded options, warrants, and traded financial futures, all of which are treated as financial assets, are included in the position at market values on the appropriate accounting dates. For an option, the market value recorded is either the current value of the option\u2014that is,the prevailing market rate price\u2014or the amount of the premium paid as a proxy. The counterpartliability is attributable, by convention, to thewriter of the option and is valued at the currentvalue cost of buying out the rights of the option holder. For a warrant, the counterpart liability ofthe issuer is the current value of buying out outlay required to buy out the exercise rights of 13a There is one exception, which pertains to reserve assets, to this recommendation. See paragraph 473a.the holder. A contract for a currency swap A forward is recorded at market value; when payments are effected, the value of the asset andassociated liability is amortized andsubsequently reflected in the position on theappropriate accounting date. The market value of a forward contract can switch from an asset position to a liability position (and vice versa) between reporting dates. The switch is a result of movement in the price of the underlying item(s) from which the value of the forward is derived. All price changes, including those that result in such switches of position, are treated as revaluations. When a switch in position occurs (and there are no settlement payments), the market value of the gross asset/liability position at the close of the previous accounting period is revalued to zero, and the gross liability/asset position is revalued from zero to the market value at the end of the present accounting period. [. . .] New paragraph 473a. The net marked-to-market values of financial derivative contracts (forwards, futures, swaps and options, for example) with nonresidents should be recorded in reserve assets only if the derivative contracts pertain to the management of reserve assets, are integral to the valuation of such assets, and are controlled by the monetary authorities. In addition, such derivative contracts must be highly liquid, and settlement thereof must be executed in foreign currency. Unlike all other items recorded in the position, financial derivatives\u2014if reported as reserve assets \u2014should be recorded after liabil- ity positions are deducted from asset positions, even if the result is a negative net asset position.43Standard Components of the International Investment Position Changes in Position Reflecting Position at Exchange Other Position Beginning Trans- Price Rate Adjust- at End of Year actions Changes Changes ments of Year A.

Relationship of the Rest of the World Account to the Balance of Payments Accounts and the International Investment Position [. . .] Conversion Procedures [. . .] Classification and Linkages [. . .] 511. Coverage of account V.III.2, the SNA financial account , is identical with that of the financial account of the capital and financial account in the balance of payments, although the level of detail is different. (See Table 4 atthe end of this appendix.) In the SNA, financialassets are classified primarily by type of instru-ment. In the balance of payments, financialitems are classified primarily by function: directinvestment, portfolio investment, financial derivatives, other investment (including loans), and reserve assets . In addition to categories identifying types of financial instruments(insurance technical reserves being anexception), the balance of payments contains anabbreviated breakdown disaggregation by sector (monetary authorities, general government,banks, and other sectors) to provide links withother bodies of economic and financial statisticssuch as money and banking, governmentfinance, international banking, and externaldebt. Furthermore, to conform with the SNA, the Manual states that entries in the financial account of the balance of payments are recorded, in principle, on a net basis (increasesless decreases in assets or liabilities). However,gross recording is included as supplementaryinformation (for example, in the case ofdrawings and repayments on long-term loans).49Appendix II. A Note on Sectors 512. As presented in the Manual , the sectorization of the balance of paymentsportfolio investment, financial derivatives and other investment accounts and related components of the international investmentposition strengthens the links between theinternational accounts, the SNA, and IMF statistical systems such as money andbanking, government finance, and inter-national banking. In addition, the sectorizationenhances the analytic usefulness of theaccounts.50Appendix V. Selected Issues in Balance of Payments Analysis [. . .] General Framework [. . .] 556. In addition to current transactions (i.e., those involving the exchange of goods,the provision of services, and the receipt andpayment of income and transfers), the flow offinancial transactions (i.e., those involvingchanges in financial claims on, and liabilitiesto, the rest of the world) must be analyzed. Asnoted in chapters 8 and 16, these transactionshave two main components: (i) narrowlydefined financial transactions in direct investment , portfolio investment , financial derivatives, and other investment (includingtrade credits, loans, and deposits) and (ii) transactions in reserve assets . There are direct linkages between these components of acountry's international transactions. Forexample, imports of goods are often financedby nonresident suppliers so that an increase inimports will typically be matched by a financialinflow. At the expiration of the financingperiod, the payment to the nonresident supplierwill involve either a drawdown of foreign assets(e.g., foreign deposits held by domestic banks)or the replacement of the liability to thenonresident supplier by another liability tononresidents. There are also close connectionsbetween many financial account transactions. For example, the proceeds from the sale ofbonds in foreign capital markets (a financialinflow) may be temporarily invested abroad inshort-term assets (a financial outflow). "}
