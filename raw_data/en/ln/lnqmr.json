Learn more about the uses and potential side effects of fennel oil supplements here.", "sitename": "BetterMe Blog", "date": "2023-04-25", "cleaned_text": "What are fennel seeds? Fennel seeds are the edible seeds of a plant from the same family as celery, carrots, and parsley. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, fennel has been used for centuries in food and medicine ( [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30000852/)). Fennel oil is derived from the seeds of the fennel plant through steam distillation. It is pale yellow in color and has a sweet, spicy smell. It contains a variety of compounds, including anethole, limonene, and estragole ( [1](https://healthyfocus.org/fennel-essential-oil-benefits/)). These compounds may have a variety of beneficial health effects. What Are The Health Benefits Of Fennel Oil? Fennel oil has many uses on its own and is often combined with other essential oils for even greater benefits. Here are some of the top benefits associated with fennel [oil](https://betterme.world/articles/best-essential-oil-for-skin-tightening/): Soothe Digestive Issues Fennel oil is a volatile oil. That means it can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. Coupled with its active compounds, fennel is thought to be an effective treatment for digestive problems such as gas, bloating, and indigestion. The oil works as a carminative to help expel gas, reduce bloating and aid in digestion ( [10](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system)). People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may also find fennel beneficial. Fennel is often found in medications that are intended to treat abdominal pain and other symptoms associated with IBS ( [2](https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/health-benefits-of-fennel.html)). Gut spasms are painful contractions that can cause significant discomfort ( [18](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355787)). They are often caused by indigestion and can be extremely uncomfortable. Fennel oil's volatile compounds may help reduce abdominal pain and relax the muscles of the digestive tract, alleviating spasms.

These compounds are especially good at reducing inflammation in the gut, which may be helpful for people with inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammation is a leading contributor to many chronic diseases, including heart disease and diabetes ( [19](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/inflammation-a-unifying-theory-of-disease)). Research suggests that fennel oil may be able to help reduce inflammation, thanks to one compound in particular, anethole. Anethole has been found to have anti-inflammatory [properties](https://betterme.world/articles/ginger-essential-oil-for-weight-loss/), and studies in animals suggest it may be effective at reducing inflammation associated with cancer. It specifically targets cytokines, which are small proteins that play a role in inflammation ( [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23054333/)). Support Immunity Fennel oil has antimicrobial characteristics. One study published in Flavour and Fragrance Journal found that fennel oil contains compounds with strong antimicrobial properties ( [7](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364307992_Antimicrobial_and_antioxidant_activities_of_fennel_oil)). These compounds include trans-anethole, methyl chavicol, and fenchone. Because of its antimicrobial properties, fennel oil can help support the [immune system](https://betterme.world/articles/essential-oil-blends-for-sleep/), protect against infections and may even fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Healing Wounds Fennel oil is often used topically to help speed up wound healing. Its antiseptic properties can help fight off infections and reduce the risk of infection. It may also be beneficial in treating sunburns, rashes, and other skin irritations. Fennel oil's benefits for skin don't stop there. It also contains compounds that are thought to help reduce wrinkles and make skin look more youthful. This is due to its antioxidant properties, which can help protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and environmental stressors( [3](https://www.lifesavinghealth.org/youthful-skin-remedies.html)). Killing Intestinal Parasites Fennel oil is said to be effective against a variety of intestinal parasites, including hookworm and roundworm. It may do this by disrupting the parasite's life cycle, ultimately killing the worms ( [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbdv.201400293)). By doing so, it prevents the parasites from reproducing and reduces the risk of infection. Children who are susceptible to intestinal parasites may benefit from taking fennel oil, but speak to your child's pediatrician before giving it to them. Emmenagogue Properties Fennel oil contains phystoestrogens, which have weak estrogen-like activity in the body. . This may make it beneficial for women who experience irregular periods, hormonal imbalances or menopausal symptoms ( [14](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331522125_Effect_of_Phytoestrogen_Fennel_on_Some_Sex_Hormones_and_Other_Physiological_Parameters_in_Male_Albino_Rats)). One study in 2012 found that fennel helped reduce period pain in young women ( [12](https://www.ayujournal.org/article.asp?issn=0974-8520;year=2012;volume=33;issue=2;spage=311;epage=313;aulast=Omidvar)).

Lactation Aid Fennel oil is a widely used galactagogue, meaning it is believed to help to increase milk production in lactating women. However, the scientific evidence behind this use is not conclusive ( [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501793/)). Furthermore, some of the carminative and antispasmodic properties of fennel [oil](https://betterme.world/articles/myofascial-release-creams-and-oils/) might pass through the mother's milk and soothe the baby's stomach, however excessive use may be harmful, so speak to your doctor before using supplements to promote lactation. Diuretic Properties Fennel oil is also a natural diuretic, meaning it can help to flush toxins and excess fluid out of the [body](https://betterme.world/articles/is-olive-oil-gluten-free/). Research in animals suggests that it increases urine production, which can help the body to get rid of unwanted substances, such as excess sodium and potassium ( [4](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/7-best-natural-diuretics/#:~:text=Fennel%20offers%20an%20anise%20or%20licorice%20flavor%20and,was%20double%20that%20of%20the%20control%20group%20%287%29.)). This can help lower blood pressure, reduce bloating and prevent water retention ( [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891367/#:~:text=Impact%20statement%20Current%20knowledge%20on,with%20depression%20and%20anxiety%20disorders)).

However, pregnant women should avoid this oil as it can have estrogen-like activity, which may interfere with fetal growth and development or even be toxic to fetal cells at high doses ( [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15251180/)). Women at risk of hormone-related cancers and tumors, such as breast and uterine cancer, should also avoid fennel oil due to its phytoestrogen content. Allergic Reactions Like any other essential oil, you can be allergic to fennel oil. If you experience any adverse reactions such as swelling, itching or hives while using this oil, discontinue use and consult a doctor.
