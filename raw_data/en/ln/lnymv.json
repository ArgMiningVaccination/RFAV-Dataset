Best known as Japan's leading manufacturer of chocolate products, the Food & Health Care Company is recognized as a source of dreams and good food and helps people lead healthy life. The Pharmaceutical Company concentrates on providing anti-infectives and central nervous system drugs for the treatment of diseases, and it has a growing line of generic drugs. By continuing to expand these two businesses, we are determined to use our wealth of technology to contribute to healthy life. As an organization that is closely linked to the preservation of good health and life, Meiji Seika will continue to fulll its social responsibility and provide products that help its customers lead fullling lives while adhering to the highest ethical standards. At the same time, under the current medium- term business plan, we will work to raise our corporate value and become an even more competitive and dynamic company.

In 1926, we began selling MILK CHOCOLATE, which soon became our flagship product. The introduction of MARBLE CHOCOLATE in 1961 had an immediate and signicant impact, rmly positioning Meiji Seika as Japan's premier supplier of chocolate. With the 1968 launch of KARL, we began the full-scale development of Japan's snack food market. We then launched CHELSEA in 1971 and KAJU GUMMY in In July 2005, Meiji Seika combined its Food Company and its Health Care Company into a unied organization called the Food & Health Care Company. The objective of this integration is to use the Group's resources to create a highly distinctive business model in the eld of health care, a drive that includes building deeper ties with the Pharmaceutical Company. We are increasing the exchange of personnel with the Pharmaceutical Company. Specically, in R&D, we are building a framework capable of constantly utilizing the know-how of our pharmaceutical business in health-related compounds and clinical development, as well as information extending from medical institutions to health maintenance. Such efforts are aimed at maximizing synergies across the food and pharmaceutical businesses to benet our health care business.Further Enhancing Reliability MILK CHOCOLATE 2Value-Added Products that Reflect a Devotion to Good Healthand Safety FOOD CHELSEA MARBLE CHOCOLATE 1988, which created new categories of the candy market. In 1997 , we began selling our rst major chewing gum product, XYLISH, which was followed by the 1998 launch of CHOCOLATE KOUKA with high cacao polyphenol content. In 1999, we created a sensation with FRAN. Offering a new type of eating experience, this innovative product won SIAL d'Or, a gold award at the SIAL 2000 food exhibition, an international trade fair. Current Positioning As people become increasingly aware of the importance of healthy diets, interest has been growing in chocolate products that have a high cacao content. In response, we introduced CHOCOLATE KOUKA and recently began selling NOIR, which uses carefully selected cacao beans. Both products performed well. Sales of MILK CHOCOLATE remained strong as this product approaches its 80th anniversary, demonstrating the timeless appeal of this brand. Products with nuts also posted higher sales, with growth paced by ALMOND CHOCOLATE and MACADAMIA CHOCOLATE. In the chewing gum category, sales of XYLISH were signicantly higher as we conducted sales campaigns and other high-prole marketing activities. Candy sales were also strong, supported by a substantial increase in sales of a new CHELSEA product that places the candy in a sack. In the snack and biscuit category, sales were flat despite general weakness in this market sector.Future Initiatives Meiji Seika is focusing on achieving two major goals. First is raising the market share of existing products. Second is increasing sales of high-value-added products, such as chilled-and-serve chocolate, chocolate with high cacao content, chewing gum certied as Food for Specied Health Use and gift products. In addition, we are reinforcing our earnings base through further advances in the Meiji Production System (MPS)*. This system allows us to manufacture safe and reliable products with outstanding quality while keeping costs down and flexibility high. * Please refer to page 17 for the MPS. 3 Chocolate with High Cacao Content A Flavorful Adult Chocolate for Good Health The antioxidant polyphenol, contained in cacao beans, has been attracting much attention, and the popularity of bitter sweet chocolate, which has high cacao content, is rapidly growing among adults in Japan. To increase demand for chocolate, a core product of the confectionery business, in April 2006 we launched a line of chocolate bars, called CHOCOLATE KOUKA, that are available with cacao content of 99%, 99% cacao mass and absolutely no sugar. One 45-gram bar contains 1,700 milligrams of polyphenol, about four times that of ordinary milk chocolate. This product, which has an extremely bitter taste, and the 86% and 72% versions have all generated a strong response from consumers. T O P I C S NOIRKARLALMOND CHOCOLATEXYLISH XYLISH Food & Health Care Company Support for a Healthy Life For decades, Meiji Seika has conducted its food and pharmaceutical businesses by placing safety and reliability above all else. Through these core businesses, we have gained much expertise in delivering proven efcacy and good taste. We are now leveraging this know-how to develop health care into a new core business. While existing technologies and research work will form the basis for this business, our health care operations will also constantly evolve and advance in response to trends in our markets and society. Our objective is to strengthen our presence in the health care business by introducing distinctive products that reflect the themes of good health, functionality and good taste. Looking Back In the food category, Meiji Seika has many accomplishments, including the 1926 beginning of cocoa production and sales and the 1954 introduction of Japan's rst canned juice. Today, we supply a wide range of food products including cocoa and other beverages, GINZA CURRY and other retort-pouch products, powdered soups, and many other products. We also supply food products that perform specic functions for people's health. SAVAS, which incorporates protein and other nutritional components, has been popular with Olympic and other top athletes for many years. LOLA chewable GINZA CURRY 4HEALTH CARE CASSIS-i SAVAS MILK COCOA supplements are full of vitamins. AMINO COLLAGEN, a product that contributes to beauty, is the market leader in its category, even offering the best taste as well. Meiji Seika has an outstanding reputation for the nutritional assistance that it has provided to top athletes and others for many years. Today, this same know-how is what gives us a competitive edge. In the OTC drug category, our ISODINE GARGLE has been the leading brand for more than two decades in the market for throat gargles. Another important product in this category is MEIJI G TROCHE, which is highly effective at killing throat bacteria and throat disinfection. Current Positioning Although sales of SAVAS declined due mainly to intensifying competition, sales of AMINO COLLAGEN rose substantially as a result of a renewal and expansion of the product lineup. We also concentrated on expanding the market for our lineup of cassis (black currant) products through active promotion of cassis. In cocoa, sales of mainstay MILK COCOA were strong. However, sales of retort-pouch curries were lower despite aggressive in-store sales promotion. Sales of ISODINE declined despite stepped-up sales promotion, including more exposure on store shelves.Future Initiatives To build a solid market position for the health care business, we are developing highly distinctive products and building solid relationships with our customers. Our aim is to use our skills in businesses where food and pharmaceuticals combine in order to establish a business model that is unique to Meiji Seika. To bolster our health-related activities, we have combined the health care and food businesses to create the Food & Health Care Company. In another important step, MEIJI SPORTS PLAZA, Ltd. is taking the lead in starting a business to provide health solutions that draw on our expertise in food and sports. 5 AMINO COLLAGEN Helping People Lead New Lifestyles People of all ages are intrigued by \"anti-aging,\" a concept that is winning acceptance as the basis for new lifestyles. In response, Meiji Seika launched AMINO COLLAGEN, a fundamental beauty food that can play a part in enabling people to enjoy new lifestyles and lead more fullling lives. AMINO COLLAGEN has been extremely well received in the market since its introduction. For the past two years, the product was chosen as number one in the supplements category of the \"@cosme\" web site, which specializes in beauty care information and is very popular among women. As these rankings are based on the evaluations of \"@cosme\" members, AMINO COLLAGEN's rst-place position demonstrates the support generated by this new idea for lifestyles.T O P I C S ISODINEMEIJI G TROCHELOLA MULTIVITAMIN SAVAS 6 Pharmaceutical Company 6Looking Back Our pharmaceutical business dates back to 1946 when we began surface fermentation of penicillin. We subsequently began deep tank fermentation of penicillin, resulting in a dramatic advance in production technology. In 1950, we launched Streptomycin, which played an important part in reducing the incidence of tuberculosis in Japan. In 1958, we developed Kanamycin, the rst antibiotic from Japan to be used on a global scale. This was the rst step in adding products using our own technologies to our lineup of ethical pharmaceuticals. Since then, we have developed and sold many more outstanding antibiotics, in the process helping improve medical care around the world. Drawing on our expertise in antibiotics, we extended our scope of activity to include other ethical drugs, OTC drugs, agricultural A Focus on Drugs Our Distinctive Approach to Helping People Stay Healthyand Generic Drugs The Pharmaceutical Company bases its activities on a steadfast commitment to contribute to good health and health care. Our primary objective is to supply effective, high-quality drugs quickly to individuals who are ghting various diseases. Reflecting this spirit, pharmaceutical activities at the Meiji Seika Group are guided by its mission \"To help people lead happier and more fullling lives.\" Central nervous system drug DEPROMEL Anti-infective MEIACT New 7 chemicals and veterinary drugs. One highlight is ISODINE, a topical antiseptic that went on sale in 1961 and is now widely used. Current Positioning In the ethical pharmaceuticals eld, Meiji Seika supplies many outstanding antibiotics, such as HABEKACIN, Japan's rst treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, and MEIACT, an orally active cephalosporin. More recently, we have concentrated on anti-infectives and central nervous system drugs to create new drugs outstandingly efcacious and safe by new mechanisms and concepts. In the area of generic drugs, health care professionals give Meiji Seika high marks for extensive information provided by our team of medical representatives (MRs) and our specialized product lineup. In agricultural chemicals, we sell distinctive products and materials. One of the best known is ORYZEMATE, a herbicide that protects rice against blast. In veterinary drugs, we supply anti-infectives, fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and other functional materials and enzymes for animal feed, thus helping maintain safe and stable food supplies. In recent years, we have also begun selling drugs and nutrition supplements for companion animals such as dogs, cats and other small animals.Future Initiatives Quickly and successfully commercializing new drugs under development is a high priority of the Pharmaceutical Company. Another important priority is enlarging the generic drug business, which is positioned to expand as the government continues to take measures to hold down growth in medical care expenses. Activities are focused on raising the number of generic drugs that match specic medical needs and effectively using the entire MR team to promote our generic products. By rapidly establishing a sound base for our generic drug business, we intend to achieve our annual sales target of \u00a510 billion and to grow as a \"specialty and generic pharmaceutical\" company. Agricultural chemical ORYZEMATE ME1211 The World's First Oral Carbapenem Antibiotic The antibiotic ME1211, which we license from Wyeth K.K., has completed Phase IIb clinical trials. We expect the drug to be approved in the Japanese market by the scal year ending March 31, 2009. It will be the world's rst carbapenem antibiotic for oral administration. ME1211 is an oral carbapenem prodrug with a wide antibacterial spectrum covering both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It also exhibits potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), thus making it a promising candidate for use in the area of pediatric respiratory tract infections. Clinical development of this pharmaceutical was based on PK/PD (Pharmacokinetic/ Pharmacodynamic) analysis, a rst in Japan. Clinical research continues with the aim of launching ME1211 in the market at the earliest date.T O P I C S The world's rst oral carbapenem (treatment of respiratory tract infections) Preparing for Phase III clinical trials, beginning with pediatric development Injectable carbapenem antibiotic (treatment of MRSA and other serious infections) Development in North America preceding other areas Aminoglycoside injectable antibiotic (treatment of serious infections) Good prospects for outstanding efcacy and greater convenience in clinical use, developing changes in indication and dosage (one dose per day) Japan's rst anti-depressant anti-anxiety with a new mechanism (NaSSA) Completed Phase IIb trials, which conrmed efcacy vs. placebo Treatment for hepatitis C (indication for prevention of death of liver cells, indication for control of immune system) Now in Phase IIa trials using a preparation having improved oral absorption Nose anti-inflammatory drug Considering a licensing partner ME1211 ME1036 Org3770 ME3738 ME3301Phase IIb Phase IIa ongoingList of Products under Development Antibacterial HABEKACINCentral nervous system drug MEILAX Anti-infective HABEKACIN Development Code Indication and Notes Stage Depression OthersMeiji Seika is engaged in the leasing and management of ofce buildings in the Tokyo metropolitan area and is exploring the feasibility of developing these operations into a new business sector. Solid Square, the primary property that we lease, marked its 10th anniversary in 2005. Over the past decade, the building has contributed to the development of the city of Kawasaki and to improving its immediate surroundings. Demand for ofce space in the Tokyo area is strong due to the rebound in corporate earnings. In this environment, we are having considerable success of Solid Square with aggressive efforts to attract new tenants. Meiji Seika plans to continue to supply quality ofce space. Solid Square Solid Square Constructed in 1995 on the former site of the Kawasaki Plant, the Solid Square intelligent building is a landmark ofce building in Kawasaki.Ofce Building Leasing & Others 8T aking on the Challenge of Starting a New Business 9Quality Control / R&D The Meiji Seika Quality Control System In addition to prioritizing taste, we also place much importance on safety and reliability when producing our confectionery and food products. Further, we are acutely aware of the critical role that our pharmaceuticals play in keeping people healthy and in saving the precious life of people. This is why we have highly sophisticated control systems for manufacturing and quality assurance. All Meiji Seika confectionery and food factories have received ISO 9001 certication, an international standard for quality management systems. Our factories perform all tasks\u2014from the selection of raw materials and packaging to shipment and logistics\u2014under stringent quality control standards. At all of our pharmaceutical plants, manufacturing activities conform to the strict standards of Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Quality Practice. Quality management and quality assurance departments that are independent of manufacturing divisions monitor activities to verify this compliance. Research & Development at Meiji Seika We conduct extensive R&D activities based on the central theme of remaining a source of products that offer good taste and health. To offer customers exciting flavors and more health-related functions, the Food and Health R&D Laboratory develops products that use new technologies to create new forms of value. The Pharmaceutical Research Center applies unique core technologies and skills to develop new products for preserving the precious life of people and people' s \"Quality of Life.\" The Microbiological Resource & Technology Laboratory uses microbiological resources to help create new drugs and raise productivity at factories. Meanwhile, the Agricultural & Veterinary Research Laboratory is dedicated to the research and development of high-quality agricultural chemicals and veterinary drugs that are ecologically sound and safe. Constantly conducting these research activities allows us to achieve steady progress in targeted elds while making meaningful contributions to society. Dedicated to Remaining a Source of Reliable and Exciting Products The Company's operations center on food and pharmaceuticals\u2014 vital elements of people's lives and of effective health care. To fulll our responsibilities, we have production and quality assurance systems that put safety and reliability above all else.

Stauffer Biscuit is performing well currently with concentrating on enlarging its sales channels as it narrows its lineup to a selection of key products. In Asia, Meiji Seika (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. was established in 1974 to conduct business locally and in neighboring countries, and its operations have grown steadily. The company is developing a new business following the 2006 completion of a factory to manufacture milk powder preparations. In 2001, we established P .T. Ceres Meiji Indotama in Indonesia. Operations in China are conducted by Guangzhou Meiji Confectionery Co., Ltd., established in 1993, and Meiji Seika (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., established in 2004, and we are working to expand out presence in this market. Pharmaceutical Company Overseas operations began in 1954 with the export of antibiotics. Today, Meiji Seika-brand drugs, such as MEIACT and FOSMICIN, are sold in more than 60 countries. Accompanying growth in the scale of our operations in Asia, we set up production bases in Indonesia, P .T. Meiji Indonesian Pharmaceutical Industries in 1974, and in Thailand, Thai Meiji Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in 1979, thereby allowing is to develop multinational supply capabilities in various countries. In China, we established Shantou Meiji Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., in 1989 for the manufacture and sale of antibiotics, cancer drugs and other products. In a more recent step to grow our operations in China, we formed Meiji Lukang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., in 2004. In Europe, our base of operations for the European Union market is Tedec- Meiji Farma S.A., which we established in Spain in 1991.Worldwide Contributions in Food and Pharmaceutical Markets Businesses that seek to provide good taste and health and dreams have no boundaries.

As a result, consolidated net sales rose 5.1% from the previous scal year, to \u00a5382,429 million. Several factors contributed to an improvement in earnings, including net sales growth that was centered on core products and structural reforms that brought down costs. The benets of these and other factors lifted operating income 88.8%, to \u00a516,460 million. Net income was \u00a58,678 million compared with the previous scal year's net loss of \u00a58,240 million. 15 The Final Year of \"Challenge 2005\"\u2014 Building a Base for Pursuing Aggressive Management \"Challenge 2005\" is the three-year business plan that we commenced in June 2003, when I became president, and completed in March 2006. We initiated this plan at a time of crisis. Meiji Seika had seen its earnings drop dramatically for two consecutive years and \"Challenge 2005\" was formulated to end this decline. The plan's rst two years, which ended in March 2005, was a period of transformation. Everyone at the Company worked toward achieving a V-shaped recovery in our prot structure through rigorous structural reforms and active business development. Such efforts involved making many difcult decisions. We reorganized our production bases, and we reduced our workforce by introducing an early retirement support system. Moreover, a radical change in our pension system resulted in the lump-sum amortization of unrecognized obligation. Following the implementation of these measures, we turned to aggressive management in the plan's nal year. Although we did not reach our net sales target, net income exceeded our target for the nal year of \"Challenge 2005.\" Looking back over this three-year period, I believe there were two particularly signicant accomplishments. First, we completed the plan without any mid-course adjustments. Second, we established a foundation for becoming a more competitive and dynamic company. As this second point has no nal goal, we will advance one step at a time toward fullling the goals of our new medium-term Medium-term business \u00a5400,000 To Our Stakeholders \"DASH! 08\"\u2014 A Plan for Becoming a More Competitive and Dynamic Company The accomplishments of \"Challenge 2005\" give us a solid base for embarking on our next medium-term business plan, which will end in March 2009. To express our determination to execute this new plan with great speed, we named the plan \"DASH! 08.\" In formulating the plan, we began by establishing a vision for the entire Meiji Seika Group in 2008. Once we had completed that initial step, we then used the Group vision to create visions for each of our Group companies and business divisions. This next step also formed the basis for determining strategies. With visions in place, we will take the above actions to transform these visions into reality.Aims of the Meiji Seika Group (Vision for 2008) Striving to be a More Competitive and Dynamic Company. 1) Consumers would generally have an image \"Good Taste and Fun,\" \"Good Health\" and \"Reliability\" with the brand of \"Meiji.\" 2) Develop health care business is the top priority: The Company has an established health care business model including co-work with the Pharmaceutical Company, that utilizes the advantage of having food and pharmaceutical businesses in a company. 3) Establish a new \"specialty and generic pharmaceutical\" business structure by developing generic drugs into a core business, alongside anti-infectives and central nervous system drugs. 4) Aggressively expand overseas operations with the ultimate aim of generating the same level of sales as in Ja pan. By Having Each and Every Employee Set Ambitious Goals and Constantly Work toward Achieving those Goals: 1) Increase net sales to \u00a5 450 billion * This target incorporates the estimated negative impact (more than \u00a510 billion) of two ofcial drug price revisions in Japan. 2) Raise overseas sales to about 20% of total net sales17 A More Powerful Product Lineup and Higher Market Share in the Confectionery Business In terms of product categories, we will concentrate on strengthening our chocolate and chewing gum operations in order to raise our market share. For some time, we have been aiming for a 30% share of Japan's chocolate candy market. Market conditions are favorable, and there is growing interest in Japan in regions of the world that produce cacao beans and in high cacao content. We will take full advantage of our powerful brand name, which is our greatest strength. We intend to reach our market share target by adding to our lineup of high-value-added products for adults and distinctive products, such as chilled-and-serve chocolate products. To raise our share of the chewing gum market, we are executing two initiatives. The rst is to raise the market share of existing products. The second is to increase the presence of our products in the high-value-added category, such as chewing gum that is certied as Food for Specied Health Use. To strengthen manufacturing, the Meiji Production System (MPS)* will be used at all our factories and we will make a total of about \u00a510 billion in capital investment. By adopting this production system, we will raise product quality and achieve an estimated annual cost saving of about \u00a53 billion in the scal year ending March 2009. Meiji Seika will be much more competitive as a result. * The Meiji Production System (MPS) is a manufacturing and logistics system that gives Meiji Seika a sound base for maintaining a protable operating framework. Two elements of the system are the use of an internal company system, similar to the Kanban system employed at Toyota, and a cell production system, similar to the one utilized at Canon. Going even farther, Meiji Seika is building a Food & Health Care Company production and logistics system that can fully meet the needs of consumers as well as the entire supply chain. Establishing a New Business Model Centered on Health We are implementing strategies that will expand our health care business. Concentrating resources on core brands is one strategy. Another is working on the enlargement of our sales channels by focusing on catalog sales and specialty sales routes. To successfully achieve further business growth, it is vital that we assemble a highly distinctive business model. Nutrition and exercise are directly linked to good health. For many years, we have been involved in these two aspects of healthy living and this experience sets us apart from competitors. Meiji Seika is particularly skilled with regard to nutrition for athletes. We will draw on this know-how to conduct a health solutions business based on a new concept\u2014the integration of food and sports. One step in this direction will be the fall 2006 opening of the new \"Meiji Sports Plaza\" (Takatsuki, Osaka), a part of our 90th anniversary activities. We will offer individualized consultations to identify the nutrition and exercise needs of each customer. This interaction with customers will enable us to provide them with counseling that covers both food and exercise. Applying our expertise in supporting athletes to the sports activities of the general public is another business eld that offers much potential. 18 To Our Stakeholders A Specialty and Generic Pharmaceutical Business Until now, our pharmaceutical business has focused on anti-infectives and central nervous system drugs. Going forward, we will remain committed to these elds, and at the same time we will strengthen our generic drug business with the aim of establishing a new business structure rooted in specialty and generic pharmaceuticals. There are two reasons to strengthen our generic drug business. First, we have a competitive advantage because, as a producer of new drugs, we have been involved in generic drugs for about 10 years. Second, market conditions for generic drugs in Japan are becoming increasingly favorable as a result of government measures to hold down medical expenses. Moreover, generic drugs account for only about 15% of Japan's total pharmaceutical sales in terms of volume and 5% in monetary terms. In the United States, these gures are about 53% and 12%, respectively. In the near future, Japan is likely to approach these levels. Thus, by bolstering our generic drug capabilities now, we will be positioned to capitalize on emerging market opportunities. Regarding specialty drugs, our goal is to bring to market new drugs as quickly as possible while raising sales by strengthening our marketing capabilities. Our R&D programs will focus on the most attractive projects, and we will execute these programs swiftly. Additionally, we will take steps to improve our product life cycle management to further increase sales. We are determined to rapidly put this new business structure in place by working to increase the number of distinctive generic drugs that meet medical needs while actively promoting those products by using our entire team of medical representatives (MRs). In this way, we will lay the foundations for a successful specialty and generic pharmaceutical business. Aggressive Expansion Outside Japan Japan's markets for confectionery and pharmaceuticals are unlikely to grow. That means we must increase our share of overseas markets to sustain our growth. Accordingly, our goal is to continue to expand operations in China and other Asian countries, in North America, and in other regions. Over the next three years, we aim to raise overseas sales to about 20% of total net sales. In China, in particular, we are taking steps to strengthen our manufacturing and sales infrastructures, and in August 2006 a new confectionery factory began operations on the outskirts of Shanghai. 19 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)\u2014 Our Commitment to Corporate Citizenship and Responsibility From the perspective of our social obligations, we believe that our highest priority is fullling our responsibilities to shareholders, customers, business partners, employees, communities and all other stakeholders. Doing so requires that we maintain growth over the long term while raising operating efciency and capital efciency. We must also be a source of products and services that excel in terms of safety and quality. In sum, Meiji Seika must develop as a company that coexists with and is valued by society. As in the past, we will prioritize six elements of CSR: quality assurance, compliance, risk management, the environment, social contributions and the disclosure of information. By taking this approach, we will become more competitive and raise the value of our brands and the entire Company. Furthermore, we have taken steps to ensure comprehensive CSR management. Our CSR Committee is tasked with taking the lead in this regard by discussing and determining fundamental policies and other important matters associated with the Meiji Seika Group's CSR programs. A Global Organization Able to Create \"Good Taste and Health\" We continue to face many challenges, notably reductions in ofcial drug prices in Japan and the much higher cost of raw materials, such as sugar, nuts and crude oil. To overcome these challenges, we will raise our corporate value by successfully executing the strategies outlined above. Our goal is clear; we will become a global organization that is recognized as a source of \"Good Taste and Health.\" Meiji Seika will celebrate its 90th anniversary in October 2006. To express our gratitude to shareholders for their support over the years, we paid a year-end commemorative dividend of \u00a53 per share in addition to the year-end dividend per share of common stock of \u00a53.50. This resulted in an annual cash dividend of \u00a510 per share applicable to the scal year ended March 31, 2006. In line with the basic policy of paying a stable dividend over the medium-to-long term, Meiji Seika will continue to meet the expectations of its shareholders by taking measures aimed at raising protability and corporate value. August 2006 Naotada Sato President 20Corporate Governance and Compliance Corporate Governance Meiji Seika positions corporate governance as one of its highest management priorities. We intend to become more competitive and better able to sustain growth by using sound management systems that can earn the trust of society. Corporate ofcers are responsible for conducting business activities. This system allows directors to focus exclusively on making decisions on important management issues and supervising the execution of business activities. We have two external directors, who have wide-ranging knowledge and experience, to provide objective and diverse viewpoints with regard to decision-making and supervisory functions. Advisory committees that include external directors afford even greater management transparency and objectivity. The Nomination Committee submits to the Board of Directors recommendations for candidates for directors and corporate ofcers positions. The Compensation Committee evaluates the annual performance of directors and corporate ofcers and submits compensation proposals. The Board of Corporate Auditors has four members, including two external auditors, to provide a powerful supervisory function. We have also established the CSR Committee, which discusses and determines our fundamental policy and other items concerning corporate social responsibility (CSR). The committee's goal is to make our CSR spirit an integral element of operations at all Meiji Seika Group companies.

As one way to fulll this mission and obligation, we established the Compliance Committee in October 2002. This was followed in January 2003 with the announcement of the Meiji Seika Business Practices Charter, which denes guidelines for the behavior of all employees when conducting business activities.

Consolidated Subsidiaries As of March 31, 2006, the Meiji Seika Group encompassed Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (Meiji Seika), 21 consolidated subsidiaries and one afliate accounted for on the equity method. The 13 domestic subsidiaries include 10 companies in the food business, 1 company in the pharmaceutical business, and 2 companies in the health care business. The 8 overseas subsidiaries include 3 companies in the food business, 4 companies in the pharmaceutical business and 1 company in other businesses. Overview During the scal year ended March 31, 2006, Japan's economy staged a gradual recovery as corporate earnings improved, capital investment increased and there was an upturn in consumer spending. However, the outlook remains uncertain because of the much higher cost of crude oil and other raw materials. In this environment, the Meiji Seika Group shifted its focus from structural reforms to business development in order to achieve the goals of \"Challenge 2005,\" a medium-term business plan that ended in March 2006. In particular, priority was placed on active business development with a focus on the health care sector. The Food & Health Care Company was established in July 2005 and other actions were taken to become more competitive in order to increase sales and restore protability. Due to these actions, consolidated net sales increased 5.1% year-on-year to \u00a5382,429 million, operating income was up 88.8% year-on-year to \u00a516,460 million and net income was \u00a58,678 million compared with the previous scal year's net loss of \u00a58,240 million. Review of Operations by Segment Food & Health Care CompanyThe Food & Health Care Company was established in July 2005 through the integration and reorganization of the Food Company and Health Care Company. This resulted in the change of segment classication from the scal year under review. The operating environment for the Food & Health Care business was challenging. Consumption in Japan of confectioneries remained flat. In the health care sector, despite market expansion continued, the large number of new entrants in this market produced heated competition. In this environment, the Meiji Seika Group worked on increasing sales mainly through two initiatives. First was the development of new products that anticipate consumer needs and have a competitive edge. Second was the execution of strategic marketing activities for individual brands. At domestic consolidated subsidiaries, MEIJI FOOD MATERIA CO., LTD. saw sales decline due to a change in the terms and conditions for transactions with major customers in the core sugar products business. MEIJI CHEWING GUM CO., LTD. performed well by reinforcing product development skills that have been developed over many years and the marketing activities. MEIJI SPORTS PLAZA, Ltd., which operates sports club facilities, expanded its business because of the May 2005 acquisition of the tness clubs of Tokyo Gas Sports Co., Ltd. At overseas subsidiaries, Meiji Seika (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. increased sales in Singapore and neighboring countries. In the United States, D.F. Stauffer Biscuit Co., Inc. had a strong performance due to the aggressive expansion of sales channels and a tight focus on key products. In the overseas business, there was a big increase in export sales because of efforts to raise sales in Asian countries and develop business operations in the Chinese market. Import sales were also strong. This was mainly a reflection of higher imports of chocolate due to the growing interest in Japan in cacao and of sales activities to promote products for Valentine's Day. The result was a 5.0% year-on-year increase in net sales to \u00a5264,410 million and a 56.7% year-on-year increase in operating income to \u00a59,843 million. These comparisons with the previous scal year are based on the combined results of the Food Company and Health Care Company. Pharmaceutical Company This company continued to encounter a difcult operating environment. The major challenges were the widespread medical expenses containment measures in Japan, intense competition involving the development of new drugs and the growth in research and development costs. In this environment, the Meiji Seika Group continued to concentrate its resources on the sale of key products, such as anti-infectives and central nervous 2324system drugs. Outside Japan, the main goal was selling products in more countries by steadily conducting programs to supply scientic information concerning core products and other products. Regarding ethical pharmaceuticals, the operating environment is extremely difcult because of the contracting market for anti-infectives. Nevertheless, core products MEIACT and OMEGACIN posted strong sales. However, sales of HABEKACIN and FOSMICIN were lower due to intense competition. In central nervous system drugs, DEPROMEL, a treatment for depression, recorded a substantial increase in sales. This accomplishment was due to the aggressive dissemination of scientic information by medical representatives specializing in this drug, as well as to the receipt of approval for the additional indication for social anxiety disorder for the rst time in Japan. Sales of the anti-anxiety drug MEILAX continued to climb. In other ethical pharmaceuticals, sales of the external topical antiseptic ISODINE were lower because of intense competition. Additionally, sales of the anti- allergy drug EBASTEL declined. Although EBASTEL beneted from the introduction of a new chewable version, sales were lower because of a less severe pollen season than in the previous scal year. In agricultural chemicals, sales were strong as sales of the core product ORYZEMATE, a herbicide that protects rice against blast, increased. In veterinary drugs, the shrinking market for anti-infectives, streamlining of the product lineup and other actions impacted sales, but the benets of extensive sales activities offset these factors to produce a sales increase. At domestic consolidated subsidiaries, strong demand for influenza vaccines led to higher sales at Kitasato Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd. At FUJI-AMIDE CHEMICAL CO., LTD., sales were lower due to challenges posed by competing products. Meiji Seika sold all of its shares in this company to Nankai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. in March 2006. At overseas consolidated subsidiaries, sales were lower at P.T. Meiji Indonesian Pharmaceutical Industries due to weak sales in local markets. Thai Meiji Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. reported higher sales mainly because of strong sales in the local market of MEIACT and FOSMICIN, which were backed by high-prole sales activities. In Spain, Tedec-Meiji Farma S.A. achieved a substantial sales increase due to the contribution of MEIACT, which it began selling in the fall of 2004. In the overseas business, there was a large increase in export sales of COLISTIN, an animal feed additive that Meiji Seika backed up with the dissemination of scientic information stressing this product's high quality. Additionally, MEIACT recorded substantial growth in sales mainly in Europe and Turkey. As a result, net sales of the Pharmaceutical Company increased 5.3% to \u00a5115,388 million and operating income rose 87.9% to \u00a56,606 million. Ofce Building Leasing & Others The recovery in earnings at Japanese companies is producing strong demand for large buildings in the Tokyo metropolitan area. As a result, the Solid Square ofce building, the segment's primary property, was successful at attracting new tenants. The result was a 0.1%, or a \u00a53 million, increase in segment net sales to \u00a52,630 million. Segment results in the previous scal year include the operations of MEIJI KAIHATSU CO., LTD., which was liquidated in March 2005. Analysis of Income Statement For the scal year ended March 31, 2006, net sales increased 5.1% to \u00a5382,429 million but the cost of sales increased only 3.3% to \u00a5213,069 million. This resulted in a 1.0 percentage point improvement in the ratio of cost of sales to net sales to 55.7%, which raised the gross prot by 7.3% to \u00a5169,360 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 2.6% to \u00a5152,899 million, but the ratio of SG&A expenses to net sales declined by 1.0 percentage point to 40.0% because of the larger growth in net sales. Research and development costs, which are included in general and administrative expenses and manufacturing expenses, decreased 1.6% to \u00a516,578 million. This was due to the concentration of R&D resources on strategic business elds in the Pharmaceutical Company. Due to these items, operating income was up 88.8% to \u00a516,460 million and the ratio of operating income to net sales improved by 1.9 percentage point to 4.3%.2006 2005 MEIACT 20.7 19.2 (Export sales) 1.7 1.5 FOSMICIN 6.3 7.2 HABEKACIN 5.5 5.7 OMEGACIN 3.2 2.7 SWORD 1.9 1.9 ISODINE 6.1 6.9 DEPROMEL 9.1 7.7 EBASTEL 3.7 3.9 MEILAX 4.5 4.3Sales of Key Pharmaceutical Products (\u00a5 Billions)25Net other expenses increased \u00a586 million to \u00a5300 million. Although interest and dividend income increased 10.7%, interest expenses were up 4.5%. The interest coverage ratio, which is net cash provided by operating activities divided by interest expenses, improved from 13.5 times to 15.3 times. Extraordinary items resulted in a net gain of \u00a5261 million compared with the net loss of \u00a520,833 million in the previous scal year. The main reason is the extraordinary loss recorded in the previous scal year for the one-time amortization of unrecognized retirement benet obligations and expenses incurred due to management structure reforms. These factors did not affect the nancial results for the scal year under review. As a result of the above, income before income taxes was \u00a516,422 million compared with a loss of \u00a512,330 million in the previous scal year, and net income was \u00a58,678 million compared with a net loss of \u00a58,240 million as consolidated performance made a big improvement from the previous year's losses to a solid prot. Net income per share was \u00a522.41 compared with a net loss per share of \u00a521.53 in the previous scal year. Analysis of Financial Position As of March 31, 2006, total assets increased \u00a58,433 million to \u00a5348,281 million. Total current assets decreased \u00a56,962 million, and total xed assets increased \u00a515,396 million. Total liabilities decreased \u00a54,781 million to \u00a5187,622 million. Growth in short-term bank loans and other items caused total current liabilities to increase \u00a52,096 million, but total long-term liabilities were down \u00a56,877 million mainly because of declines in long-term debt and employees' retirement benets. Shareholders' equity increased \u00a512,924 million to \u00a5157,761 million as the strong earnings resulted in higher retained earnings and there was an increase in the difference in valuation of other securities. Shareholders' equity per share increased \u00a535.75 to \u00a5413.53, the return on average total shareholders' equity (ROE) was 5.7% and the equity ratio improved by 2.7 percentage points to 45.3%. Analysis of Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities increased \u00a52,782 million from the previous scal year to \u00a519,513 million. Although cash was used for a pension plan contribution associated with the switch to a new retirement benet system, this was offset by the large improvement in income before income taxes.Net cash used in investing activities increased \u00a52,050 million to \u00a518,822 million. This was due in part to investments in production bases in China. Net cash used in nancing activities was \u00a54,687 million, mainly due to dividend payments and the purchase of treasury stock. This was a decline of \u00a516,664 million compared with net cash provided in the previous scal year when there were proceeds of \u00a520,000 million from the bond issuance. The net result was a \u00a53,890 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents at end of year compared with the previous scal year to \u00a518,755 million as of March 31, 2006. Outlook for the Year Ending March 31, 2007 As the beginning of the \"DASH! 08,\" a medium-term business plan, the scal year ending March 31, 2007 is an important period for Meiji Seika. To accomplish the goals of this plan, the Food & Health Care Company will focus on raising its share of the chocolate and chewing gum markets and on the challenge of targeting new customer needs associated health in particular. In the Pharmaceutical Company, plans call for speeding the development of new drugs and establishing a framework for a generic drug business. For the scal year ending March 31, 2007, Meiji Seika is forecasting a 3.3% increase in net sales to \u00a5395,000 million, a 27.1% decrease in operating income to \u00a512,000 million and a 42.4% decrease in net income to \u00a55,000 million. Net sales are expected to grow because of an expanding health business and the aggressive development of overseas businesses. However, the impact of NHI drug price revisions in Japan, higher raw materials prices and other factors are expected to cause earnings to decline. By business segment, Food & Health Care Company sales are projected to increase 5.9% to \u00a5280,000 million and operating income to decrease 18.7% to \u00a58,000 million. Pharmaceutical Company sales are projected to decrease 2.9% to \u00a5112,000 million and operating income to decrease 54.6% to \u00a53,000 million. Ofce Building Leasing & Others sales are projected to increase 14.0% to \u00a53,000 million and operating income to increase 90.8% to \u00a5300 million.26Risk Factors Factors that have the potential to exert a signicant influence on investors' decisions include, but are not limited to, the following. Statements in the text concerning the future are based on the judgment of the Meiji Seika Group's management as of March 31, 2006, the end of the scal year under review. (1) Procurement of Raw Ingredients In the Meiji Seika Group's confectionery products business, nearly all raw ingredients and major ingredients (cacao beans, nuts, etc.) are imported. In principle, the Group maintains a xed level of domestic stock, and takes measures to disperse risks in producing regions. However, in the event that the Group is unable to secure a sufcient volume of ingredients for an extended period of time due to political conditions in exporting countries, global demand conditions or other factors, the Group's production activities would be hindered, which could impact the Group's business results and nancial position. In addition, prices are currently trending higher for nearly all raw ingredients, and the Group is working to control costs by developing new procurement routes and promoting streamlining. However, acceleration in this upward trend in prices in the future could affect production costs. (2) Changes in Exchange Rates The Meiji Seika Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts in procuring raw materials. However, changes in exchange rates could increase procurement costs, which could affect the Meiji Seika Group's nancial position. In addition, items such as product sales, expenses and assets of overseas subsidiaries and businesses that are denominated in local currencies are translated into yen upon consolidation. Changes in exchange rates can therefore affect the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position. (3) The Impact of Weather Chocolate sales account for a large percentage of the Meiji Seika Group' s confectionery products business. High temperatures and changes in the weather can easily affect consumer purchasing patterns and affect sales of chocolate and other confectioneries. Unpredictable changes in weather can therefore affect the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position.(4) Legal RegulationsThe Meiji Seika Group must comply with the Food Sanitation Law and other laws and regulations, as well as with the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and other laws and regulations involving pharmaceuticals, and with the Agricultural Chemicals Regulation Law and other laws and regulations involving agricultural chemicals. Furthermore, the Group is subject to the Product Liability Law, the Anti-monopoly Law and other laws. In its food and health care business and its pharmaceuticals business, the Meiji Seika Group assures strict compliance with relevant laws and regulations, enhances sanitary management, and ensures accurate product labeling. However, should the Group be required to suspend or to recall products manufactured prior to changes in relevant laws and regulations, experience problems unique to the Group, such as defective products, or suffer the consequences of common social problems or criminal acts directed against the Group, the Meiji Seika Group's nancial position could be affected. Ethical pharmaceuticals prices are subject to changes in the government's medical policies, including NHI drug price revisions, and the national health insurance system. Such changes could affect the Group's nancial position. (5) Contamination by Foreign Substances In its food and health care business, the Meiji Seika Group places the highest priority on using ingredients that are safe and reliable for consumers, and is working to obtain safe, reliable ingredients through measures such as shifting procurement to safer countries and strengthening inspection of suppliers. In the pharmaceutical business, the Meiji Seika Group manufactures products ranging from bulk pharmaceuticals to drug preparations under management that follows Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines stipulated by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. To prevent contamination incidents, the Group routinely conducts stringent production management and has incorporated the latest technology in an effort to improve the conguration and equipment of production facilities. However, there is no guarantee against the possibility of contamination by foreign substances in any of the Group's products. Contamination by foreign substances would have a serious impact on the reputation of the Meiji Seika Group, which could cause sales to decline and costs to rise, and thus has the potential to impact the Group's business results.27(6) Occurrence of Side Effects In the pharmaceutical business, the Meiji Seika Group conducts product development, manufacturing and marketing according to various laws and standards enforced by regulatory authorities. However, unforeseen side effects have the potential to occur during development and after product launch. The Meiji Seika Group prepares against the occurrence of such incidents by carrying insurance coverage for various types of liability, including product liability. However, because there is no guarantee that such insurance will be sufcient to cover all damages associated with such liability, unforeseen side effects have the potential to impact the Group's business results and nancial position. (7) Research and Development In the Meiji Seika Group's pharmaceutical business, the development of new products requires a variety of tests over long periods of time, which necessitates substantial expenses. In addition, the Meiji Seika Group must in some instances extend, interrupt or cease particular research and development projects because of safety and efcacy issues. Therefore, progress in research and development has the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position. Moreover, the launch of products that the Meiji Seika Group develops may be delayed if research and development does not proceed as planned. This may result in the need to introduce the products of other companies. Such cases have the potential to increase outlays for intellectual property rights and licensing. (8) Intellectual Property The Meiji Seika Group owns intellectual property created through business activities including research and development. The Group also legally uses a broad range of intellectual property that is patented by third parties. The Group uses such intellectual property with the understanding that it is not infringing upon the rights of third parties. However, litigation and other issues arising in connection with intellectual property have the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position. (9) The Impact of Regional Upheaval or Change in Social Conditions The Meiji Seika Group conducts production and sales activities overseas, primarily in Europe, North America and Southeast Asia. The occurrence of earthquakes or other major natural disasters in areas in which the Group operates; changes in inflation and other economic conditions; and wars, revolutions and other events that may cause political turbulence have the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position. (10) The Impact of a Large Earthquake, Fire or Other Disaster A large earthquake, re or other natural disaster that causes extensive damage to Meiji Seika Group's production facilities and results in an extended halt in production has the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position. (11) Information Systems The Meiji Seika Group works to thoroughly implement measures to counter computer viruses and rigorously maintains its information management system. However, a system shutdown resulting from an unknown virus or unauthorized system access, or leakage of customer information, all have the potential to impact the Meiji Seika Group's business results and nancial position. The above list is not a complete list of the risks to which the Meiji Seika Group is vulnerable. 28Consolidated Balance Sheets Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries March 31,

Statements Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated nancial statements of Meiji Seika Kaisha, Ltd. (the \"Company\") and subsidiary companies have been prepared from the consolidated nancial statements in Japanese led with the Kanto Finance Bureau as required by the Securities and Exchange Law of Japan, which are in conformity with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan. These are different in certain respects from the application and disclosure requirements of International Accounting Standards. The consolidated nancial statements are not intended to present the nancial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated nancial statements, certain reclassications have been made to present them in a form which is familiar to readers outside Japan. The accounts and the nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are maintained in Japanese yen. For the convenience of the reader, the accompanying consolidated nancial statements are also presented in U.S. dollars by arithmetically translating all Japanese yen amounts by using the exchange rate of \u00a5117.47 to $1 in effect at March 31, 2006. 2. Summary of Signicant Accounting Policies (a) Consolidation policyThe accompanying consolidated nancial statements include the accounts of the Company and signicant subsidiaries (the \"Companies\"), over which the Company has power of control through majority voting rights or existence of certain conditions evidencing control by the Company. Investments in afliates over which the Company has ability to exercise signicant influences over operating and nancial policies of the investees, are accounted for on the equity method. The consolidated nancial statements consist of the Company and its 21 (21 in 2005) signicant subsidiaries. All signicant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Accounts of subsidiaries whose business year-ends differ by three months from March 31 have been included using nancial information with appropriate adjustment. Investments in one afliate are accounted for on the equity method. The difference between the cost and underlying net equity at acquisition of investments in consolidated subsidiaries and afliates is allocated to identiable assets based on fair market value at the date of acquisition. The unallocated portion of the differences is amortized over 5 years and 15 years on a straight-line basis. (b) Marketable and investment securities Marketable and investment securities are valued using the following methods. Securities that have market prices: Market valuation based on market prices at scal year-end. Differences in appraisals are accounted for by incorporation of direct capital, and sales cost is calculated using the moving-average method. Securities that have no market prices: Cost method based on the moving-average method. (c) InventoriesInventories, including nished and seminished products as well as work in progress, are valued at cost, which is determined mainly by the average cost method, except supplies and raw materials, which are stated at the lower of cost or market. (d) Income taxes The Companies provide for income taxes applicable to all items included in the consolidated statements of income regardless of when such taxes are payable. Income taxes based on temporary differences between tax and nancial reporting purposes are reflected as deferred income taxes in the consolidated nancial statements using the asset and liability method. (e) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of the assets of the parent company and domestic subsidiaries is calculated primarily by the declining balance method. However, depreciation of buildings and structures used in the leasing business that were acquired on or after April 1, 1995 is calculated by the straight-line method. Furthermore, depreciation of buildings (excluding attached xtures) acquired on or after April 1, 1998 is calculated by the straight-line method. Overseas consolidated subsidiaries mainly used the straight-line method to calculate depreciation. (f) Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, which is calculated principally by the straight-line method. Commencing with the scal year under review, the Company's U.S. subsidiaries have adopted the U.S. Financial Accounting Standard Board' s Statement No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Accordingly, impairment studies will be conducted annually or when incidents that could possibly impair goodwill or other intangible assets occur to determine whether impairment has occurred. Following this standard, the U.S. subsidiaries have conducted impairment studies and determined that the fair value of their goodwill and other intangible assets lie above carrying value. Therefore, starting with the scal year under review, no amortization charges will be made to the consolidation adjustment account. (g) Allowance for doubtful accounts To provide for losses on doubtful accounts such as accounts receivable, the Company charges to income an amount based on actual loss experience for normal accounts, plus an amount for projected unrecoverable amounts based on assessments of individual designated accounts, such as credits from companies in danger of bankruptcy. (h) Reserve for retirement allowances The Company and its principal consolidated subsidiaries provide for employees' accrued retirement benets by charging to income the amount recognized as having been incurred based upon the projected amounts of the liability for accrued retirement benets and pension assets at the end of the consolidated scal year. Certain consolidated subsidiaries charge the difference at the time of accounting standard alteration (\u00a5233 million) is being charged to income on a pro rata basis over seven years. Prior service liabilities are amortized on the straight-line method over a specied number of years (4 years), that is less than the average remaining 34period of employment for employees from the time the liability arouse. The difference based on an actuarial calculation is charged to income beginning in the following consolidated scal year, using the pro rata amounts based on a specied number of years (seven) that is less than the average remaining period of employment for employees at the time the difference arose. (i) Leases For nance lease transactions, except for leases that transfer ownership of the property to the lessee, the usual accounting method governing lease transactions is applicable. (j) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are composed of cash on hand, bank deposits available for withdrawal on demand and highly liquid, short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less that can be readily converted into cash and which represent a minor risk of fluctuation in value. (k) Impairment of xed assets Effective from the scal year ended March 31, 2006, the Companies adopted the new accounting standards for impairment of xed assets (\"Statement of Opinion on the Establishment of Accounting Standards for Impairment of Fixed Assets\" issued by the Business Accounting Council of Japan on August 9, 2002) and the implementation guidance for accounting standards for impairment of xed assets (Financial Accounting Standards Implementation Guidance No.6- \"Application Guidance on Accounting Standards for Impairment of Fixed Assets\" issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on October 31, 2003) . The adoption of these standards had no effect on the consolidated statement of income for the scal year ended March 31, 2006. (l) Translation of foreign currency Short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rate at the consolidated balance sheet date. The foreign currency translation adjustment is accounted for as a gain or loss. The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. The income and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen using the average exchange rate during the scal year. The translation adjustments are included in minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and in the foreign currency translation adjustment account in the shareholders' equity portion of the consolidated balance sheet. (m) Per share data Net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock. 3.
