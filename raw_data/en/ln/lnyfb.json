Material A balancing board made with good quality material like birch wood is recommended as it determines its durability. In addition, use of non-toxic paint and eco-friendly materials adds to the sustainability factor. A plastic balance board can also be used as long as it meets the safety standards and is used under adult supervision. 2. Capacity Most balancing boards can easily hold the weight of kids as well as adults, but it is still recommended to make sure that you double check with the seller about the weight holding capacity of the one that you are looking out to buy. 3.

But at the same time, a deeply curved board might make balancing hard, making kids prone to falls and accidents. Choose a balancing board that has a medium curve for kids to make maximum use of it. 5. Surface type There are different balancing boards in the market with different either a smooth surface or an anti-skid one. The anti-skid boards provide a good grip and help balance well but not be suitable for sliding and other uses, making it a limitation. On the other hand, a balancing board with a smooth surface might be more versatile but pose a risk of poor grip leading to falls. 6. Usability A balancing board should be well-finished with non-toxic paints, glues, and lacquers, making them chip and peel resistant and safe for kids.
