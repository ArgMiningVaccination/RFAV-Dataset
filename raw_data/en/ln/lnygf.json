A 2014 survey from the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/#_Chapter_3:_Attitudes) found 86 percent of scientists with the American Association for the Advancement of Science think childhood vaccines should be mandatory. And the [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://www2.aap.org/immunization/), [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/imz-basics.htm), Institutes [National Academy of Sciences](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=13164), and [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/features/qa/84/en/) encourage vaccination and deem it safe. The [standard vaccination schedule](http://www.vox.com/cards/vaccines/vaccine-schedule) from the CDC provides various vaccine recommendations for [children](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) and [adults](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/adult.html), including MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough), and the flu. The recommended vaccines are seen as crucial to preventing the spread of dangerous, sometimes life-threatening illnesses. The scientific evidence shows [vaccines are generally safe](http://www.vox.com/cards/vaccines/do-vaccines-cause-autism), barring a few rare, typically minor complications. Vaccines also played [a key role](http://www.vox.com/cards/vaccines/why-vaccine-treatable-diseases-still-exist) in eradicating or diminishing diseases like polio, smallpox, tetanus, measles, mumps, and whooping cough.
