[Schedule Now](#) I have been receiving regular holistic medicine treatments from Bridget for over a year. I have an autoimmune condition and systemic Lyme disease, and I can say with confidence that I have noticed a huge improvement in my symptoms and overall well-being. She is extremely kind, generous and knowledgeable and it is a gift to have her support in my healing journey. Bridget I am very grateful for your healing knowledge. The acupuncture treatment and herbs have done wonders for me. Last night I had a great night's sleep. See you next week! Bridget is knowledgeable, professional and caring! She is super knowledgeable about yoga and Chinese Medicine but what I love most about her is how comfortable she always makes me feel. She's got a very calm and sweet energy about her and is always a pleasure to be around. I must admit that I was a huge skeptic about acupuncture, but after only one treatment I was a believer. I felt calm after my treatments and she has helped me improve my digestion and my asthma/allergy symptoms. It is evident that she loves what she does and I'm grateful to have her as my practitioner. Bridget, I am so appreciative of your yoga classes, your insights, your wisdom and the wonderful acupuncture treatments you have given me. You are a treasure. Can't recommend Bridget enough as an acupuncturist and Ayurveda therapist. She has helped me so much to achieve an optimum level of health with her consistent care and no nonsense approach to alternative medicine. She is extremely smart and well-informed as well as an incredible healer. She also takes insurance so you can make her a regular appointment on your health care schedule for acupuncture! Plus she is super funny and cool. Thanks Bridget for your care! Thank you for taking care of my body, listening to me and giving practical suggestions to reduce the stress in my life. "}
