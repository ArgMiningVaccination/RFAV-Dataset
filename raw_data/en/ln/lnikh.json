Ayurveda teaches us to cultivate a holistic balance in everything we do and developing a daily routine plays a key role in an Ayurvedic lifestyle. According to Ayurveda, a morning ritual is an important aspect of overall health, as it allows us to begin the day with a pure spirit and a positive frame of mind. The morning is also the perfect time to clear out toxins that build up overnight, to start the day feeling energized, joyous, and alert. 1. Rise and Shine with the Sun In Ayurveda, it is believed that waking before sunrise allows us to absorb the energy of the sun's rays when it is at its peak. No matter the tendencies of our dominant dosha, we can train ourselves to wake up with the sun to reap its energizing benefits. The element of sunshine is filled with positive energy and offers us the opportunity to begin the day with a lightness of spirit. Sunrise is the ideal time to practice a little pranayama (focused breathing). This invigorates the body, enhances clarity of mind, and soothes the spirit. Although pranayama is traditionally associated with yoga, we can also use it in alignment with mindful walking or meditation. 2. Cleanse the Body of Toxins Dry brushing and tongue scraping are exfoliation techniques, both of which can be of benefit in a healthy morning ritual. The method of dry brushing allows us to remove dead skin cells from the body, to promote the growth of new cells, which enhances the health and beauty of the skin. Dry brushing stimulates blood circulation and cleanses the lymphatic system. This simple self-care ritual requires a hard brush, which is used to sweep the body in circular motions, all the way from the toes to the top of the neck. Tongue scraping assists in cleansing bacteria and toxins from the tongue, which benefits the Agni (fire) of the digestive system for optimal holistic health. 3. Self-Massage Self-massage using dosha-specific oils is a wonderful addition to the morning health ritual and should be used directly after dry brushing the skin. This ensures that the cells are at their most receptive to the healing properties of the oils. The Ayurvedic term for massage is Abhyanga and is known to nourish the body, soothe the nerves, and strengthen the muscles. The warm oils should be massaged gently yet firmly into the body, with a little extra focus on the soles of the feet. Due to the number of nerve endings found in the soles of the feet, we can stimulate the life force energy through foot massage. When the massage is complete, it is the ideal time to take a shower or bath, visualizing any negative energy being washed away. 4. Routine Meal Times A major part of an Ayurvedic lifestyle is the practice of eating at the same time every day. The body and digestive system function best when they are fed on a routine schedule. To maintain a healthy biorhythm, Ayurveda advises eating breakfast between 06.00 and 08.00, lunch between 11.00 and 13.00, and dinner between 16.00 and 18.00. If a meal or meal-time is missed, it is best to eat lighter foods (such as fruits) to preserve the appetite for the scheduled meal-time. When meals are consumed at regular times, it balances the digestive fires for excellent health. No single meal is more important than another, and it is through maintaining a balance that we can achieve harmony of the body, mind, and soul. 5. Ayurvedic Bath In Ayurveda, bathing is an important cleansing ritual for the purification of the spirit. Ayurvedic baths use a combination of herbs and oils, unique to each individual dosha-type. Ayurveda teaches that warm water strengthens the body, while cool water is best suited to the head and face. An Ayurvedic bath can be used in place of a shower, directly after self-massage in the morning, or as part of the evening routine to promote a night of relaxing sleep. In the Ashtanga Hridayam (the root sacred text of Ayurveda) it is written that bathing lengthens the life span, uplifts the spirit, and improves emotional health. By including any one of these rituals into the daily routine, we can improve the balance of our unique dosha-compositions and work towards cultivating holistic health. The Ayurvedic way of life supports the prevention of disease, and it is of benefit to include as many of these ancient healing rituals as possible. It's best to begin with one method, and over time progress towards developing a fully Ayurvedic daily routine. The benefits of making minor lifestyle changes can result in a significant increase in vitality in the long run! By focusing on one ritual at a time, we can develop healthy Ayurvedic habits that last a lifetime. "}
