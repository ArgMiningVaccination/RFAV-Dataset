A person who is weak, unsteady on their feet, or confused is at high risk for falling. Someone who has these problems could fall when trying to get out of bed, using the toilet, taking a bath or shower, or walking. Your health care team can look for certain factors that could increase your risk of falling: Your health care team may have you work with a physical or occupational therapist and home health care to find different ways to lower your risk of falling. These specialists may also teach you certain exercises or how to use equipment (wheelchair, walker, cane) that can help with daily routines (transportation, preparing meals, shopping, or grooming). Strength training and coordination exercises, along with equipment to assist you, can all help improve your safety, balance, coordination, and strength. Managing cancer symptoms and other medical conditions may also be part of managing your balance problems and falls. Fatigue, confusion, and low blood counts are some common symptoms that occur with cancer and its treatment. These conditions may add to problems with balance and falling. Different medications can also affect these symptoms and your risk of falling. It's important that you review both your medication list and any new symptoms with your health care team regularly so they can adjust your medicines and treat symptoms as early as possible.
