At the end of February, I was determined to change as many things as I could about my life to get my health back. For me, it was imperative. I was tired of being fatigued from the moment I woke to the moment I went back to bed. I was tired of being bloated and uncomfortable. I was tired of the constant brain fog, mood swings and general discomfort in my own skin. In an effort to completely clean up my diet, lifestyle and home, I knew I needed to get the toxic cleaning ingredients out of my home. So, I reached out to [Branch Basics](http://branchbasics.refr.cc/sisters10) asking for more information on their products. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found: Branch Basics is a small business, founded by 3 women with an incredible story. Allison, Kelly and Marilee are on a mission to help families live a better life by choosing to have toxin-free cleaners do the work around the house. Their desire is to inspire families to make better decisions by understanding what is in their cleaning products and choosing a different way.

Purified Water, Coco Branch Basics Remove Germs? I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's) over 10 years ago and I know that my body is more susceptible to viruses. If my kids get a common cold for a few days, I could have it for a few weeks. If my kids get the flu for 1 week, I'll have it for 3-4 weeks. Removing germs is so important for our household and should be important for yours too. In April 2019, the [FDA issued a final ruling on the safety and effectiveness](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-final-rule-safety-and-effectiveness-consumer-hand-sanitizers) of hand sanitizers. The FDA found that the use of sanitizers have been shown to encourage the proliferation of superbugs. This means that by over-sanitizing our homes with disinfectants that were designed to kill bacteria and germs is actually causing them to mutate into stronger more dangerous germs. Since then, I have been on the hunt to find a non-toxic cleaner that was safe and effective at removing germs, not just killing them. Does Branch Basics have a Scent? Nope, not a scent at all. Matter of fact, a few weeks ago I was asking my daughter, Abigail what she thought the clean clothes we were moving from the washing machine to the dryer and her response was, \"It just smells like water...\".
