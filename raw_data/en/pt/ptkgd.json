Detoxing is trendy\u2014and not just at the turn of the new year! From juice cleanses to water fasting and supplement-based programs, there's certainly no shortage of cleanse and detox packages available. Alluring to people who're trying to lose weight, boost brain power, lower inflammation and fight hunger and cravings alike, these plans offer a jump-start to better health, weight loss and vitality. With a saturated marketplace and catchy advertising, it's hard to know which program to choose, when to embark on detox vs. cleanse, and why to choose one over the other. Highlights: - Offering a jumpstart to health, weight loss and vitality, cleanses and detoxes are alluring to people trying to lose weight, boost brain power, lower inflammation and fight cravings. - How do they differ? While both center on a diet of clean healthy foods, \"cleanses\" typically focus on digestive health, whereas \"detoxes\" are a systematic approach to toxin removal that leaves you feeling refreshed, restored and revitalized on a deep cellular level. - Nourished\u00ae offers an all-inclusive [One-Day Cleanse](https://nourished.com/nutrition-detox/one-day-soup-cleanse/)as well as a [Seasonal 3-Day Detox Program](https://nourished.com/nutrition-detox/3-day-detox-program/)that will help you maintain your health, weight and energy year-round.

Cleanses and detoxes are similar in that they both center on a diet of clean, healthy foods that are light and nutrient-dense. Although their outcome may be slightly different based on the protocol you choose, both promote for feeling \"better\" afterward, especially in regard to energy, cravings and bloating. Often used interchangeably, once you understand their differences, you'll see that cleanses and detoxes are separate entities, each with a unique purpose when it comes to total body health. A \"cleanse\" often describes a clean eating program that's loaded with real, wholesome and minimally-processed foods. While cleanses typically last a week or less, some may span an entire month, if not more. With a primary goal of giving the digestive system a much-needed rest, cleanses help fight bloating while supporting bowel regularity. They're also a great way to maintain health in between detoxes. Although there're many different programs on the market, Nourished\u00ae offers a [Nutritionist-developed One-Day Soup Cleanse](https://nourished.com/nutrition-detox/one-day-soup-cleanse/) that consists of eating the highest quality, organic veggie-loaded soups for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with homemade 100% pastured chicken bone broth in between. In comparison to juicing, \"souping\" is low in sugar and retains all elements of the produce, including the fiber, which makes them more filling. Plus, soups are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, are easily digested and blood sugar balancing, and provide nutrients that are easily absorbed and utilized by the body. Available for daily pickup, our One-Day Soup Cleanse can be done on a weekly basis, or even a couple days in a row to help reset and repair the digestive tract. A \"detox\" takes cleansing to the next level. A proper detoxification program will effectively take you through all three phases of liver detoxification - toxin release, neutralization and elimination. This ensures that harmful toxins, which naturally accumulate over time, are completely eliminated from the body. Detoxification essentially takes the trash out from your liver and kidneys, the primary channels of detoxification, to restore your body on a deep cellular level. A true detoxification program will last anywhere from a few days to a week. Afterward, you'll not only feel less bloated, but also restored and revitalized from the inside out. Aside from better mental clarity, hunger and cravings subside, hormones rebalance and energy soars. At Nourished\u00ae, we recommend detoxing four separate times per year, preferably at the start of each new season. This supports your body with the right foods, nutrients and rest needed to transition more seamlessly into spring, summer, fall and winter. Developed by our Nutritionist and Wellness Chefs, our [Seasonal 3-Day Detox Program](https://nourished.com/nutrition-detox/3-day-detox-program/) consists of soups, smoothies, veggies, salads, teas and tonics that are carefully designed to take you through all phases of liver detoxification.
