To update the Committee on work carried out by the ACMSF Working Group on Avian Influenza, which has considered the February 2007 outbreak of avian influenza (AI) in Suffolk and reviewed the current ACMSF risk assessment of acquir ing avian influenza through the food chain. Background 2. In December 2005 the ACMSF agr eed to establish a Working Group to carry forward conclusions reached by an expert Group of influenza virologists and epidemiologists fo llowing review of the 2003 ACMSF Risk Assessment, and to keep a wa tching brief on developments. In March 2006 the ACMSF Working Gr oup on avian influenza met to review the current ACMSF risk assessm ent of acquiring avian influenza (AI) through the food chain. Th e Group met again in May 2007 to review the recent AI outbreak in Su ffolk in detail and to consider the current ACMSF risk assessment of ac quiring AI through the food chain in light of any new information m ade available since the March 2006 review. 3. On 3 February 2007 the H5N1 strain of the avian influenza virus was confirmed on a turkey farm in Suffolk. As part of normal disease control measures restriction zones were set up surrounding the infected premises, all birds were culled and cleaning and disinfection was carried out. The Food Standards Agency advice, that avian flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers, remained unchanged. 4. Investigations into the source of the outbreak demonstrated that the virus isolates from Suffolk and re cent outbreaks in farmed geese in Hungary were very similar. This ra ised the prospect that the source of the outbreak in Suffolk might be a ssociated with the trade in poultry meat from Hungary, some of which was processed in the cutting plant adjacent to the farm. The Agency therefore led an in vestigation into whether illegal meat had entered t he UK from a restricted zone in Hungary. The investigation concl uded there was no evidence to suggest poultry meat had been import ed from an illegal source. The final epidemiological report published by Defra concluded that there is no proven source of the outbreak but the most plausible explanation 2remained that infection was introduced to the UK via the importation of turkey meat from Hungary. 5. At this meeting the Group co nsidered the issues surrounding the outbreak of AI in Suffolk in Februa ry 2007, including control measures that were put in place and investi gations into the source of the outbreak. The Group were also a sked to comment on a number of questions raised during the Agency's response to the outbreak: Survivability of the virus in poultry meat Distribution and titre of the virus in all edible, traded tissues of poultry Survivability of the virus in the food processing and handling environment Survival of the virus in dried egg white Risks associated with hunting pot entially infected game birds Testing poultry meat for the AI virus. Outcome In summary the Group concluded that: 6. Members were not aware of any new published scient ific evidence to suggest that the food chain had a role in the acquisition of AI in humans. However new or emerging scientific evidence and publications should be monitored and assessed as appropriate. 7. Initial investigations showed the Suffolk isolate to be identical to the Hungarian goose isolates. This wa s unusual so a full genomic sequence was carried out which indicated 99. 6% homology between the isolates which is within normal strain variabili ty. When viruses pass through a live animal, selection pressure will result in changes in the virus with greater variation than that seen between the Hungarian and Suffo lk strains. It is therefore very unlikely that the viru s could have been introduced to the turkey flock via a wild bird or other live poultry. 8. Further information on actions tak en in Hungary and conclusions of their epidemiological report may help in id entifying a source of the UK outbreak. Members also suggested that further environmental sampling of the processing plant, waste bins and se rological samples from staff in Suffolk may have aided investigations. 9. The Group concluded t hat there are still a num ber of gaps in current knowledge of H5N1 survival in poultr y meat, including the effects of pH changes after slaughter, the use of brin e, the effect of the scald tank during processing, virus distribution in different tissues and virus survival in the processing environment. Mem bers were informed that some of these issues are bei ng investigated as part of the VLA research programme. It was agreed that these fa ctors are likely to contribute to a small reduction in virus le vels in or on meat and t herefore add to the risk assessment that AI is a low risk to humans via the food chain. 3 10. Should another outbreak occur, it is unlikely that Defra will be able to enforce a long term ban on shooting wi thin restricted zones, therefore advice on handling game birds shot in restricted zones needs to be considered. Plucking and evisceration are high risk activities associated with human disease and members ex pressed concern about these activities continuing in restricted zones whilst an outbreak is ongoing. 11. During the recent outbreak the Agency decision not to recommend screening of poultry meat for AI wa s questioned. The Agency considered testing was inappropriate as this woul d not add to consumer protection or provide robust and reliable informati on on the presence or absence of the AI virus due to the limitations of microbiological testi ng. Members noted a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was available but, while this was validated for clinical samples, it had not been validated for use with poultry meat. Members supporte d the Agency's approach. 12. No further meetings are planned. However the Working Group will continue to monitor developments on avian influenza and will convene should an assessment of new information be required. Summary There was no new published scientific evidence to suggest that the food chain has a role in the acquisition of AI in humans. Although a number of questions have bee n identified as a result of the recent outbreak, it was agreed that t here was no fundam ental change to the risk assessment and the Februar y 2007 outbreak posed a low risk to humans via the food chain. There were adequate systems in plac e to protect consumers from the introduction of AI through the food chain. The Group highlighted the need for more information on international controls and identification of the sour ce of the virus. to hel p identify any gaps in the risk assessment.
