Formaldehyde, mercury, aluminum, bromide, MSG, 2-phenoxyethoanol, polysorbate 80, and more! These nasty things are among the most toxic known to man, and can be retained in the kidneys, spleen, liver, heart, brain, lymph nodes, and muscle if our body isn't metabolizing them or detoxing properly. The more you can metabolize and get rid of toxins, the less likely you or your child will be to suffer the unfortunate adverse effects from vaccinations. This is our attempt at getting the best of both worlds (medical and natural), and supporting your child in every situation as much as we possibly can! Pre-Vaccine Support Make sure the GI tract is healthy! Your child should be having healthy, regular bowel movements daily at least 14 days prior to any vaccine. If this is not the case, discuss your treatment options with a physician, or the Back In Line team. Nutrition We suggest the following supplements daily, two weeks before vaccinating, ask a physician for doses. Each of the following supplements can be purchased at Back In Line, if we don't have any in stock we will order some especially for you! Probiotics Good bacteria put into the gut, which helps to make your immune system stronger! 70-80% of our immune systems reside in these little gut bugs. We recommend physician-grade probiotics, such as Orthomolecular's Floraboost, which is powdered and easy for kids to take. Omega 3s Essential for brain function and detoxification; especially with MMR, DTaP, and Varicella vaccines (most prone to adverse effects). We recommend physician-grade Orthomega Pearls for kids. Vitamin A Research has shown that Vitamin A supplementation is effective at preventing and treating measles infections, as well as many other diseases. We suggest Vita-Kids Immune, a physician-grade liquid that also has elderberry herbs in it which stimulates the immune system and helpful filter cells. Vitamin D Vitamin D is the immune system king/queen. We have a tasteless, colorless, physician-grade liquid form from Orthomolecular labs that can be used for the whole family. Get Adjusted! Chiropractic adjustments boost the immune system, making sure the brain is able to talk to the rest of the body via the spinal cord. A higher functioning immune system prior to vaccinating will help the body better deal with infections and toxins. Affordable family packages are available for mom, dad, and siblings to all get their immune boost. Avoid processed food and junk food the week before vaccinations. The goal is to decrease the toxic blow as much as possible. If your child is breastfeeding, awesome\u2014Keep it going! Post-Vaccination Detox - Continue nutritional supplements (listed above) 2 weeks after vaccinating to keep the immune system strong. - Get adjusted! A vaccine contains toxins that can throw our nervous systems out of whack. Get back to proper function by getting checked by your Back In Line doctor the week following vaccination. - IR sauna Come sit in our infrared sauna at Back In Line. Mom, dad, and siblings, can sit in the sauna with vaccinated children or babies for no extra charge. We have protocols specifically for our precious pediatric patients. Sweating eliminates toxins and heavy metals. - Continue to avoid processed foods (and junk foods), for as long as possible after vaccinating! - Water If the child is an appropriate age for drinking water, make sure they are drinking enough. We detox heavily through our bowels, and we need to keep them moving! - Possible detoxification side effects Occasionally when your body is getting rid of garbage, you might feel a little garbage-y. It may not happen, but if it does, it may be normal. You might notice you or your children feeling nauseous, sleepy, grumpy, sweaty, or having loose stools. These are signs your body is doing its best to get the toxins out. Sometimes this is called a \"healing crisis.\" More commonly than not, this will not occur, but if it does, feel free to call our office "}
