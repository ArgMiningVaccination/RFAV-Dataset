I got my start in the late 1980s when I left Iowa for California to learn how to be a chef. For the next few years, I worked my way up the ladder from one four- or five-star restaurant to another. Young and star struck, one night I was at a Malibu party and I met Billy Idol, and was soon hired as his chef. It was one of my first big breaks. Later, I worked for a catering company that did a lot of work for the film industry. Soon I was cooking for Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and the guys in KISS. The best was actress Jane Seymour. She liked my cooking so well I transitioned to her house, where I cooked for her family. They were great. In 2008, I decided to return home to Iowa. I signed on with Hy-Vee and couldn't be happier. I often lie awake at night mulling over new dishes I want to create for you. It's appropriate that this is the Back to School issue because I often feel like a teacher at Hy-Vee. Five years ago, I teamed up with Katie Squires, our store health and wellness specialist, to set up the Healthy Cooking Club. Together we teach families how to make healthy meals that taste great. I also offer a line of Chef William's seasonings at Hy-Vee and appear in cooking segments on KWWL-TV in Waterloo. To encourage healthy eating, this issue of Hy-Vee Seasons magazine opens with \"Snack Attack,\" page 16, which includes seven nutritious recipes for kids that they'll love. Learn about local farmers and fresh produce in \"Farm to Table,\" page 62. We also have great recipes for grilling party foods, an in-depth look at training for amateur athletes and more. With the new school year just ahead, it's time to offer fresh tastes for your students to enjoy. Let all of us at Hy-Vee help.

Seven years ago, he returned to the Midwest and began his Hy-Vee career. 0C2-003_TOC_Letter2.indd 3 6/30/14 10:20 AMYOU ASKED ASK US IT'S BACK- TO-SCHOOL SEASON, WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO FOR BAGGED LUNCHES, AFTER- SCHOOL SNACKS & SCHOOL- NIGHT DINNER MENUS.A: Cheese is a great option for healthy snacking. I'm fortunate to live in a college town where young people know the health benefits of cheese. For them I cut smaller wedges that are affordable.

VISIT YOUR HY-VEE FOR SOME OF THE FRESHEST LOCALLY GROWN CORN. PHOTOS Tobin BennettIN SEASON WHITE OR YELLOW? You can't judge sweetness by color. That's because sweet-tasting corn comes in yellow, white or bicolor. If you want to know which variety you're buying, ask a Hy-Vee produce expert. Be prepared to try different kinds each time because they change frequently. SELECT Hy-Vee offers the freshest sweetest farm-to- table corn. Look for the \"homegrown\" sign in your Hy-Vee Produce Department. The best ears are snugly wrapped in vibrant green husks that aren't dried out. When you run your fingers along an ear, you should feel plump, densely packed kernels all the way to the tip. STORE Shuck the corn just before you're ready to cook it. If you're not going to eat the corn right away, keep the ears in their husks to retain moisture. Place them in a plastic bag in a crisper drawer of your refrigerator.

Hy-Vee dietitians can help. You'll nd these specialists in nearly every store. Two award-winning dietitians answer questions and share their insights. AT YOUR SERVICE PHOTOS Tobin Bennett SEASONS | Back to School 2014 10 010-011_OurBest.indd 10 6/27/14 7:05 PMLong before it became trendy for supermarkets to hire nutrition experts, Hy-Vee placed registered dietitians in its stores to help customers. How can these specialists help you? A pair of award-winning Hy-Vee dietitians have the answers. Dawn Blocklinger works at Hy-Vee in Moline, Illinois, and has earned the awards Young Dietitian of the Year for Chicago and Outstanding Dietitian of the Year for Illinois. The U.S. Army presented her with an award for educating soldiers about nutrition prior to their deployment overseas in 2010. Katie Wilhelmi works at the Hy-Vee store in New Ulm, Minnesota, and at the nearby store in Windom. She received a Best of the Best Award from Hy-Vee and was named Minnesota Young Dietitian of the Year. Q: WHY DOES HY-VEE HAVE DIETITIANS IN ITS STORES? A: Dawn: The company was founded by Mr. Hyde and Mr. Vredenburg\u2014Hy and V\u2014and Mr. Hyde had a son diagnosed with type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes. Unfortunately, the boy died at the age of eight. Out of that experience came a serious discussion about how a grocery store might be equipped to give customers guidance in diet and nutrition. Katie : Doesn't it make sense? We're right where the food is. We can look at food labels with someone there in the aisles and show them what they are eating and how they can easily make better choices. Q: WHAT PROBLEMS DO YOU ADDRESS MOST FREQUENTLY? A: Dawn: I have a huge medical community near me. I think there are 12 gastroenterologists around us, so I see a lot of celiac disease cases. Someone will come in and say, \"I need your help. I have to go gluten-free.\" I also get a lot of questions from customers about lowering salt intake. We come up with other fl avors, spices and mixtures that are salt-free\u2014herb blends, spice blends, marinades and chili mixes. These keep the food from becoming too bland. Katie: One of the most popular questions I receive is about arti cial sweeteners and sugar. I created a talk on sugars and what's in popular drinks. I often present that information in an informal way to customers when I'm working in the aisles. Q: HOW DO YOU ENGAGE WITH CUSTOMERS AS THEY SHOP?A: Dawn: I see customers stalled out in front of a shelf, reading labels or just staring like the answer is going to jump out at them. I introduce myself as a Hy-Vee dietitian and ask if I can help. Most often, it's a label question. Many of these customers have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and they're looking for foods with no carbohydrates. So I teach them about how to make the adjustments needed in their diets. Katie: I like giving store tours. Usually when we start the tour, people are a little apprehensive because they think we're just doing this to get them to buy new products. But then they see they're actually learning, they appreciate it. A large part of a tour is label reading. This really helps customers who are trying to improve the quality of what they are buying because we can go into the aisles and look at speci c categories, comparing the labels. It's easy for them to see, 'Oh, this one has way more ber.' When we're done, they're always glad they took the tour. Dawn Blocklinger, Hy-Vee Registered Dietitian, Moline #2, Illinois Turn to Hy-Vee dietitians when you need expert advice about nutrition. Here are some of the key services they offer.Store tours.

A couple of spoonfuls of brilliant peach jam infuses Greek yogurt with sweetness.Sweet , irresistible jams and jellies can ll your pantry shelf in a summer afternoon and keep you smiling all winter. Whether you're a canning pro or just starting out, homemade jellied spreads are a terric way to preserve gorgeous summer fruits. But the real advantage of home canning is that you control the quality of ingredients that go into every jar. Choose fresh fruit grown as close to home as possible. Your Hy-Vee store works closely with local farmers to deliver an abundance of peak-season fruits and vegetables that ll \"homegrown\" sections. When you support local farmers, you'll be preserving local agriculture, too. Once you gather the ripe fruits, follow these tips to make your jams and jellies turn out perfectly. *Choose a large kettle or Dutch oven to allow for vigorous boiling. *Follow the jam or jelly recipe instructions exactly. Use liquid pectin as specied. Add pectin gels to fruit mixtures quickly to speed up the jam-making process. *When making a larger quantity of jam or jelly, do not try to double quantities. Prepare the recipe two or more times. *Use sterilized canning jars with two-piece lids. You can reuse jars and bands that are not chipped or dented, but always use new lids (the flat metal disk with the rubberized flange). Prepare jars rst; keep them warm while cooking the jam or jelly. *Process jars of jellied products in a boiling-water canner to prevent mold growth.

Skewers, sliders and melty Brie creations o er amazing mouthfuls of fl avor in every tantalizing bite. Simple techniques add big spice to small bites, whether you marinate steak strips for an Asian steak roll or light up your crowd with pepper poppers that combine highly seasoned chorizo and crunchy chips. Wrap pineapple, shrimp, sweet potato fries or even dates in crispy, smoky bacon for exceptional party treats. Grilling on a wood plank adds sweet, smoky fl avors to everyone's favorite party cheese, Brie. Be sure to savor the rind. It enhances the character of the cheese and contrasts deliciously with the creamy portion of the Brie and the sweet or savory toppers. This cheese goes well with fruit, chopped garlic and fresh herbs such as rosemary and thyme. Another secret for creating bites that pack a punch is pairing unexpected fl avors. Stir feta cheese into a berry-and-kiwi salsa and serve it on grilled watermelon slices. This sweet- and-sassy treat takes a simple summer favorite to a new level. For the most fl avorful Brussels sprouts ever, sear them on a grill. After a brief grilling, the delicate leaves blister and caramelize, yet the little cabbages stay rm. Skewer sprouts between salty prosciutto and sweet dates for bursts of fl avor in every bite.

Its outer rind is meant to be eaten; it enhances the nutty, earthy fl avor and character of the cheese. Plank grilling adds a kiss of smokiness while the cheese turns soft, warm and melty. Prep: 15 minutes | Soak: 30 minutes | Grill: 15 to 21 minutes Serves 8 (2 toasts each) 1 cedar plank 1 loaf baguette-style French bread \u00bc cup Hy-Vee Select Extra-Virgin Olive Oil 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme2 cloves garlic, minced \u00bd cup apricot preserves 1 (8-ounce) wheel Brie cheese, at room temperature1 peach, pitted and sliced1 plum, pitted and sliced \u00bc teaspoon sea salt \u00bc teaspoon Hy-Vee black pepper Fresh thyme sprigs, optional 1. Soak cedar plank in water for at least 30 minutes. 2. Slice baguette diagonally into sixteen \u00bc-inch slices. Reserve any remaining baguette for another use. For herb oil, in a small bowl combine olive oil, chopped thyme and garlic; set aside. In a small saucepan, heat preserves until melted; cover and keep warm.3. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Place plank on grill. Cover grill and preheat plank for about 5 minutes, turning once. (Preheating the plank allows it to begin releasing smoke and fl avor.) Place Brie on preheated plank. Brush with some of the melted preserves. Arrange peach and plum slices on grill grate around plank. Cover and grill for 2 to 3 minutes or until fruit slices are slightly charred, turning once. Arrange some of fruit on top of Brie. Place remaining fruit slices on plank. Brush remaining melted preserves on fruit. Cover and grill for 10 to 15 minutes more or until Brie is melted.

TOASTS BRIE WITH PEACHES, FRESH THYME & GARLIC hy-vee.com 43 042-049_Small_Bites_Big_Flavor_Final.indd 43 6/27/14 8:29 PMOoey-gooey melty cheese along with an array of fresh toppers sets these grilled party-style sliders apart. When you grill the mini patties for these delicious combos, be sure not to squeeze them with a turner as they grill. Compressing them causes the juices to ooze out, leaving you with dry burgers. Top each burger with one of the following fl avorful combos. CHIPOTLE CHEDDAR CHEESE + AVOCADO SLICES + RED ONION SLICES A slice of chipotle cheddar cheese is a sure way to spice up your everyday burger, especially a pork burger. Pair the rm, smoky cheese with Monterey Jack, a milder cheese that melts so creamily. Buttery avocado slices add a divine richness while red onion slices add a nice astringency, balancing out the fl avors. BABY SWISS + TOMATO SLICES + BABY SPINACH LEAVES On a beef burger, Swiss cheese becomes the perfect blend of soft and creamy, gooey and stretchy. Or try Emmentaler and Gruy\u00e8re, also in this family of cheeses, which have amazing tastes and great melting properties. Top the burger with tomato slices and leafy greens such as spinach or arugula for a burst of freshness.MUENSTER + ROASTED BELL PEPPERS + BACON SLICES If you prefer a mild cheese with excellent melting qualities, try a slice of Muenster cheese. Bacon slices and jarred roasted bell peppers or balsamic saut\u00e9ed onions help balance the richness of the cheese. GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS: When using charcoal, grill Hy-Vee gourmet sliders directly over medium coals for 14 to 18 minutes or until done (160\u00b0F), turning once halfway through grilling. Or for a gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Place patties on grill rack over heat. Cover and grill as directed.

THE POT OF GOLD IS A HEALTHIER YOU!FUEL UP1How your body performs depends on what you eat. Food is fuel. Fill a car with bad gas, and it will run roughly. Your body is no dierent. Processed, sugar-laden foods can't provide the quality energy you get from nutrients found in whole foods. Make good food choices and your body will reward you with energy and good health. SEASONS | Back to School 2014 54 052-059_Get In the Race_V2.indd 54 6/27/14 8:36 PMEAT FOR ENERGY. The energy your body needs comes from three macronutrients: lean proteins, carbohydrates and good fats. Combining whole foods rich in these macronutrients, such as those shown below, is the key to a strong athletic performance. Need help with nutrition? See a Hy-Vee dietitian for advice. WHOLE GRAINS: Not all carbs are created equal. Rened carbs, those found in processed foods, can leave you feeling flat. Instead, go for whole grain breads or pastas, which provide more ber and nutrition. SWEET POTATOES : When prepared in healthy ways, these tubers act as slow-burning carbs. Roasted or mashed, they oer the perfect recipe for lasting energy, leveling blood sugar and an in-check appetite. SALMON: Although salmon is a tasty source of protein \u2014essential for building muscle \u2014its benets dive much deeper. Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, this superfood is good for the heart, brain and body. LEAFY GREENS: Popeye gets points for knowing a good source of strength. Spinach and other leafy greens combine iron, vitamins and ber to ll you up with the fuel you need. The darker the greens, the greater the benet.

FLOSS EVERY DAY. You probably hear it from your dentist twice a year, but studies show that giving your gums a once over each day is good for your heart as well as your mouth.2. STRETCH. Flexibility is crucial to staying injury-free when you work out. However, a lack of everyday movement also causes you to tense up. 3. FILL UP ON FIBER. Found in fruits, veggies, legumes and whole grains, dietary ber promotes heart health, keeps weight on target, curbs hunger and makes your belly feel better.4. BREATHE DEEPLY . If you breathe from your chest instead of your belly, you're missing out. Belly breathing increases the amount of oxygen in your cells, which lowers stress levels and improves concentration. 5. ADOPT A MEATLESS MONDAY . According to a Harvard University study, replacing red meat just once a week with another protein reduces your risk of heart disease by up to 19 percent.6. LAUGH MORE. It's no joke; laughing decreases stress and reduces blood pressure. Need some comic relief? Hang out with funny friends, see a comedian or crack up over your own mishaps.7. 'TIS THE SEASON. While it may seem obvious, fresh food is most nutritious when it's in season. Eat seasonal produce at peak ripeness and your body and taste buds both benet. 8. MUSCLE UP. Muscle burns calories more eciently and also keeps you protected from injury as you age.9. BUILD YOUR BONES. Get enough vitamin D and calcium, but don't stop there. Bones need plenty of weight-bearing exercise to maintain their strength and density for a lifetime. Walk, lift weights, garden or play a sport. 10. JUST BE. Relaxing may seem impossible thanks to the inner dialogue in your mind. Start meditating 5 to 10 minutes each day, focusing on your breathing and letting your thoughts drift. 052-059_Get In the Race_V2.indd 56 6/27/14 8:37 PMEvery day can feel like a race when you look at your ever-growing to-do list.

Exercise leads to tiny tears in muscle fibers, and through recovery the muscle gains strength as it heals. While mending, use the following tips to boost how you feel as you improve your physical and mental fitness. REFUEL: Within 30 minutes after moderate to vigorous exercise, your body is depleted and turns to your muscles for energy. Your muscles need nutrients, so take in a small serving of simple carbs, such as chocolate milk, cherry juice, bananas or pomegranate seeds.KNEAD: The solution to soothing sore muscles lies in upping blood flow and circulation to soft tissues. Massage helps, but you can also stretch your way to relief. Exercise bands and balls, foam rollers and yoga blocks aid in recovery when paired with your body weight. HYDRATE: Up to 60 percent of the body is water, which is necessary for metabolism, energy conversion, digestion and more. Staying hydrated maintains your health, rids toxins from the body, keeps joints lubricated and reduces muscle cramps. REST: You may think of sleep as downtime, but it's when your body goes into overdrive, healing muscles, balancing hormone levels and giving your brain a break. You do lose if you don't snooze, so sneak in the recommended 7 to 9 hours of daily ZZZs. DID YOU K NOW? SEVENTY-FIVE PE RCENT OF AMERIC ANS ARE CHRONICA LLY DEHY DRATE D.

Getting enough sleep is also a factor in whether you will hit your times or fall behind. Just because sleep is a state of reduced consciousness that doesn't mean our brain and body are inactive. Research shows that the brain is highly active during sleep. As brain activity changes during sleep, it works in more regular and synchronized patterns. During sleep, breathing, temperature, blood sugar, blood pressure and heart rate all slow down. This lets your heart rest. Whether you're an established athlete or a teenager competing just for the fun of it, here are a few things to keep in mind about sleep. As you sleep, new pathways are forming in your brain, which helps with learning and remembering information. This helps you make better decisions\u2014\"I have to stretch more during warm-ups\"\u2014and spurs creativity\u2014\"Kick...now!\" Sleep helps control metabolism and how your body processes sugars to keep your energy level up. The last thing you want when racing is to slump for lack of sleep. Lack of sleep alters the immune system's ability to ght infections, boost muscle mass and repair cells and tissues. Lack of sleep contributes to being less alert, which can be dangerous when training or competing. Athletes experience more injury when they lack sleep, according to a Stanford University study. Ironically, sleep disorders are an indication that athletes are training too hard and/or sleeping too little. GET YOUR REST PUT SLEEP HI GH ON YOUR LIS T OF REQUIREMENT S FOR W INNING .

PHARMACY 101 HY-VEE GETS AN \"A\" FOR PHARMACY SERVICES In their college years, students start managing their own lives, including taking care of their medical prescriptions. Fortunately, Hy-Vee pharmacists and pharmacy support staffs are ready to help. \"I have a daughter who is away at college in Columbia, Missouri, so I fully understand what families go through concerning prescriptions and college students,\" says Jennifer Valentine, pharmacy manager for nine years at the Hy-Vee in Independence, Missouri. With the help of pharmacists like Jennifer, transferring a prescription is simple. If you are attending a college in a city with a Hy-Vee store, ask your hometown Hy-Vee Pharmacy to transfer your records to a different Hy-Vee Pharmacy. Whether it's a new prescription or a refill, the medication will be supplied by the new store as efficiently as by the hometown Hy-Vee. If no Hy-Vee store is located in the college town or city, students need only provide their hometown Hy-Vee pharmacy with the name of a pharmacy in the college town. Records will be transferred to this other pharmacy. For uninterrupted service, it's best for college-bound students to make these arrangements before leaving home. \"My own college daughter simply transfers her prescriptions back and forth so they are always available, whether she is here or there,\" Jennifer says. QUICK PRESCRIPTION REFILLS The clock says it's way past pharmacy business hours, but you need a prescription refilled and need to check on the status of another. What to do? Order refills and check status of all orders using a Hy-Vee app on your smartphone or go to the pharmacy page at www.hy-vee.com. The app and website also allow you to search for local Hy-Vee pharmacies and scan a list of generic medications available for $4 for a 30-day supply. If you use the online service, Hy-Vee offers two ways to manage your online account.

Create a My Hy-Vee account, and you can fulll all the Express services plus submit multiple prescriptions, check your Hy-Vee Pharmacy history or print out a list of your previous prescriptions and costs.

These are the freshest, most fl avorful fruits and vegetables you can nd. Each of these foods comes from farmers within easy driving distance of a Hy-Vee store. These crops may be literally picked in the morning, delivered in the afternoon and be on your table by dinnertime. Some of the relationships between these farmers and Hy-Vee go back more than 20 years. These producers include such farmers as Joe Pedersen, page 67, who supplies sweet corn and squash to three northern Iowa stores. Or family farms like Williams Produce, page 68, which delivers seasonal vegetables to stores within 100 miles of the southern Minnesota farm. There are also growers who extend the season by raising crops in greenhouses, as does Marv Fritz, page 65, who delivers Nebraska-grown tomatoes year-round. Customers taste the advantage of Homegrown produce. \"We can grow varieties that taste great but don't ship well, and get them to the store at their fl avor peaks,\" says Kerry Williams, a fourth-generation farmer. The \"homegrown\" program also bene ts communities by creating farm jobs and boosting local economies. On the following pages, three Hy-Vee chefs pair with local farmers to create farm-fresh recipes you're going to love.

Now he delivers fresh Nebraska-grown tomatoes 11 months of the year directly to Hy-Vee stores. Grown under glass, his tomatoes are pesticide- and herbicide-free and ripen naturally. The Flavorino Mini Romas have proven so popular he can't keep up with demand. Trucks are the secret to maintaining the great taste of Marv's produce. Tomatoes don't like the cool air preferred by most veggies. Chill tomatoes below 52\u00b0F and they turn mealy. Marv avoids this by delivering to stores in his own trucks. \"We keep our tomatoes at about 60\u00b0F, the ideal temperature.\" Iowa City Hy-Vee chef Tracy Tonning is an enthusiastic supporter. \"If that tomato is coming directly out of the greenhouse to the store, it's going to be a great product,\" he says. Marv farms in O'Neill, Nebraska. He has 24 acres under glass, 90 full-time sta and 30 summer part-timers, and delivers fresh tomatoes to 31 Nebraska Hy-Vee stores. Though he still manages the greenhouses, he sold the farm recently to Huron Produce, which labels the tomatoes \"Suntastic.\" Marv's tomato selection tip: Never put tomatoes in the fridge.

By 10 a.m., he's already delivering fresh-picked corn to three Iowa Hy-Vee stores. \"We always pick in the morning when the corn is coolest and freshest,\" says Joe. \"We sort it, bag it and cover it with wet burlap to keep everything cool.\" Once sweet corn is picked, it's a race to get it on tables before sugars turn to starch. Keeping it cool slows the change. Joe delivers corn every other day. \"The freshness is the big bene t,\" says chef Dale Miller of the Hy-vee in Newton, Iowa. \"It's coming right o the farm!\" A retired agriculture education teacher, Joe grows 15 acres of sweet corn, 2 acres of winter squash and 100 tomato plants at his farm in Laurens, Iowa. He's been supplying Hy-Vee stores for 10 years. Joe's corn selection tip: \"Look for bright green ears, and eat it the day you buy it.\" For chef Dale's recipe for \"Peach-Blueberry Galette with Basil Cream,\" see page 71. Farms from throughout the Midwest supply \"homegrown \" corn to Hy-Vee stores. Most of this corn doesn't even cross a state line to get to your table. It 's delivered at the peak of freshness. \"I like to grill them for a few minutes with husks off, seasoned, \" says Hy-Vee chef Dale Miller of Newton, Iowa. \"Maybe I'll make up some butter with fresh basil and shallots in it. \" You 'll nd instructions for making such butters as Lime-Tarragon, Herb, Chipotle and Honey Spice by clicking on \"Recipes \" at www.hy-vee.com/ meal-solutions QUICK GRILLED CORN Prepare charcoal or gas grill for direct heating over medium heat.

On their 45 acres, the family grows muskmelon, watermelon, squash, pumpkin, sweet corn, peppers, cucumbers, onions and potatoes. The Williams family delivers to Hy-Vee stores several times a week from July through Christmas, hiring 20 seasonal workers to get the job done. The three Williams kids also work in the business.

Add mascarpone and whisk until medium peaks form. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 2 hours.2. To make the oven-fried basil: Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F . Brush both sides of basil with vegetable oil and place on parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with sugar and bake for 5 minutes. Cool completely. 3. To make the dough: Pulse fl our, salt and sugar in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until mixture forms coarse crumbs. Add ice water and pulse until just combined (dough will still be crumbly). Shape dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight).4. Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F . On a fl oured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch round; transfer to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.5. To make the galette: In a small skillet, simmer wine over medium heat until it has reduced by half, about 10 to 15 minutes. Toss the peaches in cornstarch until lightly coated. Add the peaches and sugar to the skillet and saut\u00e9 about 3 to 4 minutes, or until syrup has thickened and peaches are just soft. Add the blueberries and toss to coat in the peach mixture. Remove from heat and add the vanilla. Pour the mixture into the center of the dough. Gently fold the edge of the dough over the peach and berry mixture. Refrigerate for 15 minutes.6. Whisk egg with 2 teaspoons water to make egg wash. Brush dough with egg wash and dust with sugar, if desired. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until lightly browned. Allow to sit and cool slightly before serving. Top with basil cream and garnish with fried basil.

Among the wheels and wedges, you'll find lots of crazy-good flavors lurking in the Hy-Vee Deli cheese display. Kay Murray, cheese specialist at Hy-Vee #2 in Ankeny, Iowa, says tasting a new cheese is the best way to learn about it. So be sure to ask for a sample of any cheese you are considering. Your Hy-Vee Deli cheese specialist can tell you all you need to know about any cheese, give you samples and recommend food and beverage pairings. Kay recommends taking cheese out of the refrigerator about an hour before serving to allow the aroma and flavor to fully develop. Here are some specialty cheeses you'll find at the Hy-Vee Deli. Serving and beverage suggestions accompany each description. 1 . vintage gouda Its rich flavor with pronounced butterscotch notes cuts through the sweet acidity of apples and grapes. Wine: Cabernet Sauvignon.2. naked goat This semihard Spanish goat cheese is mild and creamy with a tangy, sweet finish. For a cheese plate, pair it with fig jam and almonds.

EDUCATORS ARE MAKING A NATIONAL STEM PUSH, WHICH EQUIPS STUDENTS TO DESIGN AND BUILD SUCH IMAGINATIVE PROJECTS AS A BALL-SHOOTING ROBOT. WORDS Steve Cooper PHOT OS Tobin Bennett SEASONS | Back to School 2014 74 074-075 STEM.indd 74 6/27/14 8:46 PMA Brighter Future ith thousands of fans cheering them on, members of the Swartdogs robotics team from Cedar Falls High School in Iowa watched anxiously as their robot maneuvered down the court toward the goal. It was joined by robots built by two rival teams. Would a robot score? The national competition was part of the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Championships held last April in a St. Louis arena. The object was simple: Put a large ball in a basket. If a single robot scored, its team earned 10 points. If two robots made a basket by cooperating, that was worth 20 points. A whopping 40 points went to teams when all three robots worked together to make the shot. As much as Cedar Falls senior Eric Cheng wanted to score the most points possible, he had an even bigger goal. \"For me, it's all about getting the experience of helping to design and build our robot.\" This was Eric's second season with the Swartdogs, named after Cedar Falls physics teacher Kenton Swartley. When Eric rst joined, he had an interest in science and technology. Today he is passionate about science and will continue to pursue that passion next year as a student at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Being involved with this program has de nitely made an impact in my life. I'll have a double major in computer science and engineering at Berkeley,\" he says. The robotics team is just one small part of a program called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). STEM encourages interest in the sciences by giving hands-on experiences to students in kindergarten through high school. Teachers such as Swartley offer their students practical experience with applied sciences year after year. But STEM grants from federal, state and local school district sources bring more funds to the table, making it possible to ll an arena with 20,000 screaming fans\u2014many of them student participants\u2014for national and international competitions such as the FIRST Championships. \"We have a system where there's excitement if one football player from a school makes it into the pros every 10 years,\" Swartley says. \"But I can tell my students quite honestly that if they apply themselves, all of them can go pro with the skills they start learning in their classes.\" One of Swartley's students, senior Colin McIntyre, discovered his teacher is right. \"I'd never written any computer programming until I joined the team. Then I found out how much I like doing it, and I'll be going to Iowa State next year to study computer engineering. You certainly can say that being on the team has helped me. Absolutely!\"In the end, the Swartdogs may not have won the robot championships in St. Louis, but all had achieved their goals of learning and discovering a eld they are passionate about. SCIENTISTS IN THE MAKING Students in kindergarten through high school across the country get hands-on experience with science thanks to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programs. In Iowa, $5.2 million was appropriated to fund the Governor's STEM Advisory Council for the 2014-2015 school year. This amount whetted lots of STEM appetites, yet still fell short of meeting demand from schools and clubs across the state. STEM education is supported by Hy-Vee, says vice president Pat Hensley, who oversees Hy-Vee's governmental a airs. \"These are the types of programs we want to support because they help the entire community. Hy-Vee has an interest in seeing education advance in all the states that we serve.\" Here are a few STEM programs: KIDWIND. Kids in grades 3 to 12 learn about the basics of electricity and wind energy and conduct their own experiments. PINT-SIZE SCIENCE. Science centers give young children hands-on experience with plant life, health topics, weather and more. PROJECT LEAD THE WAY. Students in grades 6 to 12 discover the principles of engineering, computer science, biomedical science and much more. WORLD IN MOTION. Kindergarten to 8th grade students discover the principles of motion. STEM JOBS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ESTIMATES THAT JOBS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH (STEM) WILL GROW 17 PERCENT BY 2018\u2014NEARLY DOUBLE THE GROWTH FOR NON-STEM FIELDS.
