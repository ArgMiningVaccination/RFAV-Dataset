Children, teens, and adults suffering from frustrating, complex illnesses depend on Kenneth A. Bock, M.D., and his Nurse Practitioner, Jennifer Petkos, FNP-BC, for proper diagnosis and treatment of their chronic medical conditions. Board-certified in Family Medicine, Dr. Bock has over 35 years of experience combining his expertise in evidence-based clinical medicine with his passion for solving intricate problems to address medical issues that are difficult to diagnose and treat. As a physician with expertise in autoimmune disease, we know how frustrating it can be when you or your child are experiencing ongoing symptoms of an illness that doctors have not been able to treat effectively. That's why our caring team of medical experts dedicates themselves to figuring out the cause of your complex chronic medical disorder and developing an individualized treatment plan that can help restore normalcy to your life. Root Cause Analysis At Bock Integrative Medicine, our medical experts employ a root-cause strategy, exposing the layers of imbalance, inflammation and infection to discover the real source of your symptoms. We take a functional approach to diagnosis and evidence-based treatment, carefully considering each patient's lifestyle and background to identify possible genetic and environmental causes of illness. We seek to safely improve the health of our chronically ill patients by developing practical, research-supported treatment programs personalized to each individual's unique condition and contributing factors. Integrative medicine is an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and healing that considers all of a patient's lifestyle factors and employs traditional as well as more comprehensive treatment methods. As practitioners with expertise in adult and pediatric integrative medicine, the board-certified providers at Bock Integrative look for sources of imbalance that are causing physical reactions, like inflammation or oxidative stress, and seek to address these problems using the most appropriate individualized immune, hormonal, nutritional, metabolic, psychosocial and antimicrobial therapies. Dr. Bock and his staff are experts in the diagnosis and treatment of multi-symptom, multisystem disorders, including Lyme disease and co-infections, autoimmune disease, PANS and PANDAS (ITABI), Autism and co-occurring conditions, and: Evidence-based Diagnosis and Personalized Treatment Plans With over three decades of experience in the diagnosis and treatment of complex medical disorders, Dr. Bock has a wealth of knowledge from which to draw when determining cause and effect of chronic illnesses. He recognizes that the combination of factors that can contribute to any chronic medical condition differs for each person and uses integrative/functional medicine to diagnose and treat these often-frustrating illnesses in children, teens and adults. Rather than only trying to manage your symptoms, he takes a comprehensive \"whole person\" approach to evaluate everything you are exposed to, and their effects. Dr. Bock then incorporates validated lab results and decades of diagnostic experience to develop an evidence-based diagnosis on which to base a highly personalized treatment regimen. Our research-supported treatment plans typically involve individualized combination therapy that may include IV immune modulators (such as IVIG), vitamin and mineral therapy, herbal therapy, chelation therapy, and dietary modifications, as well as antibiotics and other medications as needed to treat acute problems, including infection. With any treatment plan, safety is our top priority. When we prescribe pharmaceuticals, we are careful to use supplements, herbs and nutritional support to protect the liver and gut. We move forward with caution when implementing any treatment plan, using an iterative process to evaluate results often and make adjustments as needed. The highly trained, licensed medical professionals at Bock Integrative have accumulated over 45 years of combined experience tackling complex medical problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat. We don't just treat symptoms; we put decades of diagnostic expertise to work for you, untangling the interwoven complexities of your chronic condition to determine the true cause of your illness. Dr. Bock and Jennifer Petkos, FNP-BC, use the latest medical science and technology to design an evidence-based clinical treatment regimen highly personalized to the needs of each of their patients. Their individualized combination therapy treatments are supported by research, translated to the clinical situation and applied clinically. When the use of medications is necessary to treat acute infection, they are careful to combine pharmaceutical regimens with supplements, herbs, and dietary modification to protect the liver and GI tract. Safety is our first concern when starting any treatment plan. As such, we continually assess a patient's response to treatment and make individualized adjustments as needed. The caring medical experts at Bock Integrative want to help eliminate the anxiety and frustration a patient and their family feel when faced with a laundry list of symptoms and no clear diagnosis or treatment plan.
