Studies from other animal models ar e used as surrogates for humans. Based on primate models, the inhalation median infectious dose (ID 50) in humans is likely less than 10,000 PFU, and possibly less than 1,000 PFU. We need to know the infectious dose for human s by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ...................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans (R 0 = 2.2 - 3.1), through close contact and aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible173, 617 but rare.592 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others while asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic. Most transmission events occur in the home, but outbreaks can occur in any crowded setting, particularly indoors. Rates of transmission on public transport are unclear but appear low. The role of children in disease transmission is not well -understood, but pediatric cases in the US are increasing.9 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported.686 Individuals who have recovered clinically, b ut test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19.307 We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). Host Range - How man y species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ......................................................... 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.361, 371, 373 Current evidence suggests a direct jump fr om bats to humans is plausible.69 SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans. To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, deer mice, raccoon dogs, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS - CoV-2 infection. We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? .......................... 6 On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop sy mptoms but can still transmit disease. The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. Individuals can shed virus for several we eks, though it is not necessarily infectious. We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? ................................................................... 7 Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.4 Older individu als and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men. Fever is most often the first symptom. Between 16% and 58% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection.83, 342, 348, 426, 447, 460, 584, 600 The case fatality rate is unknown, but individuals >60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.591, 699 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.430 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,160 though generally show milder112, 385 or no symptoms. We need to know the true case fatality rate, as well as the duration and prevalence of debilitating symptoms that inhibit an individual's ability to function. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ........................................ 9 Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown. Reinfection is possible. The longevity of antibody re sponses and T -cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several months. Immune responses appear to differ by sex, and may contribute to differences in symptom severity. Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible, but the frequency of reinfection is unknown. The strength and duration of any immunity after initial COVID -19 infection is unknown.26, 642 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.84, 663 The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown. We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEAR ED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? ...................10 Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Con firmed cases are still underreported.257 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. We need to identify additional factors tha t affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based diagnostic tests. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? ...........................................................................................................11 Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care,237, 405 and no single standard of care exists. Drug trials are ongoing. Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration55 and mortality220 in humans. Hydroxychloroquine is associated with risk of cardiac arrhythmias and provides limited to no clinical benefit.192 Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilate d patients. Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and appears to be effective when administered early, though evidence is mixed. Anticoagulants may reduce COVID -19 mortality in hospitalized patients Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated, but results from large clinical trials are needed. We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in p atients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ................................................................................................................................. 12 Work is ongoing to develop and produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine (e.g., Operation Warp Speed).52, 244, 250- 252, 445 Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger Phase III trials are completed. We need published results from Phase I -III trials in humans to assess vaccine efficacy and safety, and length of immunity. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions - Are public health control measures e ffective at reducing spread? ................................. 13 Broad -scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously. Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.198 Research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Testing most symptomatic individuals is critical, and synchronized interventions may help. Robust contact tracing can be effective but can also be overwhelmed. We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .........................................................................14 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on surf aces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours as an aerosol but is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) believes that it is highly unlikely that ingestion of SARS -CoV-2 will result in illness; there is no documented evidence that food, food packaging, or food handling is a significant source o f COVID -19 infections.282 We need to quantify the duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? ..........................................................15 Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectant s are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators.452 Heat is effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2. We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .......................................................................................................16 The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. ................................................................................17 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? ..................................................................................18 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. At least one mutation has been associated with greater viral transmission, but virulence appears unchanged. Associations between human blood type and COVID -19 severity are unclear. We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients. Forecasting - What forecasting models and methods e xist? ............................................................................................... 19 We need to know how different forecasting methods have fared when compared to real data, and develop an understanding of which model features contribute most to accurate and inaccurate forec asts. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. Studies from other animal models are used as surrogates for humans. Based on primate models, the inhalation median infectious dose (ID 50) in humans is likely less than 10,000 PFU, and possibly less than 1,000 PFU. Non-human primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus S ARS-CoV-2 infected macaques via combination exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).525 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms, but shed virus from the nose and throat.525 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x106 PFU (delivered through several routes), while marmosets developed mild infections when exposed to 1x106 PFU in tranasally.384 Rhesus macaques are effectively -CoV-2 via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route at of ~700,000 (106 TCID50 ).151 Rhesus macaques infected with 50 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal, intratrache al, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human disease.437 A Rhesus macaques via ocular inoculation (1x106 TCID50), resulting in mild infection ; however , gastric inoculation did not result in infection (same dose) , suggesting a limited role of gastric transmission . Interpretation is limited due to the small scale.150 African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intranasal and intratracheal routes), 654 mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposures between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),255 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with small particle aerosol exposure doses as low as 2,000 PFU.67 Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all animals with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.298 Rhesus macaques have been suggested as the best non -human primate model of human COVID -19 infection based on a more similar clinical presentation compared to other primate models.383 Rodents and other animal models Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 T CID50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters infected).559 In a separate study, immunosuppressed Golden Syrian hamsters showed severe clinical symptoms (including death) after exposure to 100 -10,000 PFU via intranasal challenge.76 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies, 107 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. In another study, older hamsters had more severe symptoms and developed fewer neutralizing antibodies than younger hamsters.463 Mice genetically modified to express the human ACE2 receptor (transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intr anasally with TCID 50 (~70,000 PFU), and all mice developed pathological symptoms consistent with COVID -19.46 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected afte r timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID 50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID50 (~630- 756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25 -30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID 50, ~504 PFU).47 Key methodological details (e.g., particle size, quantification of actual aerosol dose) are missing from the study's report. Transgenic (hACE2) mice exposed intranasally to 400,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 develop typical human symptoms.581 Ferrets infected with 316 ,000 TCID 50314 or 600,000 TCID 50519 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.314, 519 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contact.314 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets,314 however, transmission without direct contact was found in another study.519 In a ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.535 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lungs.557 In a separate study, infected cats showed no clinical signs, but were able to shed virus and transmit to other cats.70 Related Coronaviruses The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, i ntranasal route).145, 147 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100-500,000 PFU show signs of i nfection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.18, 128, 353, 695 What do we need to know? We need to know the infectious dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Human infectious dose by aerosol, surface contact (fomite), fecal -oral routes, and other potential routes of exposure Most appropriate animal model(s) to estimate the human infectious dose for SARS -CoV-2 Does exposure dose determine disease severity? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans (R0 = 2.2 - 3.1), through close contact and aerosol transmission. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible173, 617 but rare.592 As of 9/ 15/2020, p andemic COVID -19 has caused at least 29,303,757 infection s and 928,963 deaths294 in 188 countries and territories .95, 550, 646 There are 6,555,243 confirmed COVID -19 cases a cross all 50 US states, with 194,674 deaths.294 Initial high -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1400, 474, 522, 662, 694 and possibly higher.538 The majority of new infections come from relatively few infectious individuals .13, 170, 678 SARS- CoV-2 spreads through close contact t he WHO acknowledged that aerosol tr ansmission could not be ruled out in all cases .647 Infectious virus ha s been found in patient rooms ,541 up to 16 feet away from COVID -19 patient beds ,345 at concentrations of 6 to 74 TCID 50/L.345 Modeling from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak suggests that long -distance aerosol transmission (>2 m) was more important than large droplet or fomite transmission, though results were highly dependent on assumptions.41 In China, evidence suggests that aerosols in a multi- apartment high -rise638 and on a bus tour393 contributed to transmission. Based on cycle threshold values of viral load in the upper respiratory tract, it is estimated that exhaled breath may emit between 100,000- 10,000,000 genome copies per person per hour ;439 the amount of infectious virus remains unknown. Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others while asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic . Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset.37, 633 Pre-symptomatic68, 319, 570, 578, 672, 697 or asymptomatic45, 271, 391 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2.379 At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission.163 Approximately 40%515 (between 15-56%) of infections may be caused by pre -symptomatic transmission.89, 260, 375, 693 Individuals are most infectious before symptoms begin and within 5 days of sy mptom onset .117 Asymptom atic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection.577 Most transmissio n events occur in the home, but tran smission can occur in any crowded setting, particularly indoors. Attack rates of the virus are higher within households than casual contacts.81, 556 The attack rate ranges from 11%,60 16%,358 and 38%528 of household members, with rates increasing with age.528 The attack rate for children is low in households with an adult COVID -19 case.568, 684 Individuals with more severe illness appear to transmit SARS -CoV-2 more often than those with mild illness, as did index patients who reported coughing.389 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation8, 351, 542, 571 in indoor areas such as restaurant s362; positive SARS- CoV-2 patients were twice as likely as negative patients to report that they had recently eaten in restaurants .199 Clusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings,344, 475 including bars, restaurants, and music festivals.683 Transmission rates are high in confined areas ,466, 537 and places with high heat and humidity (e.g., spas) are able to facili tate outbreaks.246 Rates of transmission on public transport are unclear but appear low. Transmission on airplanes has been inferred,44, 262 though only crude estimates of infection risk on flights currently exist .48 On trains in China, transmission rates were high for those in the same row as an infectious individual (1.5 -3.5% attack rate), though low for non -neighboring passengers.267 Infection risk increased with co -habitation time.267 Examining data from several co untries, few transmission clusters have been linked to public transit.224 The role of children in disease transmission is not well- un derstood, but pediatric cases in the US are increasing.9 Several studies have documented low rates of transmission from or among children in different settings: Australian schools,394 Greek households,402 South Korean homes,311, 476 childcare facilities in the US ,367 and estimates from transmission models.143 However, these studies may underestimate risk of transmission in and from children. Children appear to have as much viral RNA in their upper respiratory tract as adults.261, 678 Asymptomatic and symptomatic children shed SARS -CoV-2 RNA for 18 and 14 days, respectively, but the infectious duration is unknown.245 In a Georgia summer camp, 260 of 344 tested attendees (campers and staff) tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 RNA.583 Children below 10 had the highest rates of SARS -CoV-2 positivity, which decreased with increasing age.583 Undete cted cases play a major role in transmission, and most cases are not reported.686 Models suggest up to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were undetected, and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.357 Models estimate that the true number of cases may be approximately 5 to 10 times greater than the reported number of cases in the US.296, 533, 560 Individuals who have recovered clinically, but test positive, appear unable to transmit COVID -19.307 What do we need to know? We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). How common is transmission from bodily fluids like semen,352 urine,579 and feces ?607 Is it possible to determine the route by which someone became infected by the clinical presentation of disease? How infectious are young children compared to adults? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.361, 371, 373 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausib le.69 Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,701 with a suggested bat origin.129, 701 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,104 though it is possible that the virus wa s circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the seafood market.53, 130, 669, 681 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago ,334 and pangolins positive for coronaviruses related to SARS -CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.360 However, a survey of 334 pangolins did not identify coronavirus nucleic acid in 'upstream' m arket chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. These data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.346 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS- CoV-1,657 potentially explaining its high transmissibility. The same work suggests that differences between SARS - CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 Spike proteins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatm ents.657 Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range, in addition to receptor binding.416 Modeling suggests a wide range of animal hosts for SARS -CoV-2, thou gh experimental studies are still needed .140 Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans. Infected mink have been linked to human infections in workers at mink farms.465 To date, ferrets, mink, hamsters, cats, deer mice, raccoon dogs, and primates have been shown to be susceptible to SARS - CoV-2 infection. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters, primates, and ferrets may be susceptible to infection.107, 314 In the Netherlands, farmed mink developed breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.1 It is thought that an infected mink has transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to a human.329 Golden Syrian hamsters are able to infect other hamsters via direct contact and close quarters aerosol transmission.559 Similarly, raccoon dogs (mammals related to fox es) are susceptible to COVID -19 (105 intranasal exposure dose) and were shown to transmit infection to other raccoon dogs in neighboring enclosures .207 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000- 520,000 PFU via the intranasal route557 or a combination of routes243), and can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.557 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies70 but exhibited no clinical symptoms.557, 565 Deer mice can be experimentally infected with SARS -CoV-2 via intranasal exposure ( 104 or 105 TCID 50)174 and are able to transmit virus to uninfected deer mice through direct contact.232 Their capacity as a reservoir species is unknown. Wild cats (tigers and lions )632 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.401, 690 Studies have confirmed that human keepers transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo.50 Two cases of SARS -CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in pet domestic cats.94 Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens557, 100, 000 PFU for pigs557, PFU for pigs chickens546 all intranasal When pigs were inoculated by the oronasal route ( 106 PFU), minimal to no signs of clinical disease were noted , suggesting limited transmission concerns.492 Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 after experimental exposures.576 Rabbits do not exhibit clinical symptoms after exposure to SARS -CoV-2, but do seroconvert.439 Cattle exposed to SARS -CoV-2 showed no clinical disease but exhibited low levels of viral shedding in the nose, which could be residual virus from the exposure dose.604 What do we need to know? We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes . What is the intermediate host(s) (if any) ? Which animal species can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir populations, potentially leading to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2-14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. By general consensus, the incubation period of COVID -19 is between 5341 and 6634 days.674 Fewer than 2.5% of infec ted individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.341 However, more recent estimates using different models calculate a longer incubation period, between 7 and 8 days.499 This could mean that 5 -10% of individuals undergoing a 14 - day quarantine are still infectious at the end.499 There is evidence that younger (<14) and older (>75) individuals have longer COVID -19 incubation periods, creating a U - shaped relationship between incubation period length and patient age320 while adolescent and young adult populations (15-24 years old) have been estimated at ~2 days.365 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical symptoms.45, 106, 237, 591, 697 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic,101, 530, 591, 697 and asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptomatic patients.37, 313, 707 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.260 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.37 The i nfectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 -14 days .6, 357, 550 Asym ptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.269 The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the seria l interval) is approximately 5 days. On average, there are approximately 4163 to 7.5355 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China and additi onal met a- analysis , the mean serial interval is between 4.4 and 6.0 days.162, 674, 504 The serial interval of COVID -19 has declined substantially over time a s a result of increased case isolation,24 meaning individuals tend to transmit virus for less time. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).387 Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SARS -CoV-2 take less time to test negative than severely ill patients.348 Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals m ay take longer to develop symptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals.634 Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two weeks after symptoms begin.618 The duration of the infectious period is unknown,618 though patients can test positive for SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples.618 What do we need to know? We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? How infectious are asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals compared to mildly, moderately, or severely ill patients? How soon can asymptomatic patients transmit infection after exposure? Does the incubation period correlate with disease severity or exposure dose?

What do we know? Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.4 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death , as are me n. Fever is most often the first symptom. COVID -19 generally begins with fever, then cough and malaise, with gastrointestinal symptoms developing later .336 In 49 children with COVID -19 (0-22 years), however, only 51% developed fever.678 Most -19 cases are mild (81%, n=44,000 cases).591, 648 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9%, only 44 -52% present with fever initially),35, 237 cough (67.7%),237 fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, and reduced lymphocyte count.102, 110, 270 Initial cough without fever may precede mild/moderate illness.363 Chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell483, 673 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.102 GI symptoms are present in approximately 9% of patients .527 Neurological symptoms may present with COVID -19481 and may be more common in severe cases .135 Ocular issues664 such as conjunctivitis (~10% )240 and skin lesions208 may also be symptoms o f COVID -19.71 Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17 -29% of hospitalized patients),115, 270, 620 pneum onia,469 cardiac injury (20%),558 secondary infection, kidney damage,36, 575 arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke (1.6% of hospitalized patients),419 and shock.237, 270, 620, 699 Half of hospitalized COVID -19 patients show abnormal heart scans.165 SARS- CoV-2 may attack blood vessels in the lung, leading to clotting complications and ARDS.12, 611 Clotting affects multiple human organ systems508 and is present in 15 -27% of cases.386 COVID -19 patients should be monitored for possible thrombosis.350 Autopsies of COVID -19 patients show diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)544 and increased blood clotting.545 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,237, 591 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.237, 591 Higher SARS -CoV-2 RNA load s on admission have been associated with greater risk of death.396 COV ID-19 symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath commonly persist for weeks589 to months88 after initial onset. In a news release, most (88%) of the individuals infected with COVID -19 (n=86) showed evidence of lung damage after clinical recovery (88% at 6 weeks after leaving the hospital, 56% after 12 weeks).238 US deaths due to COVID -19 been underreported .456, 653 COVID -19 positive inpatients (n=242) with concomitant bacterial infections (n=46) had an overall mortality rate of 21%; those rece iving antibiotics appeared to have a significantly higher mortality risk than those who did not (30% vs 5%).225 Between 16% and 58% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection .83, 342, 348, 426, 447, 460, 584, 600 The case fatality rate is unknown, but individuals >60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.591, 699 Cardiovascular disease , obesity,14, 489 hypertension,688 diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.591, 699 Hy pertension and obesity are common in the US212 and contribute to mortality.36, 472 Around 21% of US adults (age 18-43) who suffer fr om obesity and high blood pressure have a significantly higher risk of ICU admission following infection .136 The CFR increases with age (data from China and Italy) : 0-19 year s < 0.2%; 20 -29 years = 0-0.2%, 30- 39 years = 0.2 -0.3%, 40-49 years = 0.4%, 50- 59 years 1.0-1.3%, 60 -69 years = 3.5 -3.6%, 70- 79 years = 8.0 -12.8%, >80 years = 14.8 -20.2%.458 For many countries, the CFR has decreased over time, potentially due to increased testing and detection or increasing infection rates in younger populations.175 In Iceland, the overall case fatality rate has been estimated at 0.3 -0.6% but increases to ~4% in those over 70 years o ld.239 Males are at higher risk of COVID -1 9 infection, severe illness , and death.462 An estimated overall infection fatality rate for Indiana was calculated as 0.26% , increasing to 1.71% for those > 65 years old; this estimate excluded long -term care facilities and was not confirmed by serological surveys.66 Smoking appears to be statistically associated with a higher likelihood of COVID -19 progressing to more severe disease .479 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.430 Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) populations acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups203, 230, 468 and are hospitalized212, 497 and die d isproportionately.263, 422 Hospitalization rates in Native American, Hispanic, and Black populations are 4- 5 times higher than those in non-Hispanic white populations.97 In the US, Hispanic and Black COVID -19 patients tend to die at younger ages than white patients.656 Pregnant women with COVID -19 appear to require ICU care more often than non -pregnant women,494 have higher rates of preterm delivery and are less likely to present with fever and myalgia .25 Severity in pregnan t women may be associated with underlying conditions such as obesity.25 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,160 though generally show milder112, 385 or no symptoms. Between 21 -28% of children (<19 years old) may be asymptomatic.385, 477, 500 Most symptomatic children present with mild or moderate symptoms,229, 477 with few exhibiting severe or clinical illness.661 In the US, 33% of children hospitalized with COVID -19 required ICU care, though th e case fatality rate was low (1.8%).312 Severe symptoms in children374 and infants79, 385 are possible , and more likely in those with complex medical histories .555 WHO645 and US CDC292 have issued definitions for a rare condition in children (Ped iatric Multi -System Inflammatory Syndrome , MIS -C)222 linked to COVID -19 infection.523 The prevalence of this condition is unknown . Children with both severe and moderate initial symptoms can progress to MIS -C,221 though it may be more likely to be preceded by fever.678 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEA RED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 8 Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person?

How does the asymptomatic fraction vary across age groups? How long, on average, are affected individuals unable to perform normal jobs and responsibilities? Is Vitamin D protective against COVID -19?415 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEA RED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 9 Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown . Reinfection is possible. The longevity of antibody responses and T -cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several months. In 1,215 infected individuals from Iceland, 91% developed antibody responses that persisted for at least 4 months.239 In a small comparison study (n=74), both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic i ndividuals showed reductions in IgG antibody levels 8 weeks after infection.379 The half-l ife of one antibody (IgG) has been estimated at 36 days in COVID-1 9 patients.276 However, mild COVID-1 9 infections can induce detectable immune responses for at l east 3 months.526 In a study of 285 COVID-1 9 patients, 100% developed antiviral immunoglobulin-G within 19 days of symptom onset,378 and antibody levels have been correlated with neutralizing ability in in vitro studies.597 In a smaller study of 44 patients, plasma from 91% demonstrated SARS-C oV-2 neutralizing ability, appearing ~8 develop in 50%-7 0% of patients.483, 514, 65 9 In a study of 221 COVID-1 9 patients, l evels of two types of antibodies (IgM and IgG) were not associated with the severity of symptoms.268 However, in a smaller study, patients with severe disease showed stronger antibody responses than those with non-s evere symptoms.597 Severely ill individuals develop higher levels of neutralizing antibodies370 and greater T-c ell response frequencies551 than mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. In an outbreak on a fishing vessel where 85% of the crew became infected, three individuals who had high levels of neutralizing antibodies from previous SARS -CoV-2 exposure were protected from the on-b oard outbreak.15 Some patients do not develop detectable antibody responses,587, 659 future protection is unknown. A small study (n=4) identified that children (<3 years) can seroconvert after asymptomatic infection, but level of protection is unknown.306 Im mune responses appear to differ by sex and may contribute to differences in symptom sever ity. In 39 patients, the immune responses of females differed from males, namely through a stronger T -cell response and lower levels of some inflammatory cytokines ,586 which may help to explain increased disease severity in males. In 159 patients, antibody levels differed between males and females, supporting the notion that greater inflammatory responses in males contribute to their elevated disease severity.326 Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible, but the frequency of reinfection is unknown. Researchers in Hong Kong596 and the US595 have identified COVID -19 reinfections. R einfections have been either less596 or more severe595 than the initial infection . The infectiousness of re -infected individuals is unknown. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques. In the first, two experimentally infected macaques were not capable of being re- infected 28 days after their primary infection resolved.152 In the second, rhesus macaques exposed to different doses of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal and intratracheal routes (104 - 106 PFU) dev eloped pathological infection and were protected upon secondary challenge 35 days after initial exposure.109 Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acute lung injury following secondary challenge with SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms such as lethargy and ruffled fur.535 Cats exposed to SARS- CoV-2 after initial recovery did not shed virus, suggesting some protective effect of primary infection.70 The strength and duration o f any immunity after initial COVID -19 infection is unknown.26, 642 In a small study (n=65), 95% of patients developed neutralizing antibodies within 8 days of symptom onset,552 but neutralizing antibody titers declined substantially when assayed after 60 days.552 Individuals with more severe infections developed higher neutralizing antibody levels that persisted longer than those with asymptomatic or mild infections.552 Protective antibody immunity may depend on the severity of initial infection, and may not persist for more than a few months, which is consistent with observations in other human coronaviruses. In a 35 -year study of 10 men, immunity to seasonal coronaviruses waned after one year.166 Reinfection was observed between one and three years after initial infection.166 Pr evious studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.84, 663 The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown. Cross -reactivity in T -cell responses between other human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 may explain variation in symptom severity among patients .404 No single study has quantified both historical exposure and COVID -19 severity. Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the m ajority of recovered COVID - 19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.74, 234 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells of ~30 -40% of unexposed patients,234 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2.74, 234 Long -lasting T -cell responses have been seen in SARS -CoV-1 patients, and T - cell cross -react ivity reactivity between other coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 suggest additional immune protection.343 Children do not appear to be protected from SARS -CoV-2 infection by historical exposure to seasonal coronaviruses553 What do we need to know? We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection? How does initial disease severity affect the type, magnitude, and timing of any protective immune response? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 10 Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Confirmed cases are still underreported.257 The US CDC updated guidance on COVID -19 testing to exclude individuals who do not have symptoms but who have been in close contact with a confirmed case, with exceptions made for vulnerable individuals or if recommended by healthcare providers or local/state public health officials .99 The CDC advises that recovered patients need not be tested for SARS -COV -2 again within 3 months of rec overy unless symptoms re -develop; this advice does not imply protection from re -infection in recovered patients.103 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT -PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give false -negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.332 The role of temporal changes in immunological response and variation of diagnostic test results based on symptom severity warrants additional studies.321 A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography is recommended,516 particularly when results from either test are inconclusive.324 A single throat swab detects 78.2% of infections, and duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.516 PCR tests using saliva are at least as effective as those using nasopharyngeal swabs .113, 666 The US FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a saliva -based diagnostic assay.176 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as diagnostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 625 although evidence is mixed.650 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.696 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike protein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection.80 Diagnostic test results from at- home, mid -nasal swabs were comparable to clinician -conducted nasopharyngeal swabs, though false -negatives were observed in individuals with low viral titer.406 Asymptomatic individuals have a higher likelihood of testing negative for a specific antibody (IgG) compared to symptomatic patients, potentially due to lower viral loads (as measured by RT -PCR). 637 Tests from the US CDC are available to states.92, 101 Rapid test kits have been produced by univ ersities and industry .58, 64, 139, 182, 614 Home tests are being developed , though they cannot yet be used for diagnosis .438, 440, 473 The CRISPR -Cas12a system is being used to develop fluorescence- based COVID -19 diagnostic tests.273 Immunological indicators42, 169, 259, 272, 493, 580, 621 and fasting blood glucose levels624 may help differentiate between severe and non -severe cases,124 and decision- support tools for diagnosing severe infections have been developed.660 Individuals who test positive again after hospital discharge were more likely to have had short hospital stays, be younger than 18, and have had mild or moderate COVID -19 symptoms. 682 Preliminary work has demonstrated the feasibility of nanoparticle -based breath samplers for detecting COVID -19, though additional validation work is necessary on larger sample sizes.554 As of 27 August, the FDA has approved 226 tests under EUAs, to include 182 molecular, 40 antibody, and 4 antigen tests (FDA, 2020). The latest antigen test, BinaxNOW COVID -19 Ag Card, is the first COVID -19 diagnostic test that can be read directly from the card, without use of an analyzer. The test can be administered within the first 7 days of symptom onset and is authorized for point -of-care settings. 185-186 Validated serological (antibody) assays are be ing used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Repeated serological testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic496 and other undetected patients.539 Exclusively testing symptomatic healthcare workers is likely to exclude a large f raction of COVID -19 positive personnel.574 Research has shown high variability in the ability of tests (ELISA455 and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases (sensitivity and specificity, respectively).338, 639 The FDA has excluded several dozen serological diagnostic assays based on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.181 Researchers have designed a standardized ELISA procedure for SARS -CoV-2 serology samples.316 Meta -analysis suggests that lateral flow assays are less accurate than ELISA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target of serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.368 Serological assay false positive rates may account for a substantial portion of reported exposures .56 The Infectious Disease Society of America advises against using serolog y to determine exp osure within two weeks of symptom onse t.247 SARS- CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for COVID -19 surveillance.20 What do we need to know? We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based diagnostic tests . How long do antibody targets of serological assays persist, and after what point are they not informative for prevalence?

What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care,237, 405 and no single standard of care exists. Drug trials are ongoing. Remdesivir shows promise for reducing symptom duration55 and mortality220 in humans. Remdesivir can reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 11 days on average (compared to controls).55 Remdesivir received an Emergency Use Au thorization from the FDA446 and is recommended for use in the EU.649 On 8/28/2020, the US FDA broadened the Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir to include all hospitalized adult and pediatric COVID -19 patients, regardless o f symptom severity.178 A randomized clinical trial of remdesivir found no significant clinical benefits (n=2 37 patients), but the trial ended early .629 Hydroxychloroquine is associated with risk of cardiac arrhythmias and prov ides limited to no clinical benefit .192 Hydroxychloroquine does not benefit mild -moderate COVID- 19 cases,91 was associated with adverse cardiac events in severely ill patients,309 and increases mortality when combined with azithromycin.192 Several large clinical trials have stopped administering hydroxychloroquine due to lack of efficacy .254, 264, 442 Other e xisting studies have found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine (with or without azithromycin)27, 111, 114, 215, 266, 304, 317, 395, 397, 567, 588 as well as cardiac side effects57, 123, 218, 288, 398, 418, 543 and elevated risk of mortality.395, 524 Hydroxychloroquine does not protect individuals from infection either before216 or after exposure.72, 424 The FDA revoked its EUA for the drug on 6/15/20.177 Benefits of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin214 have been called into question, as studies lack key methodological details116 or do not specify their study populations .680 A larger retrospective study (n=2,541) found t hat hydroxychloroquine reduced mortality ,38 though concerns exist over the patient selection protocol .347 Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients. Dexamethasone is associated with substantial reductions in mortality for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and smaller benefits for those receiving supplemental oxygen. 265 Dexamethasone did not reduce mortality in patients who did not need oxygen or mechanical ventilation.265 A large meta -analysis performed by the WHO REACT working group found that 28 -day mortality in critically ill patients was reduced in patients (n=678) who received systemic corticosteroids (dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone).572 Four separate, smaller trials of corticosteroids (n<152) were stopped early due to the results of the WHO REACT trial, limiting their ability to detect statistical differences.32, 154, 356, 599 The b enefits of glucocorticoids may depend heavily on patient inflammation (beneficial if high, detrime ntal if low).308 For instance, methylprednisolone reduced mortality in older patients with high CRP levels, but the effect was not seen in the general study population.293 Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and appears to be effective when administered early, though evidence is mixed. A large trial of plasma therapy (>25,000 patients) shows that treatment is safe, with some evidence that it can reduce 7 - day mortality.301 Plasma therapy shows larger reductions in mortality when administered early in the illness,536 and donor plasma with higher antibody levels appear s more effective.302 Some trial data suggest benefits of plasma in terms of reduced hosp italization time,11 though evidence is mixed.73, 159, 219, 354 On 8/24/2020, t he US FDA approved an Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent plasma therapy .187 Anticoagulants may reduce COVID -19 mortality in hospitalized patients Both therapeutic and prophylactic use of anticoagulants has been associated with significant (~50%) reduction in mortality in hospitalized COVID -19 patients. 441 Anticoagulant use was associated with lower mortality in the severely ill.471 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated but results from large clinical trials are neede d. Several interferon -based treatments show promise , including interferon beta -1b,275 interferon beta -1a,144 and alpha -2b.486 A small cl inical trial (n=33) found patients taking interferon beta -1b had shorter times to clinical improvement, reduced mortality, and reduced ICU admission compared to the standard of care.503 Observational studies have found benefits of tocilizumab191, 256, 529, 569, 671 in severe COVID -19 patients,85 and Phase II trial results show limited reductions in mortality.488 However, studies of tocilizu mab suffer from non -random patient assignments and the confounding influence of concomitant treatments, despite showing some clinical benefits.223, 258, 432, 480, 506, 573, 598, 601 Randomized clinical trials are needed. There is no clinical benefit from combination ritonavir /lopinavir .86, 210, 233, 364 The kin ase inhibitor ruxolitinib may help to reduce symptom duration and mortality.87 The anticoagulant heparin is being used to mitigate risks of pulmonary embolism.169 Anakinra has show n some evidence of clinical benefit in small observational studies.90, 127 Regeneron is conducting human trials of a human monoclonal antibody cocktail, REGN -COV2, which has shown efficacy as both treatment and prophylaxis in non -human primate and rodent animal models.51 What do we need to know?

What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders are effective at reducing transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously . Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.198 Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong134 and reduce d spread throughout China ,327, 331, 333, 381, 399, 623 Europe ,213, 305 and the US.325 Restrictive lockdowns in China are estimated to have reduced disease transmission within only a few days705 by reducing contacts .687 In China, modeling suggests that a one-day delay in implementing control measures increased the time needed to curtail an outbreak by 2.4 days.161 In the US, each day of delay in emergency declarations and school closures w as associated with a 5 -6% increase in mortality.677 In the US, shelter -in-place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.131 School closures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.131 Similarly, researchers found that a larger number of public health interventions in place was strongly associated with lower COVID - 19 growth rates in the next week.303 Individual behaviors such as wearing face coverings and practi cing social distancing have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.483 Mobility201, 337 and physical contact rates291 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with significant reductions in COVID -19 case growth.43, 253 Social distancing and reduc tions in both non-essential visits to stores and overall movement distance led to lower transmission rate s of SARS - CoV-2.434 Travel restrictions delay peak prevalence by only a few days but do not limit epidemic size.23 A combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are likely required to effectively limit transmission.190, 322 School closures alone appear insufficient.285, 333 Contact tracing to identif y infected individuals reduces the amount of time infectious individuals can transmit disease in a population.60 Robust contact tracing and case finding may be needed to control COVID -19 in the US, but requires additional resources .631 In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing, and quarantine was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID -19.578 Contact tracing combined with high levels of testing may limit COVID -19 resurgence once initial social distancing policies are relaxed.21, 193 Contact tracing is likely to be more effective in combination with measures such as expanded testing and physical distancing.330 Adherence to social distancing policies depends on income .635 Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission443 even when individual mask efficiency is low,167 though their benefits are maximized when most of the population wears masks.200 Adolescents and young adults (15 -24) may require different messaging to improve adherence to non- pharmaceutical interventions and public health policies; targeted messaging campaigns are suggested to reduce transmission.241 Research is needed to help plan for easing of restrictions. Testing most symptomatic individuals is critical, and synchronized interventions may help. Robust contact tracing can be effective but can also be overwhelmed. Modeling suggests that optimal control policies involve quickly quarantining infected individuals, and that periods of social distancing or lock -down may be effective in reducing overall exposure from asymptomatic or unconfirmed cases.602 Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.602 Rolling interventions, whereby social distancing measur es are put into place every few weeks, may keep healthcare demand below a critical point.675 Undetected cases, can lead to elevated risk of re -emergence after restrictions are lifted, highlighting the need for robust testing strategies.248 Modeling in the UK suggests that testing of between 59 % and 87% of symptomatic individuals, alongside robust contact tracing and quarantine, is necessary to safely reopen schools without creating a second, winter pandemic wave.470 Regularly testing high -risk groups like healthcare workers may provide benefits to transmission reduction.231 Modeling in the US shows that contact tracing and testing are necessary to reduce the likelihood of COVID -19 resurgence after initial movement restrictions are lifted.22 Quarantining entire households based on potentially infectious contacts may increase the efficiency of test an d trace programs.22 Synchronizing public health interventions and lockdowns across US state lines may reduce the total number of interventions necessary to eliminate transmission as COVID -19 cases continue to resurge.531 Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep cases below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic.315 Results depend on the duration of immunity after exposure.315 In the US, statistical modeling suggests that early school closures resulted in lower mortality, though school closures were often implemented in conjunction with other non -pharmaceutical interventions.39 What do we need to know? We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. What constitutes a high -risk contact time for interactions with COVID -19 patients?299 How will broad -scale school re -openings impact disease progression in the US? How effective are school closures when COVID -19 prevalence in the community is high? Low? What measures can be implemented to limit spread in the winter, where individuals often congregate in enclosed indoor spaces with relatively low humidity, which is favorable to SARS -CoV-2 survival? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEA RED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 14 Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environme nt? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days and on the surface of a surgical mask for up to 7 days depending on conditions. SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours as an aerosol but is inactivated rapidly with sunlight. In simulated saliva on stainless steel surface s, SARS -CoV-2 exhibits negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6.8 -12.8 minutes, depending on the intensity of simulated UVB radiatio n levels.509 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity. This model estimates virus decay in the absence of exposure to direct sunlight.157 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces between 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)608 and 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH). Infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH).121 At room temperature (22 \u00b0C), SARS -CoV-2 remains detectable (via plaque assay) on paper currency for up to 24 hours, on clothing for up to 4 hours, and on skin for up to 96 hours.249 Persistence is reduced with warmer temperatures (37 \u00b0C), and enhanced at colder temperatures (4 \u00b0C).249 SAR S-CoV-2 persists for less than 3 days within the pages of library books, and for less than 1 day on the exterior of book and DVD covers.3 Both temperature and humidity contribute to SARS -CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).65 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aer osols (1.78 -1.96 m mass median aerodynamic diameter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (similar to mid-June ) and 19 minutes in low -intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October ).548 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matr ix.548 Humidity had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.548 DH S developed a tool for estimating the decay of airborne SARS -CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.156 SARS- CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours ( without sunlight, particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH).608 Research suggest s SARS -CoV-2 retains infectivity as an aerosol for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23 \u00b0C, 53% RH, no sunlight).188 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4\u00b0C).121, 507 SARS -CoV-2 maintains infectivity for at least 21 days when experimentally inoculated on frozen foods and stored below -20\u00b0C.197 SAR S-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated. The infectiousness of this materia l is not known.433 No strong evidence exists showing a reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.390 Mo delin g suggests that even accounting for potential reductions in transmission due to weather and behavioral changes, public health interventions will still need to be in effect to limit COVID -19 transmission.420 A r ecent study determined that approximately 0.1 -1% of initial SARS -CoV-2 inoculated on plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, cotton, paper, and surgical masks remained after 48 hours.376 Ap proximately 0.1% of SARS -CoV-2 remains in fecal matter after 6 hours.376 Approximately 0.1% of SARS -CoV-2 in human urine persists after 4 -5 da ys.376 RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is sta ble at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real -time RT -PCR results.566 RNA in clinical samples is also stable at 4 \u00b0C for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS) at room temperature (18 -25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentrations.485 SARS- CoV-2 was detectable on wooden chopsticks used by symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 patients, though sample sizes were small and no efforts were made to isolate infectious virus.388 Re searchers found SARS -CoV-2 to be stable at room temperature across pH 3 -10, and tested its stability on several surfaces.122 After 3 hours (22\u00b0 C, RH 65%), no infectious virus was detected on printing and tissue papers; on day 2, none was found on treated wood and cloth; on day 4, none was found on glass or banknote; on day 7, none was found onstainless steel or plastic. Detectable levels (~ 0.1% or original inoculum) were found on a surgical mask on day 7. 122 The International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) believes that it is highly unlikely that ingestion of SARS -CoV-2 will result in illness; there is no documented evidence t hat food, food packaging, or food handling is a significant source of COVID -19 infections .282 What do we need to know?

What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.328 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective aga inst live virus in lab tests.120 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.459 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but most solutions were not tested on SARS -CoV-2.17 Several solutions have been tested against SARS -CoV-2 and found to be effective , including those based on para -chloro -meta -xylenol, salicylic acid, and quaternary ammoni um compounds .279 Two of these products, Lysol Disinfectant Spray (EPA Reg No. 777- 99) and Lysol Disinfectant Max Cover Mist (EPA Reg No. 777 -127) have specifically been approved for SARS -CoV-2 decontamination.392 Oral antiseptic rinses used in pre- procedural rinses for dentistry containing povidone -iodine (PVP -I) are effective decontaminants of SARS -CoV-2, with 15 -sec and 30 -sec contact times completely inactivating SARS -CoV-2 at concentrations above 0.5% in lab tests.61 Holder pasteurization of donor breast milk spiked with SARS -CoV-2 rendered the virus inactive, demonstrating that standard decontamination procedures are effective at reducing risk of COVID -19 risk in infants via donor breast milk.605 Efforts are ongoing to create paint -on surfaces that can rapidly inactivate SARS -CoV-2.54 Under an emergency exemption, the US EPA permitted Texas and American Airlines to use a product manufactured by Applied BioScience as a surface coating capable of inactivating SARS -CoV-2 within 2 hours, for up to 7 days.171 Pulsed xenon ultraviolet light was able to decontaminate SARS -CoV-2 on respirators with 1 -5 minute exposures.561 Addition of surfactant agents to common sanitizing liquids was shown to increase evaporation time and viricidal efficiency when sprayed on a PVC surface coated with a SARS -CoV-2 virus suspension. 287 Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators.452 Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). 196 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.196 Dry heat and UV decontamination can also be used under certain conditions.195 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly deconta minate N95 respirators.520 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.179 The FDA ha s issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.75 However, a cohort study suggested fit failure after 1 -5 decontamination cycles with this method, depending on mask type.366 Respirator decontamination methods such as VHP appear to maintain filtration efficiency after repeated decontamination cycles. 484 Several decontamination metho ds, including VHP, moist heat, and UVC, are capable of decontaminating N95 respirators for 10 -20 cycles without loss of fit or filtration efficiency.7 Stacking respirators may increase decontamin ation rates without compromising efficiency.534 Heat is effective at inactivati ng SARS -CoV-2. Wet heat (65 \u00b0C for in a multicooker can decontaminate N95 respirators inoculated with SARS -CoV-2.158 Researchers have developed a thermal inactivation model for SARS -CoV-2, providing estimates of infectivity reduction based on time and temperature in the environment and under decontamination strategies.676 Heat treatment (56 \u00b0C) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses (not SARS -CoV-2 explicitly) ,502, 698 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.502 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.593-594 Coronaviruses are more stab le in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.164 Dry heat (100\u00b0 C, 5% RH for 50 minutes) able to decontaminate N95 respirators inoculated with sev eral viruses without compromising fit, but has not been tested on SARS -CoV-2.454 What do we need to know?

What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guidance. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses591 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.547 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high.513 Contacts with healthcare workers tend to transmit COVID - 19 more often than other casual contacts.627 Over 50% of US healthcare workers infected with COVID -19 report work in a healthcare setting as their single source of exposure.82 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive infection control measures, including expanded testing and use of PPE for all patient contacts.521 Universal masking policies also reduced the rate of new healthcare worker infections.626, 704 A modeling study suggests that healthcare workers are primarily at risk from droplet and inhalation exposure (compared to contact with fomites), with grea ter risk while in closer proximity to patients.300 Even among healthcare personnel reporting adequate PPE early in the pandemic (March - April), rates of infection were 3.4 times higher in healthcare personnel than the general population.444 Four percent of healthcare workers in Denmark tested positive for SARS -CoV-2; higher rates are observed in those with direct contact with COVID -19 patients.284 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"98 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.643 PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.189, 636 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those working with potential aerosols.644 Additional protection (Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with full hood ), should be considered for high -risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ven tilation).78 KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.180 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.184 A study suggests that P100 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in short supply.482 Particular care should be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.148 Dome - shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended use.148 The US FDA cautions healthcare facilities using passive protective barrier enclosures without negative pressure, and has withdrawn a prior Emergency Use Authorization for the devices. 183 Non- medical masks may be effective at slowing transmission , though data specific to SARS -CoV-2 are sparse.2, 5 On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. 100 The CDC recommends masks without exhalation vents or valves ,93 as masks with valves can allow particles to pass through unfiltered.615 The WHO recommends that the general population wear non -medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly) wear medical masks when close contact is likely. 641 Infected individuals wearing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.628 A meta -analysis of SARS -CoV-1, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of transmission.125 N95 respirators were associated with a larger reduction in transmission risk compared to surgical face masks.125 Physical distance (>1 or 2 meters) was also associated with lower transmission risk.125 In a separate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.453 N95 respirators were associated with large reductions (up to 80%) in SARS -CoV-1 infections.453 Surgical face masks, respirators and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals (with or without symptoms) to other individuals. 142, 349, 606 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus (not SARS -CoV-2) expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m).349 Homemade masks generally reduce overall flow from breathing and coughing (63 -86% reduction) but also generate leakage jets facing downward and backward from the wearer's f ace.616 The effic acy of homemade PPE, made with T -shirts, bandanas, or similar materials, is less than standard PPE, but may offer some protection .126, 141, 517 Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,318 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).622 Of 42 homemade materials tested, the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers .685 Neck fleeces commonly worn by runners may increase the frequency of small aerosol particles , compare d to wearing no mask at all.194 What do we need to know? We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. When and how do N95 respirators and other face coverings fail? What are proper procedures for reducing spread and transmission rates in medical facilities? How effective are homemade masks at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission?

Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. New analysis of SARS -CoV-2 and related SARS -like coronaviruses suggests that SARS -CoV-2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without the influence of an intermediate 'mixing' host.69 Pangolin coronaviruses were shown to be more divergent and split off from bat coronaviruses earlier than SARS -CoV-2.69 Current samp ling of pangolin viruses does not implicate them as an intermediate to human SARS -CoV-2.69 These data suggest SARS -CoV-2 emerged from circulating bat coronaviruses in SE China/SE Asia and additional zoonotic emergence of novel coronaviruses could occur. Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS -COV -2 most likely emerged f rom Rhinolophus (horseshoe) bats living in China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, or another Southeast Asian country,339 though historical recombination with pangolin coronaviruses may explain some features of the SARS -CoV-2 genome.204 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human- derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.28, 701 Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has identified key genomic signatures shared among high case fatal ity rate coronaviruses (SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.242 These data further suggest that SAR S-CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.242 Deletion mutants were identified at low levels in human clinical samples , suggesting that the PRRA furin cleavage site alone is not fully responsible for human infection , but does confer a fitness adv antage in the human host .652 Additional whole -genome sequencing in humans would help to confirm this finding. Genomic data support at least two plausible origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"28 Both scenarios are consistent with the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relations hip with pangolin coronaviruses,651 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses.371, 373 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circul ating coronavirus in pangolins and bats could be the source of SARS -CoV-2.359, 668 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.691 Additional research is needed. There are multiple studies showing that the SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.28, 359, 372, 691 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion between the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein . While distinct from the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.700 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory or igination,28 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"28 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition motif.146 What do we need to know? We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate species? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS -CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 9/15/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 18 Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.30, 53, 505 Analysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an estimated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.610 The same analysis estimates the emergence of SARS -CoV-2 in humans between October and December 2019.610 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early December 2019, in Europe in late December 2019,155 circulation in the US (Washington State) in February 2020,655 and circulation in Mexico in March, 2020.585 In both California153 and New York City,226 phylogenetic evidence supports multiple introductions of SARS -CoV-2 from both inside and outside the US. SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing purifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).658 Low genetic diversity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,658 and that additional jumps into humans from reservoir species may occur. In 94 COVID -19 patients , there was no association between viral genotype and clinical severity.692 However, a 382 base pair deletion in the SARS -CoV-2 genome has been linked to milder clinical illness (n = 39),679 though caveats in sample size, time of sampling, and patient selection are warranted. Recent analysis of >16,000 genomes of SARS -CoV-2 suggests two major introductions in the US, one associated with the West coast and one with the Eastern portion of the US.435 At least one mutation has been associated with greater viral transmission, but virulence appears unchanged. Phylogenetic and clinical analysis suggests the D614G mutation in the Spike protein is associated with higher rates of SARS- CoV-2 transmission, but no change in clinical severity in infected patients.323 However, it is difficult to determine whether this mutation is overrepresented due to founder effects, or whether it truly spreads more ra pidly than other isolates. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that this mutation increases infectivity in cell lines, but additional animal model work is needed to confirm the effect of this mutation on transmission.689 The D614G mutation increased viral loads in experimentally infected hamsters, though the results were only statistically significant in the upper respiratory tract (i.e., nose, throat).495 Additionally, the D614G mutation showed a competitive advantage within hamster hosts, meaning it increased in frequency in vitro compared to wild -type virus.495 The mutation did increase viral replication in human cell lines.495 Associations between human blood type and COVID -19 severity are unclear. A genome -wide association study in humans identified two loci corresponding to higher risk of severe COVID -19 (3p.21.31 and 9q34.2), including one associated with blood type.168 Individuals with type -O blood showed reduced risk of severe disease, while individuals with type -A blood showed an increased risk.168 However, a large cohort study (n = 1,289) documented no difference in disease severity by blood type.340 A very small case series identified more severe illness in those with type A/B blood compared to O blood, though the A/B group was older and contained more males.274 Due to conflicting evidence, additional research is warranted. Phylog enetic s suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolin s.371, 373 The SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is the major determinant of host range, is very s imilar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein.382 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat382 and coronaviruses found in pangolin s.373 Structural modeling suggests that observed changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors .461 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are linked with improving the stability of the virus -recept or binding complex.461 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stabili ty of the receptor binding domain, potentially increasing binding efficacy.464 Infectivity assays are needed to validate the potential phenotypic results identified in these studies. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coro naviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).132 What do we need to know? We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allow ed human infection and transmission? How do viral mutations affect the long -term efficacy of specific vaccines? Does blood type play a major role in determining COVID -19 severity?
