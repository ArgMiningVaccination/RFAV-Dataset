Feeling the warmth of an adaptogenic tea is basically comfort in a mug, especially if you practice tea mediation. Drinking tea will provide health benefits beyond the pure feeling of comfort, though. Tea can even help boost your immune system when your body needs it most, especially during cold and flu season (not to mention COVID times). However, not all teas are created equal when it comes to helping you strengthen your immune system. Now, It's important to note that consistent restful sleep, vitamin intake, stress reduction, and exercise are things you need to incorporate into your daily or weekly routine to ensure you're staying healthy overall. But sometimes, it's a good idea to add supplements like mushroom-based tea to help get you there.

Chaga mushrooms are a nutrient-dense mushroom that grows on birch trees in Asia, Canada, Northern Europe, Russia, and some North-Eastern parts of the United States. In addition to their ability to support the immune system, Chaga mushrooms also contain high levels of melanin. This is believed to mimic the melanin which is naturally produced in the skin. This allows for anti-aging properties, repairing damaged skin cells, and can act as a protectant against the sun. What's more, is that Chaga can also help reduce thyroid antibodies by increasing natural killer cell response and activating immune pathways. This can help to restore balance to the related hormones and cells that cause health issues such as hypo and hyperthyroidism.
