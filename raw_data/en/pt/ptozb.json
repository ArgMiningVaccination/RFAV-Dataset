So much so, that Terese became a qualified Usui Reiki healer to pass on her knowledge to the wider community. She has recently joined our team at Hawker Chiropractic and will add another option for wellness care. So [what is Usui Reiki](https://www.reikiassociation.net/usui-shiki-ryoho.php)? It is an ancient Japanese healing method - a form of hands on healing to bring the mind, body and spirit in balance. It is often described as a relaxation method that promotes healing. Universal life energy is channelled through the Reiki practitioner to the recipient. It releases energy blockages, cleanses the body and replenishes the body's energy system by activating your natural healing abilities. With the philosophy of chiropractic also dealing with Universal energy and Innate Intelligence, Reiki, along with Acupuncture and Massage work together to promote healing in all aspects of your life. Usui Reiki is suitable for most people, including babies, the elderly, pregnant women and those recovering from surgery. People with Pace makers are unfortunately not able to receive Reiki. Some benefits that may come from a Reiki session can include: Increased energy; Balanced mind, body and spirit; Calmed central nervous system; Reduced and even eliminated existing physical pain; and Reduced stress and anxiety levels. Terese will have limited availability initially working only later in the afternoon and evenings and Saturdays. The appointments will be either 30 minutes or 60 minutes, so we suggest you get in early as times will fill quickly. This super relaxing, painless and very effective method of healing may be just what you have been looking for.
