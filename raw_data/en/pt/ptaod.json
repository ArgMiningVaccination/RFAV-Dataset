These services give health care providers important information to make decisions about your care and treatment. Diagnostic Imaging services are provided on an inpatient, outpatient and emergency basis and include examinations such as: - general radiography (X-rays, bone mineral densitometry, and GI procedures); - ultrasounds; - echocardiography; - magnetic imaging computed tomography (CT or CAT Scan); - mammograms; and - nuclear medicine. Will I need a referral? You must have a requisition from a physician or nurse practitioner to receive diagnostic imaging services. You do not require a physician referral for breast screening (mammogram). How will I get the results of my examination? Diagnostic Imaging Services will send a report to the ordering physician, and if requested, to another doctor or specialist involved in your care. Contact your physician's office to obtain results. If you've had a mammogram for Breast Cancer Screening, you will receive a letter with your results. Your physician will also be sent a report with your screening results. How long will I have to wait to receive diagnostic imaging services? Wait times for diagnostic imaging services are measured from the time the requisition is received at the Diagnostic Imaging department to the date when the examination is performed. Learn more about wait times for an [ultrasound](/en/information/health-pei/ultrasound-wait-times), [CT scan](/en/information/health-pei/computed-tomography-ct-wait-times) and [MRI scan](/en/information/health-pei/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri-wait-times). What is general radiography? General radiography, commonly referred to as X-ray, is a diagnostic tool used to create images of the body's internal structures. These images are used to detect abnormalities in bones, lungs and other internal organs. Other general radiography services include Bone Mineral Densitometry (BMD) and GI procedures, such as barium swallow, [barium enema](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/qeh_-_a_guide_to_your_barium_enema_0.pdf) [PDF | 98 KB], upper GI, and small bowel follow through. View the [patient preparation instructions for general radiography](/en/information/health-pei/general-radiography-patient-preparation). General radiography services are offered at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Prince County Hospital, Souris Hospital, Kings County Memorial Hospital, Community Hospital O'Leary and Western Hospital. Note: You must have an x-ray requisition from your Physician/Nurse Practitioner or one must be faxed to the Diagnostic Imaging Department at either QEH or PCH prior to making your appointment.

Ultrasound is used to examine blood flow and the function of moving organs such as your heart, liver and kidneys. It can also be used to perform needle biopsies and to assess the development of an unborn baby (fetus). Learn more about having a: [ultrasound](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/qeh_and_pch_-_a_guide_to_your_ultrasound_brochure.pdf)[PDF | 86 KB]; and [transrectal ultrasound biopsy](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/qeh_-_a_guide_to_your_transrectal_ultrasound_biopsy.pdf)[PDF | 107 KB]. View the [patient preparation instructions for ultrasound](/en/information/health-pei/ultrasound-patient-preparation). If you wish to know the sex of your baby during your second or third trimester ultrasound, please read and sign the [Routine Obstetrical Ultrasound Disclosure/Consent Statement](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/forms/routine_obstetrical_ultrasound_disclosure_consent_statement.pdf) [PDF | 55 KB] and bring it with you to your appointment. What is echocardiography? Echocardiography, or Echo, simply put is an Ultrasound of the heart. The pictures can show the size, shape and function of the heart's valves and chambers, as well as the blood flow and pressures throughout the heart. This test can also help discover blood clots in the heart, fluid in the sac around the heart, problems with the aorta, as well as, heart defects in infants and children. There are various types of Echocardiograms, your preparation will depend on the type of Echocardiogram your health care provider is requesting. Echocardiograms are performed at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Prince County Hospital. What is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)? MRI imaging is a safe, efficient, non-invasive way to examine your internal organs in great detail and from a number of angles. The magnetic scan is used to identify tumours, strokes, degenerative diseases, inflammation, infection and other abnormalities. Learn more about having an [MRI exam](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/mri_-_a_guide_to_your_mri_exam.pdf) [PDF | 133 KB] at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. View the [patient preparation instructions for MRI](/en/information/health-pei/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri-patient-preparation). You will receive your booked appointment two weeks or less prior to the date, via an automated text or phone call. You must confirm this appointment at the end of the phone call or by responding to the text. What is a computed tomography (CT) scan? CT scan, or CAT scan is used to capture clear images of internal sections of your body from different angles. It presents a cross-sectional image of internal tissue and organs. Depending on the procedure, an injection of contrast (dye) may be used to highlight certain internal structures. Learn more about having a [CT Scan](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/ct_scan_-_a_guide_to_your_ct_scan.pdf) [PDF | 109 KB] and [patient preparation instructions](/en/information/health-pei/computed-tomography-ct-patient-preparation). CT scans are offered at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Prince County Hospital. What is a mammogram? A mammogram is an x-ray of the breast that is used to detect cancer. Regular screening can detect breast cancer at an early stage when women have no signs or symptoms. If you are a person with breast tissue, screening is available annually between the ages of 40-49 and recommended every two years between the ages of 50-74. Learn more about [breast cancer screening](/en/information/health-pei/pei-breast-screening-program). Mammograms are offered at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Prince County Hospital. What is Nuclear Medicine? Nuclear Medicine involves the use of small amounts of radioactive material to help diagnose and treat a variety of diseases. Once administered, gamma cameras trace the flow of the substance which allows for the detection of abnormalities early in the progression of a disease. Nuclear Medicine procedures include bone scans, HIDA scans and Meckel's scans. Learn more about having a [Nuclear Medicine exam](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/sites/default/files/publications/qeh_-_myocardial_perfusion_imaging_mibi_.pdf) [PDF | 74 KB] and [patient preparation instructions](/en/information/health-pei/nuclear-medicine-patient-preparation). Nuclear medicine exams are offered at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. How does diagnostic imaging collect, store and share information? Diagnostic Imaging uses Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) technology. This digital system means that authorized health care providers across the province can access digital images and reports at anytime of the day. Radiology Information System (RIS) is also used to manage all diagnostic imaging-related patient information. For example, this allows an x-ray taken at one hospital to be interpreted by a radiologist at another hospital. Through these technologies, patients benefit from more accurate and timely diagnosis, faster treatments and reduced wait times. What other information is available?
