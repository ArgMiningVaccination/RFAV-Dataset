I feel like I have tried every medication and diet. Would acupuncture help with treating these digestive issues? 26 Answers sure couldn't hurt to try it! I have successfully treated all sorts of digestive issues. Being specific and giving more history might allow me to delve a bit deeper in my response. [Theresa Evans](/Expert/81226290-Theresa-Evans)Acupuncturist NAPLES, FL I have treated several thousand patients for digestive distress with success. Get an assessment and consultation. [Jennifer Kolter](/Expert/81226363-Jennifer-Kolter)Acupuncturist Henderson, MN Yes, but I also implement herbal and/or supplements to heal the gut. Without your specific condition I can't speak specifically, but our medicine is great in lots of situations like this, those that western medicine can't help. [Michelle Lee](/Expert/81891321-Michelle-Lee)Acupuncturist SMYRNA, GA No doubt in my mind. It's quite a vicious cycle for digestive disorders and medication. The medication could possibly be too strong for your GI system to handle at it's current condition. If you are currently taking prescriptions, acupuncture can be catered to strengthen the GI system, as well as addressing the main root cause of your digestive disorders. This will allow you to naturally live well, and get back to your desired quality of life. [Majidreza Tabibzadeh](/Expert/82091516-Majidreza-Tabibzadeh)Acupuncturist TUSTIN, California Acupuncture is very effective in digestive issues. [Kathleen Blazek](/Expert/81227025-Kathleen-Blazek)Acupuncturist Colorado Springs, CO I have treated some big digestive disorders with acupuncture & Chinese herbs. Your success with acupuncture is dependent upon your condition(s). Digestive disorders aren't as simple and a one-stop-shop fixes all so I can't give a definitive answer. We know that our digestive system creates its own hormones and enzymes and has been know to be the \"second brain\" of the body. When one area gets off balance, it effects the digestive system as a whole. It can also effect the other organs and glands, hormones, gut flora, blood and brain function. I would recommend that you contact a license acupuncturist and Chinese medicine practitioner in your area experienced in treating digestive disorders and have them to a complete assessment on you including pulse diagnosis, tongue diagnosis (the only muscle that we can see with direct connection to your digestive system), nutritional and lifestyle assessment.

[lada komarova](/Expert/82734744-lada-komarova)Acupuncturist New York, NY Acupuncture and herbs help in treating digestive issues. Since you've asked a general question and I don't know what issue you have, the best way is to be diagnosed by an experienced acupuncturist who will find out what is your pattern of imbalance and prescribe a proper treatment for you, Good Luck! [WenShuo Wu](/Expert/81226382-WenShuo-Wu)Acupuncturist Diamond Bar, CA Acupuncture and Chinese herbs can help patients with digestion problems. Please check with local acupuncture clinic for help. [Adam Perna](/Expert/81226479-Adam-Perna)Acupuncturist Roseland, NJ Yes, personally, I find acupuncture helps with digestion very well. I would put it at top 3 things on a scale that it helps (skin issues being on the low end). [JOONKOO LEE](/Expert/81226344-JOONKOO-LEE)Acupuncturist LOS ANGELES, California Acupuncture and herbal medicine are more effective when used together. [Abe Shahabelmolki](/Expert/81226414-Abe-Shahabelmolki)Acupuncturist Sarasota, FL Acupunctuee treatment for digestive issue is a temporarily fix. You need to exercise and change your diet. Certain foods and drinks can cause flare up. Stay away from hot spicy foods and alcohol. Reduce your stress level. Consume more plant base diet and cut back on foods that are difficult to digest. Drink more water. Stay away from dairy and sugar. Cut back on coffee. Good luck! [Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York It can. Unlike medications, acupuncture works beyond just treating symptoms and gets to the root cause of your digestive distress. [Huy Tran](/Expert/81227314-Huy-Tran)Acupuncturist San Jose, CA Hi there, There are reasons for why certain symptoms come about. Acupuncture can help distinguish what is the root cause and then go from there. There are reasons for why certain symptoms come about. Acupuncture can help distinguish what is the root cause and then go from there. [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Acupuncture could help. That said, digestive issues can stem from so many different causes, including current dietary imbalances, parasites, allergens, etc. Getting to the bottom of your digestive troubles can be as easy as incorporating more of the foods that are easily digested and less of those that are trouble makers OR it could involve many medical disciplines to solve the issue. Nevertheless, Acupuncture will certainly help to improve organ function and digestive power and decrease any pain/gas/indigestion. [David Chen](/Expert/81227116-David-Chen)Acupuncturist Whittier, CA Yes, acupuncture can treat digestive disorders. David David [Ms. Ellen D. Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR Yes, I treat a lot of people for digestive disorders. The most common cause is gluten intolerance, but I see many other causes, and between dietary changes, herbs, and the acupuncture, we can usually get things under control and your life back on track. Good luck! Good luck! [Dr. Carol Revak](/Expert/2293443-Carol-Revak)Acupuncturist Tucson, AZ In my clinical experience, treating gastrointestinal issues is an area where acupuncture and/or Chinese herbal therapy excels. Problems with digestion could range from issues like acid reflux, nausea and vomiting to inflammatory processes, constipation, loose stools, infectious processes, etc. The success in treating digestive issues with acupuncture is because each patient will receive an individualized plan regardless of the specific complaint. I highly recommend you give it a try. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO We need to identify what is the underline problem by treating either with needles or combining with Chinese herbal medicine. It is quite effective without adding too many extra substances in the ill GI system. [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL I have treated many people with digestive issues using acupuncture alone. The practitioner will need to differentially diagnose what they see as the root of the issue, but they should be able to get things moving smoothly. There may be more things involved, such as emotional turmoil, life style habits, work related or relationship related issues, too - so, if the practitioner starts asking about these things, know that it is part of their diagnosis to help get to the root of the issue. Be sure to use a Licensed Acupuncturist that you trust and are comfortable with. Good luck. Good luck. [Jeannette Kerns](/Expert/81227064-Jeannette-Kerns)Acupuncturist Saint Cloud, florida Digestive disorders (from IBS to Crohn's) are conditions I see the most of aside from pain. Acupuncture is very helpful, though I also use a combination of Chinese herbs, probiotics, and digestive enzymes. Digestion is a tricky condition, but acupuncture is phenomenal for helping. I recommend finding an acupuncturist specializing in digestion. [BoDanielle Park](/Expert/81227213-BoDanielle-Park)Acupuncturist Duluth, Georgia Yes, acupuncture helps because acupuncture treatment does not work like you take medication. It is helping by promoting your system to balance and work properly. [Andrew Pacholyk](/Expert/1060796-Andrew-Pacholyk)Acupuncturist New York, NY Hi! In a nutshell, YES.

[Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO Generally, yes, acupuncture can be an excellent choice for digestive issues. One of the many things acupuncture has been shown to do is stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. This is the so-called \"rest and digest\" part of the autonomic system (as opposed to the \"fight-or-flight\" part of that system). I generally get excellent results for a spectrum of digestive complaints ranging from acid reflux to chronic diarrhea to chronic constipation. For the best results, make sure you're seeing an NCCAOM board certified acupuncturist.
