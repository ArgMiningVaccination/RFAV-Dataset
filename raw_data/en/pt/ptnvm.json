Juli Mazi, 41, of Napa, was charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of false statements related to health care matters, the US Department of Justice said in a statement Wednesday. The case is the first federal criminal fraud prosecution related to the sale of homeoprophylaxis pellets, which falsely promise lifelong immunity from COVID-19, and fraudulent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 vaccination cards, the department said. Prosecutors said Mazi peddled fake medical information and created skepticism as health officials pleaded with the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The pandemic and vaccines have generated deep divisions in the U.S., with some saying they don't trust the shots and won't get inoculated. 'This doctor violated the all-important trust the public extends to healthcare professionals \u2014 at a time when integrity is needed the most,' said Special Agent in Charge Steven Ryan, of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. A federal complaint alleges that Mazi peddled homeoprophylaxis pellets, said to contain small amounts of the COVID-19 virus, falsely promising lifelong immunity from the illness Mazi is also accused selling forged Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 vaccination cards marked with Moderna vaccine doses (pictured) Federal prosecutors said Mazi sold homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets she fraudulently claimed would provide 'lifelong immunity to COVID-19' when swallowed. She told customers the pellets contained small amounts of the virus and would create an antibody response, prosecutors said. To encourage customers to buy the pellets, Mazi made false claims that the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines contain 'toxic ingredients,' according to the Justice Department. Mazi also is accused of saying that customers could give the pellets to children for COVID-19 immunity, and that the 'dose is actually the same for babies.' According to prosecutors, prior to the pandemic the Napa-based naturopath already was running an immunization scheme where she offered the homeoprophylaxis pellets for childhood illnesses. They said she falsely claimed they would satisfy the immunization requirements for California schools, and falsified immunization cards that were submitted by parents to California schools. The investigation into Mazi was prompted by a complaint in April to the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General hotline. Family members of the caller bought the immunization pellets from Mazi, who then sent them COVID-19 Vaccination Record cards, with Moderna listed, even though the patients did not receive any of the three approved vaccines, the complaint said. 'Mazi allegedly instructed the complainant family to mark the cards to falsely state that they received the Moderna vaccine on the date that they ingested the COVID-19 homeoprophylaxis immunization pellets,' prosecutors stated. Prosecutors claimed Mazi provided customers with specific Moderna vaccine lot numbers to enter onto the cards and told them how to select dates for the cards on which they received the vaccines to avoid suspicion. 'According to the complaint, instead of disseminating valid remedies and information, Juli Mazi profited from unlawfully peddling unapproved remedies, stirring up false fears, and generating fake proof of vaccinations,' said Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds for the Northern District of California. Prosecutors said before the pandemic, Mazi sold homeoprophylaxis pellets for childhood illnesses and faked immunization cards submitted to schools According to an affidavit in support of a criminal complaint, Mazi made $221,817 between January 2020 and May 2021 for 1,242 transactions. Twenty-five transactions amounting to $7,653 contained notes indicating that they were for COVID treatments. If convicted as charged, the 41-year-old licensed naturopath could face up to 25 years in federal prison. According to Mazi's website, she has an undergraduate and master's degree in communications studies from Portland State University, and her doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine from the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon. 'She believes in and holds deep respect for everyone's innate ability to discover and find a path to their own well being,' the page reads.
