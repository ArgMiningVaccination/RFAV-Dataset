So even if you're taking your magnesium for serenity, you're also doing far more for your total health and well-being. Balanced mood Our favorite benefit of magnesium, by far, of course, is how well it works to support a balanced mood and healthy response to stress. It also eases tension and helps you relax.* NIGHTTIME RELAXATION Magnesium helps ease tension so you can relax for a good night's sleep.* Muscle function When we say magnesium is an essential mineral, we mean it. Your muscles need it in order to contract and relax. That means the more active you are, the more you may need it to help support healthy muscle function.* Brain & nervous system function Magnesium protects the lining of your nerves and helps your nerves talk to each other. Ultimately, this all supports overall healthy nerve and brain function.* Cardiovascular health Another reason to love magnesium? Your heart. Not only does it help maintain healthy blood pressure levels, but it's also required for normal heart contraction.* Bone density Keeping up your daily levels of magnesium helps you maintain healthy bones. When you don't get enough, your body's ability to absorb calcium and vitamin D might be impacted.* You may feel your muscles relax or an overall sense of serenity. But give it time.

Magnesium is tied to brain health, including feelings of occasional stress. The biological mechanisms behind magnesium's calming activity in the brain are clear. By blocking stimulating neurotransmitters and binding to calm, restful receptors in the brain, magnesium may help us relax. By regulating stress hormones like cortisol, magnesium also has effects on the HPA axis, the body's main system that manages and responds to stress. In other words, magnesium can help keep your nervous system from getting stuck in overdrive. Gummies are just another delivery mode for essential nutrients and minerals like magnesium. Whether you prefer to take CALM magnesium in tablet, powder or gummy form, you'll get the dose of magnesium listed on the label. With our magnesium citrate CALM gummies, you get magnesium citrate, which is three times better absorbed than magnesium oxide\u2014all in a tasty, sweet treat.
