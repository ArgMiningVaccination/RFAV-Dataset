Introduction Looking back into the history of mankind, one is often startled to find the emergence of some outstanding personalities at different inte rvals of time. Their thoughts and futuristic viewpoints revolutionized the existing perspe ctive in the fields of science, philosophy and social order. The embodiment of such a pers onality in the field of medicine was Samuel Christian Friedrich Hahnemann, the father of homeopathy. He was born on the 10th April 1755 in the small town of Meissen, near Dresde n in Germany. A doctor in the conventional medicine of his time, by 1790 he was recognized as one of the most distinguished physicians of his generation and was appointed physicia n to the king. Soon however, he became dissatisfied with contemporary medical ideas and the often cruel practices that ensued, as well as the drugs being prescribed. He realized t h a t m a n y o f t h e s e m e d i c i n e s o w e d t h e i r pride of place in the Materia Medica due to their very biologically active nature, which could easily occasion death or produce new diseases on whomever they were applied. Disillusioned, Hahnemann renounce d his practice of medicine. While engaged in translating a treatise on herbal medicine, he felt dissatis fied with the explanation given for the cure of malarial fever by giving cinchona bark. He took the drug himself in order to investigate the changes induced by it on his healthy system. Peculiarly, the symptoms of malaria made their appearance in him, one after the other, but without the chilly rigor. This reminded him of Hippocrates' aphorism, \" Similia similibus curentur, \" meaning \" Let likes be cured by likes \" (Hobhouse, 2002). Hahnemann felt convinced that the drug, which wa s the best agent to cure malarial fever, produced in him the initial symptoms of that fever. He then investigated the action, on healthy human beings, of as many as 50 more dr ugs over a period of six years. He recorded the symptoms produced, and compared them wi th the symptoms of diseases against which they were used successfully. 1.1 What is homeopathy? In 1776, Hahnemann published the results of his findings in a paper entitled \"Essay on the new principle for ascertaining the curative power of drugs.\" In this, he postulated the most important principle of homeopathy, stating, \" Every powerful medicinal substance produces in the human body a kind of peculiar disease, the mo re powerful the medicine, the more particularly www.intechopen.com A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy 124 marked and violent the disease. We should imitate nature, which sometimes cures a chronic disease, by superadding another, and employ in the disease (esp ecially chronic) we wish to cure, that medicine which is able to produce anothe r very similar artificial disease, an d the former will be cured similia similibus .\" In 1810, he published The Organon of the Rational Art of Healing, his greatest book, wherein he elucidated systematically the meth ods and principles of a system of medical treatment to which he had given the name of \"Homeopathy\" (Hahnemann, 1982). The homeopathic approach is holistic, that is , while treating a patient a homeopath will consider not only the disease, bu t the whole constitution of the patient. The patient is treated as a whole. To know about homeopathy we should know what \"individualization\" and \"similimum\" mean because these two are the basic tenets on which selection of homeopathic medicines depends, as practised and ta ught from the time of Hahnemann. What is \"individualization\" ? Every individual person is diff erent from the other physically, mentally, constitutionally and in their likes and dislikes. In general, we may find some persons alike, but all individuals have their own special features. \"Similimum\" means the most similar medicine as per symptoms narra ted by a patient. After noting down the symptoms of a patient the phys ician thinks of a few medicines out of which he finds one medicine which appears to be the most simila r to the symptoms narrated, considering the mental and constitutional status for that partic ular individual. In classical homeopathy only a single medicine is given in a single dose and then the patient is observed for his/her response. Classical homeopathy has, theref ore, no specific remedy for any disease by name, but it has specificity for each individual case of disease. A specific drug cannot be used for a specific disease. In general, when a homeopathic physic ian examines a patient, only a few medicines come to his mind. This small group of medicines exhibits similar symptoms whe n given to healthy subjects for pharmacologi cal testing (a process called \"p roving.\".. Finally only one is selected as a result of practical experience and this procedure requires a long and intense interrogation of the patient. In an interesting study of homeopathic diag nosis and treatment, it was shown that a typical classical homeopathic in itial consultation took 117 +/- 43 minutes for each adult patient and 86 +/- 36 minutes for each child patient. Theoretically there should be only one such medicine considering the entire ty of the patient (Becker-Witt, et. al., 2004). The homeopathic drug is not ad ministered in usual pharmacological doses, but in minute doses prepared according to certain principles . These medicines are produced using various plant extracts, salts, animal pr oducts, minerals etc. and then diluting the extracted mother tincture or the crude materials, per pharmaco poeial methods. These solutions are serially diluted and succussed (agitated) until the desired potency is produced. Greater dilution leads to greater potency of the medicine. The cr ude or slightly diluted extract when ingested by healthy volunteers produces symptom complexes that mimic various diseases. The symptoms produced and recorded are a result of the dynamic action of drugs on healthy volunteers or \"provers.\" The symptoms produced by the dr ug in provers are exactly what the potentized medicine is prescribed for in the sick. 1.2 The central problem of classical homeopathy Although classical homeopaths believe that the above-described method of selecting medicines is essential to the worth of their medical system, the central problem is, whether a www.intechopen.com Homeopathy: Treatment of Cancer with the Banerji Protocols 125 correct similimum can be selected by such a method of individualization. The subjective symptoms elicited in the typical two-hour initial consultation are often \"lost in the translation.\"Thus, should a pati ent be examined separately by different homeopaths on the same day, he will be perplexed to find that none of them seem to agree as to the so-called \"similimum.\" Then how can individualization be expl ained logically and used to benefit the suffering population? Do all the medicines suggested by various homeopaths for a patient behave as a similimum for that particular case? Obviously not! Then what is the solution to this central question of how the correct medici ne should be determined? The answer is to rationalize the selection of medicines based on previous experience and experimentation and to develop routine treatment protocols following a scientific method for selecting medicines. Another practical problem may be mentioned here. If a homeopath examines six or eight cases daily, he may have to charge high fees from each individual patient for maintenance. This will put homeopathy out of reach to the suffering population who really need it. At the same time, with such a small number of patients, a homeopath hardly gets enough clinical experience to become a true physician. It is common knowledge that experience makes a doctor. Scientific validation of the efficacy of ho meopathic medicines, which are nontoxic and inexpensive - making them ideal as \"the Peop le's Medicine\" - has been stalled due to the inability to conduct clinical trials using st andardized treatment protocols with these medicines. The true healing potential of home opathy, then, has been repeatedly challenged and denied by mainstream medicine because of this problem. T hus, this system of medicine is at risk of being delegated to the archives of history. 1.3 The Banerji Protocols In the clinics of our research foundation,, we do not practice classical homeopathy. We have developed a method of treatment in which spec ific medicines are prescribed for specific diseases. Diseases are diagnosed using modern state-of-the-art scientific methods. This is done because modern diagnostic approaches incorporate and help in the selection of medicines so that specific medicines can be eas ily prescribed for specif ic diseases. With the passage of time and the availability of new diagnostic tools like ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, cancer biomarkers and othe r a d v a n c e d t e s t s , w e h a v e b e e n a b l e t o further streamline the treatment protocols. The e fficacy of this approach is reflected by the encouraging results of our new method of treatm ent, which we call the \"Banerji Protocols.\" We often combine two potentized medicines and use the combination in our practice. This combination of two potentized medicines is ma de in a meaningful way based on years of clinical observations by us. Medicines are comb ined for special advantages in treatment, so that the aggravation due to the medicines can be checked, side effects of the medicines abated, and quick and uneventful recovery can be ensured in a much shorter time. We will discuss the Banerji Protocols in more depth later in this chapter. 2. The global use of homeopathy Homeopathy currently is used in over 80 countries around the world. In several countries including India, Mexico, Brazil and the UK home opathy is integrated into the healthcare systems. In the United States, homeopathic remedies are regulated as nonprescription www.intechopen.com A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy 126 drugs, which give them a unique status ov er other natural ther apies and supplements. Homeopathy is very popular in the UK, where the Royal Family has had homeopathic physicians since the 1830s. In England, as many as 45% of conventional MDs refer patients to homeopaths and the treatment is part of th e National Health Scheme (NHS). In France, 40% of the population use homeopathy. Thirty thousand French doctors use homeopathic medicines, there are twenty thousand phar macies providing them, and 32% of French family physicians use homeopathy. In Italy, homeopathy is the most popular alternative therapy, used by 86% of the population. In Germany 25% of family physicians use homeopathy, and non-MD homeopaths are eligib le for licensure and until recently were reimbursed by the National Health System. Nine million people use homeopathy in Brazil. In 1985, homeopathy was included among the th erapeutic options offered at the outpatient facilities of the Brazilian public health syst em. Fifteen thousand Brazilian doctors practice homeopathy (Marino, 2008). In Asia, the homeopathic medical system is very popular, especially in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The epoch-making statement of Mahatma Gandhi, \"Homeopathy.... cures a larger percentage of cases than any other method of treatment and is beyond doubt safe r and more economical and most complete medical science,\" added another feather to the cap of homeopathy. In India today there are 162 de gree colleges teaching homeopathy and the largest pool of homeopaths in the world - over 200,000 doctors practice homeopathy. About 100 million people use homeopathy (Ghosh, 2010; Singh, 2005). This is a very conservative estimate because in the 1950ss and 1960s there were not many conventional doctors available for the treatment of the masses. In that era, most village school masters and scholars educated themselves in this economic al and easy to administer treatment form. Thus homeopathy had a much further reac h amongst the general population than conventional medicine. Of Indi a's 1.16 billion population, appr oximately 70% live in villages and rural areas, where access to expensive conven tional medical facilities is limited (World Health Organization, 2006). 3. History of homeopathy in India Seen through the mist of years, the early histor y of the advent of homeopathy in India is a fascinating episode. As early as 1810, some German missionaries landed in Bengal. They used to distribute homeopathic remedies among the poor people to alleviate their sufferings. Slowly the elite of society recognized its efficacy and many civil servants and military personnel became amateur homeopaths. On the other hand, due to the efficacy and affordability of the medicines, in the rural environment many school teachers also took to reading the homeopathic materia medicas and pr escribing to their village communities. In 1852 John Martin Hoenigberger, who was initiated into homeopathy by Hahnemann himself in Paris in 1835, published a book which gave a glimpse of the beginning of Indian homeopathic practice in Lahore, at the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In his chronicles, he gives a vivid account of his successful treatment of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's chronic disease of partial paralysis (Hoenigberger, 1852). During the second half of the nineteenth century some homeopathic dispensaries were opened in Bengal and in the south. The pioneer in this field in Calcutta was Rajendralal Dutta (1818-1889). He belonged to a scholarly and aristocratic family of Bengal. He engaged a French doctor, Dr. Tonnere, and placed him in charge of a homeopathic hospital and www.intechopen.com Homeopathy: Treatment of Cancer with the Banerji Protocols 127 dispensary in Calcutta in 1852. Unfortunately, this venture failed. Subsequently Rajen Dutta himself took up the cudgel and started practice in homeopathy. Among his illustrious patients may be mentioned the great early soci al reformer of a migraine which the conventional system had failed to cure. Furthermore the cure of a gangrenous ulcer of Raja Radhakanta Dev Bahadur created a sensation in Calcutta at the time. In order to strengthen the roots of homeopathic practice in India, Dutta looked around for a suitable person of eminence. His efforts were crowned with success when he was able to persuade Dr. Mahendralal Sircar, medical doct or and skeptic of homeopathy, to test its scientific efficacy and curative potential. In his experiment, administration of homeopathic medicines became effective even when Dr. Sirc ar's conventional medi cine failed. Thus Dr. Sircar became converted to homeopathy and carv ed a niche for it in the medical history of India. A number of allopathic doctors started homeopathic practice fo llowing Sircar's lead. The Calcutta Homeopathic Medical College, the first homeopathic medical college, was established in 1881. This institution took on a major role in popularizing homeopathy in India (Ghosh, 2010). Gradually homeopathic dispensaries opened in other cities like Benares and Allahabad, and by the beginning of the twentieth century home opathy had spread all over India. In 1973, the Government of India recognized homeopat hy by setting up the Central Council of Homeopathy (CCH) to regulate its education and practice. Now, only qualified registered homeopaths can practice homeopathy in India. At present, in India, homeopathy is probably the most popular system of medicine, due to the fact of its easy administration in the home setting and its affordability. 4. Cancer and homeopathy The role and efficacy of homeopathic medicines for treatment of malignant tumors is largely unknown and unproven so far. Homeopathic th erapy is mainly used for supportive cancer care and some have suggested an integration of this therapy with conventional methods (Kassab, et al., 2009). However, in numerous studies, it has been found that orthodox medicine is not meeting the needs of some patients and that Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) may wholly or part ly substitute for conventional medicines. Most patients indicate that their problems improve with CAM (Ernst, 2005; Frenkel, 2010). Cancer is a subject of great concern because ther e is a lack of effective treatment even in the 21st century. Along with a search for conventional solutions, researchers are actively trying to identify treatment options offered by vari ous systems of complementary and alternative medicine, including homeopathy. We believe th at the Banerji Protocols have an important role to play in this effort. A comprehensive worldwide survey of studies of the use of complementary and alternative medicine by cancer patients concluded that its use is common and widespread. Within this broad arena of therapies, homeopathy is consiste ntly listed as one of the systems chosen by patients with cancer (Ernst, 2000). A large descr iptive survey of cancer patients in Europe found that on average 35.9% were using so me form of complementary or alternative therapy. Homeopathy was the most commonly used of these therapies in Belgium and was in the top five choices in six other countries. In other European countries, it was second only www.intechopen.com A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy 128 to herbal medicines. In France, a recent stud y in an oncology department revealed that 34% of the patients were using complementar y medicine and homeopathy was the most frequently used of these (Tr\u00e4ger-Maury, 2007). Homeopathy is one of the eight most popular complementary therapies used by cancer patients in the UK (Chang, 2011). A recently reported European study conducte d a prospective one-year observational study of cancer patients comparing one cohort of 2 59 patients under homeopathic treatment with a matched cohort of 380 patients undergoing co nventional treatment. Outcomes compared included quality of life (QOL), fatigue, an d anxiety/depression. Th e researchers found a significant improvement in quality of life in the homeopathy group after three months and a continued improvement after twelve months. The conventionally treated group had no improvement in one QOL scale after three mont hs and a slight improvement in the other QOL scale; at twelve months there was a slight increase in one indicator and a decrease in the other. Fatigue and anxiety/depression were not improved in the conventionally treated group; fatigue but not anxiety/depression impr oved in the homeopathy group (Rostock, et al., 2011). A meta-analysis of all clinical st udies on cancer trea tment outcomes using homeopathy (Milazzo et al., 2006) found that a ll studies examined we re investigating the use of homeopathy for adjunctive symptom trea tment, not as primary antitumor treatment. There are a number of in vitro and in vivo studies, however, that have investigated the antitumor activity of homeopathic medicines. In India, the laboratory of Khuda-Bukhsh has reported a significant anti-tumor effect of homeopathically prepared Chelidonium and Lycopodium (Banerji, A., et al., 2010; Pathak, S. et al., 2006). In America, several studies have reported the in antitumor effect of five homeop athic remedies used for treatment of prostate cancer. There was a 23% reduction in tumor in cidence, and for animals with tumors, there was a 38% reduction in tumor volume in ho meopathy-treated animals versus controls (Jonas, W.B., 2006). However, in another stud y there were no direct cellular anticancer effects demonstrated in these re searchers' in vitro and in vivo studies (Thangapazham, R.L., 2006). A third study examined in vivo effects on mice treated with homeopathically prepared Sabal serrulata and clearly demonstrated a biologic response to homeopathic treatment as manifested by cell proliferation and tumo r growth. Two other homeopathic medicines tested did not show similar anti-tumor effe cts (MacLaughlin, B.W., 2006). Another study done in India reported that homeopathic drug s retarded liver tumor growth in mice and reduced the incidence of chemically-induced sa rcomas and also increa sed the life span of mice harboring these tumors (Kumar, K.B., 2007). What we see in this review of laboratory research of homeopathy is consistent reports of its effectiveness in slowing tumor growth in mice without a clear mechanism of action being demonstrated. Our own studies done in collaboration with American researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas must be mentioned at this point, for they have demonstrated plausible biological mechanisms for the antitumor effects of the homeopathic medicines tested. In one report we described 15 patients diagnosed with documented intracranial tumors who were treated ex clusively with chemothe rapy or radiation. Of these 15 patients, six of the seven who had g lioma showed complete regression of the tumors. In this study we also reported th at these medicines stimulated induction of survival-signaling pathways in normal lymphocytes and induction of death-signaling pathways in brain cancer cells. Cancer cell death was initiated by telomere erosion and www.intechopen.com Homeopathy: Treatment of Cancer with the Banerji Protocols 129 completed through mitotic catastrophe events (Pathak, S., 2003). More recently we reported a study of four homeopathic remedies that we use for treating breast cancer against two human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF -7 and MDA-MB-231) and a cell line derived from immortalized normal human mammary epithelial cells. The remedies exerted preferential cytotoxic effects against the tw o breast cancer cell lines, causing cell cycle delay/arrest and apoptosis. These effects were accompanied by altered expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins, including down regulation of phosphorylated Rb and upregulation of the CDK inhibitor p27, whic h were likely responsible for the cell cycle delay/arrest as well as induction of the apopto tic cascade that manifested in the activation of caspase 7 and cleavage of PARP in th e treated cells (Frenkel, et al., 2010). 5. Evolution of the Banerji Protocols Research in homeopathy and the introduction of Homeopathic medicinal mixtures in India are due to the late Dr. Pareshnath Banerji, nephew of illustrious Pandit Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, who himself happened to be an ar dent follower of homeopathy after his above- described cure. Dr. Banerji started his charitable clinic in a remote village, Mihijam, situated in the border of Bihar in 1918 and soon beca me a legend. He achiev ed phenomenal success against all kinds of disease. He could declare with certainty that he would cure both acute and chronic conditions of innumerable commo n people, who congregated at his village clinic seeking relief from all variety of illnesses. Treating his patients gratis, he naturally had to deal with a vast number of patients every day. If he had followed the classical homeopathic approach to case assessment, he would have been able to examine at most a dozen patients a day. He found that about 80% of his patients suffering from common ailments were curable by specific homeopathic remedies, making his clinical dispensation as quick as lightning. For the remaining 20%, he gave the greatest importance to symptoms narrated by the patients themselves. Thus he achieved success through sheer practical experience. He did not always ad here to Hahnemann's dictum of \"Single simple and minimum .\" He did not mind prescribing mixtures of remedies or frequent repetitions of the remedies when required. 5.1 The Banerji Protocols: What are they? Homeopathy as a school of medicine is very yo ung, only 200 years old. Our family has been associated with it for over 150 years. It can be said that the Banerji Protocols are the fruit of a cumulative experience and careful analysis of observ ed trends in patient - medicine interaction and the translation of the same into a system of prescri bing with a view to standardize and make easy the practice of an extremely complex system of medicine using ul tradilute medicines. The use of specific medicines in specific potencies, in fixed dosage patterns, eliminates the necessity for any guess work on the part of no vice practitioners and is always a tremendous help for even seasoned doctors. Our approach is more diagnostic than individualistic, i.e. more objective than subjective. These protocols ar e easy to learn and since the focus is on the diagnostic approach the case-taking time is shor tened. That is why it is easy to disseminate to medical students and the general public. In a short time more patients can be treated. Consequently, it also makes the treatment affo rdable to the weaker sections of society, making it \"The People's Medicine.\" For any scientific medical system it is a rule that www.intechopen.com A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy 130 interventions should be repeated with almost the same result - meaning, a treatment should have replicability - and the Banerji Protocols fulfill this criterion. 5.2 The Banerji Protocols (BP) in the treatment of cancer In our clinic in Kolkata, Indi a, an average patient turnout of 1000 to 1200 a day gives us a clear perspective as to disease and treatment tren ds in the population we serve. We treat an average of 10 to 15% of our patient turnout - 120 to 200 cancer cases a day - whose suffering from this dreaded disease has helped us to fo rmulate set protocols for their treatment. At present, patients from more than sevent y countries follow the Banerji Protocols for treatment of their cancer through the webs ite www.pbhrfindia.org, seeking online medical advice and treatment. In our c linics we are privileged to have the opportunity to treat every type of cancer and every stage of the disease. The majority of our patients opt to take only our treatment without any conven tional treatments and we also have patients who use our medicines as adjunct therapy along with or afte r conventional treatments fail. We often also have patients who come to us to seek relief from the various side-effects of conventional chemotherapy and radiation. Our protocols for the different types of cancer are mostly customized according to the location and tissu e type, and the specific medicines, in their specific dilutions and dosage pattern s, have been standardized by us. 5.3 The Banerji cancer treatment protocols The main objective we follow while taking on th e treatment of our cancer cases is to provide them with a better quality of life and, if possi ble, to provide a permanent cure. The Banerji Protocols are designed taking into account the diagnosis as well as the various comp laints being suffered by the patients. We give a basic set of medicines to treat each cancer type and have 1st line, 2nd line and in most scenarios 3rd line medicines already thought out and designated. This is complemented by preset medicines to give palliative relief to the suffering of the patients brought on by acco mpanying symptoms. This is the basis of the Banerji Protocols, where quality of life is gi ven paramount importance. The medicines that we use for different types of cancer are listed in detail in Table 1, but require an insight into cancer care for the practitioner in terms of pathology and the cause and effect of the morbid situation affecting the individual.

To this end, we maintain a recently upgraded, state-of-the-art computer network with a high-end server and five nodes. Our system also has two stand-alones for internet access and im age processing and storage. At present our patient database running on customized softwa re on Oracle and MS Visual Basic has more than 20,000 cases inputted with more than half a million visits recorded. The data consists of approximately 60 cancer types by site, including tw o cases of cancer of the heart. This data is the epicenter of the PBHRF and makes us a ttractive to researchers from premiere institutions throughout the world. Clinicians and researchers from many of these institutions have visited our clinics for an in sight into our way of treatment. This is an ongoing research initiative that has been active since 2002, though due to our access to cases prior to this date, we have been able to get a wider perspective from even earlier in our experience. At present, we are in the proc ess of collaborating with researchers from the National Cancer Institute of the United States with the desire to mine the data and use the information to understand better the sphere of efficacy, as well as to fine tune our protocols. 5.5 Cancer treatment outcomes at PBHRF with the Banerji Protocols In the six months prior to preparation of this manuscript, we saw a total of 1856 cancer cases at PBHRF. Table 2 shows the types of cancer treated during this period.

According to TNM classification of the tumor in this case, the growth was T2, N1, M0 - Stage II; if it was a case of metastasis from an unknown primary, then it would be staged at Stage IV. Addi tional chest X-rays were done on several occasions. The last was on 7th of January 1999, which showed complete reso lution of the mediastinal tumor (Figure 7). There were no complications during treatment. We are still reviewin g the case off and on but there has been no recurrence. 6.2 Case 2 - Esophageal cancer Male, aged 75 years, was suffering for two months with difficulty in swallowing food, heartburn and belching, when he ca me to us for his treatment on 16th of December 1996. www.intechopen.com Homeopathy: Treatment of Cancer with the Banerji Protocols 137 Clinically the patient presente d with dysphagia, heartburn an d belching.

Worldwide interest in the Banerji Protocols However, since 1997, there have been winds of change. It was this year when the National I n s t i t u t e s o f H e a l t h ( N I H ) o f t h e U n i t e d S t a t e s a s k e d u s t o p r o d u c e r e c o r d s o f o u r successes as part of their Best Case Series programme for evaluating clinical data from alternative healthcare practitioners. We su bmitted complete records of cured cases in 1997, and our presentation of cases was accepted after detailed scrutiny by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1999. Subsequently, we provided a six-hour presentation before a 17-member Cancer Advisory Panel. This panel included cancer specialists from all the leading American Comprehensive Cancer Centers, including the Washington Cancer Institute, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, The Memorial Sl oan Kettering Cancer Center, and The Johns Hopkins Medical Center. The panel accepted our presentation unanimously, and this was inde ed a great victory for homeopathy (Banerji, 2008). Since then we have had many visitors from th e United States includin g: Dr. Jeffrey White, MD, Director, Office of Cancer Complementar y and Alternative Medicine, National Cancer Institute; Dr. Moshe Frenkel, Associate Prof essor of Integrative Medicine and Medical Director of the Integrative Medicine Program, Division of Cancer Medicine Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center; Dr. Elena Ladas, MS, RD, Di rector, and Dr. Kara M. Kelly, MD, Medical Director of the Integrative Therapies Prog ram for Children with Cancer, Division of Pediatric Oncology, and others from Columbia University; and Dr. Barbara Sarter, now at the University of San Diego, who spent five months in Kolkata to study the Banerji Protocols and work with us when she held a faculty position in the Depar tment of Family Medicine at the University of Southern California; she has a long background in conventional medicine, and also a degree in classical homeopathy. www.intechopen.com Homeopathy: Treatment of Cancer with the Banerji Protocols 141 An important aspect of the PBHRF's activi ties is research, and under its banner, Drs. Banerji have been involved in recent ye ars in collaborative re search projects with American institutes of international renown which include the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Columbia Universi ty, and the University of Kansas Medical Center. Since 1977, Drs. Banerji have been invited to a large number of prestigious international conferences, symposia, seminars and meetings to deliv er lectures, present papers, or discuss important aspects of their wo rk. Patients from more than 70 countries at present follow the Banerji Protocols throug h the website www.pbhrfindia.org, seeking online medical advice and treatment. Spain has assumed great import ance for our work in recent years. In 2008, a three- member cancer support team from Spain undertook a week-long visit to PBHRF to acquire firsthand knowledge about the Banerji Pr otocols; two hold senior positions at the University of Barcelona, while the third runs a Valencia-based web portal f or cancer support, which is visited by nearly 1000 persons daily, not only in Spain, but also in Spanish-speaking countries elsewhere in the world - with many enquiries on the Bane rji Protocols. The response of Spanish homeopaths, pharmacist s and patients to the Banerji Protocols has been extremely enthusiastic. In 2008, Drs. Banerji made a presentation at a conference exclusively for classical homeopaths who enthus iastically welcomed the Banerji Protocols. A documentary film on Dr. Prasanta Banerji is now being made by two Spanish documentary film makers who have undertaken visits to Kolkata and Mihijam. In 2009, Drs. Banerji visited Japan twice, and there are excellent prospects for the popularization of treatment in this country us ing the Banerji Protocols. They are scheduled to visit again by invitation from the Royal Academy of Homeopathy, for more seminars in October 2011. 8. Conclusion: Winds of change Compared to conventional medicine, homeop athy has always suffered from a lack of credibility and recognition the world over, havi ng been acceptable only to those who cannot afford the high costs of conventional medica l treatment. However, since 1977, there have been winds of change. There has, on the one hand, been a perceptible lack of success of conventional medicine to cure various ailments and diseases - notably cancer - and, on the other, the serious - and growing - concern of researchers to identify options for medical treatment offered by various streams of alternative medicine, including homeopathy. It is here that the Banerji Protocols of treatment, based on the use of homeopathic medicines, have had an important role to play. Dr. Prasan ta Banerji and Dr. Pratip Banerji, along with their assistants, together attend 1000 to 1 200 patients every day, including 300 to 400 patients at their free clinic, in K o l k a t a . B y s o d o i n g , t h e y keep up the tradition of their revered forefathers, help make the Banerji Pr otocols a mode of medical treatment for the masses - the second important objective of the PBHRF \u2014 and ensure the collection, documentation and use in meaningful research in the years to come. The operations of the PBHRF and the development of the Banerji Pr otocols have been giving homeopathy a scientific basis and making it eligible for scientific research. www.intechopen.com A Compendium of Essays on Alternative Therapy 142 8.1 Looking at the future To meaningfully serve medical science and humanity, homeopathy required a rebirth. Perhaps nothing can provide this better than the Banerji Protocols and the work of the PBHRF, both aimed at making homeopathy with the use of the Banerji Protocols scientifically acceptable. Opposition to the Banerji Protocols and th e work of the PBHRF from the scientific community and followers of classical homeopathy notwithstanding, everything augurs well for the rebirth of homeopathy. Much is required to make the Banerji Protocols and the role of the PBHRF known everywhere in the world. 9.
