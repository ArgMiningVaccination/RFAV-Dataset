Integrative Health and Menopause The practice of Integrative Medicine blends conventional care with evidence-based traditional and complementary approaches to support whole-person health and wellness. Integrative medicine encompasses mind-body-spirit approaches such a yoga, tai chi, and mindfulness as well as acupuncture and natural/botanical supplements. Integrative medicine has a unique role in supporting a person's mind-body-spirit as they transition through menopause. Yoga, tai chi, and mindfulness have been shown to improve symptoms in menopause including hot flashes and mood disturbances. Incorporating integrative mind-body-spirit practices into a treatment plan can also be incredibly helpful in coping with stress and supporting healthy sleep. There is also emerging data to support other integrative approaches including hypnotherapy and acupuncture which can be helpful in managing difficult to control symptoms during menopause. Natural products and dietary supplements remain a popular approach for people seeking symptom relief during menopause, but the data supporting use of these products is limited and inconclusive. There can also be a significant risk of harm from these products due to adverse side effects and/or interactions with medications. Finding reliable information about the safe and careful use of supplements remains a challenge for many persons experiencing menopausal symptoms. Using an integrative approach, patients can discuss the use of these products with their healthcare team to determine a risk and benefit assessment of using these products that is tailored to their individual health goals. Ultimately, the use of integrative medicine within the UCLA Menopause Program supports a personalized approach to care that can support a person going through perimenopause or in menopause.
