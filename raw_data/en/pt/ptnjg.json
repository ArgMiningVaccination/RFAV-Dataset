Although generally safe, space heaters can spew toxic fumes or tip over and spill fuel, igniting a flash fire. Properly install and vent the heater, leaving lots of \"space\" around the unit. Don't leave a space heater on overnight or when no one is in the room. Plug in a detector to prevent deadly poisoning by colorless, odorless carbon monoxide (CO). Select a heater with a guard around the flame or heating element. Choose a heater with a \"tip switch\" designed to auto- matically turn off the heater if it's knocked over. Keep portable oxygen tanks and flammable items away from space heaters. Always choose a heater tested and labeled by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.Hot Flash!Cystic Fibrosis Grows Up Each year nearly 3,000 babies are born with cystic fibrosis (CF), a progressive inherited disorder that causes the body to produce thick mucus that clogs the lungs, digestive tract, sweat glands and reproductive organs. An estimated 30,000 Americans are living with the chronic disease, which predominately afflicts Cauca - sians of Northern European ancestry, Latinos and Native Americans. \"Twenty years ago, cystic fibrosis was a fatal childhood disease,\" says R. Fred - eric Knauft, M.D., director of the adult program at the Central Connecticut Cystic Fibrosis Center (CCCFC) at Hartford Hospital. \"Today, median life expectancy is 38.\" Since 40 percent of CF patients are now over 18, it no longer makes sense to treat them in a pediatric setting. The national Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has ac - credited the Hartford Hospital-Connecticut Children's Medical Center partnership as the only Center of Care in the region\u2014and one of only 117 in the nation\u2014to provide multidisciplinary care to patients of all ages. An estimated 1,000 new cases of cystic fibrosis are diagnosed each year in the United States. Although 70 percent of cases are identified before age two, individ - uals with mild symptoms sometimes go undiagnosed. Connecticut does not require newborn CF screening, although Hartford Hospital offers prenatal testing for CF and other common genetic mutations to pregnant women with a family history of the disorder. Since the recessive trait causes symptoms only when both parents pass along a defective gene, an estimated 12 million Americans don't know they're carriers of a chromosomal (genetic) abnormality. Scientists have identified the faulty gene that impairs protein synthesis, leading to clogged airways, diabetes and life-threaten - ing lung infections. Medical advances and breakthroughs in gene therapy hold promise of an eventual cure, while patients are living longer than ever before. \"Increasing life expectancy presents adult-specific challenges tied to disease progression,\" adds Dr. Knauft. \"The Center's physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers and infection control specialists have worked tirelessly to transition adults from pediatric and adolescent models of care to a system of chronic disease manage - ment with better clinical outcomes.\" 2Do you want to reach a new level of health and vitality? What changes are you willing to make to look and feel better? Exceptional health care providers and a top-flight fitness facility are creating a one-of-a-kind wellness center in the region's hottest new retail and entertainment destination: Blue Back Square in West Hartford Center. Hartford Hospital's new \"Healthy Weight and Wellness Center\" combines nutritional counseling and exercise for weight loss, well-being, and personal fitness. The dazzling surroundings promote health and wellness in a convenient suburban setting. Hartford Hospital's Christine M. Greene, Ph.D., offers nutrition, exercise and lifestyle management consultations that incorporate the best practices of long- term weight loss success. Consultations are by appointment and new clients are currently being scheduled. Future plans include incorporating on-site exercise training through a partnership with the recently opened New York Sports Club on the east side of Blue Back Square. The fitness club offers plush locker rooms, a sizable pool, secluded exercise spots, cardio kickboxing or vinyasa yoga classes (included in the membership fee), weight machines, free weights, spinning workouts, sauna, whirlpool and more. \"We offer a warm, encouraging and cooperative way for individuals to reach their weight loss and fitness goals,\" says Dr. Greene. \"We recognize that for some people the relationship with food is quite complex. For this reason, we have designed our program to integrate with other medi - cal services. One example would be bariatric (weight loss) surgery. Patients are encouraged to seek lifestyle support, including continued nutritional counseling and exercise pre - scriptions, to help them learn how to change their eating habits and maintain their surgical weight loss.\" No matter what your desired level of fitness, you will begin a tailored program to change your lifestyle with the help of skilled exercise specialists and caring nutritional experts. You will be guided, encouraged and supported every step of the way with advice, information, recipes and educational seminars. \"Our program is very flexible. If someone prefers to maintain their own exercise program, they can still make an appointment for nutritional counseling,\" adds Dr. Greene. \"Often, there are cultural and societal factors that make lifestyle changes difficult. We use a team approach to help individuals modify their behavior, and since we are located in the wellness center, we can easily make referrals to behavioral therapy professionals if someone needs help beyond nutritional counseling.\" Lifestyles of the Fit and Healthy Christine M. Greene, Ph.D., shops for some healthy foods. 3Urologist Steven J. Shichman, M.D, (left) pioneered a minimally invasive technique for kidney cancer. He is shown here with Edward Myer, M.D., chief urology resident. In today's high-tech operating room, surgery is shrinking. Surgeons slice tiny slits in the skin and insert slender instruments through incisions roughly the size of a buttonhole. The intricate mysteries of the body yield to thin, flexible fiber - optic scopes with shining cameras that illuminate the vast world beneath the skin. Before navigating the body's hidden terrain, surgeons map the inner landscape with three-di - mensional imagery to pinpoint the surgical field. Armed with miniature instruments that snip and stitch, the surgeon makes the fewest possible cuts, stanching the bleeding with the soft buzz of a ultrasonic device while scrutinizing the magnified image on an overhead video monitor. Smaller scars, reduced pain, minimal blood loss and shorter recovery times have spurred the rapid growth of minimally invasive surgery over the past decade. Surgeons avoid cutting deeply into the skin and underlying muscles, instead making small entry ports for the miniature camera and down - sized instruments. For frail or elderly patients, minimally invasive techniques allow life-saving surgery with far less risk than conventional \"open\" methods. The patient lies swathed in surgical drapes as the physician makes a short incision and inserts a narrow laparoscope, a fiberoptic camera only slightly wider than a pencil. As the scope glides into the body, the surgeon follows its lighted path, eyes fixed intently on the video screen. Laparoscopic surgery is now routine for gallbladder removal or hernia repair, as well as many abdomi - nal procedures. Patients go home wearing only bandaids over their incisions. \"Minimally invasive surgery is tailored to a more patient-centered approach,\" says Orlando C. Kirton, M.D., director of the Department of Surgery. \"With minimal intrusiveness and small port access, surgeons can achieve better outcomes with shorter hospital stays and less need for pain medications. Hartford Hospital is technologically at the fore - front, providing the best surgical care possible in the least invasive way.\" Interventional radiologists use minimally inva - sive techniques and high-resolution imaging tech - nologies to guide instruments through the vessels to the farthest regions of the body. Endoscopes look into the esophagus, stomach, and portions of the intestine through the body's natural open - ings. When surgery becomes necessary, laparos - copy opens a small window to the internal organs. Less Is More Minimally invasive surgery means less pain and faster recovery Over the years, Hartford Hospital has pioneered complex, yet minimally invasive, techniques for cancer surgery, heart bypass, bariatric (weight loss) surgery and more. The Surgeon's Art The da Vinci surgical robot takes minimally invasive surgery one step further. In 2003, Hart - ford Hospital became the first medical center in Connecticut to offer nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery with robotic-assisted techniques. As in conventional laparoscopy, instruments are inserted through the belly button and several small (less than an inch long) incisions in the patient's abdomen. Seated at a console next to the operating table, a urologist scrutinizes im - ages relayed to a viewfinder by a tiny fiberoptic camera as instruments wielded by robotic arms move in sync with the movements of his hands. \"The surgeon retains complete control,\" explains Joseph R. Wagner, M.D., the first of several Hartford Hospital urologists trained on the da Vinci surgical robot. \"The greatly magnified three- dimensional view allows precise removal of the cancerous prostate gland while preserving urinary continence and vital nerves essential for sexual function.\" While robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery to remove a cancerous prostate gland is a daily occurrence, Hartford Hospital is the only medical center in the state to routinely use the hospital's surgical robot for bladder cancer. Surgical removal of the bladder is often necessary for invasive can - cer that has spread into the muscle wall. When - ever possible, Dr. Wagner sculpts a new bladder from the patient's own tissue. Innovations in robotic-assisted techniques have revolutionized surgical control and precision, automating complex and repetitive maneuvers to reduce fatigue during complex or lengthy surger - ies. Even the steadiest of human hands cannot match those of a surgical robot. The Beating Heart Hartford Hospital's cardiac surgeons were the first in the region to harness the power of robot - ics to perform heart operations with speed, safety and smaller scars. Until recently, the complexity of cardiac surgery limited heart operations to the conventional, open method. Curved and tapered 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Rocco Orlando, III, M.D. tools have improved accuracy and dexterity, enhancing the cardiac surgeon's ability to repair heart valve abnormalities and cardiac defects. \"We can perform coronary artery bypass surgery on a beating heart without a heart-lung machine in selected patients,\" explains cardiac surgeon Robert Gallagher, M.D. \"Minimally invasive techniques are especially safe for older and sicker patients. Ten years ago we had to cut ribs to perform a valve repair, but now we have smaller, better tools. Patients benefit from less bleeding, less pain and easier recovery.\" Many patients benefit from balloon angioplasty to open blocked coronary arteries or drug-eluting stents (to keep the artery open) delivered by cath - eters inserted through a small incision in the groin. Coronary artery bypass surgery has been shown to extend the lives of patients with heart disease. Robotic-assisted surgery has a steep learning curve and requires specialized training, but for some patients, offers clear advantages, including fewer transfusions, less risk of wound infection and, in many cases, better clinical outcomes. Assisted by a surgical robot, surgeons can perform more technically demanding procedures, thanks to the flexibility of the instrumentation and high-definition 3-D vision. Support from donors helped underwrite the cost of an additional million-dollar robot. \"The da Vinci offers spectacular optics and visualization,\" says cardiac surgeon David Underhill, M.D., who, along with Dr. Gallagher, is using the robot for bypass surgery. \"We see views inside the chest that we wouldn't see in conventional surgery.\" Smaller Scars Kidney cancer is on the rise, as better diagnostic imaging leads to earlier detection. Since 1998, when he pioneered an innovative laparoscopic procedure for kidney removal, urologist Steven J. Shichman, M.D., has seen a profound shift toward minimally invasive surgery for kidney cancer. In a complex procedure called laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, he makes four half-inch-long abdominal ports for instruments and removes the cancerous tumor through a two-inch incision in the belly button. The kidney is isolated from the surrounding organs, yet left attached to its artery and vein. Both are temporarily clamped and the tumor is meticulously cut out of the kidney. Using advanced suturing techniques, the kidney is repaired and the vessels are unclamped. \"We prefer to keep the vessels clamped for less than 30 minutes or the kidney tissue starts to die,\" explains Dr. Shichman. \"Working with Dr. Stuart Kesler, the newest member of the Department of Urology, we have started to use the robot to push the envelope and perform minimally invasive partial nephrectomies in patients with larger tumors that usually require open surgery.\" Patients come to Hartford Hospital from Florida, the eastern seaboard and as far away as Greece to have laparoscopic kidney surgery. Dr. Shichman teaches these new techniques in courses given by the American Urologic Association's training center in Houston, Texas. \"Today, whenever possible, we just remove the tumor, leaving as much of the kidney as we can. We have found that the more of the kidney we pre - serve, the better the patient's overall health and longevity.\" Kidney cancer can be cured only if the tumor is diagnosed early and removed before cancerous cells migrate out of the kidney, since no adjuvant therapies\u2014chemotherapy or radiation\u2014exist to cure kidney cancer. In the Rocco Orlando, III, M.D., a fellow of the American College of Surgeons, specializes in general surgery and surgical critical care. He is Board- certified in surgery and surgical criti - cal care, and is a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Connecti - cut (UConn) School of Medicine. A surgeon with Connecticut Surgical Group, he is president of Hartford Hospital's medical staff. A graduate of Hamilton College, Dr. Orlando attended medical school at UConn and did his internship at Hartford Hospital in medicine and general surgery from 1978-1983. He joined Hartford Hospital in 1984 after completing a fellowship at the University of Miami in critical care medicine. Among his areas of specialty are laparoscopic surgery and minimally invasive surgery. He and his col- leagues have published techniques for hand-assisted management of liver tumors and pancreatic cancer, as well as research on laparoscopy in the critically ill, among many other topics. Dr. Orlando, who enjoys hiking and traveling, lives in Glastonbury with his wife, Joanne, a Unitarian minister. He has two college-age children. 6past, removal of a cancerous kidney required almost a foot-long incision through the abdomen, flank or chest. Minimally invasive laparoscopic tech - niques reduce blood loss, shorten hospital stays, and speed recovery. Safer Surgery Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a widespread complaint, afflict - ing nearly 20 million Ame ricans. While the condition can usually be controlled with medication, severe GERD sometimes necessitates surgery. Another fre - quent stomach complaint is a hiatal hernia, which occurs when the diaphragm tears and the stomach protrudes into the chest. \"We perform laparoscopic surgery even on very elderly patients who would not be able to tolerate an open operation,\" says surgeon Rocco Orlando, III, M.D. \"Patients recover faster because there's less trauma.\" The incidence of esophageal cancer has soared over the past 30 years and is now rising faster than any other cancer in adults. Minimally invasive procedures can be used for removal of malignancies in the esophagus, as well as the stomach, pancreas, liver and spleen. Dr. Orlando has developed a hand-assisted technique for removal of liver tumors that allows him to reach in and feel the organ, since the surgeon has no sense of touch with conven - tional laparoscopic techniques. For those who aren't candidates for surgery to remove liver tumors, Dr. Orlando performs cryoablation, a minimally inva - sive procedure that relies on laparoscopic techniques to \"freeze\" cancerous lesions. Gynecology Today at Hartford Hospital, minimally invasive surgery is routine for fibroid tumors, ovarian cysts, (re - moval the uterus) are performed vaginally,\" says urogynecologist Christine LaSala, M.D. Hartford Hospital is the only medical center in the Northeast to use a sur - gical robot for urogynecological surgery. The da Vinci robot can be used for gynecological cancers and pelvic reconstructive surgery to repair a prolapsed uterus or vagina, although surgery is performed vaginally whenever possible. \"Many procedures can be performed with laparoscopy,\" adds urogynecologist Paul K. Tulikangas, M.D. \"Women over age 75 aren't candidates for the robot because of the risks of general anesthesia.\" While laparoscopy reduces the need for an open procedure and shortens recovery times, the robot offers unprecedented control and precision during lengthy or difficult operations. \"Laparoscopic procedures can sometimes be technically difficult and require large amounts of suturing,\" explains urogy - necologist Adam C. Steinberg, D.O. \"Robotic surgery allows us to perform the same procedures with greater ease.\" \"Conventional surgery requires a long surgical incision that can take up to eight weeks to heal,\" says Dr. LaSala. \"The robot makes the procedure easier to perform so we can often avoid an abdominal incision.\" \"Pelvic prolapse is an embarrassing problem,\" says a patient who asked that her name not be used, whose pelvic reconstruction was performed by Dr. Steinberg. \"It helps to have a doctor with a sense of humor.

For nearly five million aging Americans, congestive heart failure brings frightening trips to the emergency room and recurrent hospitalizations. In the United States, 550,000 new cases of CHF are diagnosed each year. The condition usually develops gradually as the result of a heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pres - sure, heart defect or viral infection. During a heart attack, a sudden clot blocks a coro - nary artery, sometimes damaging the oxygen-starved heart muscle permanently. When the heart can't pump forcefully enough, blood flow drops as the heart struggles to supply oxy - gen and nutrients to the brain and vital organs. The chambers of the heart stretch to hold more blood, but over time, the heart muscle walls weaken and pump - ing slows. The kidneys respond by causing the body to retain water and sodium. Blood backs up into the veins leading to the heart, excess fluid pools in the lower legs and ankles, and the belly becomes swollen and congested. Fluid fills the lungs, causing shortness of breath, especially when lying down. When so much fluid accumulates that diuretics (water pills) no longer work, the usual treatment is hospitalization for intravenous (IV) administration of medications. In hospitals across the country, conges - tive heart failure is the leading cause of hospitaliza - tion for patients age 65 and over. \"Repeated hospitalizations are a medical and finan - cial burden,\" says Detlef Wencker, M.D., who recently joined the Henry Low Heart Center as director of the Heart Failure and Transplant Center. \"Nationally, the average stay for CHF patients is five to six days\u2014and 50 percent are readmitted to the hospital within six months. Outpatient infusions have been shown to re - duce hospital readmissions by as much as 91 percent.\" Hartford Hospital's new infusion center is chang- ing the way today's patients are living with heart disease. The Henry Low Heart Center, with generous support from donors, funds the infusion center. The state-of-the-art outpatient treatment facility is dedi - cated to caring for patients at the advanced stage of heart failure. Intravenous administration of medica -tions rapidly improves symptoms and restores normal fluid status. In addition, one-on-one nutritional counseling helps patients adhere to a complex medi - cal regimen and a specialized low-sodium (salt) diet, while learning to recognize weight gain that signals fluid retention. Cardiac rehabilitation and individual - ized exercise plans strengthen the heart muscle to improve circulation and support the recovery process. \"Patients do better when they stay out of the hospital,\" says Dr. Wencker, \"Our results show clearly that outpatient infusion with IV diuretics keeps heart failure patients mobile, which translates into better outcomes. Just being in bed for six days in the hospital worsens patients' cardiovascular condi - tion and outcomes. Although the expected mortal - ity rate for acute decompensated CHF is about 30 percent at one year, we saw only about five percent in our patient population. Patients referred to us by a cardiologist can call and come directly to the infu - sion center, avoiding the emergency department and hospitalization.\" The hospital's Heart Failure and Transplant Center offers comprehensive services to patients with vary - ing degrees of heart disease, ranging from treatment with drugs, cardiac pacing devices and implantable defibrillators all the way to heart transplantation, as one of only two transplant centers in the state. In patients with end-stage heart failure, an implant - able mechanical pump called a ventricular assist device (VAD) often serves as a \"bridge to transplant\" until a suitable donor heart becomes available. Not only does the infusion center provide thera - py in a convenient setting, but patients also receive a complete blood work-up at every visit, which keeps tabs on blood volume, total body water, electrolyte levels, kidney function and other indicators. As part of Dr. Wencker's research into the cellular mechanism of progressive heart failure in patients with end- stage heart failure, Hartford Hospital patients who meet specific criteria may be eligible to enroll in several groundbreaking clinical trials. \"We are part of multi-center studies of new pharmaco-therapies for CHF patients with severe fluid overload,\" explains Dr. Wencker. \"These thera - pies, from initial efficacy trials, are promising to reduce the number and length of stay of readmis - sions while improving symptoms.\" People are living longer with advanced heart failure. Even \"end-stage heart failure\" is no longer a death sentence, as heart transplant or mechanical heart pumps offer recovery from heart failure and a longer life span. For patients whose heart muscle can no longer pump vigorously, Hartford Hospital's infusion center can help ensure extra years of healthy life. 8Detlef Wencker, M.D., director of the Heart Failure and Transplant Center at the Henry Low Heart Center. | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & BreakthroughsAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when the center of the retina, the macula , undergoes deterio - ration, swelling or hemorrhage. The most common cause of central vision loss in those over age 50, AMD afflicts as many as 10 million Americans. Each year, approximately 200,000 people in the United States develop the condition. \"The cause of macular degeneration is unknown,\" says Alexander Gaudio, M.D., a Hartford retina specialist. \"How - ever, the roles of genetics and aging are indisputable. In addition, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, exposure to sunlight and blue eyes have been implicated.\" \"AMD often begins with blurred vision,\" says retina specialist Jerry Neuwirth, M.D., director of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hartford Hospital. \"It's not painful, but lines appear to bend or distort, with a blind spot in the center.\" Although the degenerative disease is progressive, the milder \"dry\" form usually is not as aggressive and sight threatening as the \"wet\" form of AMD. \"In 15 percent of people with dry AMD, abnormal blood vessels invade the macula, causing the conversion to \"wet\" AMD,\" says Dr. Gaudio. \"These vessels are leaky and fragile. They bleed Alzheimer's Link Variations in the SORL1 gene may be a factor in late-onset Alzheimer's disease, report the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and a group of international researchers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Three mutated genes were previ - ously shown to cause rare, early-onset Alzheimer's. Identifying genes involved in Alzheimer's may eventu - ally alert individuals at risk and speed new treatments.Warning Women The American Heart As - sociation warns that more women than previously suspected may be at risk for asymptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD), a cir - culatory problem that can lead to heart attack and stroke. The sharp increase is linked to rising rates of obesity and Type 2 diabe - tes, both cardiovascular risk factors. PAD can signal development of coronary artery disease.Dying of Loneliness People who are socially iso - lated die more often from all causes, and are more susceptible to the common cold, infections, cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Solinsky, M.D. \"At this conver - sion point, sight becomes threatened and can deteriorate quickly. With new advances in drug therapies showing great promise in halting the progression of AMD, it has become imperative to detect this conversion from dry to wet AMD earlier.\" Recently, a large study showed that antioxidants may help prevent the progression from dry to wet AMD. Before starting vitamin therapy, those at risk for AMD because of family history or aging should have a comprehensive eye exam performed by a qualified ophthalmologist. New treatments for wet AMD involve injecting the eye with drugs to help stop bleeding and impede the growth of new blood vessels. So far, the FDA has approved Lucentis for wet AMD. \"New therapies have revolutionized AMD treatment,\" says Dr. Neuwirth. \"Although not curative, 90 percent of patients maintained their sight with monthly injections of Lucentis and nearly 40 percent had significant improvement in their vision.\" Age-Related Macular Degeneration: In the Sights of Targeted Drugs 10At the Institute of Living (IOL), dogs are popular among the inpatient geriatric patients suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Dogs evoke a response in individuals reluctant to participate in programs or communicate with other people. Dogs don't care if someone is old or inconti - nent, withdrawn or disoriented. Pet therapy visits provide non-verbal and tactile comfort that helps break the cycle of loneliness, hopelessness and social withdrawal that often afflicts older adults. It's not surprising that dogs are welcome visitors at the IOL, which is seeking three or four more certified pet therapy dogs and volunteers for daytime visits. The therapeutic value of connections between humans and pets is well documented in the medical literature. \"Stress is a major component of disease in an inner city clinic,\" says Darrin D'Agostino, D.O., M.P.H., medical direc - tor of Integrative Medicine and director of the Ambulatory Pain Services. \"Ambulatory care patients often suffer from significant psychiatric disease in addition to organic dis - ease. Pets can be very therapeutic for anxiety and feelings of loss of control. In my opinion, pet therapy isn't ordered enough\u2014the least treated problem in the hospital is the physical and emotional stress of just being in the hospital.\" Pet owners, particularly the elderly, have lower blood pressure and higher self esteem than people who don't own a pet. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that coronary artery disease sufferers who went home from the hospital to pets were less likely to die within a year. While older people may worry about what will happen to their pets after they're gone, animals provide a reason for living for some patients. And, although cats don't visit Hartford Hospital, they offer the same life-saving benefits to their owners. \"Bringing a cat into a skilled nursing facil - ity keeps people happy,\" adds Dr. D'Agostino. \"Watching an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease petting a therapy dog on her bed, you know that these animals are giving the best of themselves.\" Dog Days in the ICU Patient Carl Pinto enjoys a visit from Lyle, a pet therapy-certified dog, and volunteer Susan Pennington. As any pet lover will tell you, dogs make people feel better. Scientific studies confirm what pet own - ers already know\u2014a pet's calming companionship comforts loss, soothes pain and reduces blood pressure. Gazing into the gentle eyes of a dog creates a strong emotional bond that can help patients cope with feelings of loneliness and isolation. For a bedridden geriatric patient, something as simple as the touch of a wet nose or a lick from a sandpaper tongue brings a smile. Popular in Europe for centuries, pet therapy arrived at Hartford Hospital in 1995, when Robert Martin, M.D., a retired oncologist, began making rounds with his puppy, Abby. After more than 10 years of service throughout the hospital, from pediatrics to palliative care, Abby was hon - ored posthumously with the Red Cross Hero Award in 2005. Today, there are 36 pet therapy-certified dogs in Hart - ford Hospital's program, which received both the Distin - guished Service Award and the Pet(s) of the Year Award in 2007 from the Connecticut Veterinarian Medical Association. Over the years, the pet therapy team has welcomed mixed breeds, rescued dogs, Jack Russell terriers, Irish wolf - hounds, Newfoundlands and golden retrievers, among many other dogs. \"Dogs go everywhere in the hospital but the operating room and maternity floor,\" says Volunteer Services Manager Kelly Boothby. \"Doctors and nurses can make a request via computer for a pet therapy visit to a hospitalized patient, even someone who is unresponsive or even unconscious in an intensive care unit. On nursing units, dogs go from room to room on a weekly basis, although anyone who is allergic to animals or doesn't want a visit can refuse. The dogs get attention, but they know they're working\u2014they go home exhausted.\" 11Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545-1888 or (800) 545-7664 for information about any program.

Cook until onions are soft and transpar - ent. Add the water and potatoes. Simmer until potatoes can be easily picked with a fork. Add the corn and simmer until soft, then stir in milk, pepper and red pepper. Cook on low until heated through. DO NOT boil. Serve immediately. Garnish with avocado and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Makes 6 half-cup servings.Sweet Corn Chowder with Avocado Warm up winter's chill with a steaming cup of hearty corn chowder, low in sodium yet rich in flavor. Adding a sprinkling of cilantro and cubed avocado lends a zesty tang to this thick and creamy soup. Avocados are related to cinnamon and sassafrass, with zero cholesterol and 60 percent more potas - sium than bananas. Revered by the Aztecs as an aphrodisiac, avocados are higher in fat content than other fruits, but aren't as fattening as you might think. High in heart- healthy monounsaturated fat, avocados contain beta-sitosterol, a beneficial plant-based fat believed to lower LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. Peak season for avocados is late winter and early spring.
