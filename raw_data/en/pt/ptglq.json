All Target Clean beauty, personal care, and cleaning products are formulated without the following: Propylparabens and BHT Aluminum (in deodorants) Artificial sweeteners (in toothpaste) Additionally, Target Clean feminine care, adult care, and diapers are free of added fragrance and chlorine. Target Clean pet foods do not have meat, poultry, or seafood as the first ingredient. They are free of artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. Choosing Target Clean products is an excellent starting point but it is not foolproof, and there are still some products you want to avoid within this category. For example, some contain other harmful ingredients such as the following: PEGs (polyethylene glycols) - penetration enhancers that may be [contaminated with 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide](https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/potential-contaminants-cosmetics/14-dioxane-cosmetics-manufacturing-byproduct)which are associated with reproductive, developmental, and endocrine effects, cancer, and DNA damage.

There is strong evidence that nitrosamines are carcinogenic, and they are banned from Canadian cosmetics. Phenoxyethanol -skin, eye, or lung irritant. In 2008, the [FDA warned consumers not to use Mommy's Bliss Nipple](https://www.healthywomen.org/content/blog-entry/fda-warns-mothers-about-mommys-bliss-nipple-cream)cream because it contained phenoxyethanol which was harmful to infants.
