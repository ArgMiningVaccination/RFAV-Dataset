His symptoms do not begin immediately, but approximately 12 hours after he receives the vaccination. He has no other associated symptoms such as fever, rash, swelling at the vaccination site, or difficulties with his breathing. He is slightly irritable during this time. The symptoms will persist for at least two days before he feels better. Vomiting has resulted in ER/Urgent care visits. The symptoms have occurred even when the vaccinations have been given individually. Would like advice on how to manage this patient's future vaccinations. Answer: Vomiting is an atypical adverse reaction following a vaccine, and even more unusual following different vaccines. While vomiting can occur following certain vaccines, the prolonged nature is also atypical. I have reached out to Dr John Kelso, an expert in vaccine adverse reactions, for his thoughts. Dr Kelso: Vomiting is specifically listed as a common side effect after DTaP and rotavirus vaccines ( [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm)), although this type of delayed, prolonged vomiting would be unusual. I do not believe there would be any sort of test to determine the mechanism or predict recurrence with these or other vaccines. I would consider prophylaxis with ondansetron, which comes in an oral solution, for future vaccines. Jeffrey G. "}
