The incidence of this disease is increasing in states across the U.S. Measles can be prevented by vaccination. If you were born after January 1, 1957, please ensure that you have had two MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccines or a blood test called a rubeola (measles) titer that shows you are immune to measles. Immunization Requirements Iowa State University requires that you provide [proof of immunity](http://www.health.iastate.edu/new-students/immunization-requirements/) to measles. If you have not provided Student Health with this information previously, we encourage you to verify your immunization records and provide them at this time. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others. If you need a MMR vaccine or a rubeola titer, you may call Student Health at 515-294-5801 to arrange an appointment. We urge you to learn more about measles and how you can protect yourself and others. Read more about the measles here: [Center "}
