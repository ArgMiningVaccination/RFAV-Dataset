Dr Simon Floreani has been banned from practising for six months and ordered not to make public comment or display information that discourages vaccination. The ruling by the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) comes after the Chiropractic Board of Australia referred Dr Floreani for professional misconduct in March 2019. The Board reported the chiropractor for his role in a YouTube video titled \"Nazi vaccine regime in Australia\". \"'Under my regulation and registration requirements, [I'm] not allowed to talk about vaccination,\" Dr Floreani said in the video. \"But under the laws of this country, I have to do what's right.\" Dr Floreani also likened childhood vaccines to poison in the video. \"We could not find one shred of evidence to show the efficacy of childhood vaccination,\" he said. He added: \"The evidence is not there to suggest that people are safe and our kids are safe.\" The Board also reported Dr Floreani after the film Vaxxed: From cover-up to catastrophe was screened at his clinic in December 2016. In pictures: Opposition Leader Albanese has vaccine as rollout continues Dr Floreani confirmed to VCAT the Board's allegations were true. VCAT said it had had \"no hesitation\" in finding Dr Floreani had engaged in professional misconduct considering the \"flawed, inaccurate and dangerous\" statements the chiropractor had made in the video. Dr Floreani's registration has been suspended for six months from October 18, 2021. Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) CEO Martin Fletcher said the ruling was particularly important given concerns about misinformation spreading about COVID-19 vaccines. \"While this matter predates the pandemic, I note the tribunal's consideration of the responsibility of chiropractors and other health practitioners in public discourse and that 'there is a potential for significant harm to the community when false claims are made which can directly impact public health,'\" he said. Chiropractic Board of Australia Chair, Dr Wayne Minter AM, said chiropractors breached the trust placed in their profession \"when they share or promote information that isn't evidence-based or in line with the best available health advice\".

Dr Floreani said he had been performing procedures on babies as young as just one week old and it was only getting more popular. \"I've been doing this 20 years, and the proportion of paediatric patients has gone from one in 10 to three or four in 10,\" he told A Current Affair.
