Excludes gift vouchers Here's the scenario - you walk into your favorite crystal shop (or, if you shop online, the crystal catalog opens) and, most likely, the first thing that draws your attention is the array of colors represented by those shimmering gemstones. Whether they're lying in little bowls on a table, hanging in strands on the wall, set behind glass cases or peer from stunning photos on the internet, they call to you like little sirens. You're hooked now and can hardly hold in your giddiness. You wander and can't help but want to touch (you know you do!). But we don't always choose our crystals - they choose us and, like it or not, it's because we need the particular healing energy that a certain stone carries and wears proudly by its color. Perhaps it's the vitality of red stones, the grounding energy of black, the soothing of blue or the energizing yellows. Color is as important in crystals as the energy they produce. Crystals are treasures of the Earth, packed with energy. They carry with them a variety of metaphysical properties that have been widely used for thousands of years. They can be used for healing, luck and prosperity to love, protection and removing negativity. Gemstones possess either receptive or projective energies. Receptive stones are magnetic, soothing; promoting love, calm and peace. They can be used for meditation and de-stressing and can promote wisdom, love, sleep, friendship, prosperity, fertility and growth. Projective stones are energizing; used for healing, luck, success, courage and self-confidence. Red, Orange & Yellow These are projective gemstones. Red crystals, such as, [Red Tiger Jasper](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-red%20jasper-stone.html), and [Garnet](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-garnet-stone.html) provide courage, vitality, will-power, passion and protection. Physically, red stones help boost the immune system, aid in blood circulation and help with problems associated with the reproductive organs. They are associated with the Root Chakra. Orange stones relate to personal power and are excellent for those with low self-esteem. They promote joy and give you a boost of confidence. Orange crystals, such as [Carnelian](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-carnelian-stone.html), [Sunstone](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-sunstone-stone.html), or [Orange Calcite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-orange%20calcite-stone.html) are helpful with kidney or bladder problems, exhaustion, food allergies and eating disorders. They are associated with the Sacral Chakra. Yellow stones, like [Citrine](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-citrine-stone.html), [Yellow Tiger Eye](https://www.healingcrystals.com/advanced_search_result.php?dropdown=Search+Products&keywords=Golden+Tiger+Eye), and [Yellow Calcite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/advanced_search_result.php?dropdown=Search+Products&keywords=yellow+calcite) are attributed to communication, concentration and self-expression as well as skin problems and digestive system disorders. They offer a \"sunny\" outlook and can increase prosperity. Use these stones on the Solar Plexus Chakra. Green, Blue & Purple These are receptive stones. Green stones are useful for healing, bringing luck or money and working with nature. Physically, green crystals keep the heart and respiratory system functioning properly as well as the immune system. They also help calm those that may suffer from anxiety, panic attacks and addictions. Green crystals are often associated with the Heart Chakra. Examples are [Malachite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-malachite-stone.html), [Green Aventurine](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-green%20aventurine-stone.html), [Moss Agate](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-moss%20agate-stone.html) and [Peridot](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-peridot-stone.html). and restful sleep (think 'deep ocean'). They are also used for healing, especially for reducing pain, inflammation, fevers and headaches. Blue crystals are good for increasing communication skills, intuition, helping with legal matters and long-distance travel. Examples are [Lapis Lazuli](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-lapis%20lazuli-stone.html), [Blue Lace Agate](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-blue%20lace%20agate-stone.html), [Sodalite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-sodalite-stone.html) and [Kyanite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-blue%20kyanite-stone.html). They are with the Throat or Third Eye Chakras. Purple gemstones, such as [Amethyst](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-amethyst-stone.html), [Lepidolite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-lepidolite-stone.html), and [Sugilite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-sugilite-stone.html) promote harmony, aid in meditation and reduce stress. They increase psychic awareness and inner wisdom. Physically, purple stones are great healing stones - relieving migraines, sleep disorders, asthma/allergy symptoms and problems from ear, nose and throat ailments. Purple crystals are often linked to the Brow Chakra. Black & White These two colors are receptive stones. White is used for safe travel, psychic abilities and intuition, as well as a true sense of purpose, and inspiration. Physically, white crystals help with bones and teeth and heal both the physical and spiritual body. [Moonstone](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-moonstone-stone.html), [Quartz Crystal](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-clear%20quartz-stone.html), [Selenite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-selenite-stone.html) and [Apophyllite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-apophyllite-stone.html) are good examples. They are associated with the Crown, Brow or Sacral Chakras. Black crystals, such as [Onyx](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-black%20onyx-stone.html), [Obsidian](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-black%20obsidian-stone.html) and [Jet](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-jet-stone.html), aid in getting rid of negativity, grounding and protection. They help one to move away from destructive influences and keep you from making the same mistakes repeatedly. Physically, black stones help with overstressed nerves, shock and trauma, as well as alleviating spinal problems. Black crystals are often associated with the Root Chakra. Rainbow Colors Gemstones that are multi-colored, such as [Tourmaline](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-tourmaline-stone.html) and Opal, are multi-purpose stones and carry the metaphysical properties associated with the colors that they possess. So, while you wander amidst the beautiful crystals and have your heart set on a specific color, you may just find yourself going home with something totally different and unexpected - the crystals have chosen you, for they know you need them, whether you realize it or not.
