A healthy diet provides the body with essential [nutrition](/wiki/Human_nutrition): fluid, [macronutrients](/wiki/Macronutrient) such as [protein](/wiki/Protein), [micronutrients](/wiki/Micronutrient) and [food energy](/wiki/Food_energy). [[2]](#cite_note-lean-2) [[3]](#cite_note-WHO2004-3) A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and [whole grains](/wiki/Whole_grain), and may include little to no [processed food](/wiki/Processed_food) or [sweetened beverages](/wiki/Sweetened_beverage). The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of [plant-based](/wiki/Plant-based_diet) and animal-based foods, although additional sources of [vitamin B12](/wiki/Vitamin_B12) are needed for those following a [vegan diet](/wiki/Vegan_diet). [[4]](#cite_note-4) Various [nutrition guides](/wiki/List_of_nutrition_guides) are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. [Nutrition facts labels](/wiki/Nutrition_facts_label) are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health. [[5]](#cite_note-EU1-5) [[6]](#cite_note-WHO123-6) Recommendations[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] World Health Organization[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] The [World Health Organization](/wiki/World_Health_Organization) (WHO) makes the following five recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals: [[7]](#cite_note-7) - Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using. - Limit intake of fats to no more than 30% of total caloric intake, preferring [unsaturated fats](/wiki/Unsaturated_fats)to [saturated fats](/wiki/Saturated_fats). Avoid [trans fats](/wiki/Trans_fats). - Eat at least 400 grams of [fruits](/wiki/Fruits)and vegetables per day (not counting potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other starchy roots). A healthy diet also contains [legumes](/wiki/Legumes)(e.g. lentils, beans), [whole grains](/wiki/Whole_grains), and [nuts](/wiki/Nut_(fruit)). [[8]](#cite_note-8) - Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of caloric intake (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better). [[9]](#cite_note-9) - Limit salt/ [sodium](/wiki/Sodium)from all sources and ensure that [salt is iodized](/wiki/Iodised_salt). Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of [cardiovascular disease](/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease). [[10]](#cite_note-:0-10) The WHO has stated that insufficient vegetables and fruit is the cause of 2.8% of deaths worldwide. [[10]](#cite_note-:0-10)[ [failed verification](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability)] Other WHO recommendations include: - ensuring that the foods chosen have sufficient [vitamins](/wiki/Vitamins)and certain minerals; - avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic (e.g. [benzene](/wiki/Benzene)) substances; - avoiding foods contaminated by human [pathogens](/wiki/Pathogens)(e.g. [E. coli](/wiki/E._coli), [tapeworm](/wiki/Tapeworm)eggs); - and replacing saturated fats with [polyunsaturated fats](/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat)in the diet, which can reduce the risk of [coronary artery disease](/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease)and [diabetes](/wiki/Diabetes). [[10]](#cite_note-:0-10)[ [Dietary Guidelines for Americans](/wiki/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans) by the [United States Department of Agriculture](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture) (USDA) recommends three healthy patterns of diet, summarized in the table below, for a 2000 kcal diet. [[11]](#cite_note-11) [[12]](#cite_note-USGuidelines2013-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) These guidelines are increasingly adopted by various groups and institutions for recipe and meal plan development. [[14]](#cite_note-14) The guidelines emphasize both health and environmental sustainability and a flexible approach. The committee that drafted it wrote: \"The major findings regarding sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the \"Healthy U.S.-style Pattern\", the \"Healthy Vegetarian Pattern\" and the \"Healthy Mediterranean-style Pattern\". [[15]](#cite_note-15) Food group amounts are per American Heart Association / World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] The [American Heart Association](/wiki/American_Heart_Association), [World Cancer Research Fund](/wiki/World_Cancer_Research_Fund), and [American Institute for Cancer Research](/wiki/American_Institute_for_Cancer_Research) recommend a diet that consists mostly of unprocessed plant foods, with emphasis on a wide range of whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables and fruits. This healthy diet includes a wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and [cruciferous vegetables](/wiki/Cruciferous_vegetables) like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy-rich foods, including \"fast foods\" and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity. Overall, researchers and medical policymakers conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease and cancer. [[16]](#cite_note-WCR2007-16) [[17]](#cite_note-urlwww.cancer.org-17) It is recommended that children consume 25 grams or less of added sugar (100 calories) per day. [[18]](#cite_note-Vos2016-18) Other recommendations include no extra sugars in those under two years old and less than one soft drink per week. [[18]](#cite_note-Vos2016-18) As of 2017, decreasing total fat is no longer recommended, but instead, the recommendation to lower risk of [cardiovascular disease](/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease) is to increase consumption of [monounsaturated fats](/wiki/Monounsaturated_fat) fats](/wiki/Polyunsaturated_fat), while decreasing consumption [[19]](#cite_note-19) Harvard School of Public Health[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] The Nutrition Source of [Harvard School of Public Health](/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health) (HSPH) makes the following dietary recommendations: [[20]](#cite_note-nsm-20) - Eat healthy fats: healthy fats are necessary and beneficial for health. [[21]](#cite_note-HSPH-fats-21)HSPH \"recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA\" and \"does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat.\" [[20]](#cite_note-nsm-20)Healthy fats include polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and fish. Foods containing trans fats are to be avoided, while foods high in saturated fats like red meat, butter, cheese, ice cream, coconut and palm oil negatively impact health and should be limited. [[21]](#cite_note-HSPH-fats-21) [[22]](#cite_note-HSPH-coconutoil-22) - Eat healthy protein: the majority of protein should come from plant sources when possible: lentils, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains; avoid processed meats like bacon. [[23]](#cite_note-HSPH-protein-23) - Eat mostly vegetables, fruit, and whole grains. [[20]](#cite_note-nsm-20) - Drink water. Consume sugary beverages, juices, and milk only in moderation. Artificially sweetened beverages contribute to weight gain because sweet drinks cause cravings. 100% fruit juice is high in calories. The ideal amount of milk and calcium is not known today. [[24]](#cite_note-HSPH-drinks-24) - Pay attention to salt intake from commercially prepared foods: most of the dietary salt comes from processed foods, \"not from salt added to cooking at home or even from salt added at the table before eating.\" [[25]](#cite_note-HSPH-salt-25) - Vitamins and minerals: must be obtained from food because they are not produced in our body. They are provided by a diet containing healthy fats, healthy protein, vegetables, fruit, milk and whole grains. [[26]](#cite_note-HSPH-vitamins-26) [[24]](#cite_note-HSPH-drinks-24) - Pay attention to the carbohydrates package: the type of carbohydrates in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrates. Good sources for carbohydrates are vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains. Avoid sugared sodas, 100% fruit juice, artificially sweetened drinks, and other highly processed food. [[24]](#cite_note-HSPH-drinks-24) [[20]](#cite_note-nsm-20) Other than nutrition, the guide recommends staying active and maintaining a healthy [body weight](/wiki/Body_weight). [[20]](#cite_note-nsm-20) Others[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] [David L. Katz](/wiki/David_L._Katz), most prevalent popular diets in 2014, noted: The weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating while allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary approaches. Efforts to improve public health through diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do. Knowledge in this case is not, as of yet, power; would that it were so. [[27]] [Marion Nestle](/wiki/Marion_Nestle) expresses the mainstream view among scientists who study nutrition: [[28]](#cite_note-fitz-28): 10 The basic principles of good diets are so simple that I can summarize them in just ten words: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and vegetables. For additional clarification, a five-word modifier helps: go easy on [junk foods]. Follow these precepts and you will go a long way toward preventing the major diseases of our overfed society\u2014coronary heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, stroke, osteoporosis, and a host of others.... These precepts constitute the bottom line of what seem to be the far more complicated dietary recommendations of many health organizations and national and international governments\u2014the forty-one \"key recommendations\" of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines, for example. ... Although you may feel as though advice about nutrition is constantly changing, the basic ideas behind my four precepts have not changed in half a century. And they leave plenty of room for enjoying the pleasures of food. [[29]]: 22 Historically, a healthy diet was defined as a diet comprising more than 55% of carbohydrates, less than 30% of fat and about 15% of proteins. [[30]](#cite_note-30) This view is currently shifting towards a more comprehensive framing of dietary needs as a global need of various nutrients with complex interactions, instead of per nutrient type needs. [[31]](#cite_note-USDietaryGuidelines2015-31) Specific conditions[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] In addition to dietary recommendations for the general population, there are many specific diets that have primarily been developed to promote better health in specific population groups, such as people with [high blood pressure](/wiki/Hypertension) (such as [low sodium diets](/wiki/Low_sodium_diet) or the more specific [DASH diet](/wiki/DASH_diet)), or who are [overweight](/wiki/Overweight) or [obese](/wiki/Obesity) ( [weight control diets](/wiki/Dieting)). Some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] Diabetes[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] A healthy diet in combination with being active can help those with diabetes keep their blood sugar in check. [[32]](#cite_note-32) The [US CDC](/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) advises individuals with diabetes to plan for regular, balanced meals and to include more nonstarchy vegetables, reduce added sugars and refined grains, and focus on whole foods instead of highly processed foods. [[33]](#cite_note-33) Generally, people with diabetes and those at risk are encouraged to increase their fiber intake. [[34]](#cite_note-34) Hypertension[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=9)] A low-sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. A [Cochrane review](/wiki/Cochrane_review) published in 2008 concluded that a long-term (more than four weeks) low-sodium diet usefully lowers blood pressure, both in people with [hypertension](/wiki/Hypertension) (high blood pressure) and in those with normal blood pressure. [[35]](#cite_note-cochrane2008-35) The [DASH diet](/wiki/DASH_diet) (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](/wiki/National_Heart,_Lung,_and_Blood_Institute) (part of the [NIH](/wiki/NIH), a United States government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of [sodium](/wiki/Sodium), [[36]](#cite_note-dashguide-36) and the diet also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also \"rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein\". The [Mediterranean diet](/wiki/Mediterranean_diet), which includes limiting consumption of red meat and using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes. [[37]](#cite_note-Walker_C,_Reamy_BV_2009_571-8-37) Obesity[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] The most effective [treatment for [[38]](#cite_note-38) However, people who are [overweight](/wiki/Overweight) or [obese](/wiki/Obese) can use healthy diets in combination with [physical exercise](/wiki/Physical_exercise) in an attempt to [lose weight](/wiki/Weight_loss), although this is particularly effective for only a short period (up to one year), after which some of the weight is typically regained. [[39]](#cite_note-39) [[40]](#cite_note-40) A [meta-analysis](/wiki/Meta-analysis) of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between diet types ( [low-fat](/wiki/Low-fat_diet), [low-carbohydrate](/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet), and [low-calorie](/wiki/Calorie_restriction)), with a 2-4 in all studies.

[[47]](#cite_note-EatrightKeto-47) Research[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Healthy_diet&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] Preliminary research indicated that a diet high in fruit and vegetables may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, but not cancer. [[48]](#cite_note-48) Eating a healthy diet and [getting enough exercise](/wiki/Physical_exercise) can maintain body weight within the normal range and reduce the risk of obesity in most people. [[49]](#cite_note-49) A 2021 [scientific review](/wiki/Scientific_review) of evidence on diets for lowering the risk of [atherosclerosis](/wiki/Atherosclerosis) found that: [[50]](#cite_note-50) low consumption of salt and foods of animal origin, and increased intake of plant-based foods\u2014whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts\u2014are linked with reduced atherosclerosis risk. The same applies for the replacement of butter and other animal/tropical fats with olive oil and other unsaturated-fat-rich oil. [...] With regard to meat, new evidence differentiates processed and red meat\u2014both associated with increased [CVD]risk\u2014from poultry, showing a neutral relationship with CVD for moderate intakes. [...] New data endorse the replacement of most high [glycemic index](GI) foods with both whole grain and low GI cereal foods. Scientific research is also investigating impacts of nutrition on health- and lifespans beyond any specific range of diseases. Research suggests that increasing adherence to [Mediterranean diet](/wiki/Mediterranean_diet) patterns is associated with a reduction in total and cause-specific mortality, extending health- and lifespan.

[[102]](#cite_note-Hebden2017-102) As an example, the [Western pattern diet](/wiki/Western_pattern_diet) is \"rich in red meat, dairy products, processed and artificially sweetened foods, and salt, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains,\" contrasted by the [Mediterranean diet](/wiki/Mediterranean_diet) which is associated with less [morbidity](/wiki/Morbidity) and [mortality](/wiki/Mortality_rate).

[[109]](#cite_note-109) The [British Heart Foundation](/wiki/British_Heart_Foundation) released its own government-funded advertisements, labeled \"Food4Thought\", which were targeted at children and adults to discourage unhealthy habits of consuming junk food. [[110]](#cite_note-110) From a [psychological](/wiki/Psychology) and [cultural](/wiki/Culture) perspective, a healthier diet may be difficult to achieve for people with poor eating habits.
