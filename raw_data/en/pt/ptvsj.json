However, [research](https://homeopathy-soh.org/all-resources-2/research-resources/) suggests that the vigorous shaking during the manufacturing process of homeopathic remedies changes the properties of the water that the original substance is dissolved in. This results in preparations that can exhibit biological activity at very high dilutions - as has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments. You can safely use your homeopathic remedy alongside conventional drugs. It will not interfere with the action of any medicines prescribed by a doctor. Did you know.... - There are powerful outcome studies demonstrating that homeopathy improves patient health - in 2005, the largest clinical evaluation of homeopathic treatment, reported that 70 per cent of 6,500 patients experienced improvement in their health.
