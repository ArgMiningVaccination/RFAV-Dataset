Each professional course in the program serves as the prerequisite for the subsequent course. Consequently, professional courses must be taken in sequence. Withdrawing or failure to successfully complete a professional course with a letter grade of \"C\" or better may result in the student being placed on the three -year track, given a leave of absence ( LOA ) and academic probation , or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions. Students readmitted to the program at times other than the fall semester of the second year will pick up the course sequence as prescribed by the Chair/Program Director or Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR RESPIRATORY CARE AND MAJOR FIELD RELATED COURSES 90 - 100 = A 80 - 89 = B 75 - 79 = C 70 - 74 = D below 70 = F Unless otherwise describe d in a given course syllabus, the minimum satisfactory grade for course credit is a letter grade of \"C\" and all stipulated segments of a course must be passed by this standard. Students must demonstrate proficiency in all clinical skills presented in order to pass clinical courses. For all clinical courses, the final exam must be passed at the designated cut score AND a grade of \"C\" or better must be maintained in order to successfully complete each clinical course to continue in the program. Students are expected to maintain an Overall GPA in The Program of at Least 3.0 Failure of the student to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 will subject the student to a review and may result in the student being placed on probation, given a LOA, or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions. If dismissed and the student wishes to reenter the program, he/she must reapply and will be considered on the same basis as any new applicant. Students who voluntarily withdraw fr om the program either passing or failing have no guarantee of reinstatement to the program. Students requesting readmission to the program should submit a letter to that effect to the Committee on Progress and Promotion for Respiratory Care. Students read mitted to the program will pick up the course sequence as prescribed by the Chair/Program Director or Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. CLINICAL FINAL EXAMINATIONS All students are required to pass the clinical final examinatio n after completing clinical course s to continue in the program. In the event a student fails the clinical final examination, the student is allowed to make ONE more attempt to pass. In the event the student passes the clinical final exam on the second atte mpt the student will continue in the program. The grade earned on the first attempt will be used to calculate the final clinical grade. In the event the student does NOT pass the clinical final exam on the second attempt the student will be placed in rem ediation. The Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 19 student will be given a third attempt to pass the final by the end of the next semester . In the event the students does not pass on the third attempt the student will earn an \"F\" in the clinical course and may be suspended or released from th e program . COMPREHENSIVE END -OF-PROGRAM COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT EXAMINATION Before graduating the student will complete comprehensive end -of-program ex amination assessments [NBRC secure Therapist Multiple Choice (TMC) and clinical simulation examination s (CSE )]. The TMC examination will be taken at the end of spring semester of the secon d year as a part of RC P 581, Clinical Practice 2. The CSE will be given at the beginning of the Summer semester of the second year as part of RC P 591, Clinical Practice 3. A passing score is required to successfully complete RC P 581 and RCP 591, as well as meet graduation and program course completion requirements. Students who do not successfully complete the comprehensive self -assessment examination s will receive an Inc omplete (\"I\") for RC P 581 and/or RCP 591. Those students failing receiving and \"I\" will be required to attend re mediation over the following semester . Those failing the examination after multiple attempt s or failing to attend remediation may be subject to dismissal from the program. Those students may reapply to the program (see Procedures for Readmission). CONDUCT AND ETHICS Each student is expected to conduct oneself at all times in a dignified manner . This manner conforms to the ethics of the professi on and instills patient confidence in one 's abilities as a health care practitioner. Each student is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in this handbook and policies outlined in the university catalog . Irresponsible, unpro fessional, or unethical behavior as determined by the instructor or failure to follow the instructions of a clinical instructor during clinical practice may result in dismissal from the program. Falsification on any clinical documents will be treated as sc holastic dishonesty. All hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical training in a facility. If employed by a clinical site in which the student is assigned a clinical rotation, the student must not complete clinical cou rsework while in an employee status. SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY AND CHEATING The division will not condone cheating in any form. Plagiarizing or copying others writing or work is considered cheating. Any allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the Co mmittee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care and if merited, dealt with in a strict manner, including immediate dismissal from the program. Any student found to be cheating on an examination , test, quiz, or assignment will automatically receiv e a \"0\" for the grade and will be subject to dismissal from the program at the discretion of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . Plagiarism on drafts of assignments may result in a \"0\" grade for the entire assignment. Failure to report incidents Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 20 involving scholastic dishonesty on the part of another student will be considered unprofessional conduct on the part of the student and may result in disciplinary action. EXAMINATION ADMINISTRATION All examinations given by the division will be monitored by faculty or staff at all times. Students will be seated in such a manner as to minimize the opportunity for observation of other students' examination papers. No breaks will be allowed once an examination period has begun, and student s may not leave the room during an exam until they are finished taking the examination, except in the event of an emergency, which will be judged by the faculty or staff monitoring the exam on a case by case basis. If a student turns in an examination w ithout answering all questions, he or she will NOT be given an opportunity to finish the examination after leaving the room. Only marks made on the Scantron sheet will be used to compute a grade on all Scantron -graded examinations. Even if a student marks the answer correctly on his or her examination, but does not mark it correctly on the Scantron, only the Scantron answer will be used to compute the grade, not the answer marked on the examination. Calculators will be provided to students for examination s, thus personal calculators will not be allowed during examinations. EXAMINATION REVIEW At the discretion of the course instructor, during review of any examination given within the curriculum, no other papers or books will be allowed on the student's desk. No writing implements of any kind will be allowed. NO note taking or recording of any kind will be permitted. This includes written note taking, and/or any form of mechanical, electronic, audio, or video recording. Violation of this policy will c onstitute academic dishonesty and will be referred to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for review and possible disciplinary action. COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES/ RESPIRATORY CARE PROGRAM: STUDENT ACADEMIC APPEAL AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES The College of Health Sciences / Respiratory Care Program student appeals and grievance procedures provide a mechanism whereby any student may obtain a review of a complaint of unfair treatment. The student appeals procedures shall not be used to question a rule, proc edure or policy established by an authorized faculty or administrative body. Rather it shall be used to provide due process for those who believe that a rule, procedure or policy has been applied in an unfair or inequitable manner, or that there has been u nfair or improper treatment by a person or persons. Students who are appealing an academic decision that could result in a dismissal from the university may be allowed to continue to progress in the program until the issue is resolved. If the academic deci sion is upheld and the student is dismissed from the university they will be withdrawn from their current classes. This withdrawal will be backdated to before the beginning of the semester and the student will receive 100 percent tuition reimbursement for that semester . Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 21 A student wishing to appeal an academic decision should follow the process summarized below, in the sequence indicated. Step 1. In the academic community, the responsibility for course development, course delivery, and the assessment of s tudent achievement rests primarily with each course instructor. Any student who has a complaint of inappropriate treatment related to a course should first seek to resolve it informally with the course instructor. If the course instructor is the department chairperson, or if the complaint does not pertain to a specific course, the student should seek resolution with the department chairperson at the outset. a) A student with such a complaint must request reconsideration, in writing, of the application of a rule, procedure, or policy or unfair or improper treatment within five working days following the incident that forms the basis for the complaint (e.g., five days after grades are posted). b) The instructor will meet with the student (or speak with the s tudent via telephone for those students who are unable to come to the instructor's office if so requested by the student). The instructor will notify the student in writing of his/her decision regarding the complaint within five working days following the meeting or discussion. Step 2. If resolution is not achieved informally, as described in Step 1, the student should seek resolution with the chairperson of the department in which the course is offered within five working days following notification by t he instructor of his/her decision. a) The chairperson will meet with the student (or speak with the student for those students unable to come to the chairperson's office if so requested by the student) following receipt of the student's request for resolu tion to discuss the problem or complaint. b) The chairperson will notify the student of his/her decision in writing following the meeting or discussion. Step 3. If the issue was not resolved in Step 2 the student may submit a written appeal, describing the nature of the student's complaint and reasons for seeking an appeal to the student progress and promotion committee of the department within five working days following notification by the department chairperson of his/her decision. a) The student may appear before the committee in person, make an oral statement and answer questions from the committee. The student will not be allowed to be present during committee deliberations. b) The committee may request that the course instructor or faculty member named in the grievance appear before the committee to make an oral statement and answer questions. The instructor or faculty member named in the grievance may not be present during committee deliberations. c) Following review of information provided, the committee will notify the student of its decision. Step 4. If the issue was not resolved to the student's satisfaction in Step 3 the student may submit a written request seeking a hearing to the Dean within five working days of receiving the department progress and promotion committee decision. The written request should include a description of the complaint and the reason the student is seeking an appeal. a) The Dean will meet with the student following receipt of the written request from the student for a hearing. b) Following the meeting with the student, the Dean may render a decision, or choose to appoint a panel to investigate the grievance and make a recommendation to the Dean. Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 22 c) Following review of the information provided and any recommendat ions from the panel, should one be appointed, the Dean will then notify the student of his/her decision. The decision of the Dean shall be final. CONDUCT IN CLINICAL FACILITIES Students must be appropriately supervised at all times during their clinical practice courses. Students must not be used to substitute for clinical, instruct ional, or administrative staff and cannot receive any form of remuneration in exchange for clinical work that they perform. In the event of a student disciplinary problem in a clinical facility, such as unprofessional conduct, the following procedure will be adhered to: 1. The student will be dismissed from the clinical facility by the instructor, and the time will be recorded as an unexcused absence. 2. The student wi ll be scheduled for a formal counseling session conducted by the instructor and the director of clinical education , at which time his/her clinical status will be reviewed and appropriate action taken. The student must complete this counseling session in o rder to be readmitted to the clinical rotation. 3. The program attendance policy remains applicable. HIPAA AND PATIENT PRIVACY As a student at Rush University, you have a legal and ethical responsibility to safeguard the privacy of all patients and protect confidentiality and security of all health information. Protecting the confidentiality of patient information means protecting it from unauthorized use or disclosure in any format - oral, verbal, fax, written or electronic/computer. Patient conf identiality is a central obligation of patient care. Any breaches in patient confidentiality or privacy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the program. The laboratory component of some courses may use students as simulat ed patients. This is particularly true for the patient evaluation, medicine and patient education components. Additionally, the sharing of personal experiences can be a rich resource in the development of students understanding, knowledge and appreciatio n of disease, health care and impact on peoples' lives. Conducting physical exam s and taking medical histori es, places students in close contact and leads to the sharing of personal information and physical findings. Similarly students may use personal experiences in patient role -playing exercises. All shared and personal medical information and physical examination findings are to be treated with utmost confidentiality, the same as for any patient contact. Failure to protect the confidentiality of any information related to the activities of this course may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the program. Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 23 GUIDE TO PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT Professionalism relates to the intellectual, ethical, behavioral and attitudinal attrib utes necessary to perform as a health care provider.

Students will be assigned to a faculty advisor in the fall semester of their first year. Times for student conference s will be posted. 3. Each student must meet with his advisor formally at least once per semester during the academic year. One advisement session will be held during each summer session. 4. A student conference record will be completed and signed by both the faculty member and student following a formal conference. RELEASE OF STUDENT INFORMATION Students must sign a release form requesting letters of reference for employment, enrollment verification, release of immunization records, etc. Additional forms a re available in the Department. Student grades cannot be given out over the telephone or through email . UNIFORM POLICY FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE The following guidelines are used to assist the student in adjustments to various hospitals and other health ag encies. The policies vary, but in general the rules established by the program will cover the student's responsibility when ente ring such health agencies. Rush University wishes to have its students represent the University in a manner that reflects its goal of high standards of professionalism. Uniform regulations are needed to assure standard, identifying attire and a well groomed personal appearance. The ultimate goal is to protect the patient and self from cross -contamination and to reflect confiden ce and assurance in patient contact and hospital staff personnel relationships. 1. A white, buttoned (no zipper), long sleeve laboratory coat approximately knee length must be worn at all times in the clinical agency. A program patch will be permanently affixed to the left front pocket. 2. Name tags and University I.D. cards specified by the program must be visibly worn at all times. 3. Males: Shirts and ties will be worn. Dress pants are preferred, but neat dress casual pants or cords are acceptab le. Females: Dresses, skirt and blouse, or slacks and blouse are acceptable. Scrubs as specified by the department may be worn in the intensive care units, surgical areas, delivery and emergency department. NO blue jeans, high heels, sandals, or tennis shoes (except with scrubs) are permitted . 4. A watch with a second indicator is required. Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 29 5. Stethoscopes, bandage scissors, and hemostats are mandatory beginning in the spring semester of the first year. A small pocket notebook should be purchased for clinical. Failure to comply with the above regulations regarding uniform policy will result in the studen t being dismissed from clinical practicum until such time as the deficiencies are corrected. ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS CLINICAL PRACTICE There are no excused absences from clinical practice. Each clinical practice has a requisite number of mandatory clinical hours. Any student not completing the required clinical hours during a given session will not receive a passing grade for that clinical practi ce. Time for any excused absence must be made up at the discretion of the clinical instructor. Clinical instructors are not required to allow a student to make up missed days. If clinical absences are not made up, a letter grade of \"F\" or \"I\" may be giv en at the discretion of the faculty. Clinical practice, unless otherwise announced, begins at 6:45 A.M. Students are expected to be prompt and prepared to begin clinical practicums at 6:45 A.M. Tardiness delays and hampers all student assignments made f or that clinical day. If assignments cannot be arranged because of tardiness the student may be required to make -up that day of tardiness as a full clinical day. Any student exceeding four (4) tardies or four (4) clinical absences may be subject to dismi ssal from the program. For those times when students may be in clinical affiliates outside of regular school or clinical times, a special request form needs to be submitted for approval to the Director of Clinical Education. PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFICATION OF ILLNESS OR LATENESS 1. First, call the hospital before 6:30 a.m. if possible. 2. Speak with the clinical instructor or shift supervisor. 3. Identify yourself and tell the shift supervisor that you are a Rush University student. 4. Inform the shift supervisor that you will be late or absent. 5. Next, call the Director of Clinical Education between 5:30 and 6:30 a.m. 6. If the Director of Clinical Education does not answer, call the Rush University Department of Respiratory Care and leave a message about your absence. Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 30 CLASS Class attendance regulations allow the student to be absent no more than 10% of the scheduled lectures. Any unexcused absences exceeding the 10% will result in the student's course grade to be lowered one letter gr ade (i.e., a B becomes a C). If the absences continue the student may be subject to withdrawal from the program. Advance standing students may be shown leniency regarding this policy if approved by the course director. ILLNESS In the event of a \"leng thy\" illness, each case will be reviewed individually in regards to time lost, time available for completion and content of objectives to be covered. Any such absence may require documentation by a physician in writing. TARDINESS (Class and/or Clinical ) The student should be in the appointed place at the scheduled class start time ; disregard for this demonstrates irresponsibility and is unacceptable professional behavior. This cannot be tolerated and action may be taken at the discretion of the instru ctor. Excess tardiness ( being tardy 20% of the scheduled lectured times ) will result in grade reduction. If the tardiness continues, the student may be subject to withdrawal from the program. INCOMPLETE ASSIGNMENTS AND MAKE -UP EXAMINATIONS All assignmen ts are to be turned in as specified on the course syllabus. Assignments not turned in to the instructor when due may result in a \"0\" for that assignment. In special circumstances, a revised due date for an assignment can be negotiated with the instructor. Requests to revise a due date need to occur a reasonable amount of time in advance of the assignment's original due date. Students given an incomplete in a course must have the mechanism for resolving the incomplete agreed upon with the course instructo r. The agreement must be in writing and must include the signature of the student and the instructor. As a general policy, make -up exams will not be given for missed exams. A request for a make - up exam should be directed to the individual course instruc tor. In cases of serious illness or accident, a make -up exam may be considered.

Seminars, lectures, workshops and related activities may be submitted to meet this requirement. A division form must be completed and signed by either a faculty member or event coordinator to document participation. ALTERNATIVE CLINICAL ACTIVITIES (CLINICAL PASS ) Students may apply for attendance to additional seminars, workshops and lectures to acqu ire clinical release time. Approval of application will be dependent upon clinical skills and in-curriculum grade point average (GPA). Each function will be evaluated independently as to its educational value in terms of how much time will be awarded. The use of this pass is limited. It cannot be used unless appropriate approval is awarded prior to the projected day of use and does NOT include specialty rotations or case studies. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT The faculty realizes that it may be necessary for some students to work part -time while attending school. This should not be done at the expense of the Respiratory Care Program. It is the student's responsibility to fulfill all school obligations. If a student appears too fatigued to perform safely in the clinical laboratory, the instructor may dismiss the student from the clinical agency. It is not advisable for a student to work from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and then come to the university or clinical agency as fatigue frequently is a cause for accide nts or poor clinical judgment. IMMUNIZATIONS AND TUBERCULOSIS TESTING Due two weeks prior to matriculation. PLEASE NOTE: You are advised to begin this process IMMEDIATELY in case you need to be reinoculated, which in some cases may take up to six month s. Proof of Immunity under Public Act 85 -1315, Illinois College and University Immunity Requirement, stipulates that all students born after December 31, 1956 must show proof of immunity. While documentation of this information for compliance with state re gulations is not mandatory for students who were born before 1/1/57, most colleges and programs at Rush have individual immunization requirements for their students. Program immunization requirements are mandatory for all students in those programs regardl ess of age. Measles (Rubeola), Mumps, Rubella - positive titers Varicella - positive Hepatitis B - immunization record and positive titers Tetanus/Diphtheria - booster within the last 10 years Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 32 Tuberculosis - two-step PPD Mantoux Skin Test or the Qua ntiferon -TB Gold test with negative results. Meningococcal - immunization record of one dose of meningococcal conjugate on or after the age of 16 . Please follow the instructions that Certified Background (Castle Branch) has provided you on this requirement . A flu vaccination, physical examination and/or drug screening may also be required for your program. Do not send any information by mail, email, or fax. PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE All entering students are required to maintain profession al liability insurance. Insurance coverage can be purchased through Rush University 's office of student financial affairs. COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK AND DRUG TESTING Programs offered in the College of Health Sciences often r equire t hat clinical rotations, practicum , internships or other learning experiences be successfully completed in hospitals and other health care facilities in order to meet program requirements. Because use of these facilities is required, students must b e able to successfully complete their assigned rotations in order to fulfill the academic requirements of their program. Hospitals and other health care facilities often have policies requiring criminal background checks for employees, students and volunte ers. These facilities may refuse to accept individuals for clinical, practicum or other experiential rotations based on past criminal convictions. Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any facility where they are assigne d as part of their educational program and may not request facility assignments in an effort to avoid specific requirements. Students who have certain types of information in their criminal background checks may be ineligible to complete rotations in speci fic facilities. Students who are not allowed to participate at assigned facilities or who are terminated from rotations based on the results of a criminal background check will be unable to complete the program requirements for graduation and will be subje ct to dismissal on academic grounds. Students should also be advised that persons with certain types of criminal convictions may not be eligible for state licensure and/or national registry or certification. In addition, many employers perform criminal bac kground checks and may not hire individuals with certain types of criminal convictions. DRUG TESTING Hospitals and other health care facilities often have policies requiring drug testing for employees, students and volunteers. Some facilities provide that students who test positive for drugs are ineligible to complete clinical, practicum or work assignments in that facility. Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any assigned facility and may not request facility assignme nts in an effort to avoid drug screening requirements. Students who fail to report for clinical or practicum assignments or who are terminated from rotations because they violate Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 33 the drug -testing or drug -use policies of the facilities will be subject to di smissal from the program. ILLNESS OR INJURY OF STUDENT WHILE ATTENDING CLASSES Illness or injury while in the classroom or clinical area must be reported to the professor or instructor present. Students who are pregnant should inform the clinical dire ctor who will inform the instructor so that no assignment will be made involving exposure to radiation or other hazards. USE OF HOSPITAL LIBRARIES Use of hospital libraries varies according to agency policy. Check with current clinical instructor about the procedure needed. FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS Specific respiratory care scholarships are available to students enrolled in the program. For more information contact the departmental office. Other financial aid information and requests should be handled through the Financial Aid Office located in Student Services. MEMBERSHIP IN PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS One key attribute of a professional is participation in associations and societies which influence the direction, education and practice of th e members of a profession. In order to develop this aspect of professionalism, the student will be expected to maintain active student membership in an appropriate professional association or society during the clinical phase of the curriculum. Membershi p in the American Association for Respiratory Care is mandatory. Membership in the Illinois Society for Respiratory Care is also encouraged . STATE AND NATIONAL CREDENTIALING Certification as an entry level respiratory care practitioner (CRT) by the Nat ional Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) is required of all graduates in order to obtain state credentialing. Registration as an advanced respiratory care practitioner (RRT) is a requisite part of successful integration into the profession. The Therapist Multiple -Choice (TMC) Exam should be taken as soon as the graduate is eligible. A passing score on this exam will provide the Respiratory Care Program graduate with either a CRT credential or serve as the written exam requirement for the RRT credential. Th e cost of the TMC exam is $190. The second part of the RRT credential requires passing a clinical simulation exam. The cost of the clinical simulation exam is $200. Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 34 CHANGES IN POLICY Additional policies and regulations may be established by the university, division or by the instructor for a course or any portion of a course. After due and proper notification, students will be expected to comp ly fully with all regulations. POLICY FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Students who have completed course work at ot her approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific course work in the Rush University program. Students must submit a n official transcript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course sylla bus for each course in which they desire transfer credit. The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related information. These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours. The division reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in course work transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such course work in cases which the student cannot demonstrate acceptable proficiency. All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. The student must also have a minimum grade of \" B\" (3.0) for each co urse being transferred. A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care course work if he/she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension, or exclusion. All university policies regarding transfer credit must be satis fied. Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 35 ADVANCED STANDING IN THE RESPIRATORY CARE PROGRAM INTRODUCTION Individuals may have acquired academic credit in respiratory care courses from other schools and universities. Some individuals may acquire knowledge through experience and on -the-job training. When such persons apply for admission into the program, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equivalent educational courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the N ational Board for Respiratory Care's certification and registry examinations. All students graduating from the Respiratory Care Program must meet the same standards for graduation; the awarding of advanced standing does not signify a lesser quality educ ation than that offered through regular course work. What it does, however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered. The progr am has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high quality patient care. The identification of these competencies is a complex task and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard o f excellence. The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced standing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University as well as departmental policies at all times. To allow individuals who are not qualified, to receive advanced standing, is not in the student's or the program's best interest. DEFINITION Advanced standing is defined as a special and individually determined status granted to a student in a formal educational setting, who has already gained professional experience through other sources or through non -academic experiences, knowledge, skills and professional ism taught in the program courses. PURPOSE OF ADVANCED STANDING PROCEDURES The purpose of the advanced standing procedures is to recognize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or experience. METHODS OF GRANTING ADVANCED STANDING 1. Advanced standing can be awarded through transfer credit. 2. Advanced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge. (An \"equivalency\" examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care Program ca n demonstrate Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 36 mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill and thus be exempted from a course in the program which teaches that area or skill.) 3. Advanced standing can be awarded as credit for successful completion of national registry examinatio ns (RRT/RPFT). WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR ADVANCED STANDING 1. Transfer students (who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program) may receive a transfer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care Program curriculum. 2. Credentialed students (RRT, RPFT) who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program, may receive transfer credit and will also be eligible to take equivalency examinations in certain courses. POLICY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD THE RRT CREDENTIAL Advanced standing is available to individuals who have successfully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's Respiratory Therapy Registry (RRT) who hold a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university . Those eligible for advanced standing must submi t the following documentation: 1. A notarized copy of the RRT certificate indicating that it is a true and accurate copy. 2. Official transcripts of all previous respiratory care and general education co urse work attempted and/or completed indicating award of the bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university . 3. A notarized copy of the Certificate of Completion from an approved respiratory care training program as applicable. 4. A compl eted application for admission to the advanced standing program. These are available through the Office of College Admission Services . 5. A letter directed to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care requesting advanced standing. REGISTERED RESPIRATORY THERAPIST (RRT) Admissions Requirements Individuals holding the RRT credential and a baccalaureate degree may apply to enter the Respiratory Care Graduate Program prior to any semester . Submission of an application for admission s hould be made to the Office of College Admission Service s with all official transcripts, NBRC RRT certificate , and a personal interview at least 30 days prior to the first day Respiratory Care MS-Program Handbook, 2018 -2020 37 of the semester which the individual desires to begin classes.
