B\u00e9renger) (By Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to the acquisition of the Med Point Clinic by the Stat e, he will - (a) state if he agrees to the setting up of a Sele ct Committee to establish all the facts, in particular - (i) if all the prescribed procedures have been fol lowed; (ii) the cost of rehabilitation and other works to be carried out, and (iii) the date on which the Central Procurement Bo ard awarded the tender, and (b) for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to if, regarding the recent reported case of ars on at Belle Terre, the police inquiry has revealed any link thereto. The Prime Minister : Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I shall re ply to this Private Notice Question and to Question B/17 together. My reply will also cover Parliamentary Questions B/52 and B/53. Regarding part (a) of the question, I should like, at the very outset, to state that, in view of the special needs of old people in the context o f an ageing population, the idea of having specialised geriatric services was first invoked as far back as the year 2000 when I referred to the need for a geriatric hospital on several occasions. This issue was taken up again by the Chief Medical Officer, late Dr. Sungkur, in June 2004. In this regard, late Dr Sungkur met Dr. J. P. Emeri au of Bordeaux University who was in Mauritius to speak about geriatric medicine, and he asked him to advise the Ministry on how to manage elderly patients. They came to the conclusi on that this would become an acute problem by the year 2010 to 2015, and that there was an urg ent need to have a plan for a geriatric hospital. However, there was no development. Mr Speaker, Sir, in our manifesto for the 2005 Gene ral Elections entitled \"Une Ile Maurice pour tous\", at Chapter 5, when we speak of what we intend to d o in the health sector, 27 we speak on two occasions on the challenge to cope with an ageing population, and we emphasise on geriatric and preventive medicine. Th e reason is clear: the number of persons aged 65 and above is on the increase because people are getting better treatments and are living longer. At present, elderly patients account for m ore than 40% of occupied bed days in our hospitals. In February 2006, a Committee, chaired by the Princ ipal Medical Officer and comprising Consultants in general medicine, discussed the poss ibility of setting up a geriatric hospital. The idea of setting up a geriatric hospital does not, t herefore, date back to the recent months. On 26 February 2010, it was decided that proceeds o btained from the National Lottery and credited to the Consolidated Fund would be used , inter alia, to fund the following projects in the health sector - (a) centre for specialised care for children and women, and (b) the National Geriatric Hospital. Mr Speaker, Sir, in line with the Government's visi on to provide quality health care services to the elderly and to improve their qualit y of life, on 05 March 2010, Government agreed to the setting up of a National Geriatric Ho spital to provide state-of-the-art treatment and care to the needs of our senior citizens suffering from chronic conditions. The hospital would also be a Centre of Excellence through the provisio ns of clinical training to undergraduate and postgraduate medical students and paramedical perso nnel. This decision of Government formed part of the communiqu\u00e9 issued by Cabinet Office on the same date. Mr Speaker, Sir, in our electoral manifesto for 201 0, one of our proposals in the health sector is the setting up of a geriatric hospital. And in the Government programme 2010-2015, at paragraph 230, we spell out clearly that Government will set up a National Geriatric Hospital. It must, therefore, be crystal clear to any reasona ble person that the idea of the setting up of a geriatric hospital did not come up recently. That idea does not hold water and is not true. As the House is aware, following various allegation s made in relation to the acquisition of the Med Point Hospital building in the press, IC AC started an enquiry on its own initiative. I am of the view that, in the circumstances, it will not be in order or appropriate for a Select Committee to be appointed for the following reasons - 28 1. First of all, as I explained, ICAC is already inqui ring in the matter. ICAC is the Independent Commission Against Corruption. 2. Furthermore, witnesses examined before the Select C ommittee may, whilst the Select Committee is sitting, become the subject of criminal charges preferred by ICAC or otherwise, and such parallel investigation and action will not be desirable or appropriate. 3. Once a witness gives an answer to a question before a Select Committee, he cannot be prosecuted on the basis of that answer. We all know section 15 of the National Assembly (Privileges and Immunities) Act; that is what I am referring to, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am sure nobody in this augu st Assembly wishes to extinguish, through the Select Committee, the possi bility of prosecution of certain persons, if warranted, after the conclusion of the investigation by ICAC. Once the ICAC investigation and any related proceed ings are completed, the relevance and desirability of appointing a Select Committee c an be considered. I also have no reason to doubt that, in the course of ICAC's investigations, the issues raised in paragraphs (a)(ii) and (iii) of the Private Notice Question as well as in the Pa rliamentary Questions B/52 and B/53 will be addressed. Having said so, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me not be misu nderstood by anyone in this House. This matter is being investigated by ICAC since Jan uary of this year. Documents, correspondences, computer disks and comp uters have been secured from the Ministry of Health and Quality of Life, the Ministr y of Finance and Economic Development and different other places. Several persons have been interrogated already and statements made. Others, I am told, are likely to be interrogated an d further statements made. All institutions and Ministries are collaborating fully with the ICAC. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Leader of the Oppo sition and hon. Members will understand that it would be inappropriate for me to unduly comment and go into minute details, into matters that concern this investigation which, as I said, is ongoing. We have to respect institutions, Mr Speaker, Sir, a nd not hamper their investigations nor try to influence them one way or the other. 29 As Prime Minister, I should not act in a manner tha t may prejudice an investigation that is ongoing. Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards part (b) of the questio n, I am informed by the Commissioner of Police that, on 01 March 2011, one Mr R. B resid ing at Belle Terre reported to the Phoenix Police Station a case of fire which occurred on the same day in his garage at about 02.45 hours. Two vehicles, namely a pickup truck and a car, the garage, as well as some furniture kept nearby were damaged during the incident. The assistance of the Forensic Science Laboratory, the Central Electricity Board, as well as the Energy Services Division was enlisted by pol ice. After examining the site of the occurrence, the Energy Services Division concluded that the fire outbreak was not due to any electrical fault. On the other hand, the Director of the Forensic Science Laboratory is of the opinion that the fire was started by person/s unkno wn distributing an accelerant around the back of the pickup truck and igniting it with a naked fl ame. Upon the examination of the exhibits, i.e. soil samples, burnt plant debris, charred debris an d fused debris collected from the scene, the examination by FSL reveals the presence of motor sp irit and diesel. During the course of the investigation, the police questioned eight persons. They have all denied their involvement therein and, after checkin g their alibis, they were allowed to go. I am further informed by the Commissioner of Police that, so far, there is nothing in the enquiry which indicates that there is any link with the acquisition of the Med Point Clinic. Enquiry into the case is proceeding. Mr B\u00e9renger: Mr Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Prime Minister, I am sure, is perfectly aware, there are lots of things that do not concern ICAC, but that would be very much of interest to a Select Committee of the National Assembly. I take one example under part (a) of my question: 'prescribed procedures'. Can I know from the hon. Prime Minister whether it was he, in his capacity as Prime Minister, who ordered or gave the green light for the tender for purchasing a building to be issued five days before the last gen eral election? The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Leader of the Opposition has been Prime Minister before. We look at policy in Cabinet; we don't give orders to do this or to do that. 30 These are procedures that are followed by the paren t Ministry, and that is exactly what happened in this case. Mr B\u00e9renger: I am given to understand that the former Minister of Health was not involved - it has been said on the radio by him - a nd that he did not give the green light. Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister who, therefore, gave th e green light? The Prime Minister: In fact, when I learned that the Leader of the Opp osition - I think in a public meeting - was saying that if it is not the former Minister of Health, it must be the Prime Minister, I immediately rang him to question him if he actually said that, and the answer, as usual, Mr Speaker, Sir, was that he did not say that, that the radio has twisted what he said. What he has done - and it is on record... (Interruptions) It is on record, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have the docum ents with me, and it is on record: \"Cabinet examined the possibility of setting up a N ational Geriatric Hospital.\" (Interruptions) I don't know which radio the hon. Leader of the Opp osition is referring to, but I know it was said on the radio. (Interruptions) In fact, when the former Minister of Health was her e, he brought an information paper to Cabinet about the setting up of a geriatric hospita l, and that is what the case is. Mr B\u00e9renger: The setting up of a geriatric hospital is one thin g; the issuing of the tender is another thing. Therefore, can I again ask who a uthorised, five days before general election, the issuing of that tender? The Prime Minister: Just to remind the hon. Leader of the Opposition, we all know, Mr Speaker, Sir, how the procedures are in this countr y. It is not five days before the general election that the decision was taken. The whole pr ocedure had to take the time that it had to take. All the procedures were followed and then th e decision was taken to acquire Med Point. It's not five days before the general election that it was decided that it is going to be Med Point. 31 Mr B\u00e9renger: That tender clearly was tailor-made for Med Point to win the tender. Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he has inquir ed who was responsible for preparing the details of that tailor-made tender? The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained, once the allegati ons were made, ICAC independently, on its own initiatives, started the investigation, as it usually does. Once the investigation starts, I think it is improper for th e Prime Minister to start querying this and that. Let the investigation be done! I know they are inv estigating minute details. I can tell the hon. Leader of the Opposition that ICAC went to the Mini stry of Health without warning. That might surprise some people! (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: It went to the Ministry of Finance and Economic De velopment without notice. They just turned up and took all th e documents that they wanted to take, and that is why I said everybody is cooperating with ICAC. Mr B\u00e9renger: The hon. Prime Minister has insisted on a point wh ich is not of interest as far as my question is concerned, that is, the need for a central hospital for old people. Is it not a fact that a committee of five specialists gave its advice, produced a report against a centralised one building? That was confirmed by a committee, c haired by the No. 1 of the Ministry of Health, Dr. Gopee, and all his technicians confirm ed that. And when the file reached the Ag. Minister of Health, the Ag. Minister put it on file that he agrees with the recommendations of the two committees of experts. The Prime Minister: I am not sure he said that on his file, but I can clarify this point, Mr Speaker, Sir. Policy decisions are taken by the Go vernment. There are committees which decide; experts, Chief Medical Officers look at thi ngs and decide. Maybe, this is not appropriate. In fact, since 2000 - I am not afraid of saying it - I am saying that we need a geriatric hospital. If you look at the report - and I can table the rep ort if the hon. Members want it - from Dr. Emeriau, whom I don't know and who happened to have been in Mauritius when they were in Government, that is, in 2004, he has written an alarming report which confirms - I have not 32 been saying it in so many words - the brutal realit y of what is going to happen if we do not have a geriatric... (Interruptions) No, he talks about a geriatric hospital. In the de veloped countries, they have geriatric hospitals. I speak from knowledge; I worked in a g eriatric hospital. The geriatric hospitals normally are separate. The reason why they are sep arate is simple, Mr Speaker, Sir. All elderly patients have particular needs; they have chronic i llnesses, a lot of combination, a lot of pathology included. They occupy beds for a long ti me. It is not right for them... (Interruptions) I am explaining... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! Order! The Prime Minister: I am explaining because the hon. Member is ignorant ; he does not know anything about hospitals. Shut up! (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: I am explaining... (Interruptions) Shut up! (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: He is ignorant; he does not know. (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: So, he should listen if he doesn't know! (Interruptions) Mr Order! Order! (Interruptions) I said order! Please, Prime Minister! (Interruptions) Mr Bhagwan: I am raising a point of order. I am asking the Chai r whether he has heard the Prime Minister telling me 'shut up'. Mr Speaker: There was a big brouhaha in the House... (Interruptions) Wait! If Members go to the Hansard, they will see how many times the words 'shut up' have been used. (Interruptions) Mr B\u00e9renger: I take it that from now on 'shut up' is in order. Thank you. It's your own ruling. Mr Speaker: I am not saying that. The hon. Member has made the point; let me look into it. I will give my ruling. (Interruptions) I can't offhand give my ruling. Mr B\u00e9renger: Mr Speaker, Sir, the law of the land provides... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Hon. Bhagwan, please keep quiet! Don't interrupt t he Leader of the Opposition! Mr B\u00e9renger: When there is a tender, the law of the land provid es that the unsuccessful tenderers must be informed within seven days, so th at they can appeal before the Independent 34 Review Panel. Is the Prime Minister aware - I am s ure he is - that, in that case, the unsuccessful bidders were never informed and, therefore, la loi fut viol\u00e9e? The Prime Minister: If that is the case, Mr Speaker, Sir, the inquiry, I am sure - they have taken all the documents, files, including conf idential files - will establish whether this is so. The hon. Member was getting excited. I was explain ing to him... (Interruptions) I am not. He is! Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: He is making allegations. I was explaining to him that, in developed countries, we have geriatric hospitals. Mr B\u00e9renger: Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Prime Minister aware that the No. 2 of the Valuation Office at the Ministry of Finance put a v aluation of Rs75 m., and that the same Ministry of Finance, out of public funds, paid for a Quantity Surveyor to produce a report about how much it would cost today to build a new hospita l? That was sent back to the Valuation Department of the same Ministry of Finance, which p aid for that private job, and then Rs75 m. became Rs125 m. (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, all the procedures are being looked at by ICAC. If that is the case, they will establish why it has been the case, because people are being interrogated, statements are being taken. Let them establish the facts! Mr B\u00e9renger: Is the hon. Prime Minister aware that one of the un successful bidders who was never informed that he had lost that bid, had t endered for Rs117 m., and that the Central Procurement Board threw that out on the basis that there was a need for renovation and partition works, sous-entendant that, in the case of Med Point, that was not the c ase, and they had tendered at much more than Rs117 m? Can I table a document? It relates to my question about how much it will cost for rehabilitation and other works. Can I tender a document? It is Minutes 35 of Proceedings of the meeting held on 07 February, under the chairwomanship of the hon. Minister of Health, where it is put noir sur blanc - \"The following works have to be completed before th e hospital could become operational - 1. waterproofing works; 2. repair of water pumps and water tanks; 3. defective solar water heaters to be replaced by new ones; 4. new equipment to be purchased for physiotherapy and occupational health units; 5. camera system to be installed in rooms; 6. bed lift to be repaired; 7. incinerator to be replaced, and 8. installation of burglar-proof in patients rooms.\" Will the hon. Prime Minister agree that already Rs1 17 m. was cheaper? This will cost - I am sure the hon. Prime Minister will agree - millio ns, which will be added on to the Rs125 m. which were paid for land and building. (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: I do not want to comment on the details, as I said , Mr Speaker, Sir. But it is not as simple as it is being made out jus t now. Because I know, for example... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Let the Prime Minister explain! The Prime Minister: I know, for example, there was somebody from my own constituency who also bid. I suppose this is the c ase, because he complained that there were large columns in this building that had to be pulle d down, and the whole structure of the building might have been then in difficulty. This is one of the reasons he told me; I did not go into the details. I said: 'well, I cannot do anything about it; this is not in my domain; it is for the people who are doing the procurement to look at who gets w hat'. That investigation will show all this. 36 Mr B\u00e9renger: I heard the hon. Prime Minister saying in his repl y that he is also replying to two PQs. My question asks for the date on which the Central Procurement Board awarded the tender, and one PQ asks for the date on which payme nt was effected. Now, we know that the date of title deeds was 29 December, so that Capita l Gains Tax would not be paid. Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister to give us the date on which th e Central Procurement Board awarded the tender and the date on which payment was effected? The Prime Minister: I have also seen that these are the dates that are being mentioned. But, as I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want, as Prime Minister, to go into the details. Tomorrow, you will find out that it was not 29, it was 28, and then they will say I misled Parliament. Let us wait for the ICAC to produce it s report. I believe they won't have to wait for so long to get the report because I am told that th ey have questioned many people and they must finish the report very soon. Mr B\u00e9renger: Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he can i nform us who signed on behalf of Government for payment to be effected, and where did that ceremony - that is the correct expression - take place? The Prime Minister: It sounds like the ceremony they did when they mad e the alliance in Med Point. It was the ceremony then. (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! Enough now! The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have trust in the institutions. I have explained from the very beginning that I am not going to go i nto the details because I do not know the details. An investigation has been started. All t his would be revealed, I am sure, from the ICAC when they would finish the inquiry. Mr B\u00e9renger: The hon. Prime Minister has said that the police i nquiry has led nowhere so far. (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Hon. Minister, please! 37 Mr B\u00e9renger: Can I know whether, amongst the eight people who h ave been interviewed - according to the reply from the Prime Minister - the neighbours, immediate and less immediate ones around Mr Harish Boodhoo's resi dence, have been interviewed? The Prime Minister: My indication from the Commissioner of Police is t hat neighbours have been interviewed. Mr 'Belle Terre' made wild allegations. He has not seen anyone, he says, but he has made allegations. Neighbours have been interviewed. There is one thing that the police are puzzled about. On the very day, in the morning, he made an interview on one of the radios - I think Radio Plus - and, in the backg round, you hear dogs barking - it is the neighbours who brought this to the attention of the police. But, in the middle of the night, when the incident happened, no dogs barked. So, the pol ice are very puzzled how come that no dogs barked. I wonder whether this is not the 1983 synd rome; and you know what I am talking about! (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : Order! Mr B\u00e9renger: Therefore, are we being told that, so many days aft er that fire arson, la police n'est sur aucune piste ? The Prime Minister: No, that is not true! The police are continuing th eir investigation. The problem is that when the fire started, they had to extinguish it very quickly. A lot of forensic evidence has obviously been lost when you use a lot of water. In fact, I must tell the hon. Leader of the Opposition that the Director of the Forensic Lab, who is a foreigner from Scotland, Mrs Maclean, is an expert in such cases - damage caused by fire. I asked the Commissioner of Police to ensure that she goes to m ake sure that we follow the investigation because I know from the wild allegations that this person usually makes, we need to make sure what has happened. As I said in my answer, there i s a lot of debris that they are analysing. Nobody has seen anybody. So, we have to go by the evidence that they have. Mr Bhagwan: Everybody knows what has happened, and the Prime M inister has just stated that ICAC is conducting the inquiry. We all know how things are run in Mauritius. Being given the urgency of the reply to the nation and al l of us, can the Prime Minister inform the House, for transparency, whether he intends to have all Ministers who have been involved in the Med Point affair stepped down in the public interes t? Because we want to know where the fire 38 began and whether all the documents are safe. Can t he Prime Minister inform the public, the nation whether he will ask all the Ministers involv ed to step down pending the finalisation of the ICAC report? (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members, including the hon. Member, and the people of this country know my track record. I have never, never hesitated to sack my Ministers... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : No. Let the hon. Prime Minister answer! The Prime Minister :...and even to initiate an inquiry on one of my Minist ers without telling him - and I have evidence of this - where t here have been serious allegations and a prima facie case has been established. That is how I proceed. If there is a prima facie case, certainly I will act, as I have done in the past. The hon. Mem ber forgets that I am not from his party. His party dissolved the Economic Crime Office when ther e were allegations against one of his colleagues. They dissolved the Economic Crime Offi ce. It is the same way... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : Order! Order now! (Interruptions) Order, please! Leader of the Opposition! Mr B\u00e9renger : I have two questions. Being given what the hon. Prime Minister has just said, will he agree with me - he has to, because it is the truth - that, in fact, the Economic Crime Office was replaced by a really independent Commiss ion like the one in India, where you have a panel of three people, that is, the President, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, to appoint and revoke the Head of ICAC? The first thing he did in 2006 was to amend the law to make ICAC become his paillasson, where the Prime Minister appoints and revokes... (Interruptions) 39 Will he agree with me? Mr Speaker : No, the Leader of the Opposition has imputed moti ves against the Prime Minister by saying that ICAC has become his paillasson . I would request the hon. Leader of the Opposition to withdraw that word. Mr B\u00e9renger : He amended the law, and I withdraw the word ' paillasson ' at your request. Mr Speaker : You have withdrawn the word. Thank you. The Prime Minister : I have amended the law. Let me remind the House why. There was the big saga of the MCB where millions had been lost from the bank, and you know how it was working. The President at the time was from th e MSM; the Prime Minister from the MSM. So, there were two against one. My voice did not c ount. Do you know how many times I had to ask that my objections be recorded because I do not agree? In fact, at that time, the Director of ICAC was very, very unhappy about the way things we re being done. Mr B\u00e9renger: My last question will be... Mr Speaker : Last question! Mr B\u00e9renger: The hon. Prime Minister tells us to give time to IC AC to carry out its inquiry. Although, as I said, there are lots of ma tters that are of no concern to ICAC, that would be of great interest to the Parliamentary Select Co mmittee. I am sure the hon. Prime Minister is aware that ICAC has made it a habit to carry out in quiries over years. In the case of a former Parliamentarian, the case was struck out, because y ears and years later things were still dragging on. When the hon. Prime Minister asks us to give t ime to ICAC, can we, at least, have a time frame? I am not saying that he must give directive s to ICAC, but that this request for a Select Committee will not be kept pending for months and, maybe years, because ICAC will go on and on with an everlasting inquiry. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand that point. We know how these things take time, but let me just make a reference to the former Minister that he mentioned. I suppose the hon. Leader of the Opposition is talkin g about hon. Chady, if I am right. In that case, let me say ICAC has, by way of mutual legal a ssistance in criminal and related matters, requested for assistance in three jurisdictions, na mely the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and 40 Singapore, in relation to securing documentary evid ence, interview of foreign suspects and witnesses. The request to Netherlands, unfortunate ly, has been subject to a challenge in the Court in Netherlands by Boskalis International Limi ted, and the procedure is still going on - in Netherlands not here. There is information received that the Court of Netherlands would be ruling, I think, from what I understand, in favour of granting the request for evidence which has already been secured, and that the Court order will be then proceeded with. I am told that the Court order is now subject to an appeal from la Cour de Cassation . That is, unfortunately, how the case is proceeding. So, it's not over. Mr Speaker : Time is over! The Table has been advised that Pa rliamentary Question No. B/2 will be replied by the Minister of Information and Communication, and that Parliamentary Question No. B/21 will be replied by Dr. the hon. P rime Minister. Questions addressed to Dr. the hon. Prime Minister! Hon. Dr. Boolell! IBA - CHAIRPERSON (No. B/1) Dr. S. Boolell (Second Member for Curepip e & Midlands) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to the Independent Broadcasting Authority, he will, fo r the benefit of the House, obtain from the Authority, information as to the name of the Chairp erson thereof, indicating the name of the person who has been designated to act as Chairperso n in the absence of the incumbent, indicating, in each case, since 2005 to date, the - (a) allowances drawn; (b) number of meetings chaired, and (c) number of overseas missions undertaken, giving details of the expenditure incurred in relation thereto. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the Director of t he Independent Broadcasting Authority that, since 2005 to date, th ree different Chairpersons, namely Mr Abdool Mr Trilock Dwarka, have chaired the Board of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. In regard to part (a) of the question, I am informe d that Mr Kalla was paid an all inclusive allowance of Rs34,800 monthly for the period Januar y 2005 to January 2006. 41 Mr Balgobin who chaired the Board from February 200 6 to February 2009 was entitled to an all inclusive allowance of Rs34,800 monthly for the period February 2006 to June 2008. This allowance was revised to Rs45,240 monthly with effe ct from 01 July 2008. Mr Dwarka who is the Acting Chairperson of the Boar d since March 2009 is drawing an all inclusive allowance of Rs45,240 monthly. In regard to part (b) of the question, I am informe d by the Director of the IBA that - Mr Kalla chaired six Board Meetings. Mr Balgobin chaired 18 Board Meetings. As at to date, Mr Dwarka has chaired 18 Board Meeti ngs. In regard to the last part of the question, I am in formed by the Director of the IBA that Mr Kalla proceeded on overseas mission on one occasion. An amount of Rs34,686 was disbursed by the Authority for the payment of his a ir tickets. Mr Balgobin went on overseas mission on four occasi ons. The expenditure incurred for payment of air tickets amounted to Rs107,867. The Authority also disbursed an amount of Rs170,657.66 to meet the cost of hotel expenses. He was also pa id an entertainment allowance of Rs52,391.51. He also had to pay the registratio n fees for participation in the conferences which amounted to Rs27,754.72. Expenditure for tra vel insurance, visa and airport transfers amounted to Rs12,221. Mr Dwarka has proceeded on overseas mission on only one occasion. Payment of air tickets and travel insurance amounted to Rs34,790, and registration fees for participation in the conference were to the tune of Rs104,342.82. I am also informed by the Director of IBA that all the three Chairpersons were paid per diem according to the approved rates. Dr. S. Boolell: May I ask the hon. Prime Minister who appointed Mr Dwarka as Chairperson? I do believe he is an acting Chairper son. The Prime Minister: He is the acting Chairperson; that is right. Dr. S. Boolell: May I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware t hat, pursuant to the provisions of the IBA Act of 2000, the appointment of a Chairperson is regulated by law and not 42 by the Board? In this matter, I would like to know whether he, as Prime Minister, or the Leader of the Opposition and the President of the Republic have been a party to appointing Mr Dwarka as Chairman. The Prime Minister: I understand all the procedures have been followed , Mr Speaker, Sir, but let me add something just to clarify this. We are not appointing a full-time Chairperson at this point, because the whole broadcasting regul atory framework is being reviewed and finalised. Dr. S. Boolell: May I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he is aw are that the legal adviser to Government, the Solicitor General, at on e meeting on 07 May, pointed out to the Board that a Chairperson for that meeting had to be elected per meeting and that legal advice had to be sought on the matter? I am willing to produc e the minutes of meeting for this issue. The Prime Minister: I have great respect for his opinion. I am sure h e has pointed it out rightly, and I am sure they have taken the measures that had to be taken. Mr Bhagwan: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister stated that Go vernment will be amending the regulatory framework. He has stated o n many occasions, here, that the IBA Act needed amendment. Can the hon. Prime Minister give us a time frame with regard to the amendment, especially the IBA? The Prime Minister: I think, in fact, the legislation is ready. We ha ve not brought it to Parliament yet, because Mr Geoffrey Robertson who i s looking at it had not been able to travel. He was going to come to Mauritius in February, and he has not been able to. But he will, I believe, try to come as soon as possible. We want him to relook at it before we bring it in Parliament. Mr Uteem: Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the hon. Prime Minister s ay that Mr Dwarka is an acting Chairperson. There is no such thing under t he law as an acting Chairperson; there is only Chairperson. The law regulates how a Chairperson i s adopted, and the paper that has been tabled shows that the Solicitor General has asked the Boar d to take measures, because you can't go on flouting the law. Would the hon. Prime Minister ta ke this matter seriously, and even if he intends to extract IBA and replace it by some other institution, that the Chairperson be appointed in the meantime in accordance to the law? 43 The Prime Minister: My understanding, Mr Speaker, Sir, is different. You can appoint an acting Chairperson in the absence of a Chairpers on. But I will look into it. (PQ No. B/2 - See Written Answers to Questions) TOURISTS - CRIMINAL OFFENCES AGAINST (No. B/3) Mr K. Ramano (Second Member for Belle Ros e & Quatre Bornes) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affai rs and External Communications whether, in regard to reported cases of criminal offences co mmitted against tourists, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to - (a) since 2005 to date, the number thereof, indicat ing the number of convictions secured, and (b) if the \" Police du Tourisme\" is still operational and, if so, the measures envi saged to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to part (a) of the quest ion, I am informed by the Commissioner of Police that, during the period 2005 to 17 March 2011, the number of reported cases of criminal offences commi tted against tourists is as follows - 2005 - 913 2006 - 331 2007 - 861 2008 - 724 2009 - 471 2010 - 292 and as at 17 March, the number of cases is 75. Convictions were secured in 239 cases. Police enqu iry is ongoing in 324 cases; the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions has b een sought in eight cases. 16 cases are before Court, and 3,380 cases have been filed. In regard to part (b) of the question, I am informe d that, in the context of the implementation of the National Policing Strategic F ramework and the reorganisation of the 44 Emergency Response Service, the Police du Tourisme has been integrated within the ERS as from July 2010. The duties of the ERS have been en larged, and tourist protection is one of the primary responsibilities of the ERS. The main obje ctive of this reorganisation is to attend as promptly as possible to cases of tourists who are v ictims of larceny, larceny with violence, larceny breaking and other offences. All requests and cases involving tourists are now directed to the ERS Operations Room, which immediately infor ms the ERS crew in the divisions concerned for quicker action. The reorganisation of the ERS is yielding positive results. The number of criminal offences committed against tourists reported to the police has decreased from 913 in 2005 to 292 last year. The police are setting up a Tourist Facilitation De sk at the Police Head Quarters, Line Barracks, to deal with matters relating to the tour ists, so that they know that they have one place also that they can go to. On the other hand, since 01 October 2008, the Minis ter of Tourism and leisure, to enhance the security of tourists, has decided that all licensed tourist operators should be equipped - 1) with a compulsory installation of a 24-hour came ra surveillance in hotels and large guest houses; 2) 24-hour watchmanship, digital safes and emergenc y telephone numbers; 3) compulsory installation of electronic locks with audit trail for all new hotels, and 4) additionally, guest houses and bungalows having more than five rooms must be equipped with burglar alarm systems with rapid resp onse. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is in addition to the CCTV c ameras already installed at Flic en Flac and Quatre Bornes. Others are nearly finished ; I think this week or next week they will be installed in the region of Grand'Baie, and then wil l be followed by Port Louis. Mr Speaker, Sir, we place a high premium on the saf ety and security of all residence, including tourists who visit our country. We shall continue to leave no stone unturned, to ensure that our country remains a safe destination. 45 Mr B\u00e9renger: Can I know from the hon. Prime Minister whether, am ongst the cases he referred to, there have been cases where the touris ts concerned have been made to come back from overseas to be a witness before the Court and, if yes, what arrangements are made in terms of air ticket and so on? The Prime Minister: I am told that, in such cases, air tickets have to be provided for them to come. But there are some problems, and tha t is why the Commissioner of Police indicated to me that he wants to change the system. Mr Speaker, Sir, a tourist comes here on holiday, there is an offence committed, whether it' s theft or whatever, and then he has to travel back for he has to work in his country. Afterward s, he has to come back to be a witness, and God knows whether he will be a witness and whether he will have to come back again. That is one of the difficulties that we have, and that is w hy the police have to reorganise the Police du Tourisme . Mr Baloomoody: Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, when looking at the stati stics, we should not take too much pride, because many tourists do not c omplain to the police in view of the difficulties the hon. Prime Minister has just menti oned. Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he will see with the police and the Judicia ry that we have a sort of fast track trial for these specific cases? This involves not only the p olice but also the Judiciary, and this will encourage tourists to report matters to the police. The Prime Minister: That has already been done. I think I have answered a question in Parliament, if I am not mistaken. That is what I a m told. MISS P.S - ALLEGED RAPE (No. B/4) Mrs F. Labelle (Third Member for Vacoas & Floreal) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to the alleged case of rape on the person of one Miss P. S., on or about 07 September 2006, reported at the Rivi\u00e8re des Anguilles Police Statio n, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to if a fresh enquiry has been initiated to look into the whole case, indicating if the DNA test has now been carried out to establish the paternal filiation of the child of Miss P. S. 46 The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer the hon. Me mber to the reply made to PQ No. 1B/136 on 29 June 2010. I have been informed by the Commissioner of Police that the police have examined anew the case, and no fresh evidence was disclosed. The matter was nevertheless referred to the DPP again in July 2010. The DPP has advised no further action on 22 July 20 10 in view of the numerous contradictions in Miss P. S's statements, and in th e absence of reliable evidence to establish the offence of rape against the respective defendants. The DPP concluded that, since there was no prosecution, the case for a DNA test did not arise in the criminal context. The DPP further advised that, being given that proceedings to estab lish the filiation of a child are of a civil nature , no further action is required from the police in fu rtherance of a DNA test. However, Miss P. S may wish to initiate civil proceedings for recherche de paternit\u00e9, under Article 340 of the Code Civil Mauricien, and have recourse to a DNA test in that respect. I am told, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the mother of Miss P. S. was subsequently informed by the Officer-in-Charge of Rivi\u00e8re des Anguilles Police Station of the outcome of the case , and that she may initiate civil proceedings for recherche de paternit\u00e9 under Article 340 of the Code Civil Mauricien . However, she declined to do so. Mrs Labelle: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I quote part of the answer tha t the hon. Prime Minister, himself, gave to the House when he first replied to this question? In fact, the hon. Prime Minister himself said - \"In fact, to me, this looks like a clear derelictio n of duty.\" The hon. Prime Minister informed the House that the Commissioner of Police has initiated an inquiry to find out why the DNA test h as not been carried out. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he has been m ade aware that, following his reply on 29 June, on 05 July, the police called on Miss P. S. t o inform them that the DNA test would be done on 07 July, but on the 6 th they called to say that this would be postponed. Can we know whether he has been provided with this piece of information that the police called on that person to tell them that the test would be effected on 07 July? The Prime Minister: In fact, the hon. Member is quoting me rightly, but I relied on information that she gave to the House. I thought it was a blatant case of not doing her duty properly. I thought that because of what she said. I did not know about the case; I did not ask 47 for the DPP's file to be sent to me. But what I ha ve now understood is that, because of the question that has been asked to see whether there i s a possibility of the DNA test, they have been advised by the DPP that due to the contradictions i n the case, it is not possible to follow up with the case. Mrs Labelle: Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he has been informed that a close relative of one of the suspec ts is working - or has been working - at that particular Police Station where the case was report ed? The Prime Minister: I did not get that detail from the hon. Member last time. But, if that is the case, give me the name, and I will ask the police to inquire into that. Dr. S. Boolell: May I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he could ascertain that the DNA test be made available to the public at large? Because, right now, it is quite restricted to only cases which are... Mr Speaker: The question does not arise from this question! Hon . Bhagwan! MBC - MRS R. A. - REINSTATEMENT (No. B/5) Mr R. Bhagwan (First Member for Beau Bass in & Petite Rivi\u00e8re) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs a nd External Communications whether, in regard to Mrs R. A., he will state if he has receiv ed representations from the Trade Union Federations for her reinstatement at the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, in fact, received such rep resentations, and I have been informed that Mrs R. A. has opted to re port a dispute to the Commission for Conciliation and Mediation, claiming her reinstatem ent following her dismissal. However, I am given to understand that lawyers repr esenting the MBC before the Commission have raised objection to the power of th e Commission to entertain the dispute. At any rate, it would certainly not be proper for m e to act on those representations, as independent institutions set up under the Labour le gislation should be allowed to function without any political intervention or pressure. Mr Bhagwan: For us, this is a clear case of victimisation. Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he is following what is happening? From what we see, hear and read, I think 48 the MBC, through its Director General, is flouting with legislations as far as the powers of the Commission for Conciliation and Mediation is concer ned. Regularly, we are seeing that the MBC is not appearing. The MBC gives us the impress ion that it is flouting and hiding behind all sorts of arguments. So, can the hon. Prime Ministe r, at least, as Minister responsible, put some order at the MBC/TV where it's like un E tat dans un Etat ? The Prime Minister: As I explained, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is being taken up by the lawyers of the MBC who are advising that it does no t have. The whole idea of the Commission for Conciliation and Mediation was to try to see wh ether the conciliation and mediation is possible. My understanding is that it is practical ly impossible. That is my understanding, and that is why I believe the lawyers are saying they d on't find a need to appear, but that they should be able to take up all this in Court. Mr Obeegadoo: Mr Speaker, Sir, is the hon. Prime Minister aware that when somebody who is universally acknowledged to be his loyal pol itical agent chooses to snub the Commission for Conciliation and Mediation, he is undermining t he conciliation mechanism under Labour laws introduced by the Prime Minister's own Governm ent, thereby creating a very dangerous precedent, setting up bad example for anti-union em ployers of this country? Mr Speaker: I am sorry to intervene at this stage. According t o the Standing Orders, the hon. Member cannot ask a question for an expression of opinion or for a solution to a legal problem. Mr Obeegadoo: I am not asking for an opinion. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me rephrase that. Does the hon. Prime Minister agree that, objectivel y, when his loyal political agent snubs the Commission, he is undermining the conciliation mech anism under the Labour laws voted in by the hon. Prime Minister's own Government, and setti ng a dangerous precedent? Is he aware that this is objectively how the situation is read by an ti-union employers of this country? The Prime Minister: I see the hon. Member says 'loyal agent'. He star ted with the MMM, if I may tell him. (Interruptions) But, he opened his eyes; he saw finally, and he cha nged his mind. He has become wise after the event. 49 (Interruptions) Mr Speaker: Order! The Prime Minister: But the reason I do not want to intervene here is because lawyers are now discussing. I am told that he has got his legal adviser. I need to find out what they would say. POLICE FORCE - PROMOTION EXERCISE (No. B/6) Mr A. Ganoo (First Member for Savanne & B lack River) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to the Police Force, he will, for the benefit of the H ouse, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to where matters stand in relation t o the promotion exercise in each of the grades of - (a) Police Constable to Police Sergeant; (b) Police Sergeant to Police Inspector of, and (c) Police Inspector and above. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I shall rep ly to Parliamentary Questions B/6 and B/18 together, as t hey relate to the same issue. In regard to the promotion exercise to the grade of Police Sergeant, I am informed that 5,948 eligible Police Constables and Corporals sat for the last competitive examination conducted by the Disciplined Forces Service Commiss ion for the selection of around 300 best candidates. I am putting emphasis on this, because people think there are 5,948 posts available. There are only 300 posts available, roughly. As fo r the promotion to the rank of Police Inspector, 1,017 eligible Police Sergeants and Sub- Inspectors sat for the last competitive examination for the selection again of around 200 b est candidates. I must point out that any member of the Force, even on interdiction or under report, is eligible to sit for these examinations. However, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are administrative procedures which must be followed to finalise the promotion exercise. When the DFSC informs the Commissioner of Police of its decision regarding the results, it draws the attent ion of the Commissioner of Police to the fact 50 that he must now ensure that none of the officers w ho has been successful in the examination is under interdiction or is the subject of disciplinar y proceedings which are still pending for any serious offence, or is on unauthorised absence, and that there is no serious adverse report on any of them. The Commissioner of Police was additionally informe d that there were police officers, and not one, who were being investigated by ICAC. That he did not know at the beginning. It is only afterwards that he found out. So, he had to g o through each and every case. Now that all administrative procedures relating to both promotion exercises have been completed, that is, from the rank of Police Constab le to Police Sergeant, and from the rank of Police Sergeant to Police Inspector, the names of t he selected officers are being published. Police are carrying out, I should point out, an ove rall promotion exercise concerning all the ranks in the Force, and this exercise is being done progressively from the lowest rank. So far, 248 Constables have already been promoted to t he rank of Corporal and 38 Sergeants to the rank of Sub-Inspector. Promotion to the ranks of C hief Inspector and above will follow shortly. Mr Ganoo: These exams were conducted two years ago. In the c ase of the rank of Sergeant to Police Inspector, exams were conducted on 31 January 2009; in the case of the Police Constable to Police Sergeant, the exams were conducted on 14 February 2009, and on 14 May 2009 - two years ago - a list of 123 Police Ser geants who had successfully passed the competitive examinations were, in fact, published i n the routine orders, serial number 20/09. On many occasions, the hon. Prime Minister has said th at the exercise will be finalised soon. He had already given the reason, that is, they must be cle ared as to whether they are under disciplinary action and so on. In one case, the hon. Prime Mini ster said that it was because of the impending coming general elections; and that's one year ago. So, in the meantime, many of them have retired, as the hon. Prime Minister should know. T herefore, can I ask the hon. Prime Minister, on a human level, whether these examinations would be finalised and the names of these successful Police Sergeants and Police Inspectors p ublished once for all? Because it is causing a lot of stress and trauma not only to them, but also to their families, as they are growing old and will lose promotion chances and other opportunities . The Prime Minister: Just to correct the hon. Member, some of them have been promoted before their retirement. I sympathise wit h them, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I cannot go and 51 do the work. But, unfortunately, after the Commiss ioner of Police published the routine list, many of the names happened to be under investigatio n by ICAC. He had to go and see whether there were serious offences, not serious offences, less serious offences. But this has been done and, as I said, the procedure has started. 248 Con stables have already been promoted to the rank of Corporal, 38 Sergeants to the rank of Sub-Inspec tor, starting from the bottom, and these are imminent. Mr Bhagwan: Can the hon. Prime Minister inform the House wheth er it is only by mere coincidence that the automatic promotion of Corpora ls has been approved and made public this Friday, on the eve of Parliament, when we have a PQ set? Is this a coincidence? Mr Speaker: No, this is not allowed! Hon. Mrs Radegonde! LA GAULETTE - POLICE STATION (No. B/7) Mrs J. Radegonde (Fourth Member for Savan ne & Black River) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs a nd External Communications whether, in regard to the project for the construction of a new Police Station at La Gaulette, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to - (a) if land has already been earmarked therefor, an d, if so, indicate the (i) location, and (ii) extent thereof, and (b) when works are expected to (i) start, and (ii) be completed. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to Parliamentary Questio n 1B/8 on 15 June 2010, I had indicated that priority was being given to the construction of new Police stations in regions where there were no Police stat ions. La Gaulette has been identified as an area requiring a new Police station. In regard to part (a) of the question, a plot of la nd of an extent of 1600 m 2 situated at La Gaulette, along the Black River-Savanne road, has a lready been vested in the Police Department. 52 In regard to part (b) of the question, the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, National Development Unit, Land Transport and Shipping is pr esently working on the architectural plans. The bidding documents are expected to be finalised by the end of this year, probably October. The contract will thereafter be awarded, and the co ntract period will be about eight months, from what I understand. LAGOONS - DROWNING CASES (No. B/8) Ms S. Anquetil (Fourth Member for Vacoas & Floreal) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to death by drowning in our lagoons, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to - (a) the number thereof for each of the last five ye ars, and (b) whether Government proposes to delimit swimming zones in our seas for the safety of the swimmers. The Prime Minister: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Commissioner of Police has in formed me of cases of drowning in our lagoons and reported to th e police from the year 2006 to 18 March 2011, and the number of cases is as follows - 2006 17 2007 16 2008 22 2009 39 2010 32, and so far, up to 18 March, seven. I am informed for part (b) that, in February 2009, a survey was carried out by the National Coast Guard with a view to identifying the sites where swimming zones needed to be demarcated in view of nautical activities and dange rous swimming zones, where signboards need to be placed. In its survey report, the National C oast Guard identified 33 public beaches requiring delimitation of swimming zones and 38 dan gerous swimming zones. 53 The report was submitted to the relevant institutio ns. Subsequently, projects for delimitation of the swimming zones by means of yell ow floats have been implemented at 17 of the most popular beaches amongst them. The exercis e is being extended to the other beaches identified by the National Coast Guard. In additio n, signboards have been placed at all the sites where there are dangerous swimming zones. In certa in places such as Flic en Flac and Belle Mare, dangerous zones have also been demarcated by red floats. Mr Speaker, Sir, the public beach at Tamarin is on the list of the sites identified by the National Coast Guard where delimitation of a swimmi ng zone is required and where there is a dangerous swimming zone. A double sided signboard has been placed at the site to inform the public of the dangerous swimming zone. However, th e delimitation of the swimming zone is yet to be carried out at Tamarin, and I have stressed t he urgency of the matter. Ms Anquetil : Mr Speaker Sir, I thank the hon. Prime Minister f or his answer. Can the hon. Prime Minister inform the House if Government might consider two things? One, to adopt a flag warning system on the most popular public be aches and, second, to provide lifeguard beach patrol on the public beaches during weekends, public holidays and school holidays. The Prime Minister : The problem is, Mr Speaker, Sir, a question of av ailability. We need to have these people first of all. Unfortunat ely, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am told that even where there are signs, people ignore them and swim. Even when there is a cyclone warning, people go and swim. They must become more responsible. I in tend to ask them to also advertise the sites on television. But, with regard to having people a t the beaches all the time, it is not going to be practical at this point of time. Mr Speaker : I have to advise the House that Parliamentary Que stions B/13 and B/14 have been withdrawn. Hon. Fran\u00e7ois! PORT MATHURIN - 'ALIZE' VESSEL (No. B/9) Mr J. F. Fran\u00e7ois (Third Member for Rodri gues) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and External Comm unications whether, in regard to the vessel Alize which called at Port Mathurin on 14 Ja nuary 2011, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Mauritius Ports Authority, i nformation as to - (a) the purpose of its call, 54 (b) whether the vessel is in possession of valid ce rtificates to operate, and (c) whether any inspection for compliance to the co nditions for operation has been carried out and, if so, table a copy of the report. The Prime Minister : Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards part (a) of the quest ion, I am informed by the Mauritius Ports Authority that the vessel \"A liz\u00e9\" flying Malagasy Flag called at the port of Port Mathurin on 14 January 2011, in connection with a proposed project for the setting up of a floating fish processing plant, including cold ro om facilities for the fishermen in Rodrigues. The vessel was cleared by the Customs, Health and I mmigration Authorities upon arrival and it is currently berthed in the outer anchorage of Port Mathurin, in order not to hamper the operations of the Mauritius Pride and Mauritius Tro chetia. As regards parts (b) and (c) of the question, I am informed that a Joint Mission was undertaken by the Mauritius Ports Authority and the Shipping Division of the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, National Development Unit, Land Tra nsport and Shipping, from 22 to 26 February 2011, to inspect the vessel \"Aliz\u00e9\". The joint inspection mission has identified a series of shortcomings. Also, in its present state, the v essel is not compliant with the requirements of the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention of the International Maritime Organisation, as well as the Convention on Marine Pollution (MARPOL) . Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of the report of the Joint Mission, the Ministry of Fisheries and Rodrigues, the Rodrigues Regional Assembly, the Mauritius Ports Authority and the Shipping Division of the Ministry of Public Infrast ructure, National Development Unit, Land Transport and Shipping are sorting out all pending issues. Mr Fran\u00e7ois: May I ask the hon. Prime Minister who initially rec ommended to Rodrigues this old vessel with barely any maintenan ce, and qualified by the local people and fishers in Rodrigues as a bateau poubelle with regard to its current state and environmental threat? Was it the RRA or the Ministry for Rodrigu es? The Prime Minister : There was a different Chief Commissioner in Rodri gues at that time I believe. I must clarify one thing, Mr Speak er, Sir. They are not using the vessel as a shipping vessel. They want to use it as what they call a factory. I am told that it is generating 55 about hundreds opportunities for Rodriguans to work . But, still, it is not in compliance with the law, and that is why it needs to be sorted out. Mr B\u00e9renger: Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he has l iaised with the Minister of Fisheries and Rodrigues qui a vant\u00e9 les m\u00e9rites of that kind of boat? How could the Minister canvass in favour of that kind of vessel? The Prime Minister: That is not something that comes to Cabinet. This was done through the Regional Assembly. Now that the proble m has arisen, it has been drawn to our attention. As I said, they are looking into the ma tter. Mr B\u00e9renger: Can I ask the hon. Prime Minister whether he is aw are that there is a security threat there where the vessel is? Is the hon. Prime Minister aware that when a cyclone - only a few days ago - was getting close to Rodrigue s, there was no captain on board, no one could be found to put that vessel to safety? The Prime Minister: This is precisely why I said it is not in complian ce with the requirements even though it might be used as une usine. It needs to be able to be moved out and, apparently, this was the problem. Mr B\u00e9renger: I do not want to target anybody; I won't mention n ames. Is he aware that this whole thing has come up mainly because of an a dviser in one of the Ministries concerned, a foreigner, who has advised in that direction and pu shed in that direction? I am not targeting the gentleman. Will the hon. Prime Minister look into that also? The Prime Minister: I will certainly look into this. Mr Fran\u00e7ois: Mr Speaker, Sir, along the same line, prior to and at the time of call, did the appointed agent of the vessel define officially the purpose of Aliz\u00e9 to Rodrigues and, if not, when he did so? The Prime Minister: As I said, this was cleared by the Customs, Health and Immigration Authorities upon arrival in Rodrigues a nd, therefore, they must have looked at all these matters. Mr Fran\u00e7ois: For the information of the House, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am going to table a photo of what the vessel looks like. 56 Mr Speaker: Time is over! The Table has been advised that Parl iamentary Question No. B/42 with regard to freight and other charges will be replied by hon. Minister of Public Infrastructure. Questions addressed to hon. Ministe rs! Hon. Seetaram! MONT IDA - FOOTBALL GROUND (No. B/19) Mr J. Seetaram (Second Member for Montag ne Blanche & GRSE) asked the Minister of Local Government and Outer Islands whether, in regard to the football ground at Mont Ida, he will for the benefit of the House, obt ain from the Moka/Flacq District Council, information as to if it is proposed to make provisi on thereat for - (a) parking facilities; (b) a cloakroom; (c) rest rooms, and (d) a children's playground. Mr Aim\u00e9e: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am informed that the football gr ound at Mont Ida has been constructed by the National Development Unit and th at, as to date, there has been no proposal for the provision of parking facilities, cloakroom, res t rooms and children's playground. Mr Seetaram: Can the hon. Minister kindly consider making provi sions for, at least, a parking, a children's playground and also for the e mbellishment of the Mont Ida football playground? Mr Aim\u00e9e: I will surely look into it, Mr Speaker, Sir. BRAMSTHAN - SCHOOL LANE - DRAINS (No. B/20) Mr J. Seetaram (Second Member for Montag ne Blanche & GRSE) asked the Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping whether he will state if it is proposed to put up n ew drains along the school lane at Bramsthan, as there is recurrent water accumulation thereat after heavy rainfalls. Mr Bachoo: Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not only new drains along s chool lane at Bramsthan, but the entire region including Sarcelle Bridge at Bramsthan is being upgraded. (PQ No. B/21 - see Written Answers to Questions) 57 GOVERNMENT HOUSE, EMMANUEL ANQUETIL, RENGANADEN SEENEEVASSEN & AIR MAURITIUS BUILDINGS - FIBRE OPTICS CABLES (No B/22) Mr J. Seetaram (Second Member for Montagne Blanche & GRSE) asked the Minister of Information and Communication Techn ology whether, in regard to the project of connecting the Government House, Emmanuel Anquetil, Renganaden Seeneevassen and Air Mauritius buildings via fibre optics cables, he wil l state where matters stand. Mr Pillay Chedumbrum: Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry had, on 30 November 2 010, signed a project implementation agreement which com prises the carrying out of civil works for connecting the four buildings, which accommodate Mi nistries and Government Departments for the installation and commissioning of the Gigabit P assive Optical Network. The works started in December 2010 and was executed over a period of thr ee months by virtue of the contractual agreement with the Mauritius Telecom, and is now un der testing and commissioning phase. Mr Seetaram: Would the hon. Minister kindly inform the House whe ther the installation of the fibre optic cables would, in any way whatsoe ver, encourage savings at all Ministries level in terms of communication? Mr Pillay Chedumbrum: In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, the project is a very im portant one, as the internet bandwidth that will be offered using f ibre optics will be as far as 50 times higher than the bandwidth presently offered via copper wi re on the Government intranet system. The present technology, that is, Government intranet sy stem via copper wire, has reached its limitation and cannot be further upgraded to meet t he growing communication needs of Government departments. With this new project, the total bandwidth will be increased from 20 MB per second to 160 MB per second, and in those fo ur buildings, thus improving considerably the internet performance as well as enhancing Gover nment operations and its interface with the general public for better public service delivery. Mr Khamajeet: Will the Minister inform the House why only the fou r Government buildings have been chosen? Mr Pillay Chedumbrum: In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, these four buildings hav e been targeted in the pilot phase, as they are hosting gr eater number of Ministries and Government departments. In due course, the new GPON technolog y will be rolled out to the other buildings also. 58 SCHOOLS - KREOL LANGUAGE - INTRODUCTION (No. B/23) Mrs F. Labelle (Third Member for Vacoas & Floreal) asked the Minister of Education and Human Resources whether, in regard to the kreol language, he will state if it will be introduced as an optional language in 2012 and, if so, the measures Government proposes for the recruitment of teachers for the teaching th ereof. Dr. Bunwaree: Mr Speaker, Sir, in line with the announcement mad e in the Government Programme for the introduction of Kreol Morisien as an optional subject in schools, my Ministry has initiated a number of measures since August 201 0 with a view to ensuring that the Kreol Morisien is introduced in primary schools at Std I level as soon as feasible and if all works as planned, as from January 2012. In my reply to PQ 1B/659 for the sitting of Tuesday 23 November 2010, I informed the House of the organisation of a National Forum on 30 August 2010 on the introduction of Kreol Morisien as an optional subject in schools. Subsequently, G overnment decided to set up a Technical Committee known as the 'Akademi Kreol Morisien', to look into all aspects related to the introduction of the Kreol Morisien in schools along with, inter alia , a harmonised version of its written form. The ' Akademi Kreol Morisien', which was set up in October 2010, has appointed fou r Working Groups to look into specific issues such as writing system, grammar, curriculum and teacher training, and these working groups are well into the fulfilment of their assignments. I wish to inform the House that, prior to the intro duction of this language, a number of steps would have to be followed - (i) finalisation of standardised writing system; (ii) finalisation of the grammar; (iii) development of the relevant curriculum, and (iv) preparation of workbooks for Standard I pupils and teachers' Guide. On 21 February 2011, the AKM finalised the 'LORTOGRAF KREOL MORISIEN', which was presented to me in the context of the Internati onal Mother Language Day 2011. 59 Once work will have been completed by the different groups, the subject will be ready to be offered at Standard I in schools. While this is underway, my Ministry has already started the administrative process related to the recruitment o f teachers. It is estimated that, initially, some 60 teachers will be required for teaching the subje ct in the 272 primary schools. Trainee Educators (Primary) enlisted in 2008 and wh o are interested in teaching Kreol Morisien have been invited on 08 March 2011 to submit their application for a six-month training programme to be carried out by the MIE. T hese teachers have to be trained in the pedagogy related to the teaching of the subject. T o date, 28 teachers have expressed their interest to teach Kreol Morisien . It is expected that this number will increase by the closing date (25 March 2011). With a view to enabling a proper planning to be car ried out, parents registering their child for admission to Standard I as from January 2012 wi ll be called upon to exercise their option. This exercise will be conducted earlier than usual this year, i.e. in April, instead of May, to enable my Ministry to obtain the number of pupil s who will opt for Kreol Morisien and, consequently, to determine the human resource requi rements. I wish to inform the House also that a sensitisatio n campaign will be carried out prior to the admission exercise to highlight the importance of the use of Kreol Morisien for the teaching and learning process to help the parents in making their options. Mr Speaker: We will continue with the supplementary questions after lunch. I suspend for one and a half hours. At 1.01 p.m. the sitting was suspended. On resuming at 2.34 p.m with the Deputy Speaker in the Chair. Mrs Labelle: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since the hon. Minister has mentioned that the teachers who will be teaching the Creole language a re from the general purpose, may I ask him what are the arrangements he is considering when th ese teachers will be absent, and whether an evaluation has been made regarding the disturbance which will be caused to the pupils while their teacher will be teaching the Creole language particularly in other schools? Dr. Bunwaree: Here, I don't find the problem. This is a feature that h appens for any other language in any other school. But what is im portant to note is that the planning is being 60 done properly, so that at the beginning we have eno ugh teachers to teach these languages as the other optional languages. It will be along the sam e trend. Mrs Labelle: My question was: the teachers who were teaching th e other Asian languages are not attached to a class, but if we ar e taking teachers from general purpose, I take it that these teachers are attached to a class. Will it be so? Dr. Bunwaree: If they are attached to a class, they will no long er be attached to the class. The option for them will be to go and teach only th is, as the other teachers. Mr Obeegadoo: Mr Speaker, Sir, we all agree that the technical c ommittee, which the Minister calls an academy, is doing a good work, bu t we are now in a race against time. If Creole, as an optional subject, is to be introduced in January next year, will the Minister consider the advisability of setting up an implementation co mmittee - not the technical committee, not the academy, but officials of the Ministry and of the M IE - to manage this project, to follow up on the technical committee's work, and ensure that in terms of textbooks, in terms of teacher training, we are really prepared for the beginning of the next academic year? Dr. Bunwaree: The implementation committee has already been set u p; it is already there, and it is, in fact, because it is working pr operly that we are on time. Mr Obeegadoo: That's the information I have from the technical co mmittee. Be that as it may, the point raised by my hon. colleague regar ding teachers is very controversial amongst the unions, as the Minister will agree. Will he, t herefore, consider urgent consultations with all the unions, so that there is some sort of stakehold er consensus as to the status of those teachers who will teach Mauritian Creole, their promotion pr ospects, the number to be recruited and the manner of their training? Dr. Bunwaree: I don't find the problem. Let us not create proble ms where there is none! Il y a des professeurs-\u00e9ducateurs \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re. In fact, in the letter that has been sent to thos e who are interested, let me quote paragraph 6 - \"In the event you elect to serve as Educator Kreol Morisien , you will retain all the terms and conditions of service, including seniority plac ing and promotional prospects throughout.\" Il ne faut pas cr\u00e9er des probl\u00e8mes. Au matin qu'on est en train de 61 le maximum \u00e0 une vitesse rapide - qu'au \u00e9coles. Mr Obeegadoo: We would be even happier if we manage to meet the o bjective at the beginning of next year. My point is: right now, as the Minister is aware - since he reads the press as we all do - there is still a lot of controversy concerning recruitment and status of those teachers. So, will he - I repeat the question - con sider the advisability of meeting all the unions, so that we can have, as early as possible, a consen sus on this issue? Dr. Bunwaree: Pour comprendre la presse, je la lis \u00e0 l'envers. Mrs Ribot: I would like to ask the hon. Minister, since there are only 28 teachers to date who have expressed their wish to be registered as t eachers of Creole language, what if the number needed is not reached? Dr. Bunwaree: Of course, we have thought about that. We have so many other possibilities. In fact, we are trying to get those teachers of the MIE who are going to join the schools in the weeks to come; we have supply teache rs, but all these teachers, whoever they are, will need to go to the 6-month training course, and we have put deadlines for that. Mrs Labelle: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am coming to the questio n of the 6-month training. As it is mentioned in the circular sent by the hon. Minister to head teachers, may I ask the hon. Minister whether there is a time schedule when this training is to be started, and also the 28 replies that the Ministry has received are out o f which number? Dr. Bunwaree: The 28 replies, out of those who have been attache d to MIE, are following the courses. I don't know the number exa ctly; I need notice for that. We are planning in such a way that the six-month must end before th e end of the school year, that is, before the end of October this year. LA TOUR KOENIG & R\u00c9SIDENCE COQUILLAGE - AIR POLLUTION (No. B/24) Mr J. C. Barbier (Second Member for GRNW & Port Louis West) asked the Minister of Environment and Sustainable Develop ment whether in regard to the air monitoring at La Tour Koenig and R\u00e9sidence Coquillage , following the air pollution caused by Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile Limit\u00e9e , he will state if his Ministry has made any recommendations in relation thereto and, if so, wil l he table copy thereof. 62 Mr Virahsawmy: Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, my Ministry had made the fo llowing recommendations to be implemented by CMT Lt\u00e9e throu gh an Enforcement Notice - (i) submit an Environmental Monitoring Plan for app roval by the Director of Environment; (ii) carry out an audit of the boilers to identify cause of breakdown, and to submit a programme of measures to remedy the situation, incl uding a contingency plan in case of any incidence that can affect the environme nt; (iii) submit a schedule for regular maintenance of boilers; (iv) inform this Ministry of additional measures ta ken to ensure surveillance of stack emissions at all time when the boilers are in opera tion; (v) carry out a survey of affected areas; (vi) clean up/reinstate the premises in the vicinit y of CMT which have been affected by deposition of particulate matter. A copy of the recommendations with the conditions o f the Enforcement Notice is being tabled. Mr Barbier: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I inform the hon. Minis ter that, in spite of all the measures proposed by his Ministry - I don't kno w whether all these have been implemented or not - from time to time, we are still having ash coming from the chimneys, which is spreading all over the region around the CMT. I would like t o know whether the Minister is agreeable to accept the proposal of the inhabitants of this area to ask CMT to raise the chimneys like at Saint Louis power station and Victoria power station, whe re the chimneys are high enough, and the ash spreads over the sea. Will the Minister consid er this request of the inhabitants of La Tour Koenig and R\u00e9sidence Coquillage ? Will he set up a committee to follow up this pro posal? Mr Virahsawmy : I do not have any objection. In fact, I think th at it is a good proposal. There is already a committee set up by Government i n March 2010 and which is made up of various Ministries. I shall ask the Committee to m eet the Directors of CMT. We shall discuss together to see how we can improve the height of th e chimney so that this can bring a better solution to the environment and to the residents of the region. 63 BREEDERS - LIVESTOCK FEED (No. B/25) Mr J. C. Barbier (Second Member for GRNW & Port Louis West) asked the Minister of Agro-Industry and Food Security whe ther he will state the measures Government proposes to take for breeders following its decisio n to stop the production of livestock feed. Mr Faugoo : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in June 2009, Government decided to close down the Richelieu Livestock Food Factory, formally know n as the maize mill created in 1943, as it was no longer economically viable to continue the m anufacture of livestock feed. The factory had been in operation for some 70 years with very o ld and obsolete equipment, which had never been renewed. The maintenance of same was very hig h, and the maximum production capacity was 7,000 tonnes, which represented only 6% of the total quantity of livestock feed produced locally. The cost of production per tonne of feed was higher than the selling price of feed manufactured by private companies. The factory cea sed operation in October 2009. However, to maintain the support to small breeders, my Ministry introduced a new scheme for the benefit of breeders who have been pu rchasing feed manufactured by Richelieu Livestock Feed Factory. The new scheme operates th rough a voucher system for the benefit of small breeders, whereby small cow, goat and pig bre eders are granted a subsidy which actually stands out Rs2,000 per tonne. As at date, there ar e 1,115 breeders benefiting from the scheme. I wish to remind the House that, upon closure of th e feed factory, the direct subsidy was increased from Rs1,500 to Rs2,000 per tonne. Mr Barbier : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are so many breeder s who have not been able to take advantage of the new scheme that the Minist ry is putting forward. Will the Minister inform the House who are those eligible to benefit from the new scheme, and how to take advantage of it? Will his Ministry issue a communi qu\u00e9 to breeders, so that those who are not having the possibility of taking advantage of the s cheme may do so? Mr Faugoo : This scheme was launched back in October 2009, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. There were communiqu\u00e9s and all the breeders were in formed accordingly. In fact, all the breeders registered with the feed factory and AREU were entitled to the subsidy under the scheme. It was not open to newcomers, because we h ad to stop the list somewhere. Even today 64 it is not open, as it is only for those who are on the list of purchasers at the time of closure of th e feed factory. Mr Barbier : Could the Minister inform the House what about th e new breeders who are coming into operation now? Mr Faugoo : As I said, the subsidy is limited to those on the list only, but there is a lot of other schemes which are being put in place by Gover nment to enhance the sector in general, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. CPE - CURRICULUM (No. B/26) Mr S. Obeegadoo (Third Member for Curepi pe & Midlands) asked the Minister of Education and Human Resources whether, in regard to the Certificate of Primary Education, he will state if, in view of the failure rate over the years, Government proposes to review the appropriateness of the examination and r elated curriculum to ensure that all children acquire the essential basic knowledge and competenc ies. Dr. Bunwaree : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question refers to CP E failure rate, and I would like first of all to start by informing the H ouse that, over the past few years, the rate of failure for the CPE Examination has been gradually on the decline. Prior to 2005, particularly in 2004, the failure rate was 37%. In 2004, the pass rate was 63%, and it gradually increased to reach 68.5% in 2010 and, consequently, the failure rate was brought down from 37% in 2004 to 31.5%, that is, a reduction of 5.5% within the 5-6 past years. Nonetheless, efforts are being stepped up to further improve the performance at CP E level. One of the concerns of my Ministry is to set the ri ght structure for the CPE Examination, to ensure that all children acquire the essential B asic Knowledge and Competencies to enable them pursue secondary education. The present format of the paper caters for the acqu isition of essential Basic Knowledge and Competencies covered in Section A of all papers of the CPE syllabus. Since this examination serves the double purpose of certificat ion and admission to secondary schools, the paper caters also for average and above average pup ils through section B of the papers, which tests higher order competencies and skills. 65 The CPE, as we all know, in its current form, encou rages rote learning and teaching to the text rather than focusing on the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. It is precisely for this reason that my Ministry is , in fact, working towards a review of the CPE and the improvement of the performance at CPE. In this context, I have appointed, since January 2011, that is, early this year, a Committee compris ing representatives of my Ministry, Mauritius Examinations Syndicate and the Mauritius Institute of Education to work on the overall review of the CPE and related curriculum, so that children who have acquired the basic knowledge and competencies could attempt Section A of the Questio n Paper with success, and thus have the required foundation on which their secondary school ing could be based. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the problem of failures can not be addressed by exclusively reviewing the CPE. In parallel with the above init iative, my Ministry has also embarked on a number of pedagogical programmes that would help in the early identification of learning difficulties, and thus provide more appropriate sup port that would facilitate the children's mastery of the required competencies. These measur es are being implemented from an early stage of primary schooling, so as to overcome the l earning deficits that otherwise tend to accumulate. These measures include, inter alia , diagnostic assessment, continuous assessment and remedial education, as well as special remedial programmes for CPE repeaters. In addition, particular attention is being given to the ZEP scho ols for improvement of their performance. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to reassure the Hous e and especially the hon. Member that, in the context of this review exercise that h as far-reaching implications, I intend to engage into wide consultations at national level with all stakeholders who would be invited to submit their proposals and inputs. Mr Obeegadoo : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Minister seems t o have missed the point of this question. Being given that the point of basic primary education today is not just about going on to secondary education, but about eq uipping all children with the skills for employment and for life, being given that whatever the government, the pass rate stagnates below 70% and one out of four children leaves prima ry school every year without the CPE, is his government committed to an overhaul of our examinat ion system and a redefinition of primary or basic education for every child of this country? 66 Dr. Bunwaree : I agree with the hon. Member, but where I disagre e with him is that, at the CPE, we do not go to work. The child has got t o continue schooling; la scolarisation est obligatoire jusqu'\u00e0 seize ans . So, the child will have to go through secondary schooling, whether it is vocational or normal stream. We are agreeing on that, but I started my reply by saying that we have to forget what the hon. Member is trying to instil in the minds of people. The CPE pass rate is progressing year after year, a nd I would like to lay this graph on the Table of the Assembly. In fact, the down-going slope is when the hon. Member was Minister and the up-going slope is ours. Regardez \u00e7a, c'est parlant! We are doing well. The Deputy Speaker : It is being circulated. Dr. Bunwaree : The dip is in 2004. Mr Obeegadoo : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us forget the dip, le t us forget party politics. Being given that, at this rate of progress, it will require 35 years before we reach a 100% success rate, which is the objective of education, has Gove rnment discussed the proposal of the Opposition to lay party politics aside and to sit down together, to redefine, to agr ee and to forge a broad consensus, across political dividing lines, o n basic education that all children need to obtain and to succeed in obtaining? Dr. Bunwaree : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that I will open a fter our committee has worked on it - this will take a few weeks - a forum where all stakeholders will be invited, including the hon. Member. But saying that it will take 20 years, if he were there, it would have taken one century. Mrs Labelle : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I heard the hon. Minister mentioning, among measures to support and help the child to mas ter the basic education, a special remedial education. May I ask him if this is currently in p lace and, if so, since when, and at what time and by whom this special remedial education is being pr ovided in our schools? Dr. Bunwaree : This is an interesting question. In fact, we don 't have enough manpower to do what we would have wished to do, but it has s tarted, especially the special one for CPE repeaters; this is what I have said. We have notice d that the CPE repeaters do not master, for example, the programme of Standard III and, of cour se, less for Standard IV. If we start them repeating only Standard VI, they will definitely go straight to failure. All this is being taken care 67 of, and special remedial education has started this year. I will be very eager to see the results at the end of the year. Mr Bhagwan : The hon. Minister has just stated that the pass r ate is on the progress. My worry is about Cit\u00e9 Barkly, Marcel Gabon Government School, where the results have been on the decrease since 2005. It is going downwards yea r by year. I have asked questions and raised the matter with the hon. Minister who has initiated actions. Can the hon. Minister inform the House where matters stand concerning the follow-up? My problem is the follow-up at the level of the Ministry. I not only have the impression, b ut I am sure there are problems at the level of the Ministry, at the level of the administrative zo ne with regard to the follow-up actions initiated to have further progress and better results in that school, which is one of the poorest regions of Mauritius, if I may say. Dr. Bunwaree : Yes, the hon. Member has talked to me about that problem on quite a few occasions and he knows that we are doing our level best. The problem is more about a problem of the community around the school than in the scho ol itself. So, we are taking care of all these. I have a special eye on this school; he knows that. We hope that things will get better. Mr Bhagwan : Can I appeal to the hon. Minister? When the hon. Minister says the community, it is on both sides. I know this is the responsibility of parents, but it is also about the attitude of teachers, head teacher and officers of the Ministry - Cit\u00e9 Barkly is a region b ann dimoune mauvais, etc . It is not good to say so. My colleagues and I h ave even talked to the parents. Can I appeal to the Minister to have a me eting chaired by him - not by his officers - with the parties concerned to give clear directives , and that there is monitoring? Then, we, in Parliament, will be asking questions in the months to come. Dr. Bunwaree : Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Mrs Labelle : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Minister also me ntioned early diagnosis. I would like to know from the hon. Minister if, at present, after Standard III, when a child does not know how to write and read, there is any struct ure which will take care of this child, because the hon. Minister said that we do not have enough s tructures. I am just asking: do we have any structure which takes care of such a child? We kno w that there are many children. Allow me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to also mention two schools in my constituency, namely All\u00e9e Brillant 68 Government School and Espitalier No\u00ebl Government Sc hool. The results have been going down year after year. There is a big dip in both school s. Dr. Bunwaree : As I said, I would have personally wished to have special teachers for remedial action. In some cases, we do have. We ar e trying to do this with regard to the schools which the hon. Member has just mentioned, but we do not have enough structures. There is the enhancement programme, which is one way of getting these children out of this problem. This year, we have started the enhancement programme and , on top of Std IV, we are starting at Std III, where we are doing our best to try to get thes e children on the right side. Mrs Ribot : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from the hon. Minister if there are specific schools that have been highlighted for those special remedial education classes? Dr. Bunwaree : Not specific schools, but we are trying to find s pecific solutions for specific schools. Mr Obeegadoo : Let me ask the hon. Minister a straight question in the hope of getting a straight answer. Is it Government's intention that the National Form III examination should replace the CPE - this is the subject matter of the question - as a pass or fail examination? Dr. Bunwaree : We are not talking about the Form III assessment programme today. For the time being, it is an assessment; it is not even an examination. Let's wait; when we come to the bridge, we will cross it. PORT LOUIS - POSTER PANELS (No. B/27) Mr A. Ameer Meea (First Member for Port Louis Maritime & Port Louis East) asked the Minister of Local Government and Outer I slands whether, in regard to the fixing of posters, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Municipal Council of Port Louis, information as to the number of - (a) poster panels presently available therefor in t he district of Port Louis; (b) requests received from political parties since March 2010 to date, indicating in each case - (i) a list thereof; (ii) the number of posters affixed, and 69 (c) the amount of revenue perceived. Mr Aim\u00e9e : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the Muni cipal Council of Port Louis that 13 posted by panels are presently availa ble in the district of Port Louis. With regard to part (b) of the question, I am infor med that only one request was received from one political party since March 2010 to date f or authorisation of fixing 1,300 posters. As far as part (c) of the question is concerned, th e issue of revenue perceived does not arise, as authorisation was not granted by the Coun cil. Mr Ameer Meea : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can I ask the hon. Minist er whether the poster panels that are currently available in Port Louis a re from the Municipal Council of Port Louis or the Tourism Authority as well? The Deputy Speaker : I understand the question is with regard to the M unicipal Council of Port Louis. Mr Ameer Meea : Yes, but there are two different types of poster panels in Port Louis: one from the Municipal Council and one from the Tou rism Authority. The Deputy Speaker : Has the hon. Minister answered? Mr Aim\u00e9e : Both of them are included. Mr Ameer Meea : Are both of them included in the 13 panels that a re available? Mr Aim\u00e9e : Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Mr Ameer Meea : The hon. Minister confirmed that only one politic al party applied to the committee since March 2010. Can we know which party was it? Mr Aim\u00e9e : It was the MMM party. Mr Uteem : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in view of the size of Po rt Louis, does the hon. Minister intend to have more poster panels? He has indicated that there are currently only 13. Will the hon. Minister make the request to the loca l authorities to increase the number of poster panels? Mr Aim\u00e9e : I will take the request of the hon. Member into c onsideration. 70 Mr B\u00e9renger : The law has it now that you cannot put up posters except on those panels designated by the local government concerned. Now, we are told that for the whole of the capital city, it is 13, which is clearly insufficie nt, and I think that the Minister acknowledges it. The distribution is 13 for the whole of Port Louis. Does the hon. Minister have the geographical distribution in terms of constituencies or wards? Mr Aim\u00e9e : The information I have from the Council indicates that there are only 13. If there is a need of any more panels around the distr ict of Port Louis, which means two or three constituencies, I will instruct them to do it. Mr B\u00e9renger: I would like to know whether all the constituencies are covered. My information is that certain regions do not have suc h designated panels at all. Mr Aim\u00e9e: That is all the information I have. I know probabl y there are certain areas which are not well covered, but I will try to look into it and make sure that everywhere we will have posters panel. Mr B\u00e9renger: With your permission, I'll put the question a bit l arger. This is the law now - and it is rightly so - but there must be the required number of designated panels. So, can I ask the Minister whether he does not think that he should carry out a survey not just in the different constituencies of Port Louis, but the dif ferent towns, the different constituencies, including district councils in each area, about how many such panels are designated? Mr Aim\u00e9e: I will inform all the local authorities of the Repu blic of Mauritius for that particular application for hon. Members of Parliame nt. Mr Lesjongard: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon. Minister what are the criteria that are used by the Municipality of Port Louis for finalising the installation of poster panels in a specific area and how did we reach that number 13? The Deputy Speaker: I think the hon. Member should come with a specific question as regards the criteria. Mr B\u00e9renger: If you will allow me, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Gove rnment has chosen - freedom of expression is a fundamental right and ri ghtly so - to limit the use of areas where posters can be put up. Well, this touches upon the fundamental freedom. So, I take it that the 71 Government, through the Minister, must see to it th at this fundamental freedom is respected. We can't just be left to administrative purposes. Mr Aim\u00e9e: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question of posters aro und the island, not only in Port Louis, before the general election, does not a rise properly. It is only six months before the elections that they start to put these panels. (Interruptions) Mr Ameer Meea: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as regards the rules that have been applied for the fixing of posters, can I ask the hon. Minis ter whether these rules will be applied to the long-awaited municipal elections? The Deputy Speaker: This has nothing to do with the original question, please. Mr Ameer Meea: No, it has to do. The Deputy Speaker: No, I won't allow this question. The hon. Member c an come with a specific question. Hon. Barbier! Mr Barbier: As regards panels which have been set up by the Min istry of Tourism, may I ask the hon. Minister whether the local authoriti es have jurisdiction on these panels? Mr Aim\u00e9e: The local authorities have got the right on all the panels installed all around the island. TAMARIN - FIRE STATION - CONSTRUCTION (No. B/28) Mrs J. Radegonde (Fourth Member for Sava nne & Black River) asked the Minister of Local Government and Outer Islands whether, in regard to the project for the construction of a new Fire Station in Tamarin, he w ill, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Government Fire Services, information as to - (a) the regions that will be covered, and (b) if construction works have started and, if so, indicate - (i) the expected date of completion thereof, and (ii) when it will be operational. 72 Mr Aim\u00e9e: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed that the new Fire Station in Tamarin will cover the region from Flic en Flac to Le Morne . With regard to part (b) of the question, I am infor med that bids for the project have been invited on 30 December 2010, and the closing date w as 16 February 2011. The bids received are currently being evaluated. As far as the last part of the question is concerne d, I am informed that the construction period will be one year as from the date of start of work. BAGATELLE/RIVIERE DES ANGUILLES - DAMS - CONSTRUCTI ON (No. B/29) Dr. R. Sorefan (Fourth Member for La Cav erne & Phoenix) asked the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Publi c Utilities whether, in regard to the project for the construction of the Bagatelle and the Rivi\u00e8 re des Anguilles dams, he will, in each case, state - (a) when the project was initiated; (b) the estimated cost thereof, and (c) where matters stand. The Deputy Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a dam project in the regio n of Bagatelle was initiated in 2000. The feasibility s tudy was submitted in August 2003 identifying the site for the construction of a 16 million metre cube dam. However, in April 2004, the then Government decided that the dam site should be revi ewed as the proposed site was partly on prime private land. In June 2004, the feasibility study was undertaken solely on SLDC land and was completed in April 2006. In June 2006, Government' s approval was obtained to proceed with the detailed design of the dam on the new revisited site. Following the visit of the Prime Minister to the Pe ople's Republic of China, in November 2006, the seventh session of the Sino Mauritian Joi nt Commission agreed in May 2007 to consider funding, inter alia , of the Bagatelle Dam project. Several requests we re previously made to various funding agencies, but funding could not be secured for the works contract. 73 Tenders for consultancy services for the detailed d esign and construction supervision were launched in January 2008 and the contract awar ded to the Consultant Coyne et Bellier in January 2009 due to an extension of the closing dat e for submission of bids by the Central Procurement Board and challenge from one of the uns uccessful bidders. The detailed designs and drawings, including geotec hnical investigations were completed in November 2010. In September 2010, following dis cussions with the Chinese Embassy, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce submitted the name of its sole recommended contractor. Following consultations with the Public Procurement Office, the tender documents were sent to the recommended contractor on 08 December 2010. The bid was received on 07 March 2011 and is presen tly being evaluated by an Evaluation Committee. After the technical evaluati on, a Negotiating Committee chaired by a representative of the State Law Office will conduct negotiations with the bidder. It is expected to award the contract in June 2011 and to start wor ks in November 2011. The dam is expected to be completed in 2014. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the Rivi\u00e8re des Anguilles dam, the feasibility study for the construction of a dam in the South wa s initiated in March 2006 and was completed in May 2009. The detailed designs and preparation of draft bid d ocuments for a rock fill dam of about 14 million cubic metres were completed in October 2 009. An EIA study has also been completed in October 2010. Following an Expression of Interest issued in Septe mber 2010 by the Central Procurement Board for the design review and constru ction supervision, five consultancy firms were shortlisted in November 2010 and have been inv ited to submit proposals by the closing date of 06 April 2011. The Consultancy is expected to start in July 2011 and the works contract to be awarded in April/May 2012. The cons truction of the dam will be completed by mid 2015. With regard to part (b) of the question, the bid fo r Bagatelle Dam is under evaluation. The Rivi\u00e8re des Anguilles dam is expected to cost a round Rs3 m. 74 Mr B\u00e9renger: I am trying to convince myself that I've heard righ tly. In the case of Terre Rouge/Verdun road, bidding was restricted to three designated contractors. We raised hell, if you will allow me, and it went to open bidding. In a way, Rs500 m. were saved. Now, did I hear rightly that there has been one contractor only who has been invited to make his offer? The Deputy Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have underlined, it is no t one contractor who has been invited to make his offer; one contractor has been submitted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. We've had protracted discussions about submitting more than one and they were adamant that, with the experience before, it is better that they choose and propose. I have consulted the Public Procurement O ffice and they are agreeable as long as we put two committees; a committee to evaluate and a c ommittee on the legal side. Mr Lesjongard: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I ask the hon. Deputy P rime Minister on what basis the Central Procurement Board gave its a pproval for that type of bidding? The Deputy Prime Minister: No, it was not the Central Procurement Board; it w as the Procurement Office. CHILD BIRTH - CAESAREAN SECTION (No. B/30) Ms S. Anquetil (Fourth Member for Vacoas & Floreal) asked the Minister of Health and Quality of Life whether, in regard to child birth, she will state the number of children born by caesarean section for the period 2 000 to 2010. Mrs Hanoomanjee: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed that there h as been a significant increase in the number of caesarean sec tions in Mauritius over the past ten years. In fact, in the year 2000, 28 percent of the total del iveries were by caesarean sections whereas in 2010 the percentage registered was 44 percent. The total number of caesarean sections performed during period 2000 to 2010 was 67, 387. Caesarean section is a complex issue usually influenced by a combination of medical fact ors such a foetal distress, detachment of placenta, diabetes and so on. Since July 2010, the Mauritius Institute of Health has been requested to conduct a study on the factors associa ted with increased rate of caesarean sections in Mauritius. After finalising the research protocol and obtaining the necessary ethical clearance, the study started early this year and is expected t o be completed by May 2011. It will cover both the public and private health institutions. 75 Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, pending the outcome of the study by MIH, my Ministry has prepared a set of guidelines, which has already bee n distributed to all health professionals of my Ministry on the management of high risk pregnancies . As a follow-up, I am personally chairing a meeting on the issue with all Consultants-in- Charge, obstetrics and gynaecology, in the interest of all prospective mothers. Mrs Labelle: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think I have heard the h on. Minister stating that in July 2010 the Mauritius Institute of Health has been directed to undertake a study. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to refer to a reply that was given in this very House on 23 June 2009? In this reply, the then Minister of Health s tated - \"I have directed the Mauritius Institute of Health to undertake a study on this issue.\" This is my first point. My second point, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that I also heard the hon. Minister mentioning 'national guidelines', and in the same a nswer in June 2009 the then Minister said - \"In February 2009, all consultants have been called upon to prepare national guidelines for dealing with these cases.\" So, my question is whether with regard to these r equests in February 2009, it's only this year that we have received it. My other question i s whether the study was started in 2009 or not, and if we have done another study in 2010. Mrs Hanoomanjee: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me say that whenever w e have got to start a study, we just don't go and say that we are starting the study immediately. We have got to consult all those concerned and put them on board t ogether; we need to have meetings with gynaecologists, consultants and with all those conc erned. We have got to decide whether the study will cover private, public and whatever other areas. All these have to be decided before we give the term of reference to the MIH, and this is why it took its time. To reply to the second part of the question, in fact, as I have said, sinc e July 2010, the MIH has been officially requested to conduct the study. I mean they have g athered all the information, and the terms of reference have been made; the objectives of the stu dy have been devised. Mr Obeegadoo: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if I have heard right, it jumped from 28 % to 44 % within ten years. These figures are absolutel y shocking. Will the hon. Minister, therefore, 76 agree that the time is no longer to having guidelin es but that we should, on the example of other developed countries, have a form of protocol - sinc e there have been consultations with private practitioners - which the Ministry and the Medical Council can monitor, with legal implications in the case it is flouted? Mrs Hanoomanjee: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree the figures are sh ocking. I know that the figures are shocking because the figures s peak for themselves but, as I have said, we are conducting a study. Let us wait for the results of the study. We cannot just rely on protocols; we cannot just rely on instructions that we give. I s aid that, pending the fact that we are waiting for the results of the study, we have given guidelines. Dr. S. Boolell: Will the hon. Minister kindly elaborate on the figu res that she has submitted to the House in terms of percentages of c aesarean sections conducted on admissions in the private sector and in the public sector? Becau se the impression is that caesarean section may be financial in nature. Mrs Hanoomanjee: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have got the reply over here, but it is long. I cannot read all this. I will circulate it for the hon. Member. Mr Obeegadoo: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the figures given concernin g caesarean are obviously directly linked to figures on premature b irth and low weight at birth, which put Mauritius to shame. Will the hon. Minister, in the light of those figures that have been revealed - caesarean and low birth rate recently - look into t he urgency of revamping specialised Neonatal Care Units in all our hospitals, with trained perso nnel? Mrs Hanoomanjee: This is already being done, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir . I have already taken action in this direction. Ms Anquetil: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have got two supplementar y questions, please. How should I proceed? The Deputy Speaker: One by one! Ms. Anquetil: Thank you. Can the hon. Minister inform the House if there is a lack of midwife in our hospitals? 77 Mrs Hanoomanjee: I can't say that there is a lack of midwives. We a lways lack staffs in all our hospitals, but I have got funded positions in the Budget and they are there; the staff is there. Ms Anquetil: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just want to know if the hon. Minister can inform the House what actions and measures she inte nds to undertake to improve the quality of the maternity services, including sanitary conditio ns in hospitals. Mrs Hanoomanjee: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I don't think this has any thing to do with the main question. The Deputy Speaker: We will take the last question from hon. Boolell! Dr. S. Boolell: Does the hon. Minister have any idea, Mr Deputy Sp eaker, Sir, about the cost of a caesarean section in the private sector? Because it might be linked to the figures... The Deputy Speaker: This is a question of opinion. Last question from hon. Obeegadoo! Mr Obeegadoo: Given the alarming figures, will the hon. Minister consider the urgent necessity of launching an information campaign for women who have recourse to public hospital during their pregnancy as to the risks associated w ith caesareans? Mrs Hanoomanjee: If we have an information campaign and tell them w hat the risks of caesarean are, I think we will just scare them beca use it is a complex issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. If they find themselves in a situation where they will have to do the caesarean section, they will be very scared. HOTELS - RECRUITMENT - CERTIFICATE OF MORALITY (No. B/31) Ms S. Anquetil (Fourth Member for Vacoas & Floreal) asked the Minister of Tourism and Leisure whether, in regard to staff in the hotels, he will state if Government proposes to invite the hotels to revise their emplo yment guidelines and policies by requesting the submission of the Certificate of Morality from the applicants, prior to their recruitment. Mr Bodha: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am advised that each hot el has its own guidelines and policies with regard to recruitment and selecti on. These policies may even differ within the same organisation depending on the post to be fille d. 78 Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Members of the House are aware, there have been many issues regarding recruitment and work environm ent in the tourism industry in the wake of recent events. This has induced a brainstorming among the best pra ctices to be adopted for the sustainable development of our tourism industry. In this regard, I have had consultations with the t ourism stakeholders in order to ensure that the service level being provided in our hotels is at the highest standard possible and is reflective of the image that we want to project, es pecially that our current strategy is to position Mauritius as an up-market, safe and hospitable dest ination with service excellence. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this respect, I have bee n informed that hotel operators who are members of AHRIM are revising their policies to provide for an enhanced recruitment and selection process. This new policy will provide for induction courses and trainings to be given to new recruits, submission of references, as well as subm ission of morality certificate. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as Members of the House are aware, the environment in which the hotel industry is operating today has witnessed many changes. Our hotels are not only operating in a more competitive environment, but th ey are witnessing a greater mobility of human resources owing to many reasons, including ne w hotel projects, growth of cruise tourism, overseas job opportunities. In this regard, I am p roposing to have consultations with the hotel stakeholders about ways and means of setting up and administering a databank, which would serve as a job centre for employees of the hotel in dustry. Information on potential vacancies as well as job seekers would be made available to offe r and demand. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this arrangement will not o nly facilitate the centralisation and standardisation of the recruitment process, but wil l also help in the recruitment of the right persons and in identifying the persons who could re present a threat to the security of tourists owing to their antecedents. The human touch has been the most valuable ingredie nt of our tourism product, and we must do all to preserve this asset, Mr Deputy Speak er, Sir. 79 Ms Anquetil : Je remercie le ministre du tourisme et des entre la Tourism Authority , l'AHRIM et la police pour introduire une autre ba se de donn\u00e9es qui \u00e0 Maurice? Mr Bodha : The databank that we are going to set up will pro vide these details, in fact. The issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is that the mora lity certificate has no definite duration. So, what happens is that it is the employer who should, as and when, according to his own discretion, request for another morality certificate. But what we should do, in fact, in the light of what has happened, is that we should have a databank with al l the antecedents as regards the career history of each employee in the industry. Dr S. Boolell : I want to ask the hon. Minister whether this is n ot an invasion of privacy in the basis of human rights, getting all the databank with unlimited information on anybody who seeks employment. There must be a time bar... Mr Bodha : It is not unlimited information on the privacy of people; it is with regard to the antecedent with regard to the career history of the person in the industry. Mr Bhagwan : One of the complaints made by the hotel operators - the main one - is that they are being pressed upon by high quarters from G overnment when people are sent for employment. I think the Minister must see to it th at whenever people are being called - it is a normal practice - for employment, at least certains r\u00e9cidivistes notoires ne sont pas recommand\u00e9s les caisses de l'Etat . (Interruptions) J'ai re\u00e7u pas mal de sollicitations de la part de c op\u00e9rateurs du ministre. C'est sur l'insistance du gouvernement... The Deputy Speaker : No, I will not allow this question. It is making insinuations. Next question! COURT OF APPEAL - SETTING UP (No. B/32) Ms S. Anquetil (Fourth Member for Vacoa s & Floreal) asked the Attorney General whether, in regard to the setting up of a Court of Appeal, as recommended by Lord Mackay, he will state where matters stand. 80 Mr Varma : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with a view to improving the efficiency of our Courts and more generally, our judicial legal syste m, the Mackay Report did indeed recommend the setting up of a separate Court of Appeal Sectio n of the Supreme Court to hear all appeals from subordinate Courts, and of a High Court Sectio n. As the Mackay Report put it, \"a Judge today may be sitting on appeal against the judgment of a Judge who in a week's time will be sitting on appeal from him or her\". In order to implement the above recommendation and various other recommendations of the Mackay Report, my Office has, for some time now , been working on, firstly, the Constitution (Amendment) Bill and, secondly, the Judicial and Le gal Provisions Bill, which provides for amendments to be brought to a series of enactments to give effect to the proposed changes in the Constitution. The Draft Bills were, in fact, circulated for publi c consultation as far back as August, last year, for any comments to be forwarded to my Office by 29 October 2010. The public was informed through the press to forward comments. It is to be noted, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that these Draft Bills were posted on the website of the Attorney General's Office. I also sent the Draft Bills and a covering letter t o the hon. Leader of the Opposition for comments and proposals. I am pleased to report to the House that comments a nd representations have, indeed, been received from various stakeholders, including the J udiciary, the Mauritius Bar Council, the Mauritius Law Society, the Chamber of Notaries, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Law Reform Commission, and tha t the stakeholders were agreeable to most of the provisions of the Draft Bills. A special me eting of the Mauritius Bar Association was called in December 2010 to discuss the proposed cha nges, and all members were agreeable (Members of the Law Society and the Chamber of Nota ries were also invited). I also discussed the Draft Bills with the hon. First Member for Sava nne & Black River, the hon. gentleman Alan Ganoo, last month, and took note of his suggestions . Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my Office will shortly fina lise the above bills, which will then be introduced in the National Assembly as soon as G overnment approval is obtained. 81 Mr Uteem : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I know from the hon. Attorney General whether a study has been conducted as to the actual cost of setting up the Court of Appeal, where it would be housed, and the amount of staffing and training required to make it operational? Mr Varma : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is part of the process , and we have to finalise the Bills first, and then get into the budgetary implic ations. But the hon. gentleman will appreciate that, during the Budget Speech which was presented by the hon. Minister of Finance last year, it was clearly stated that provision will be made for eight additional Judges, and you will see as we finalise the Bills. Then, we will have to liaise w ith the Ministry of Finance to see the cost implications. LOWER DAGOTI\u00c8RE - BRIDGE - CONSTRUCTION (No. B/33) Mr S. Dayal (Third Member for Quartier M ilitaire & Moka) asked the Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Develop ment Unit, Land Transport and Shippin g whether, in regard to the project for the construct ion of a bridge at Lower Dagoti\u00e8re near the cremation ground known as Mamet Feeder Canal, he wi ll state the - (a) date works are expected to start, and (b) cost thereof. Mr Bachoo : Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, a priority list has alread y been prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Finance. Meanwhile, d esigns are being prepared, and clearances are being sought. Once financial clearances are obtain ed, work will start. The cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs25 m. Mr Dayal : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the hon. Minister awar e that it is precisely because of this bridge, which is in a decadent state, that water stagnates and causes water to overflow in the region, even with the slightest rainfall? Ther efore, I would like to appeal to the hon. Minister to give some urgency to this project. Mr Bachoo : It is not the only place where we have problems; throughout the country, we have problems in different regions, and that is the reason why I am looking at all equally. The hon. Member has to bear with me. I have already me ntioned that we have submitted the list to the Ministry of Finance and, once clearance is obta ined, I am going to start the work. 82 Mr Dayal: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just to remind that I have raised this problem here some two years ago. It is causing lots of difficul ties and hardship to the inhabitants. I know the hon. Minister is looking at it globally, but being given that this is creating much hardship to the inhabitants and water accumulates in the whole regi on there, I am making a special plea. Mr Bachoo: I already answered, and the work is definitely goin g to start in the days to come. ALMA - RESERVOIR - CONSTRUCTION (No. B/34) Mr S. Dayal (Third Member for Quartier M ilitaire & Moka) asked the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Publi c Utilities whether, in regard to water, he will state where matters stand in regard to the con struction of a bigger reservoir at Alma with a view to meeting the increasing demand thereof. The Deputy Prime Minister : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the Cent ral Water Authority that a feasibility study carried out in 2 008, with regard to the supply of water in the regi on of Camp Fouquereaux, Alma, Highlands among others, recommended a phased implementation of works to improve water supply in the region. The most urgent works identified were the replaceme nt of the ductile iron pipes, which suffer frequent bursts. Accordingly, the Central W ater Authority is presently implementing a major project for the replacement of 10 kms of duct ile iron pipes from Camp Fouquereaux to Alma service reservoir and the laying of service ma ins at Hermitage and Valetta. This contract has been awarded for the sum of Rs267 m., and works are expected to be completed by January 2012. This project will reduce leakages, bring additional water to the Alma service reservoir, and thus significantly improve water supply in the region. The construction of a new service reservoir of 2000 m 3 capacity to supplement the existing reservoir of 975 m 3 capacity will be implemented in the next phases of the project. Mr Dayal : I thank the hon. Deputy Prime Minister for his an swer and the attention he is giving for the replacement of the pipes. But, bein g given the seriousness of the problem, which creates much hardship regarding the distribution of water in the constituency, especially with the coming of the new pipes and the fact that the reser voir is very small and the population has 83 increased dramatically, I would like to appeal to t he hon. Deputy Prime Minister to give his urgent attention to this problem and to use his goo d offices to speed up matters? The Deputy Prime Minister : The appeal is heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. QUARTIER MILITAIRE STADIUM - BASKET BALL & VOLLEYBA LL PITCHES (No. B/35) Mr S. Dayal (Third Memb er for Quartier Militaire & Moka) asked the Minister of Youth and Sports whether, in regard to the project for the putting up of - (a) a basket ball pitch, and (b) a volleyball pitch in the compound of Quarti er Militaire stadium, he will state where matters stand, indicating the estimated cost thereof. Mr Ritoo : Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to apprise the hon. Membe r that the sports infrastructures we intend to put up at the Quartier Militaire Stadium consist of - (i) a tennis Court; (ii) 3 p\u00e9tanque Courts, and (iii) a handball cum basket ball cum volleyball Court. The relevant drawings have already been prepared, a nd subject to availability of funds action will be initiated for the implementation of this project during the next financial year. The project is estimated at Rs6.2 m. VALETTA - DRAIN WORKS (No. B/36) Mr S. Dayal (Third Memb er for Quartier Militaire & Moka) asked the Minister of Local Government and Outer Islands whet her, in regard to drain works at the Jamal Road and the Madurai Road at Valetta, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Moka/Flacq District Council, information as to when they are expected to start. Mr Aim\u00e9e : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the Moka /Flacq District Council that there is an urgent need for construction of dr ains at Jamal and Madurai Roads at Valetta in view of flooding problems occurring thereat. These drains are estimated to cost around Rs2.2 m. 84 I am informed that a request has been made by the C ouncil to the National Development Unit for inclusion of these drains in the list of e mergency drains to be constructed. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL - INTRODUCTION (No. B/37) Mr D. Nagalingum (Second Member for Stan ley & Rose Hill) asked the Minister of Local Government and Outer Islands whet her, in regard to the introduction of a new Local Government Bill, he will state where matters stand. Mr Aim\u00e9e : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I refer the hon. Member t o the reply I made to PQ No. 1B/627. The proposed legislation is currently being finalis ed at the level of my Ministry and will be introduced in the National Assembly as soon as p ossible. Mr Nagalingum : Can the hon. Minister, at least, give us a time s chedule as to when the Bill is coming? Mr Aim\u00e9e : The Local Government Bill has several stages to g o through. It has first to go to Cabinet, as the hon. Member should know. I c annot reveal the exact date before going to Cabinet. It is not fair towards my colleagues Mini sters. Mr Nagalingum : Can the hon. Minister inform the House whether co nsultations have started with stakeholders? Mr Aim\u00e9e : It is not time now to have consultations on the B ill; I mean to circulate the Bill. Once I receive the agreement of Cabinet, I w ill then have the Bill circulated to members of the public, the NGOs and the whole of Mauritius. Mr Bhagwan : Can the Minister inform the House whether he has made an estimate on the financial cost of the implementation of these n ew amendments and the setting up of new municipalities? Has he made this exercise? Have r equests been made to the Minister of Finance and, if yes, when and the amount thereof? Mr Aim\u00e9e : Before I reveal the estimate here, I think it's g ood to know that the financial and legal implications have been sent to these two Ministries, that is, the Attorney General and the Ministry of Finance. 85 I have already got clearance from the Attorney Gene ral. I am waiting clearance from the Ministry of Finance, but we know exactly the amount we need for the new legislation. Mr Bhagwan : Can the country, the taxpayers of Mauritius know what will be the cost? In the name of transparency, what is the estimate? Mr Aim\u00e9e : As I mentioned before, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it would not be fair vis-\u00e0-vis my colleagues Ministers to reveal any information b efore I get the approval of Cabinet. Mr Obeegadoo : Are we to understand that a first draft of the pr oposed Bill has been discussed at Cabinet level and the policy... (Interruptions) The Deputy Speaker : No, no! Mr Aim\u00e9e : I have already answered this question. Mr Obeegadoo : Has there been an assessment of the additional st aff that will be required, and building requirements for new municip al councils? The Deputy Speaker : Please, I don't think that, at this stage, it wou ld be proper, in the light of the reply given by the Minister, to ask an y more questions, as this has to go to Cabinet first. Mr Baloomoody : Can I ask the hon. Minister to follow the example of the Attorney General, that is, before going to Cabinet, to circu late that document or, at least, to put it on the website of the Ministry of Local Government, so tha t we can... (Interruptions) The Deputy Speaker : We proceed to the next question! PLAZA THEATRE - RENOVATION (No. B/38) Mr D. Nagalingum (Second Member for Stan ley & Rose Hill) asked the Minister of Local Government and Outer Islands whet her, in regard to the Plaza Theatre at Rose Hill, he will - (a) now table a copy of the - (i) scope of works; 86 (ii) works carried out as at to date; (iii) total estimated cost thereof, and (b) for the benefit of the House, obtain from the M unicipal Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill, information as to if funds have b een secured for the implementation of Phases II and III and, if so, whe re matters stand and, if not, why not. Mr Aim\u00e9e : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to refer the hon. Member to the reply I made to Parliamentary Question No. 1B/728 on this issue. With regard to part (a) of the question, I am tabling a copy of the scope of works. The works relating to Phase I have been carried out as per the scope of works at a total cost of Rs87 m. With regard to part (b) of the question, I am infor med that a request for the provision of the required funds to the tune of Rs457 m. in respe ct of Phases II and III is under consideration at the level of the Ministry of Finance and Economic D evelopment. Mr Nagalingum : According to the Minister, Government has spent n early Rs90 m. on the first phase and, according to what the Mayor of the Municipality of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill stated recently, the roof is leaking. Can the Mini ster confirm that information? Mr Aim\u00e9e : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of what th e Mayor of the Municipality of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill said, but I w ill inquire to see whether what he said is right, and then I'll take remedial action. Mr Bhagwan : Everyone residing in Rose Hill knows what is happ ening to that building, which is a national heritage. Ce b\u00e2timent est laiss\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9labrement. Il y a des rats qui circulent au vu et su de tout le monde. Est-ce que le ministre ne consid\u00e8re l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'\u00eele Maurice que , at least, something be done urgently? May I ask the hon. Minister whether that building is insured? The building is left without any maintenance, without any protection. This is a shame! Mr Aim\u00e9e: M. le pr\u00e9sident, que le Plaza ne tombe pas en d\u00e9cr\u00e9pitude en un an 87 ou dix ans. Cela a d\u00fb \u00eatre en \u00e9tat n'est place que depuis cinq ou six ans. Mr B\u00e9renger: If I heard the hon. Minister correctly, for Phase I, we spent Rs87 m. Did I hear him correctly that for Phases II and III, we w ill need Rs477 m.? If that is the case, to whom has a request been made? Is it to the Minister of Finance for a loan, for a grant; for what? Will the hon. Minister agree with me that the more we wi ll let time go by between Phase I and Phases II and III, the more we will end up in serious trou ble? Mr Aim\u00e9e: Yes, the hon. Leader of the Opposition is right th at it is time now to look after the Plaza as a heritage building. In fact, i t is Rs457 m. The request has been made to the Minister of Finance, and we are awaiting funds to g o ahead. CEB - INDOOR SWITCHGEAR - ACQUISITION (No. B/39) Mr G. Lesjongard (Second Member for Port Louis North & Montagne Longue) asked the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Public Utilities whether, in regard to the acquisition of Indoor Switchgear pane ls for the Fort Victoria Power Station by the Central Electricity Board, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Board, information as to where matters stand. The Deputy Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the CEB t hat - (i) it intends to install 22 kV indoor switchgear panel s at Fort Victoria to provide additional sources of supply for new developments i n the Plaine Lauzun industrial zone, Les Salines and Cassis among others. (ii) On 11 February 2010, an open tender was launched an d, at the closing date, on 24 March 2010, five bids were received. The bids had to be cancelled on account of technical shortcomings in the bid document. (iii) On September 2010, another open tender was launched and, by the closing date of 13 October 2010, six bids were received. Three of the bidders satisfied the technical specifications, except for the clearance between the building wall and the back of the panel. (iv) On 09 November, clarifications were sought from the three of them. At the date limit of 12 November 2010, only ten bidders respond ed, but they did not satisfy 88 the specifications regarding the distance between t he building wall and the back of the panel. The third bidder replied after the d ate limit. (v) Subsequently, the bidding exercise was cancelled, a nd the CEB is now in the process of launching a new open tender with revised technical specifications. I am advised by the CEB that the delay in the procu rement of the switchgear panels will not have any impact on the reliability of energy su pply. Mr Lesjongard: We have understood from the Deputy Prime Minister that this is the third time that the Central Electricity Board is la unching the same tender. Can I know from the Deputy Prime Minister whether it is the same tender committee which has been suspended that was looking into that tender also? The Deputy Prime Minister: I could not say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Mr Lesjongard: I have not heard the answer, Mr Deputy Speaker, Si r. The Deputy Speaker: The Deputy Prime Minister said that he does not kn ow. (Interruptions) Mr Lesjongard: My question is whether it is the same tender commi ttee, which has been suspended concerning the tender for CFL lamps, whic h was looking after that tender for switchgears. The Deputy Speaker: The Deputy Prime Minister has just stated that he cannot say. Next question, hon. Uteem! STC - PETROLEUM PRODUCTS - CONTIGENCY PLAN (No. B/40) Mr R. Uteem (Second Member for Port Loui s South & Port Louis Central) asked the Minister of Industry and Commerce whethe r, in regard to petroleum products, he will, for the benefit of the House, ob tain from the State Trading Corporation, information as to - (a) the existing storage capacity thereof; (b) the measures taken to ensure that there is no short age thereof, and (c) whether there is any contingency plan. 89 Mr Soodhun: Mr Speaker Sir, I am informed by the State Trading Corporation that, in regard to petroleum products, the existing storage capacity is as follows - Mogas 10,100 MT Gas Oil 40,690 MT Fuel Oil 30,800 MT DPK 25,580 MT In regard to part (b) of the question, the STC has, firstly, as an immediate measure, ordered an additional shipment in between the norma l turnaround time. It will repeat such orders as and when the need arises. Secondly, the STC has made arrangement with oil com panies for the availability, within a period of one to four months, of additional stora ge capacity of 8,800 MT for Mogas and 4,850 MT for gas oil. Thirdly, negotiation is in course with another priv ate company for an additional storage capacity of 6,500 MT for fuel oil. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in addition to the above ar rangements, I am pleased to inform the House that, as announced in the Government Prog ramme 2010-2015, Government is going ahead with the construction of additional storage c apacity of 15,000 MT for Mogas and 10,000 MT for gas oil at Mer Rouge. In regard to part (c) of the question, the STC has already established contacts with potential suppliers in the region, to ensure securi ty of supply at short notice. The advantage of procurement in the region is that the carrying vess els will not have to go through \"piracy route\", and we also benefit from a shorter lead time compar ed to Mangalore Refinery Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL). Mr Uteem: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I heard the hon. Minister m ention that arrangement is being made with existing distributors for additi onal storage facilities. May I know from the hon. Minister what are the terms of this arrangemen t, and whether any additional compensation is being paid by the Government to ensure greater p eriod of storage by the private sector? 90 Mr Soodhun: It is for a short period until the STC has its own storage tank in 18 months. With regard to payment, there is a committee which is working at the STC to know how much they can afford for the storage. We have four supp liers in Mauritius. Mr Uteem: With respect to the supplier Mangalore Refinery Pet rochemicals Limited, we have seen at the beginning of the year that, appare ntly, it was not able to effect payment to its supplier of crude oil in Iran. Bearing this into c onsideration, would the hon. Minister agree that Government should look to alternative sources of su pply or look for a supplier who has alternative sources of supply for crude oil, that i s, not just Iran, but other countries which are not subject to any embargo? Mr Soodhun: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we are all aware, we ha ve a contract of three years with Mangalore Oil Refinery. According to ou r contract, MRPL will provide us whenever Mauritius requires petroleum. Since we signed the contract, up till now we did not have any problem. I agree with the hon. Member that we may have this event but, in spite of this issue, the Mangalore Oil Refinery gave us a guarantee offi cially. We wrote a letter to ask for a guarantee, and a guarantee was issued officially fr om the Mangalore Oil Refinery of India. Mr Uteem: The hon. Minister himself - I heard him on the radi o - stated that on a fr\u00f4l\u00e9 la catastrophe in the beginning of January. This is a serious ma tter, and we all know that Mangalore can always plead force majeure if it is not able to get its own supply through war or through embargo and, as a result, it is not able to supply us refined oil. In these circumstances, what is the contingency plan of the Government? Mr Soodhun: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has mention ed the contingency plan. I have replied that in case we face any prob lem, we always have solutions. We have been able to contact other suppliers in case we find our selves in a difficult situation, especially in cases of piracy. It may happen that our vessels ar e caught by piracy. We have already taken this issue into consideration, and we have been in conta ct with other suppliers in the region. Mr Uteem: Would the hon. Minister care to table a copy of the se agreements with the other potential suppliers who have agreed to help u s in case of need? Mr Soodhun: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a question of relatio ns that we have. We have good relations with Shell, which belongs to Vi tol. We have already negotiated with Vitol 91 and other companies like Total, Engine Internationa l and Seychelles Petroleum Company Ltd. We have good contact with these suppliers; we have already negotiated, and the hon. Member can rest assured that, in any case, we are safe and we have taken into consideration all the scarcity that may arise at any time. Mr B\u00e9renger: If I heard the hon. Minister correctly, the STC is going to build storage capacity of its own. That costs a lot of money. C an I know how this is going to be financed, and specifically whether we are going to have another n ew tax on the price of diesel and essence to finance same? Mr Soodhun: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have already agreed with the Minister of Finance who is going to provide us with necessary f unds. The fact that today Mauritius has been well fostered for bunkering, the money that we are going to obtain from bunkering, according to STC, will be enough to finance the said storage tan k. Mr Li Kwong Wing: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Minister mentioned the additional order of a cargo of petroleum products a s a contingency. Can he tell us the tonnage of the cargo that has been ordered? Mr Soodhun: We have an additional order in case there is any pr oblem. As I mentioned - and I mention again - we are in contact with othe r suppliers. Mr B\u00e9renger: The question is the tonnage of that exceptional ord er. Can I know whether it is from Mangalore? Mr Soodhun: First, we have to contact Mangalore. In case Manga lore refuses - because according to our contract, we have to contact Manga lore - then, we are going to see the other suppliers. Mr B\u00e9renger: Has Mangalore been contacted? Mr Soodhun: Mangalore is respecting its contract. It has alrea dy issued a guarantee of security. If, in a special case, it happens that our vessels have been captured through piracy, if we are in difficulty, then we are going to be in to uch with all the other suppliers. Mr B\u00e9renger: What the hon. Minister said is that arrangements h ave already been made - if we go to Hansard - for a special contingent to come in. The question is: is that so, or are we thinking of the next pirate? Has Mangalore been co ntacted? 92 Mr Soodhun: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I mention again that we hav e our contract. This is the first thing. Secondly, as I have mentioned, if we have any problem, it will be very short term. It is only one shipment of 30,000 metric ton nes, and we can get it from Seychelles or from the neighbouring country, as I mentioned earlier. Mr Li Kwong Wing: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how long does it take for t he tanker to deliver that exceptional order? If there is a rupture of supply in Mauritius - because there is no stock of petroleum products in Mauritius - and ther e is an exceptional event of piracy, how long will the cargo take to arrive in Mauritius? What c ontingency plan has been made? Mr Soodhun: It is three days, my good friend. In three days, w e can have it. There is no problem; it will take three days from Seychelles to come to Mauritius. INFINITY BPO LTD & RIVER HEIGHTS LTD - ACQUISITION (No. B/41) Mr R. Uteem (Second Member for Port Loui s South & Port Louis Central) asked the vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Economic Development whether, in regard to the acquisition of Infinity T ower, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the National Real Estate Ltd, informati on as to whether Infinity BPO Ltd and River Heights Ltd have complied with all of the provision s of the Term Sheet in relation to the said acquisition and, if not, the measures, if any, take n to ensure compliance therewith. The vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Ec onomic Development (Mr P. Jugnauth): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am informed that the ter m sheet, specifically with regard to the acquisition of the Infinity Tower and the ap plication of the proceeds towards the repayment of debts of both River Height and the Inf inity BPO, were signed by SIC, the Infinity BPO, River Height and Barclays Bank on 01 April 201 0. The Chief Government Valuer was appointed to evalua te the Infinity Tower (land & building). The land and building were valued at Rs 340 m., exclusive of taxes and notary fees, in a valuation report dated 05 March 2010. I am also informed that the sales deed, drawn on 31 May 2010, for a total value amounting to Rs374.9 m. (inclusive of taxes and not ary fees) were strictly utilised according to the term sheet as detailed below - 93 Rs (m) Payment to Barclays Bank in settlement of secured d ebts 251.0 Refund of debenture amount to SIC Ltd 45.0 Settlement of interest accrued on the debentures as at 31 May 2010 1.0 Settlement of registration dues, land transfer tax and notary fees 35.0 Advance rental 5.5 Completion of building 16.4 Repayment of unsecured debt and IFA fees 21.0 Total 374.9 I am informed that all the financial obligations a s per the term sheet have been met as detailed above, and the payment was effected by the Notary on 31 May 2010. The non-financial obligations as per the term shee t were - (i) the appointment of a Post Term Sheet IFA who wi ll regularly report to the then MTSP about the performance of the company, and (ii) the submission of quarterly reports to the the n MTSP by the statutory auditor of the company. In respect to the first non-financial obligation, a Post Term sheet IFA was appointed, and he submitted monthly reports until September 2010, and consequently resigned in November 2010 because of non-payment of his fees by the comp any. The ERCP Committee, which took 94 over from the MTSP, stressed upon the company the u rgency to appoint another post IFA, but by then the company had ceased its operations in Febru ary 2011. Regarding the second non-financial obligation, I am informed that the statutory auditor has submitted a quarterly report ended 31 March 201 0 to the then MTSP, which was received in June 2010, and there was no report thereafter. I am also informed that Infinity BPO and River Heig hts do not owe any money to the Government. Mr Uteem : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I heard the hon. Minister mentioning the figure of Rs5.5 m. as advance payment for rent. According to the term sheet, the advance payment for rent was supposed to be Rs7.6 m. May I know from t he hon. Minister why is there the difference in the two figures? Mr Jugnauth : On the sale and lease back agreement, that was th e only amount that could be paid by the company. Mr Uteem : When the hon. Minister answered a PQ on the repor t submitted by the IFA with regard to the acquisition of Infinity Tower, t he only option remaining for the company to continue as a going concern and to prevent any layo ff of its staff was the acquisition of Infinity Tower. So, the only option to prevent laying off o f staff was to acquire Infinity Tower. May I know from the hon. Minister what measures has the G overnment taken after acquisition of the Tower to ensure that there was no laying off of sta ff? Mr Jugnauth : I have given information to the House. This was decided by the committee of MTSP and, thereafter, the MTSP, which turned into the ERCP committee, followed up on this issue. I cannot say with regar d to the issue of the employees. I suppose a specific question must be asked with regard to the employees of the company, so that I can get the relevant information to answer, or else it can be put to my colleague, the Minister of Labour. Mr Uteem : According to the deed of acquisition, the Nationa l Real Estate Ltd, a company owned by the Government, which acquired Inf inity Tower, paid Rs17 m. as land transfer tax. We all know that registration duty i s paid by the buyer, but land transfer tax is paid by the seller. May I know from the hon. Minister w hy such generosity from the National Real Estate Ltd? 95 Mr Jugnauth : I can find the information and give it to the Hou se. I do not have information about the land transfer tax, but I can get it because it is on record. If there is a sale , it will be registered, and I can provide this infor mation to the House. Mr Li Kwong Wing : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I heard from the Minister of Finance that the last report received from the company dates Jun e 2010 when he had already assumed office, and that was for the period ended March 2010. Can the Minister inform us what action he or his Ministry has taken under the ERCP to ensure that th e money which has been disbursed was fulfilling the purpose for which it had been disbur sed, namely to save jobs and to continue as a running concern? Mr Jugnauth : As I have replied, the MTSP, and ultimately the E RCP, was following on that issue. There was nothing much that I could do , because that was the agreement which was entered into and, therefore, the committee just had to monitor about whether all the conditions that had been laid down in the term sheet had been respected. But, as we know, the company ultimately ceased operation since February 2011. Mr Li Kwong Wing : The Minister is very well aware that he has come up with a different package, which is called Economic Restruc turation Package, and he very well knows that the IFA that has been appointed under the MTSP has resigned. So, what action has he taken under the ERCP to monitor the purpose for which mon ey has been disbursed? Because Rs374 m. have been disbursed, and there has been no repor t that has been submitted and monitoring review that has been made on the company. Ultimate ly, no IFA has been appointed, and the company has ceased operations, workers have not bee n paid, and jobs have been lost. Is it not a demonstration that the ERCP is a total failure, and that the ERCP committee has totally failed in its work? Mr Jugnauth : It is not a failure, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I h ave just answered that the committee had impressed upon Infinity BPO to appoin t another IFA instead. But we know the fate of the company; it has ceased operation afterw ards. The Deputy Speaker : Last question, hon. Uteem! Mr Uteem : According to the term sheet, there is a clause to the effect that, upon completion of the Tower, another valuation would be made and any differential between the 96 valuation and the amount paid, that is, the Rs340m. , would be disbursed to the owner of the building. May I know from the hon. Minister, in th e light of what he has stated about the state of the sellers, whether there would be any follow-up o n that clause to the effect that Government has to pay more to Infinity Tower after the constru ction of the building? Mr Jugnauth : Of course, I will look into the point that has be en raised and ultimately give the information to the House. MAURITIUS/RODRIGUES - FREIGHT CHARGES (No. B/42) Mr J. F. Fran\u00e7ois (Third Member for Rodr igues) asked the Minister of Industry and Commerce whether, in regard to freight and other charges on the Mauritius/Rodrigues/Mauritius route, he will state - (a) if he is in presence of any recent report in co nnection therewith and, if so, table a copy thereof; (b) their implications on the cost of living in Rod rigues, and (c) if Government intends to subsidise basic commod ities for Rodrigues to put the price at par with that in mainland Mauritius and, i f so, when, and, if not, why not. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo) : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I s hall reply to this question addressed to my colleague the hon. Mi nister of Industry and Commerce. With regard to part (a) of the question, I wish to inform the House that in June 2009, after consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Econo mic Development, a consulting firm KPMG was appointed after the tender process to undertake a comprehensive review of the financial and organisational structure of Mauritius Shipping Corp oration Ltd. The report concluded that the Mauritius Shipping Corporation Ltd was in a difficu lt financial situation and proposed a series of restructuring measures, including the revision of t ariff for both freight and passenger on Rodrigues route, which Government approved in Febru ary 2011. The Ministry of Fisheries and Rodrigues was consult ed in connection with the tariff increase on the Rodrigues route. The House may wis h to note that, notwithstanding the fact that the last tariff revision was conducted in November 2008, freight and passenger travel on 97 Rodrigues route was still highly subsidised. The q uestion of tariff is only one issue dealt with within the review, and there are other major issues which are being looked into. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will reply to part (b) an d (c) together. I am informed that the Central Statistics Office estimated the cost of liv ing increase in Rodrigues, as a result of tariff reviews, would be around 0.5% annually. In order t o mitigate any possible hardship to vulnerable persons in Rodrigues, Government has agr eed to allocate an additional amount of Rs10 on a monthly basis to beneficiaries of existin g income support. I am informed that the question of subsidising other basic commodities, na mely rice and flour, was raised by the Chief Commissioner of the Rodrigues Regional Assembly wit h the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development on 21 February 2011 during his visit to Mauritius, and that the Ministry of Fisheries and Rodrigues would be looking into the m atter. JEUX DES ILES DE L'OCEAN INDIEN 2011 - RODRIGUAN ATHLETES - FACILITIES (No. B/43) Mr J. F. Fran\u00e7ois (Third Member for Rodr igues) asked the Minister of Youth and Sports whether, in regard to pre-selected Rodriguan athletes for the Jeux des Iles de l'Ocean Indien 2011, he will - (a) give a list thereof and their respective discip lines, and (b) state the arrangements being made and facilitie s put at their disposal, indicating if these are available in Rodrigues. Mr Ritoo : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at date, we have 34 Ro driguan athletes who have been pre-selected for the Indian Ocean Island Games 2011. I am tabling a list of those athletes and the disciplines in which they will be participa ting. As regards part (b) of the question, the following facilities and assistance are being extended to the pre-selected athletes - (i) technical equipment has already been provided to th e athletic group; (ii) a joint training camp Mauritius-Rodrigues in athlet ics was organised in Rodrigues in December 2010; (iii) a seminar in anti-doping was held in Port Mathurin in December last for coaches and pre-selected athletes; 98 (iv) a physical fitness evaluation test was organised on the pre-selected athletes from 01 to 04 March 2011; (v) my Ministry has also planned to organise medical te sts in due course and to provide vitamins to the pre-selected athletes; (vi) my Ministry has also provided Rodriguan athletes wi th the services of a massage therapist in the person of Mrs Perrine; (vii) boxers from Mauritius and R\u00e9union Islands were rece ntly in for a tournament and a coaching course; (viii) Rodriguan athletes will also be invited for trainin g camps to be organised by federations in Mauritius, and (ix) an allowance is being allocated to coaches in Rodri gues who are involved in the preparation for the games. Moreover, during my last visit in Rodrigues, I pers onally met all the pre-selected athletes to encourage them, and I handed over equipment wort h Rs350,000 to the Commissioner for Youth and Sports in Rodrigues, and I am also planni ng another visit soon to see the progress achieved. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I admit that the m ain constraint for Rodriguan athletes remains the very bad state of the synthetic track a t the Camp du Roi stadium. I can understand the difficulties encountered by those athletes who have to use the track. My Ministry is working in close collaboration with the Commissioner for Yo uth and Sports in Rodrigues to remedy the situation. The Deputy Speaker : The Table has been advised that PQ B/50 has been withdrawn. We move to PQ B/44. Hon. Li Kwong Wing! INFLATION RATE (No. B/44) Mr K. Li Kwong Wing (Second Member for B eau Bassin & Petite Rivi\u00e8re) asked the vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Economic Development whether, in regard to inflation, he will state the - (a) rate of inflation for the period November 2010 to February 2011; (b) percentage of price increase of the main commod ities comprised in the Consumer Price Index during that period; 99 (c) forecast inflation rate for calendar year 2011, and (d) the measures taken to control the increase in c onsumer price, and mitigate the effects thereof on the economy and on lower income groups. The vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Ec onomic Development (Mr P. Jugnauth) : Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, according to the Central Statistics Office, the headline inflation for the year ending February 2011 (i.e. M arch 2010 to February 2011) reached 3.6%, while the 4-month average CPI for the period Novemb er 2010 to February 2011 rose by 5.8%. Lately, a general rise in inflation rate has in fac t been observed across many countries. Based on current trends in inflation and outlook fo r the coming months, most countries are expecting to register an inflation rate higher than that recorded in 2010. The increase is explained by several factors. We have noted a shar p rise in food prices in the world market due to weather related supplies shocks and subsequent i mposition of export restrictions by some major suppliers. In addition, energy product price s are again hitting record levels. This is driven both by global recovery and speculations regarding possible negative effect that the existing political instability in the Arab world may have on energy supplies. These factors are likely to continue exerting pressures on prices throughout 20 11. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mauritius is not immune to such developments, especially when its main suppliers are also facing rising inflation in their own markets. I am tabling the information requested by the hon. Member in part (b) of his question. This information has been spelt out in three tables as follows - (a) table 1 shows the evolution of the sub-indices during the period October 2010 to February 2011 for the 12 divisions of consumptions expenditure, as used in the CPI; (b) table 2 shows the weighted contribution of the main divisions of the CPI basket to the change in CPI, and (c) table 3 shows the main changes by commodity as from November 2010 to February 2011. As regards forecast of inflation for the year 2011, I would like to inform the House that the CPI will continue to be influenced by external factors such as rising commodity prices, 100 mainly food and energy, both of which weigh heavily in the CPI basket, currency fluctuations and higher inflation rate in many supplier countrie s. Moreover, recent market information points to still higher food and energy prices in the near term. The Food and Agriculture Organisation has warned that food prices worldwide may harden du ring 2011, while the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast firmer oi l prices in 2011 and 2012. Given the high import price pass-through to domesti c prices, these international price developments would certainly impact on domestic inf lation. On the positive side, the Mauritian rupee exchange rate has fairly well-behaved in effe ctive terms, due to a large extent to the favourable interest rate differential and sustained capital inflows. These factors indicate that there are high uncertai nties regarding price development in the international market and its spill over effect on d omestic prices. At this stage, the CSO has not issued any projection of the rate of inflation for 2011. In regard to part (d), I would like to reassure the House that we are committed to take the necessary policy measures in the interest of the co untry and the population. As I indicated in my interventions in this House, this Government will e nsure that the interest of the country is protected and that the benefits of growth are fairl y distributed. We have taken major policy measures under the Economic Restructuring and Compe titiveness Programme and in the 2011 Programme-Based Budget. The measures taken are in f act paying dividends. Increased dynamism has been noted in several sectors which we re hit by the crisis, including the export oriented sectors such as manufacturing and tourism. Public finances are under control, and measures are being taken to improve our debt ratios . We ended 2010 with net international reserves of Rs108 billion. Our market diversificat ion initiatives are well underway, and these will help to address external vulnerabilities. Mr Speaker, Sir, these are comforting signs, especi ally during a time when we are still not out of the crisis and new emerging challenges s uch as the food and energy crisis are looming over us. As the House is aware, the three main thr usts of the 2011 Budget were: rebalancing growth, making a great leap forward on productivity , and consolidating social justice. We are committed to work in this direction. Any new polic y measure will have to take into account these objectives and the wider implications for the economy. 101 Government is closely following price developments at international and domestic level and has been consulting the relevant stakeholders o n the appropriate course of action that needs to be taken in the short term and in the longer ter m. As the House is aware, we have already taken mitigating measures. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has had meetings with different importers and traders to see how the pric es of goods, which are regularly consumed by people, are reduced or at least not increased in th e short term. These importers and traders reacted positively by reducing their margins, and c onsequently the retail prices of some 89 items have been reduced with effect from 16 March 2011. T he reduction ranges from 2% to 28%. Consultations were held yesterday with local produc ers, and the prices of some 25 more products will decrease. These initiatives will obviously hel p to alleviate the burden of consumers, more particularly those of the lower income groups. Furthermore, the income support for our vulnerable citizens has been doubled, as I announced on 18 March 2011. Income support has bee n increased to Rs246 per head, and for an average family of four persons the total income sup port will amount to Rs984. This is an unprecedented measure which speaks volumes of this Government's determination to provide support to our most vulnerable citizens and promote the cause of social justice. Unprecedented also is the level of subsidies on ric e, flour and cooking gas. These subsidies would reach an estimated Rs1.45 billion t his year. Had these subsidies not been given, the price of one pound of rice would have been Rs8. 35 instead of Rs5.40; the price of one pound of flour would have been Rs8.35 instead of Rs5.85, and the cooking gas cylinder of 12 kilos would have cost consumers Rs498 instead of Rs300. In addition to measures already initiated as regard s prices, an Advisory Committee has been set up under the Ministry of Industry and Comm erce to come up with recommendations about pricing policies and strategies that could be adopted by Government to effectively deal with price increases of goods of regular consumptio n. The hon. Member might wish to note that the Committ ee consists of members from the private sector, the consumers' associations and the public sector. It is expected that it would make its recommendations by the end of April 2011. At the level of the Ministry of Business, Enterpris e, Cooperatives and Consumer Protection, an 'Observatoire des Prix' has been set up, and consumers are being provided with 102 information on prices at different selling outlets on a comparative basis, so as to help them to make the best buying choices cost-wise. The fourth edition of the ' Savoir Choisir' magazine published by this Ministry has just been released. Furthermore, a Ministerial Committee under the Chai rmanship of my colleague, the Minister for Social Integration and Economic Empowe rment, has been set up to follow up on the issue of prices, particularly the pricing of essent ial commodities. Mr Li Kwong Wing: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can the Minister of Finance explain to the House how come his Ministry is unable to forecast t he rate of inflation - forecast; not estimate - for the year 2011, when the Mauritius Chamber of Co mmerce and Industry, the Bank of Mauritius, and the Economic Intelligence Unit have already made forecasts of anything between six to seven per cent? How come the Ministry of F inance is unable to give any forecast rate? Mr Jugnauth: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I take note of the forecast s that have been made by institutions of the private sector. But, as a G overnment, and the Ministry of Finance - any government for that matter - we have always relied on the figure that has been produced by the Central Statistics Office, and that is the institut ion on which I am going to rely. Until and unless they produce a report estimating the rate of inflat ion for this year, I cannot obviously prejudge, and I cannot come to this House and just put in any figure. Mr Li Kwong Wing: Can the Minister, therefore, inform the House what is the core rate of inflation? The core rate of inflation is the ra te of inflation excluding the effect of rise in foo d prices and energy prices. The Minister of Finance has explained that it is the rise of imported food prices and energy prices that has caused so mu ch increase in inflation. So, what is the core rate of inflation during the period November 2010 t o February 2011? Is the core rate of inflation higher than the estimated rate of inflation that he has given as being 5.8%? Mr Jugnauth: This is a technical question, Mr Deputy Speaker, Si r. I will get my technical people and the CSO to work on it, and pro vide the information to the House next time. Mr Li Kwong Wing: The Minister of Finance also explained that there has been a revision of certain consumer prices made by the Min istry of Commerce instead of the Ministry of Prices. Does the Minister of Finance agree with the enquiry made by the association for the 103 protection of the environment and consumers, which said that, in the list of new prices, the items that are on sale are now much more expensive... The Deputy Speaker: This does not relate to the main question. Mr Li Kwong Wing: ...meaning, therefore, that this measure is a gimmick ? The Deputy Speaker: No. I won't allow this question. (Interruptions) This has nothing to do with the main question. The main question is with regard to the rate of inflation. (Interruptions) Mr B\u00e9renger: The main question relates to measures taken, and it is the Minister who referred to a specific measure, as if it was a big success. So, the question is whether he is aware that the consumers' association has said that it is a gimmick. I think it is perfectly in order. (Interruptions) The Deputy Speaker: Any other supplementary, please. Mr Li Kwong Wing: I was just trying to quote that the association sai d \"on se demande comment le Premier ministre sein de son gouvernement\" , in relation to all these 65 articles with the suppo sedly lower prices. (Interruptions) The next question is with regard to the increase in the income support from Rs123 to Rs234. Does not the Minister think that this is di scriminatory to the other low income groups like the handicapped, old pensioners and other vuln erable groups? Mr Jugnauth: I am a bit puzzled, because they are the... (Interruptions) Mo pas p\u00e9 guet twa ; mo p\u00e9 guet Johnny . The Deputy Speaker: Hon. Minister, address the Chair, please! Mr Jugnauth: I am not looking at you! I am looking at Johnny! 104 The Deputy Speaker: Hon. Minister, please address the Chair. Mr Jugnauth: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there are three categories of people who benefit from this income support. One is those whose consu mption of electricity is less than 75 kW per month; the second is for those who benefit from soc ial aid, and the third category is those who get a pension, but who would have qualified had tha t pension not gone beyond a certain limit. This measure is going to concern 90,000 beneficiari es, and the people whom the hon. Member has mentioned will, of course, form part, provided they are in the three categories. INDIAN OCEAN GAMES - SPORTS FEDERATIONS - FUNDS (No. B/45) Mr F. Quirin (Third Member for Beau Bass in & Petite Rivi\u00e8re) asked the Minister of Youth and Sports whether, in regard to the Trust to be set up for the raising of funds for Sports Federations for the forthcoming Indian O cean Games, he will state where matters stand. Mr Ritoo: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the objective of Club Mauri ce Trust Fund was to raise funds for the financing of major internationa l competitions. However, we have been advised to rather set up a Club Maurice Company, wi th the same objectives, instead of a Trust. Thus, the Club Maurice Company has been incorporate d as Club Maurice, and is now operational. Several companies have favourably responded, and ha ve expressed their interest and wish to support financially the activities of Club Mauri ce, and it is in the process of finalising these partnerships. As you are aware, a sponsorship agreement for an am ount of Rs3 m. has been signed with the Mauritius Commercial Bank on 31 January 2011. This money will be used for the purchase of general equipment in favour of the Mauritian del egation proceeding to Seychelles to participate in the forthcoming IOIG to be held from 05 to 14 August 2011. Mr Quirin: M. le pr\u00e9sident, dans le budget 2011, le ministre d es finances avait annonc\u00e9 que le minist\u00e8re des Sports allait mettre sur conna\u00eetre ? 105 Mr Ritoo: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in fact, the objective was the same, that is, to raise funds. Au fait la forme est diff\u00e9rente mais le fond est le m\u00eame . We have now come up with a Club Maurice Company, and we are trying to raise fu nds. So far, not even one federation has been penalised as regards funding prior to the prep aration of the IOIG. Mr Ritoo: This is a landmark. It has lengthily been discusse d with lawyers, and we have now come up with this company. As I said, it is th e first time that we are having such a company. It has been registered; we have got the c ertificate of incorporation, and we have gone through all the implications. Mr Quirin: M. le pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais avoir plus de au fonctionnement de cette compagnie. Mr Ritoo: It is set up under the Companies Act 2001. It is, in fact, an innovative element in the landscape of company registration. I can later submit all the related documents with regard to its functions. The Deputy Speaker: Time is over! MOTION SUSPENSION OF S.O. 10(2) The Deputy Prime Minister: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that all the business on today's Order Paper be exempted from th e provisions of paragraph (2) of Standing Order 10. The vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Social Integra tion and Economic Empowerment (Mr X. L. Duval) rose and seconded. Question put and agreed to. PUBLIC BILLS First Reading On motion made and seconded, the following Bills we re read a first time - 106 (a) The Energy Efficiency Bill (No. XVI of 2010) (b) The International Criminal Court Bill (No. XXIII of 2010) (c) The Divorce and Judicial Separation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (No. XXIV of 2010) At 4.30 p.m the sitting was suspended. On resuming at 5.07 p.m. with Mr Speaker in the Cha ir. MOTION POPULATION CENSUS \"This Assembly resolves that a census of the popula tion of Mauritius be taken between 19 June 2011 and 1 August 2011, in respect of all pers ons alive at midnight on 03 July 2011.\" The vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Ec onomic Development (Mr P. Jugnauth): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am presenting the motion in virt ue of section (9) of the Statistics Act of 2000. This stipulates that before a populat ion census is undertaken the President shall, subject to the approval by resolution of the Nation al Assembly, make an order to that effect and that order may specify the date or the dates on or between which the census is to be carried out. The population census is normally carried out every ten years. This is a crucial exercise in data collection and dissemination. Our economy has undergone major changes during the past decade in terms of demography, education attainment , health and employment, which are the core topics that are being covered by the census. This census is thus an important exercise which will help to identify and analyse the changes that have taken place over time and thus provide better insight of the socioeconomic characteristics of the population. We are proposing to undertake a 2011 census between 19 June and 01 Augu st. The census was initially planned for 2010, but subsequently had to be postponed on accou nt of the National Assembly elections and uncertainties over the global economic crisis. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are proposing a few changes in the 2011 Census Questionnaire compared to the 2000 Census Questionnaire. First, the 2011 Census Questionnaire design has been changed so as to ensure optimal scanning and r ecognition of data. In fact, the Central Statistics Office will, for the first time, be usin g scanning and recognition technology for census data capture, in order to speed up data processing and dissemination of census results. This is an 107 improvement we are making over the last census. Ac cordingly, it will be possible to make public the results of the census at an earlier date . Second, we are integrating in the questionnaire a f ew new questions. The first new question relates to the National Identity Card numb er in respect of all Mauritians. The purpose of this question is to set up an integrated populat ion database that combines census data with survey and administrative data for broader and deep er statistical analysis. The second new question relates to place of residence. Accordingl y, data will be obtained on the number of persons who live in the Republic of Mauritius conti nuously for the past 12 months as well as on the number of persons intending to live in the Repu blic of Mauritius continuously for, at least, 12 months. This question has been introduced as per t he latest UN principles and recommendations for population and housing censuses, so as to have a standard definition for resident population. For Mauritian citizens enumerated at the census who were not in the Republic of Mauritius continuously for the past 12 months and w ho do not intend to live in the Republic of Mauritius continuously for at least 12 months, the census will seek information on whether working abroad, studying abroad, on medical treatme nt abroad or for any other reasons. The purpose of this question is to obtain an estima te of the number of Mauritians living abroad by reason of stay. For non-Mauritian citize ns enumerated at the census, information will be collected on whether working, studying, on medic al treatment or any other reasons for stay. The purpose of this question is to obtain an estima te of the number of non-Mauritians present in the country on census night by reason of their stay . Third, we are removing one question relating to inc ome from this Census Questionnaire. The question on income received by each person was asked in Census 2000. Upon comparing the census data on income with data from other sour ces, it was found that the income data from the census was largely underreported. Accordingly, we are proposing not to include the question on income in the 2011 Census. Mr Speaker, Sir, with these words I move for the mo tion. The Deputy Prime Minister rose and seconded. (5.10 p.m.) 108 The Leader of the Opposition (Mr P. B\u00e9renger) : Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, the 10- yearly population census is an important exercise. I listened to what the hon. Minister of Finance had to say about the contents of the questionnaire that will be used as compared to the 2010 questionnaire. The last part I find a bit amusing. I did not have time to think about it. I agree with the fact that you put a question on income and when you compare it, I suppose to the MRA statistics, you find that there has been understate ment, and so you do away with the question altogether. I am not really, au pied lev\u00e9, convinced that this is the right thing to do. I take it that there are no other changes to questi ons put in 2010, but I will ask the hon. Minister of Finance to confirm and in a way to reas sure us on two points. One is about communities. Last time, in a population census, it was asked to which community you belong and the four communities offered were the four ones contained in the Schedule to our Constitution for best loser purposes. The last tim e that question was put was in 1972. In 1982, after the 60-0, on the occasion of those general el ections, it was done away with. I wish to have confirmation that this question will not be asked i n the course of the forthcoming population census. The second one is trickier. It relates to religion s. I understand that religious subsidies have been paid over the last years on the basis of outdated figures, but adjusted by the Central Statistics Office. In the past, it has happened tha t people were just asked: 'What is your religion?' And that led to a lot of confusion. So, I would wish to know what is the question, if any, relating to religions that will be asked. Wil l members of the population just be asked: 'What is your religion', which could lead to a lot of confusion - and even controversy - or are the members of the population going to be given a choic e? You tick - there is the list of religions that you can claim to belong to and others if you w ant. But there are two ways of doing it, of leaving it to the population to say: 'I belong to t his and that religion.' I would wish to know whether any figures contained in relation to religi ons in that forthcoming population census will be used in any way to impact on religious subsidies . Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. Mr Jugnauth : I thank the hon. Leader of the Opposition for hav ing intervened and made those remarks. 109 Let me first come to the issue of community. In fa ct, he is right to say that the last time that community was asked with regard to the populat ion was way back in 1972. In fact, we know that the system is based - especially the best loser system - on those figures. But ever since then, no other census has asked questions about com munity, and indeed this census also - I can confirm - will not be asking any question about com munity. With regard to religion, this is funny, because I w as reading the debates with regard to the census of 2000. At that time, there was a question about 'to which religion do you belong', and probably you would be surprised that some 200 relig ions were selected with regard to what people have answered. Therefore, first of all, it does not make really sense, but then I agree that we should not be asking questions about religion an d more so that, probably, some people might think that it is because we want to direct subsidie s with regard to religions. So, that is also not included. But with regard to the issue of income, I must say it is unfortunate - because it would have been a good thing to know - as all this inform ation - probably people are not aware - is confidential information. The people who carry out this census have to take an oath, to swear that they are not going to divulge any information and, at the level of the CSO, this information is treated with care and all the confidentiality th at is required. But, unfortunately, Mauritius being what it is, from what we have seen in the pas t, figures that have been collected with regard to declaration of income are really not according t o what is the reality. Therefore, instead of burdening the questionnaire - because the questionn aire is quite a document, I must say; there is quite a number of questions - we thought that, sinc e there is data which is unreliable, it will not be useful to have it on record. So, we'll see next time there is going to be one; by that time, we will see how the situation has evolved. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, with these remarks, I m ove in terms of the motion. Mr B\u00e9renger : Can I have some clarifications with your permissi on, Mr Speaker, Sir? Did I get the hon. Minister of Finance correctly th at there would be no question relating to religions at all? Because there was in the past. I must point out that I did not take a stand that there should not be. I said we should be careful i n putting the question; I didn't take a stand that there should be no question. So, did I get the hon . Minister of Finance right that there is a change and that, unlike 2010, there will be no ques tion at all on religions? 110 Mr Jugnauth : From what I have seen - probably I'll get confirm ation from the CSO - I don't see any question in relation to religion. Pr obably there is one; I see that there is a question on religion. Mr B\u00e9renger : How will it be done? Will you indicate your reli gion or will there be a list of religions from which you tick? Mr Jugnauth : Well, if the House can bear with me, as it is som ething... Mr Speaker : The Chair will wait for the information to come. It is very important. Mr Jugnauth : From what I understand, each individual who is go ing to fill this form will tell his religion, and the information will be comp iled as reported. But let me say that, apart from those changes that I have just mentioned, the questionnaire will be the same as the one in 2000, and that questionnaire is available on the we bsite. So, apart from the changes that I have mentioned today in the House, that is, the new ques tions and the one concerning income that we are removing, the questionnaire will be identical. The motion was, on question put, agreed to. PUBLIC BILLS Second Reading THE CODE CIVIL MAURICIEN (AMENDMENT) BILL (No. XV of 2010) Order for Second Reading read The Attorney General (Mr Y. Varma): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move that the Code Civil Mauricien (Amendment) Bill (No. XV of 2010) be read a second time. Mr Speaker, Sir, according to Article 122 of the Code Civil Mauricien , there are two scenarios where a person can be declared absent. T he first scenario is where a period of five years has elapsed since a person has been presumed absent, following his pr\u00e9somption d'absence declared by the Judge in Chambers. Such a decision may follow an application made by either an interested party or the Minist\u00e8re public to the Judge in Chambers to declare the person abs ent. The second scenario is the situation where there ha s been no pr\u00e9somption d'absence , but the person has ceased to appear at his place of domicil e or residence for a period of at least ten years. 111 Here as well, any interested party or the Minist\u00e8re public may apply to the Judge in Chambers to have the person declared absent. Article 122 of the Code Civil Mauricien applies to all cases of absence. Absence has been defined as \"... l'\u00e9tat d'une personne physique qui a cess\u00e9 de pa ra\u00eetre \u00e0 son domicile ou \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence et dont on n'a point eu de nouvelles, de (Encyclop\u00e9die Dalloz Civil, Vol I, Vo. Absence). Mr Speaker, Sir, it is believed that the time delay applicable to both scenarios mentioned earlier, namely five years and ten years, is unduly long. Recent events, in particular the disappearance of fishermen following the capsize of King Fish II and V, and the resulting distress that their families experienced at the tim e because of the impossibility of having a d\u00e9claration d'absence pronounced, illustrate how families have suffered unnecessarily due to the long waiting periods. Mr Speaker, Sir, Government has, therefore, decided to introduce the Code Civil Mauricien (Amendment) Bill, in order to reduce the time limit s applicable to declare a person absent. The Bill accordingly provides that, in the first sc enario, namely where there is already a d\u00e9claration d'absence with regard to a person, the time limit before tha t person may be declared dead will be reduced from five years to three years . This will allow any interested person or the Minist\u00e8re public to make an application for pr\u00e9somption d'absence to the Judge in Chambers, once a period of three years has lapsed from the ti me that person was presumed absent. As regards the second scenario, namely where there is no pr\u00e9somption d'absence with regard to a person, but that person has ceased to a ppear at his place of domicile or residence, this Bill provides that, instead of waiting for at least ten years before applying for a d\u00e9claration d'absence , an interested person or the Minist\u00e8re public may make the application after a period of five years only. Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the main advantages that w ill result from the proposed amendment are as follows - 112 (a) the psychological and emotional distress faced by the families will be reduced, as they will be able to come to terms with the death o f that person sooner. This will allow families to faire le deuil plus t\u00f4t ; (b) the delay for the processing of pension payment s to orphans and widows entitled to pensions under the National Pensions Act will be shortened, and (c) the earlier opening of the succession, which ma y to some extent reduce the financial hardship of the spouse or heirs, as they may be encountering financial hardships following the absence of the main or sole breadwinner of the family. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is believed that the proposed t ime limit in both scenarios, namely three years and five years, are sufficiently long to allo w insurance companies and other relevant authorities to verify the d\u00e9claration d'absence . Indeed, it has been noted that an overwhelming majority of applications for d\u00e9claration d'absence result from natural catastrophes or accidents at sea, where the possibility of survival after thr ee years or five years can safely be ruled out. Mr Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the Bi ll to the House. The Deputy Prime Minister rose and seconded. (5.26 p.m.) The Leader of the Opposition (Mr P. B\u00e9renger) : I wish to thank the new and young Attorney General for coming forward on an early occ asion with that piece of legislation. I wish to thank him on behalf of the families concerned an d on my own behalf. It's a very good thing. Families who have lost the head of the family or a member of the family, especially at sea, are already in great distress, and bringing down the ti me frame within which they can get some relief, including emotional, as the hon. Minister h as said, and not just financial, material advantages, is a good thing. Therefore, I think it is a very good initiative, and I thank the hon. Minister for that. Mr Varma : Let me thank the hon. Leader of the Opposition fo r supporting the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir. This, in fact, reflects the maturity of our democracy. It shows that, in certain cases, especially of general public interest, our l egislators, from whichever side of the House they are, can rise above party politics. This Bill , Mr Speaker, Sir, is the first to be debated, and I hope the same spirit prevails throughout the year. 113 Question put and agreed to. Bill read a second time and committed . THE DIVORCE AND JUDICIAL SEPARATION (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL (No. XXIV of 2010) Order for Second Reading read The Attorney General (Mr Y. Varma): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move that the Divorce and Judicial Separation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (No. XXIV of 2010) be read a second time. Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government has always, as can be gathered from a reading of the Government Programme 2010-2015, laid a lot of empha sis on the need for modernising our judicial and legal system in order to cater for cur rent realities and address whatever lacunas there may be in our laws, which cause unnecessary problem s both for the individual members of society and our Court system generally. One such area of our law, Mr Speaker, Sir, which Go vernment undertook to review and where the need for reform has been felt for a numbe r of years, is the law on divorce. Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, a divorce can be said to be one of th e most painful and stressful experiences which a married couple and a family can ever go through. It affects not only the spouses, but also their children, and the rest of their lives - and very of ten through no particular fault of any of the spouses. This is precisely why it is increasingly felt that our law on divorce, as it presently stands (having regard to the grounds on which a pet ition for divorce may be lodged), worsens the inherent stressful and harmful experience which a d ivorce can be, instead of ensuring that a marriage is dissolved with dignity and in a manner which is not embarrassing, humiliating and, as far as possible, fair to the spouses and their c hildren, if any. Mr Speaker, Sir, the grounds on which a divorce pet ition can presently be lodged are provided for in Article 229 of the Code Civil Mauricien , by virtue of which - \"Le prononc\u00e9, soit en cas de faute, soit en cas de rupture de la vie commune.\" In relation to 'faute' , Article 230 provides, that - 114 \"Le divorce \u00eatre demand\u00e9 ces une violation ou renouv el\u00e9e des devoirs ou obligations du mariage.\" As for 'rupture de la vie commune' , Article 235 of the Code Civil Mauricien provides as follows - \"Un \u00e9poux peut demander le divorce, en raison commune, lorsque les \u00e9poux vivent s\u00e9par\u00e9s de fait depuis cin q ans.\" The grounds of divorce under our law, Mr Speaker, S ir, are, therefore, quite limited. In fact, this was the view expressed by the Law Reform Commission (LRC), in its Report on 'Law on Divorce', dated December 2008, and in which the evolution of our own law and practice, as well as developments and discussions on this area o f the law in other jurisdictions have been examined. The Law Reform Commission was thus of th e view that our law on divorce is inadequate, that it must be adapted to the realitie s of conjugal life, and that the concept of divorce by mutual consent, which had existed in our Civil Code from 1808 to 1884, should be reintroduced. As is highlighted in the said Report, Mr Speaker, S ir, a good law on divorce must seek to achieve two objectives - - firstly, it should buttress, rather than undermine, the stability of marriage; - secondly, if a marriage is dead, and here I quote - \"the object of the law should be to afford it a decent burial. It should achieve th is in a way that is just to all concerned, including the children as well as the sp ouses, and which causes them the minimum of embarrassment and humiliation. Abov e all, it should seek to take the heat out of the disputes between husband and wi fe, and certainly not further embitter the relationships between them or between them and their children. It should not merely bury the marriage, but do so with decency and dignity (...)\" The LRC considered that - - firstly, insofar as the second objective is concern ed, the current law and practice does not fulfil the said objective, and that the ne ed to file a petition for divorce to make allegations most probably causes considerable bitterness and resentment, 115 distress and humiliation. This, Mr Speaker, Sir, c an be said to explain the high number of undefended cases of divorce; - secondly, - \"a legal process which facilitates agre ement can help couples to reorganise their lives...whereas a process which conc entrates on establishing which spouse is the guilty party increases antagoni sm and discourages constructive solutions. There is thus the need for re-introducing in our law divorce by mutual consent, with certain safeguards, so as not to reduce marriage to the level of a private contract...\"; - thirdly, divorce by mutual consent would spare the parties to divorce proceedings the embarrassment and humiliation to which they are now subjected, and would make the proceedings less of a source of bitterness and recrimination; - as far as 'rupture de la vie commune' is concerned, the LRC was of the view that the period of separation required, which is present ly five years, is rather long and may impose unnecessary hardship on people whose mar riages have genuinely and irretrievably broken down and who may be in a sever e state of distress as a result. The LRC thus considered that a period of two years would be more appropriate. The Law Reform Commission accordingly proposed two new grounds of divorce. The first new ground of divorce proposed was divorc e by mutual consent, which could be resorted to where both spouses in a marriage agree to a divorce and the consequences thereof, and where they may give a joint notice to the Supre me Court of their intention to divorce by mutual consent (' consentement mutuel' ). The second new ground proposed was divorce by 'acceptation du principe de la rupture du marriage' . Thus, where the spouses agree to a divorce but n ot the consequences thereof, one or both parties may give notice to the Supreme Cour t of their intention to divorce on this ground. The main object of the present Bill, Mr Speaker, Si r, which has been prepared on the basis of the LRC Report on 'Law on Divorce', to whi ch I have just referred to, is, therefore, to provide for the following new grounds of divorce, i .e - - divorce 'en cas d'acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage' ; - divorce 'en cas de consentement mutuel' . 116 Mr Speaker, Sir, I here congratulate the former Att orney General, under whose tenure of office the Draft Bill was prepared. Divorce, and more particularly divorce by mutual co nsent, being a very sensitive issue, whereby the marital life and future of individuals are at stake, Government deemed it fit to circulate the Draft Bill for public consultation, i n order to have the views of society at large thereon. This was done in June 2010. I wish to th ank the hon. Minister of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare, the Judiciary , the Mauritius Bar Association, the Mauritius Law Society, the Chamber of Notaries, the barristers, the attorneys and the members of the public who made representations and proposal s, which were given due consideration in the finalisation of this Bill. The salient features of the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, are that it - - provides for divorce or judicial separation by mutu al consent or acceptance in principle of the breakdown of a marriage; - reduces, from five to three years, the period of se paration required for a divorce or judicial separation on the ground of 'rupture de la vie commune' ; - simplifies the process following the lodging of a p etition; - provides for the automatic conversion of a provisio nal decree into a permanent decree three months after the provisional decree ha s been granted, unless one of the parties objects to same not later than 15 days before the expiry of the three months. I shall now, Mr Speaker, Sir, indicate the changes and new provisions which the Bill proposes to bring. The most important amendment which the Bill propose s to bring is found in clause 2(a) of the Bill, by virtue of which the existing Articl e 229 of the Code Civil Mauricien is repealed and replaced by a new Article 229, which retains di vorce on the grounds of 'faute' and 'rupture de la vie commune' , but provides, in addition, for two new grounds of divorce, i.e divorce - - 'en cas d'acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage' , and - secondly, 'en cas de consentement mutuel' . 117 Clause 2(b), for its part, amends Article 235 of th e Code Civil Mauricien, which provides for divorce on the ground of 'rupture de la vie commune', by replacing the period of five years separation required for this type of divorce by a p eriod of three years. In view of the new grounds of divorce proposed, cla use 2(c) of the Bill further amends the Code Civil Mauricien by introducing three new subsections in 'Section Premi\u00e8re' of the chapter relating to divorce, which are respectively entitled - - du divorce par acceptation du principe de la ruptur e du mariage (sub section III); - du divorce par consentement mutuel (sub section IV); - des modifications du fondement d'une demande en d ivorce (sub section V). With regard to divorce ' en cas d'acceptation du principe de la rupture du m ariage ', the new Articles 238-1 and 238-2 will provide that, whe re the parties to a marriage agree to a divorce but not the consequences thereof, one or bo th parties may give notice to the Supreme Court of the intention to divorce. It is to be not ed that a period of two years should have elapsed since the celebration of the marriage before the pa rties can seek this type of divorce. Furthermore, the Judge to whom the petition is pres ented, will have to ensure that all efforts for a reconciliation have been made, and it is only if he is convinced that the parties have of their own free will given their acceptance in principle of th e breakdown of the marriage that he will grant the divorce and decide upon the consequences thereo f. As for divorce by mutual consent, the new Articles 238-3 to 238-5 of the new subsection IV will now provide that, where both spouses agree to a divorce and the consequences thereof, they may give joint notice to the Supreme Court of their intention to divorce by mutual consent by submitting to the Judge, for his approval, a ' convention ' (i.e an agreement) setting out the consequences of the divorce. It is to be noted that each of the spouses may caus e the petition to be lodged by their respective attorney or by an attorney agreed upon b y them. Moreover, just as for divorce ' en cas d'acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage ', divorce by mutual consent cannot be sought befor e a period of 24 months since the celebration of the marriage, and the Judge will aga in have to ensure that all efforts have been made for a reconciliation. He will, therefore, gra nt the divorce and ratify the agreement 118 submitted by the parties only if he is convinced th at the parties have freely consented to the divorce. It is worth stressing, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Ju dge may refuse to ratify the agreement and to grant the divorce if he finds that the agree ment does not sufficiently provide for the interests of the children or of any of the spouses. He can also order the deletion or modification of any clause of the agreement which he considers n ot to be in the interests of the children or of any of the spouses. Once the divorce is granted and the agreement is ra tified, the spouses themselves give effect to the consequences of the divorce, as set o ut in the agreement. As for new subsection V, it provides - - firstly, in its new Article 238-6, that where a p etition for divorce on the ground of 'faute ' or ' rupture de la vie commune ' has been lodged, the spouses may, at any stage of the proceedings, make a motion that the di vorce be granted on the ground of ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage ', and - secondly, under new Article 238-7, where a petiti on for divorce on the ground of 'faute', 'rupture de la vie commune' or ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage ' has been lodged, the spouses may, at any stage of the proceedings, make a motion that the divorce be granted on the ground of ' consentement mutual ', by submitting to the Judge a ' convention ' setting out the consequences of the divorce. Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the new grounds of divo rce proposed, the provisions relating to ' mesures provisoires ' (i.e ' Section Deuxi\u00e8me ' of the chapter relating to divorce) are accordingly amended under clauses 2 (d) and (e) of the Bill by - - repealing Article 239 and replacing it by a new A rticle 239, which provides for the ' mesures d'urgence ' which a District Magistrate can take following a petition for divorce on the ground of ' faute ', ' rupture de la vie commune ' or ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage '; - repealing and replacing Article 240 by a new Arti cle 240, which sets out in more detail the ' mesures provisoires ' which the Judge in Chambers may make for the 119 well-being of the spouses and the children, until s uch time as the judgment takes effect. Article 246, which relates to the date on which a d ivorce takes effect between the parties, insofar as their property is concerned, is repealed and replaced, under clause 2(f), by a new Article 246 which makes provision, in relation to e ach of the four grounds of divorce, for the date the divorce will take effect between the parti es, as regards their property. Under clause 2(g) of the Bill, where a divorce is p ronounced for ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage ' or ' consentement mutuel ', new Articles 253-1 and 253-2 provide for the consequences thereof as far as the ' donations et avantages ' made or given during the marriage are concerned. As regards the consequences of a divorce, for the c hildren, under clause 2(h), new Article 262-1 provides that where a divorce is pronounced o n the ground of mutual consent, the provisions of the ' convention ' relating to ' l'autorit\u00e9 parentale ' may, at the instance of any of the spouses or the Minist\u00e8re public , be reviewed for ' motif grave '. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as ' s\u00e9paration de corps ' is concerned, under clause 2(i) of the Bill, new Articles 280 and 281 are proposed, accord ing to which - - judicial separation may be converted into divorce by mutual consent; - where judicial separation was pronounced on the g round of mutual consent, it can be converted into divorce only by mutual consent; - by virtue of the conversion, the ground for judic ial separation becomes the ground for divorce. These, Mr Speaker, Sir, were an overview of the ame ndments being proposed to the Code Civil Mauricien . Coming to clause 3 of the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the amendments being proposed to the Code Civil Mauricien , a number of procedural amendments are consequentl y proposed to be brought to the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act 1981. The proposed amendments, in essence, simplify the process follow ing the lodging of a petition and speed up proceedings for the parties, whilst however maintai ning the provision relating to reconciliation. 120 Clause 3(a) of the Bill, first of all, amends secti on 5 of the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act to provide for the contents of a pet ition for divorce or judicial separation under Articles 230, 231, 235, 238-1 or 238-3 of the Code Civil Mauricien . Thus, a petition for divorce on the ground of ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage ' has to be accompanied by a statement that the parties accept that the marriage has broken down. As for divorce by mutual consent, the petition must be accompanied by a copy of the agreement referred to in Article 238- 3 of the Code Civil Mauricien . Under clause 3(b) of the Bill, section 6 of the Act , which provides for service and presentation of petition, is amended to provide for cases where a petition is lodged by the spouses jointly. New subsection (5), which is prop osed to be added in section 6, provides that, for petitions under Article 238-1 or 238-3 of the Code Civil Mauricien , the Judge has to go through the petition in the manner provided for in Article 238-2 or 238-4, as the case may be. Under clause 3(c) of the Bill, section 7(2) of the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act, which presently provides for the setting down of a petition for preliminary hearing, following the presentation of a petition, where the parties are u nlikely to be reconciled, is amended to do away with this procedure. Section 8 of the Divorce and Judicial Separation Ac t, which presently deals with preliminary hearings, is accordingly repealed and r eplaced under clause 3(d) of the Bill by a new section 8 entitled \"Further proceedings\", by virtue of which, in cases of divorce petitions on the ground of acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage or consentement mutuel where a reconciliation is unlikely, or in cases where a pet ition is not resisted, the Judge has to fix the cas e for trial on a date determined by him. On the other hand, Mr Speaker, Sir, where the respo ndent was not present on the day fixed for presentation of the petition or was prese nt and indicated that the petition is resisted, the Judge will cause the matter to be mentioned on a da te determined by him and the respondent may, on that date - - admit the contents of the petition; - file his reasons of objection, or - file a cross petition. 121 The case will thereafter be fixed for trial. Moreover, under clause 3(e) of the Bill, section 9 of the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act is repealed and replaced by a new section 9, wh ich provides that the Court shall grant a provisional decree - (a) in the case of a petition for divorce on the gr ound of acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage or consentement mutuel , where the Court is satisfied that the divorce should be pronounced; (b) in every other case, where the Court is satisfi ed that the petitioner has established his case or that both parties are to blame. Clause 3(f), for its part, seeks to bring another i mportant amendment by repealing and replacing the present section 10 of the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act, which deals with \"Permanent decree\" and which provides for an applic ation to the Court for a provisional decree to be made permanent by a new section 10, which pro vides for the automatic conversion of a provisional decree into a permanent decree three mo nths after the grant of the provisional decree, unless one of the parties objects to same not later than 15 days before the expiry of the three months. Section 11 of the Divorce and Judicial Separation A ct is, under clause 3(g) of the Bill, amended, to provide for restrictions on provisional decree. Thus, the Court shall not grant a provisional decree, unless it is satisfied as to th e matters provided for in the said petition. As for clause 3(h) of the Bill, it introduces a new section 11A, which provides for the conversion of a provisional decree into a permanent decree. Thus, except where a notice of objection is lodged, the Court shall, upon expiry o f the period of three months, specified in section 10(1) of the Divorce and Judicial Separatio n Act, order that the provisional decree be made permanent. The Registrar then issues a rule t o that effect. As far as decrees of judicial separation are concer ned, whilst presently the respondent to a decree of judicial separation may, not earlier th an three years after the date of the decree, apply to the Court for the conversion of the decree into a decree of divorce, this period is now reduced to two years, by virtue of the amendment brought to section 12 of the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act, under clause 3(i) of the Bill. 122 Clause 3(j) of the Bill seeks to amend section 15 o f the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act, which provides for amendment of orders and agr eements, to also provide for the amendment of agreements made under Article 238-3 of the Code Civil Mauricien . Finally, under clause 3(k), the last amendment whic h the Bill proposes to make to the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act, relates to sec tion 21, which is amended to provide for the making of regulations by the Chief Justice. Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the procedural amendmen ts to the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act, amendments are being proposed to th e Divorce and Judicial Separation Regulations of 1981, under clause 4 of the Bill, to bring them in line with the changes being brought to the Divorce and Judicial Separation Act. The main amendments are as follows - Regulation 3, which relates to service of documents where a petition is lodged, is amended to cater for situations where a petition is lodged by the parties jointly, while Regulation 5, which presently provides for the procedure as re gards preliminary hearing, is revoked. As for the Schedule to the Regulations, it is repealed and replaced by a new Schedule. Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, by virtue of the transiti onal provisions provided for in clause 5 of the Bill, any petition for divorce or judicial s eparation or any application incidental to or consequential upon it pending before the Supreme Co urt at the commencement of the Divorce and Judicial Separation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act shall be deemed to have been made under the Act and any such petition or application shall be continued in accordance with the Act. I have, Mr Speaker, Sir, highlighted the main amend ments being proposed in the Bill. Bearing in mind the way society has evolved, Mr Spe aker, Sir, the above amendments are, therefore, being proposed in order to align our exi sting laws with the current realities of conjugal life and also for the sake of the future of those p eople whose marital life has regrettably broken down. Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir, society has changed, and i t is a fact that sometimes sheer incompatibility between individuals, for instance, can make life intolerable not only for both spouses, but also very often for the children born out of the said marriage. The amendments being brought to the Code Civil Mauricien , Mr Speaker, Sir, are primarily meant to cater for 123 situations where a marriage has broken down, for on e reason or the other, and very often without any of the parties being at fault, in order to enab le spouses who have definitely made up their mind to get separated, to get a divorce without hav ing to throw accusations at the other spouse, as the case very often is under the present state o f our law. I have to point out, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we have endeavoured to strike a right balance between, on the one hand, preserving the institutio n of marriage and our values and, on the other hand, accepting the realities of our modern society . In order to ensure that our law on divorce does not undermine the institution of marriage, the amendments proposed contain certain safeguards, for example - 1) the lapse of a period of two years since the celebr ation of the marriage before divorce on the ground of ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage' or 'consentement mutuel' may be sought, and 2) the conversion of the provisional decree into a per manent decree not before a period of three months, during which, hopefully, th e parties would have had the time to further reflect on the implications of thei r choices. It is considered, and I am convinced, Mr Speaker, S ir, that our society is honest and mature enough to favourably welcome the amendments proposed. With these words, Mr Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bi ll to the House. Dr. A. Boolell rose and seconded. (6.01 p.m.) The Leader of the Opposition (Mr P. B\u00e9renger) : I don't mind doing that, because we are in full agreement with this Bill also, Mr Speak er, Sir. But, in preparing myself to take part in today's debate, I did some research - if you would allow me - to offer to the House. As a historical fact, a long time back, a lot of countri es didn't have any divorce legislation. The number of countries without any divorce legislation has decreased over the centuries, and then years. I found out that, today, every country, exc ept Malta, Philippines and Vatican City have some form of divorce legislation. In the case of M alta, as an alternative to divorce, for moral or religious reasons, is the legal separation or annul ment. 124 As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, legal separation is a legal process by which a married couple may formalise a de facto separation while remaining legally married. Those arrangements provide for interim financial arrangem ents or temporary arrangements for the care of children. Whereas annulment, especially in the Catholic Church, is a legal procedure for declaring a marriage null and void and, unlike divo rce, it is usually retroactive, that is, it is as i f the marriage never took place. In Philippines, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no divorc e legislation, except for Muslims, provided in the law; for the others, only annulment is available. There is no divorce legislation in the Vatican City, but divorce legislation exists in Italy as a whole since the 1974 referendum. We, Ile de France, now Mauritius, have had a law fo r divorce purposes for a very long time. Indeed, as a historian, I found it very inte resting - and the only reference to that by the hon . Attorney General was reintroduction of divorce by m utual consent - that, from 1808 to 1884 - le divorce, as it was in that old French Code Napoleon , Article 233 - le divorce par consentement mutuel was, in fact, in our legislation. It was removed by the British Colonial Administration through an 1884 Ordinance, after having been in our legislation, and to come back after 127 years. I find that amazing, and I wonder how many countries have been a French colony and then a British colony and found themselves in that kind of very interesting situation, Mr Speaker, Sir. Indeed, as the hon. Attorney General said, divorce by mutual consent was recommended to be reintroduced in our legislation in the Law Re form Commission Report of December 2008. I shall end by quoting two paragraphs from the Law Reform Commission of Mauritius Report dated December 2008. I quote - \"A divorce must surely be one of the most stressful and damaging experiences that a couple or a family can ever go through. It is not simply a day in court, but a whole process of painful change and adjustment, which wil l affect the parties and their children for years to come, if not for the rest of their liv es.\" And their concluding remarks, Mr Speaker, Sir - we are fulfilling their wishes today - I quote - 125 \"We are confident today that our proposals would go some way towards improving our law on divorce, by ensuring marriage is dissolved w ith dignity and in a manner which is fair to the parties and to their children.\" Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. (6.07 p.m.) Mr J. Seetaram (Second Member for Montagne Blanche & GRSE) : Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his speech . Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe this amendment is rarely a breath of fresh air for all litigants and for all parties who are in a divorce case or might be in a divorce case. Most importantly, the reason ing behind is to relieve parties concerned in divorce matters, avoiding them to cast accusations, allegations upon their partners, upon the other spouse, that is, parties no longer have to av er faute to obtain a provisional decree of divorce and thereafter a permanent decree. That indeed is a soulagement . In practice, Mr Speaker, Sir - you would know of experience - it is, however, extr emely burdensome, traumatising for parties to come to court, to swear, to defend or put forwar d arguments in the hope of averring fault on the other party to win their case. Hence, this legislation is not removing the provisi onal decree of divorce by way of fault, but is adding a first option, which is divorce or j udicial separation by mutual consent and, second, divorce or judicial separation by acceptanc e in principle of a breakdown of a marriage. For the divorce or judicial separation by mutual co nsent, parties, before coming to court, before going to see their lawyers would come to an agreeme nt on the divorce and on the consequences of the divorce. They would finalise all matters in relation to that particular divorce, be it pension alimentaire , that is, alimony, be it custody, that is, droit de visite or droit d'h\u00e9bergement, maintenance of the child or property issues that I shall come later on. All can be finalised in an agreement between parties; they come and are all ag reeable to that very fact; they put it on paper and go to court to file a divorce on mutual consent . That is one. Secondly, divorce or judicial separation by way of acceptance in principle of breakdown on marriage, that is to say parties which are agree able to the aspect of divorce only des deux personnes, whereas ancillary issues, for example, alimony, cu stody, droit de visite or property matters can be decided thereafter or before the cou rt of law. So, I believe that such an innovative legislation would relieve all parties going in that direction. 126 As I said, parties would not have to impose faute on the other. If ever a party has filed a petition for faute and, in the middle of proceedings, he finds that h e no longer wants to go for faute and wishes to change, he can do so. He is allowed either to go for mutual consent or for breakdown of marriage. So, this also, I find it a very innovative procedure. Further, most importantly, Mr Speaker knows very we ll how embarrassed litigants come to court, waiting in long queues. These used to be on Fridays where mostly all Judges used to take Family Court matters, but now it is every day. All of us, barristers and attorneys at law, know how many couples come before the Supreme Court for divorce. Such an innovative legislation would no longer embarrass litigants or make them face quarrels and tensions. Most importantly - and this is a pity - who is at the wr ong end in this whole story? It is the child! It is the child who suffers at the end of the day. Such legislation, of course, would not have parties to aver faute on each other. I believe this is also in the best interest of the child. We won't have lengthy and bulky defended or contest ed cases before the Supreme Court. Those cases can be reduced to divorce or judicial s eparation by mutual consent or acceptance in principle of breakdown on marriage cases. What I f ind also very encouraging is the automatic permanent decree of divorce. The actual procedure is that, in fact, the divorce is given at a provisional level and, after three months, one has to apply for a permanent decree, whereas as per this legislation the permanent decree would be given automatically after three months. If one has to object, he has to do so 15 days before the t hree months are over. So, this is automatic, and relieves the burden; it relieves the litigant of th e waste of time before going to court and all subsidiary connected matters. Further, the lodging procedure is simplified. Concerning the mutual consent divorce and judicial separation, both parties can retain the services of an attorney to file a case for mutual c onsent, or they can choose two different lawyers. So, that saves costs. Further, the whole population benefits from such legislation and, in conjunction with such legislation, there are som e areas where maybe one can propose to have a few amendments. Concerning property issues, we know how lengthy cou rt procedures are. We know very well that it might mostly take more than a divorce case concerning its time. Regarding property issues, one suggestion can be that, within the comm unity which is, of course, a battle in itself, one can propose a mediation to settle community pro perty issues. The Judge can be appointed or 127 another Judge, not necessarily from the Family Cour t, to do mediation in relation to those property issues concerning the community of marriag e. This can be one proposal, because you have parties/spouses coming to court for divorce ma tters. The divorce is sorted out, whereas the property issues can be left aside, and it is not de alt with yet. So, why should those parties/spouses, when they have already divorced, c ome back to court again for a few years more to settle property issues? No. Let the divorce ca se be dealt with together with the property issue and, henceforth, parties can start a new life and d on't have to bother about coming to court again for the same matter. Concerning children from the marriage, one can also provide another reasoning for l'entretien de l'enfant . While the divorce is pronounced by either proced ure, one can entwine the maintenance of the child. If the child has to go t o school, maybe at secondary level, or for further studies, it makes provision for that. Concerning droit de visite and right of stay, as referred to by the Attorney General, one can also propose more child psychologists to make p sychologist reports available within a shorter time and also for social enquiry reports to be made available much quicker, so that judgments in cases concerning custody of child can be given earlier. Concerning section 262.1, where the motifs graves have been proposed, it says - \u00ab En cas de divorce par consentement mutuel, les di spositions de la convention homologu\u00e9e par le juge relatives \u00e0 l'exercice de l' autorit\u00e9 parentale peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9es, pour des graves, \u00e0 demande de l 'un des \u00e9poux ou du Minist\u00e8re public. \u00bb I believe instead of motifs graves one could replace it by 'interests of the child'. It is in the interest of the child that one should take any decision as, at the end of the day, the one who suffers the most out of a divorce or this particula r procedure is the child. Basically, being very much in favour of that Bill, I believe we have room to amend further, and I believe this Bill should be commended to the House. Thank you. (6.21 p.m.) 128 Mr V. Baloomoody (Third Member for GRNW & Port Loui s West): Mr Speaker, Sir, as rightly pointed out by the hon. Leader of the Op position, we, on this side of the House, fully support the Bill. However, we should put some ques tions, probably for the hon. Attorney General to answer and make certain remarks, to ensu re that, in practice, it does work properly. We can have a very good legislation but, unfortunat ely, when it comes to the practical part of it, we see that it does not function as it should be. There is no doubt that divorce par consentement mutuel has many advantages, and it is well described in the report of the Law Reform Comm ission. Moreover, it minimises the psychological damage done not only to the parties, but also to the children of the family. If the marriage is dead, both emotionally and physically, there is no point keeping it alive. It creates more problems and more damage to the families. Whe n one looks at the statistics of divorce in our country, according to the CSO, in 1975, there w ere 110 divorces out of 6,888 civil marriages. In 2005, there were 1,133 divorces out of 11,076 ci vil marriages; that's nearly 10 per cent, and this doubled in four years. In 2009, we had 2,154 divorces out of 10,446 marriages; that's nearly 20 per cent. There is no doubt that divorce in our society today is increasing, and we should bring forward law not only to facilitate it, but to humanise it, and make it less harmful to the parties and to the families. When we look at the Family Division itself - the st atistics are not from the CSO, but from the Family Division, which I gathered yesterday - n early everyday now, there are about 15 cases being heard by the Judge of the Supreme Court. Out of these 15 cases, ten of them are undefended. We have to go for the cause of these u ndefended divorces, which I will come to later. Ten cases are undefended, and out of the fi ve cases which were defended, four of them go on a torts partag\u00e9s . So, only one divorce, probably, per day is heavi ly contested in our court. Clearly, the concept of consent or undefended is al ready established by the facts themselves, without the law being now in practice. We have the se statistics, which show us clearly that people are prepared to \"give way\" for a divorce tha n to contest it seriously in court. When we look at these statistics, it's clear that the issue of divorce by consent has gone forward and, in fact, has moved faster than the law. However, when we look at the law concerning the iss ue of consent itself, I think we should be very careful. We know that in Mauritius, in most of the families, one party, mostly the 129 husband, has the economic power. He is the one who has the most economic power; he is the one who is the boss in the house, and he dictates t he rules in many families up to now - let's be honest. Concerning this consent, I think the court should go deeper. It should not content itself as the amendment says that the Judge \u00ab s'assure si tous les librem ent son accord. \u00bb As to \"librement son accord \", I don't think it is sufficient. The Judge shoul d go deeper. In the French law, they have the concept of la volont\u00e9 doit \u00eatre libre et \u00e9clair\u00e9e, which means that both parties have to know the full consequence of that convention they are signing. There have been examples of consentement forc\u00e9; it has been pressed on one party. mutuel se r\u00e9sume parfois l'argent et les biens, le logement, le le conse ntement forc\u00e9. This is why that consent issue is of great importance, and it becomes more importa nt in cases where there is only one attorney who presents that contrat - that arrangement - made between parties. Who re tains the service of the attorney? It is the one who has got the money to pay the attorney. The attorney, at the end of the day, will take instructions from whom? I am no t saying that the attorney will be an accomplice in this issue, but we have to be careful , because in France again, there have been cases of conflits d'int\u00e9r\u00eats between the attorney and the parties. Very often, these documents will be drafted at the instructions of the one whic h is economically plus dominant . I will quote from a French civil book, ' Divorce par consentement mutuel', which I d\u00e9terminer les int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers de chacun de s es clients. \u00bb We have to be careful here; we have to put it in th e context of Mauritius: a common attorney, a common attorney-at-law. There might be conflict of interest; the interests of one of the party may be neglected at the expense of the ot her. This is why I say we have to look again at the issue of legal aid. Legal aid is very impor tant in this case. 130 Mr Speaker, Sir, there are many cases which go unde fended because, very often, the wife does not get legal aid and cannot afford to defend that petition of divorce. She has to accept the faute . Why does she not get legal aid? It is because s he has married under the r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 de biens . There is a property in the name of the family, a house in the name of the husband and wife and, because of this, she is not q ualified for legal aid, and if she does not work, she can't afford to defend. This will become worse in the case of consentement mutual, if one party wishes to take a legal advice, an independent attorney, and he or she is not qualified for legal aid and the one who can afford retains the se rvices of an attorney to do the common work for both parties. This is very important, and I think we have to be c areful on that issue because we live in Mauritius and the economic structure in our family is still one-sided. So, this is a point which I wanted to make on the issue of consent, linked to t he issue of legal aid. When I say legal aid, I mean that it becomes more important in these cases, and I think we have to review or probably we have to see in the future whether the idea that both parties retain the services of one attorney is convenient or if we are protecting equally the i nterests of both parties. When we say consentement mutuel, we have to look at all the issues. It must be a d ivorce en bloc, because we don't want the parties to come back aga in in court. There is another issue to which I wish to draw the attention of the court. I t is the issue of joint custody or joint autorit\u00e9 parentale if we want to have limited psychological damage on the children . In England, there is this issue of joint custody. The children are allo wed to stay in both places, especially if the family lives in the same surroundings, attend schoo l and live with both families. Probably this won't be practical as such in Mauritius, but joint autorit\u00e9 parentale is essential. In practice, what do we have? Once one parent gets the custody of the child, he or she thinks she is the owner of the child, and that she is doing a favour by giving the child for the weekend to the other party. What is worse very oft en is that one parent - the one who doesn't have custody - does not get access to the education and the health files of the child, because the other parent goes to school and presents that paper , saying - \"Look, I have the autorit\u00e9, zis moi ki gagne droit guet mo zenfant dan l'\u00e9cole, and you give the report only to me, not to him, bec ause he has got only a right of visit or a droit d'h\u00e9bergement .\" 131 Once again, we have to look at this issue of joint custody if we really want to limit the psychological damages. We should not limit to divo rce with consent, which will benefit only the parents. We should go further to joint autorit\u00e9 parentale, where both parties will have their say and follow the children, especially with regard to education and health. I come now to the Family Court. We don't have a Fa mily Court in Mauritius. Let's stop keep saying that we have a Family Court; we have a division of the Supreme Court, where two Judges are attached every now and then. There were two when we transferred the two courts from the Supreme Court to the Court House, and now we have another two Judges where one, at least, has moved back to the Supreme Court. We don 't have a specialised Family Court. The Family Court should not restrict itself to divorce only. There are many issues which a family Court should attend to. It should not limit itself by giving a permanent decree, a decree of divorce, giving custody and droit d'h\u00e9bergement . There are other issues, and here, with due respect to our learned Magistrate of the District C ourt, I must say that many of them are not qualified enough to advise, to take decision on fam ily matters. This is why I am a bit worried on this legislation. Once a petition is presented, we give certain powers to the Magistrate. I think we should leave it to Judges, who are more mature a nd experienced to look in such important issues as family matters. Let us be honest. We voted a very good law in the House, namely the Domestic Violence Bill, but in practice it does probably more harm th an good to the family because of a lack of institutions and professionals to handle the matter . Again, we need a Family Court which does not compose only of Judges. Yes, they are mature J udges, but they are not mature lawyers. So, we need the Family Court with assessors, psychologi sts like in Australia, where even priests are affiliated to the Family Court - priests, psycholog ists, councillors. So, this is where we have to reform our Family Court, if we want this law to fun ction. It is not enough just to vote a law on consentement . We need the proper institution, and we need a pr oper Family Court to ensure that we have the best from this law we are voting today. Mr Speaker, Sir, I don't want to repeat myself too much. I have drawn three points, which I think are important, namely the issue of co nsent. We have to ensure that the person giving the consent est bien encadr\u00e9e; there is no pressure on her; there is no chantage . We have to ensure that legal advice, wherever needed, is av ailable, and we have to ensure the interests of 132 the children. I think one of the main issues here is the joint parental authority we can give, which is not in our law and which I think we should introduce in such cases. Of course, we need the institution and, in my humble submission, we ne ed a proper Family Court with proper assistance not only of Judges and lawyers, but of p rofessionals who can assist, to ensure less and less or no psychological damage to a divorce. I have done, Mr Speaker Sir. Thank you. (6.36 p.m) The Minister of Gender Equality, Child Development and Family Welfare (Mrs S. Bappoo) : Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish, at the first instance, t o congratulate my colleague, hon. Yatin Varma, the Attorney General, for introducing the Di vorce and Judicial Separation Bill before the House today. This Bill ensures, first of all, equality for all c itizens, and respect of all fundamental rights and freedom through the introduction of divo rce by mutual consent. It forms part of the latest trend that reflects new and fundamental shif t to ease and simplify the divorce proceedings, but it also encourages harmonious relationship in t he future and helps the parties finally to reshape their lives. Concurrently, as has been men tioned by the hon. Attorney General, under our law, the ground for divorce is quite limited, a nd Articles 2 to 9 of the Code Civil Mauricien provide only that \" le divorce peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 soit en cas de faute soit en cas de rupture de la vie commune .\" But, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that women and children are always victims in cases of divorce. We all understand le trauma, le calvaire, la stigmatisation, l'humili ation et la douleur caused to many women who have to undergo years of c ourt proceedings and procedures before the final judgment is being given to cases of divor ce. So, with the introduction of this Bill, the governm ent is redeeming a pledge made especially to the women of this country and, in fac t, since 2005, we underscore the fact that the protection of the rights of every family as well as disintegration of the family unit against violence, social harassment, insecurity would form part of our social policies to provide for the promotion of social justice and gender equity. At paragraph 130 of the Government Programme 133 2010-2015, it specifically underlines that governme nt will sustain its policies for the promotion for family welfare and protection from domestic vio lence, in spite that we do have more hurdles to overtake. You will agree, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Bill should not be left only to the hon. Attorney General to defend, but I am happy also to see that the whole Bill has the support of the Opposition; the support and loyalty, I suppose, of all men and women in a good and just cause, because it provides much better illustration of a p rogressive piece of legislation. I do understand also the various queries put forward by hon. Baloom oody, but I am sure that the hon. Attorney General will respond to the various questions that have been put. Mr Speaker, Sir, divorce by mutual consent should n ot be taken as a license in itself to seek divorce comme certains veulent n\u00e9cessaire. These garde-fous are being provided in the Bill. The Bill is a maj or milestone in the process of simplifying and humanising divorce proce edings, and to allow the final termination of marriage by what we call today mutual consent. It also allows for quick and easy resolutions, reducing from five to three years the duration of m arriage before the proceeding on the ground of rupture de la vie commune is set. Finally, it comes to cancel the need for a provisional decree, which is normally followed after quite some time by a permanent one. Parties seeking divorce on ground of one's fault and that of torts partag\u00e9s need not to wait for long procedures. So, this piece of legislation is indeed a milestone in our e ndeavour to bring social justice, to ensure equality of rights, in line with the government vis ion for a society devoid of discrimination. M. le pr\u00e9sident, la nouvelle loi \u00e9vite au couple ay ant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de se s\u00e9parer de le faire dans des conditions inhumaines et humiliantes. Il faut q ue les divorces aient lieu dans les meilleures conditions. Il ne faut pas penser que la rupture de la vie commune pour l'\u00e9pouse ne soit qu'un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de rejet pour toute une ou cette jouissan ce partag\u00e9e entre eux - de la fixation de la pension alimentaire et des frais des tribunaux. Il est aussi tout c concern\u00e9es, et surtout de la femme au sujet de sa vie priv\u00e9e, avant que les proc\u00e9dures ne soient e nclench\u00e9es en cour. La garantir ce processus. The first amendment provides for dissolution of mar riage by mutual consent. A divorce may be obtained pour rupture de la vie commune for a period of five years, and when there has been an established faute by one partner. But the new amendment now allows for new safeguards. For example, a period of two years sho uld elapse since the celebration of the marriage before the parties can seek a divorce. Th e second amendment talks about the reduction of five to three years the period of separation req uired for a judicial separation on the ground of rupture de la vie commune, as this is viewed, Mr Speaker, Sir, being long and creating hardship for people whose marriages have genuinely broken do wn. Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, we pay great respect to women in this country. We have al ways been saying that their rights should be safeguarded. Any law on divorce should preserve th e stability of the marriage, but a piece of legislation that cannot allow sorting out matters m ore cordially with the minimum bitterness, minimum distress and humiliation remains for me per sonally a failure. It will be less hectic to look for the parties' whereabouts and no need to is sue summons time and again to parties, as a new amendment is made to cancel any preliminary hea ring following the presentation of a petition. This will inevitably speed up proceeding s for both parties and, more importantly, not creating hardship to the parties, especially their children. On ne peut leur faire pragmatique et flexi ble. This Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, makes provision for the simplification of various p rocedures relating to the elimination of a provisional order and the establishment of a permanent decree. I believe that this has always been a loophole in our jurisdiction. As a result of this practice from provisional decree over the years, many women have been waiting and waiting for months and 135 years before obtaining dissolution of marriage. In practice, this has been a situation whereby it created great injustice and hardship for any party to be settled as regards children, custody, visits, alimony, private belongings, sharing of properties. So, it goes that the Bill today, Mr Speaker, Sir, is most relevant to modern times, to modern le gislation. Mr Speaker, Sir, divorce must be the last resort to allow... Mr Speaker : I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Minister here. This is an amendment to the law as it exists. We are just extending and granti ng two more grounds for a person to apply for a divorce. Faute is still there; the other reasons are still there. We are not going to debate on the philosophy of divorce. We have to stick to the two grounds which have been put in the Bill, please. Mrs Bappoo : You are right, Mr Speaker, Sir, but I just wanted to say that, in general, it should not be as if it is a licence to just put an end to any marriage, because in our country we have always been promoting the concept that marriag e is an institution. Le mariage est un univers, M. le religions mariage la foi, couple... (Interruptions) Nous vu bien souvent pas mal de couples c\u00e9l\u00e9b rant... Mr Speaker : Oui, tout cela c'est pour autre forum ; ce n'e st pas encadr\u00e9 dans le Bill . If you want to educate people, you have to do it el sewhere. Otherwise, we will never finish. Mrs Bappoo : Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to add something ver y important as it concerns my Ministry. It is about the number of programmes and policies which goes according to the Government Programme, where we have to consolidate our society so that the respect of the marriage is visible. Mr Speaker : But, then, it is a general debate. Mrs Bappoo : No. I do understand, Mr Speaker, Sir. I have al ready said it in this august House, but I just want to emphasise that, through t he various programmes of the Ministry, we are 136 going to strengthen our effort, so that we can have at the end of the day the respect of this institution which we call marriage. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do believe that today we are pre senting to this House a Bill which is of very great importance, to bring equality to what cr ops up and ends as divorce among many couples. The legislation and, of course, the amend ments give hope to our country and more to the poor, to the less privileged people, et surtout les femmes les plus vuln\u00e9rables who do not have financial support. L'honorable Baloomoody vient de parler du probl\u00e8me de legal aid, je pense que ce serait des points \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9 ration pour voir comment donner un appui \u00e0 ces personnes, because long duration of proceedings, prosecution i n open cases of hearing, and blackmailing at times are constantly subject to the se sorts of problems. In fact, at times, we also see, Mr Speaker, Sir, that legal barriers have for too long been as if a hurdle, and they block the empowerment of women at risk for denunciation of pr ivacy matters. Today, this Bill brings about better proceedings, a s it has been done in the western laws; less adverse approaches to divorce settlement have recently emerged, such as mediation. I suppose that many of our brothers and sisters belie ve in mediation, and this is being taken care in our new Bill, in the amendments that are being brou ght. I would like, Mr Speaker, Sir, to say that legislation can be a powerful tool in shaping a policy response to parties, particularly women in a stressful divorce case. There are also children. They might be minors, the y might be older children of a certain age, but who endure distressful attitudes, which re flect in their behaviour among friends, among their peers at school, in society. So, when based on universally accepted human rights standards and appropriately enforced and implemented, the law can support positive gender issues, and enables individuals, particularly women, and commun ities to realise their rights without fear. Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. (6.53 p.m.) Mr R. Uteem (Second Member for Port Louis South & P ort Louis Central): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are today debating two new modes o f terminating marriage. Marriage is not only a consensual contract between two spouses. It is an institution with legal consequences and social consequences; it is t he bedrock of civilization. In many quarters, 137 marriage is considered a sacred bond, a divine cove nant, a sacrament, the meeting of two souls. There is a saying that weddings are made in heaven; people marry pour le meilleur et pour le pire . Mr Speaker: Perhaps I should remind the hon. Member that we ar e talking about divorce, and not marriage. (Interruptions) Mr Uteem: Yes. Against this background of marriage... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker, Sir, we are debating a very important... Mr Speaker: Yes, carry on. Mr Uteem: We are debating a very important Bill, because it affects the religious belief of many people in this country. Up to now, in many religions, divorce is forbidden... Mr Speaker: Can I, as a matter of clarification, ask my hon. f riend whether he is against divorce? Because he is saying that, for many relig ious communities, divorce is not in line with their faith. So, I am asking him whether he is, in fact, against divorce. If he says that he is against divorce, then he cannot speak on this amend ment, because this amendment is only extending the grounds of divorce by adding two more grounds. So, he has to speak on the two grounds which have been put in the Bill and say whe ther he agrees or disagrees with them. Mr Uteem: If Mr Speaker had allowed me thirty more seconds, he would have received the answer. It is a background... Mr Speaker: No, I am just drawing the attention of the hon. Me mber. Mr Uteem: We are in favour. On this side of the House, we a re supporting the Bill, as the Leader of the Opposition stated. The divorce a gainst the background setting out this Bill should not be seen as a licence for people to get d ivorce easily. There have to be safeguards. Mr Speaker: I stopped the Minister of Gender Equality on that. Mr Uteem: Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. The two new ways of getting divorce impose a lot of responsibility on the Judge to ascertain that the p arties have freely consented to the divorce, and 138 that there has not been pressure given on one party to accept. I think the Bill should have made it compulsory that a probation report be ordered in all cases where petition for divorce on mutual consent is entered, so that this Probation Officer would help the Judge to come and ascertain whether the consent of the parties has really been given freely or not. The Bill introduces two new consequences which auto matically from the new modes of terminating divorce in Articles 253-1 and 253-2 pro vide that chaque conse ntis \u00e0 l'autre. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is very far reaching. As a consequence of divorce by mutual co nsent or rupture de vie commune, one spouse can actually force the other spouse to retur n all the donations or the gifts that have been made. This is very far reaching, and again I would humbly ask that an amendment be brought so that this process is done under the supervision of the Judge, because at the moment nothing is said about the Judge giving his consent. It says c learly que les \u00e9poux d\u00e9cident eux-m\u00eames du sort des donations et avantages qu'ils s'\u00e9taient co nsentis in the case of divorce by mutual consent, or in the case of divorce for rupture de mariage, chaque \u00e9poux peut r\u00e9voquer tou t ou partie des donations. I think it is very important that this be under t he supervision of a Judge to protect the interests of the weaker side of the fam ily. Another consequence of the new amendment, which I t hink needs to be thought out again, is in respect to alimony. Mr Speaker, Sir, under the existing legislation, even after the termination of a wedding, there is an obligation de secours . The spouse against whom divorce has been pronounced - le fautif - has an obligation to pay alimony to the other spou se if she or he is in need, and the faulting party has the means. Unfortunately, when I see the amendment that is proposed, whereas under divorce by mutual consent i t is clearly stated at Article 238(5) that it is the parties themselves who are going to determine h ow to deal with the consequences and the Judge can intervene if the interests of the parties and the children are not protected. When we come to divorce pour rupture de mariage, under 238 alin\u00e9a 2, we see simply that ' le juge prononce le divorce et statue sur ses cons\u00e9quences. ' Blanket powers are given to the Judge and absolutely no guidance as to how the Judge is going to determine what these consequences are. Do not forget, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we are talking in a situation where the parties have not agreed among themselves on the consequence of the d ivorce. 139 What criteria will the Judge apply? Will it now tr y to see whether there is a party who is more fautif than the other? Will it go on the ground of means , whether one is wealthy or the other not so wealthy? We may have a situation, Mr Speaker, Sir, where the parties have come to an arrangement because the wife, for example, one o f the parties, was adulterous. However, in order to avoid all the stigmas relating to divorce by faute, they have agreed to s\u00e9parer, rupture de la vie commune, but the party who is not at faute have the means. In this case, the party who originally caused the disruption in la vie commune of the couple will also benefit, because that person does not have the means and the other person has the means. I think that, instead of leaving it to the Judge to resolve this dilemma of how to regulate the consequence of the divorce, it is for this House to give some indications in th is case about what criteria the Judge should apply when considering alimony. Considering children, it is easy. It will always b e the interest of the children who will prevail, but when it comes to alimony I think it is important that the law clearly states what criteria needs to be put. My friend, hon. Seetaram, touched on the other amen dment that is being brought as a consequence of the new form of divorce, namely Arti cle 262 alin\u00e9a 1, which allows the Judge, upon the request of one spouse or the Minist\u00e8re public to review the exercise de l'autorit\u00e9 parentale and also only for motif grave . I fully agree with my friend that this should no t be restricted to only motif grave, but should be extended to what is in the interest and welfare of the children. But I would go further and state why lim it it only to cases of autorit\u00e9 parentale. Why not give the Judge the power, in certain circumstan ces, to be able ex post facto, after weeks, months or years of the divorce to come back and rev isit what had been agreed to the parties in the light of new evidence, in the light of the situ ation of the parties. Again, on this Article, I would ask the House to consider extending this amen dment to cover other cases where the Judge can intervene. Mr Speaker, Sir, I would end by reiterating that th e aim is reconciliation, and all the parties should do whatever is necessary to reconcil e. The Judge, again in the amendment, is given the power to ascertain that all efforts have been made to reunite the parties. And again, I would humbly press the House to consider making it compulsory for the parties not only to talk to the Judge but to actually go to a marital counse llor and make sure that the counsellor signs a 140 report that, as professional psychiatrists, they co me to the conclusion that the marriage cannot be retrieved. Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. (7.04 p.m.) Mr Varma: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like, first of all, to tha nk and congratulate Members from both sides of the House who have parti cipated in the debates, and it is good that there is consensus in the House on the Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will, first of all, reply to wha t the hon. Second Member for Constituency No. 10 has stated in his speech. As regards the property issues and issues relating to children, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will refer the House to section 238 (2) on ' acceptation du principe de la rupture du mariage ', where it will be a requirement that le juge prononce le divorce et statue sur ses cons\u00e9 quences. As far as section 283 is concerned, divorce by mutual consent , la convention r\u00e9glant les cons\u00e9quences du divorce is clearly stated. Concerning the other point raised by the hon. Membe r on revision of disposition de la convention relative \u00e0 l'exercice de l'autorit\u00e9 parentale only for motif grave , we should leave that to the appreciation of the court, Mr Speaker, Sir. In practice, matters relating to best interest of the child are likely to be considered by the court as grave enough to justify revision. There was a point also raised by hon. Seetaram on child psychol ogist and other support mechanism, and this point was raised by hon. Baloomoody as well. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in the process of working o n a Family Court Bill, and we will need to consult different stakeholders before final ising this piece of legislation. I do agree with the point raised by the hon. Third Member for Const ituency No. 1 that we need to have a Family Court. Now we have a division of the Supreme Court , and I will request hon. Members to be patient. We are working on a draft Bill. Just to reply to what hon. Baloomoody stated on con sent, Article 238(2) clearly states volont\u00e9 libre et \u00e9clair\u00e9e . This should be read as to volont\u00e9 r\u00e9elle and le juge doit avoir acquis la conviction que la volont\u00e9 est r\u00e9elle. The law provides that the Judge has to be satisfi ed to the highest standard and not just have a reasona ble belief that the volont\u00e9 est r\u00e9elle, and that 141 there is no coercion or pressure. Therefore, the J udge will assess and put such questions, as may be required, and may even question each spouse sepa rately, then both together. As far as the point raised on legal aid by the hon. Third Member for Constituency No. 1 is concerned, the hon. Member will appreciate that we have circulated a green paper on the reforms to be brought to the legal aid system, and the public was invited to give their comments. In fact, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, I am having consultations with the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Chambre des notaires precisely on the reforms to be brought to the lega l aid system. I will request again the hon. Member a nd other Members of the House to be patient, because we are currently working on the reforms to be brought to the Legal Aid Act. The other point being raised on the common attorney , Mr Speaker, Sir, section 238(3) states - avou\u00e9 choisi d'un commun accord. \u00bb It is clear that the discretion is there. The poin t being raised is precisely as far as legal aid is concerned, but I have informed the House that we are working on the reforms to the Legal Aid Act. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as the point raised about t he institution of marriage is concerned, I stated in my speech that we have tried to strike th e right balance in preparing this piece of legislation, and I clearly stated that our law on d ivorce does not undermine the institution of marriage. The Probation Report, Mr Speaker, Sir, should be co mpulsory in some cases to see if the volont\u00e9 is r\u00e9elle . It should be left to the discretion of the Judge , who has to enquire and ascertain if the volont\u00e9 is r\u00e9elle . The Probation Report may not be necessary in all cases, Mr Speaker, Sir. As far as the joint autorit\u00e9 parentale is concerned, this is a matter which we will have t o discuss. These are the points which have been raised by the hon. Members of the House, Mr Speaker, Sir, to most of which I have replied. Question put and agreed to. 142 Bill read a second time and committed . COMMITTEE STAGE (Mr Speaker in the Chair) The following Bills were considered and agreed to - (a) The Code Civil Mauricien (Amendment) Bill (No. XV o f 2010) (b) The Divorce and Judicial Separation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (No. XXIV of 2010) On the Assembly resuming with Mr Speaker in the Cha ir, Mr Speaker reported accordingly.

Members on my list, and we have 30 minutes to accommodate all tho se Members. RADIER DE MACOND\u00c9 - REINSTATEMENT Mr A. Ganoo (First Member for Savanne & Black River ): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that there are many other Members who will in tervene. I just wanted to raise a matter concerning hon. Minister Bachoo, who is responsible for public infrastructure. It concerns le vieux radier de Macond\u00e9, M. le pr\u00e9sident. 143 Avant la construction du nouveau pont de Macond\u00e9, c '\u00e9tait le vieux radier Noire le sud ouest. Ce vieux radier a fait son temps M acond\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conceptualis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Je ne vais pas faire s'est du de la r\u00e9gion de Baie du Cap, Choisy, St Martin et Bel Ombre. C'\u00e9tai t devenu un jardin, un boulevard, un parcours de sant\u00e9, un jogging track et un lieu de pr\u00e9dilection pour les p\u00eacheurs qui s 'y rendaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Malheureusement, autorit\u00e9s - je le minist\u00e8re des infrastructures publiques - sont honorable et de r\u00e9parer ce radier. My appeal today to the hon. Minister, who is a reas onable Minister, is to see to it that his Ministry... (Interruptions ) The Minister knows that I always appeal to him. So metimes he does not respond, sometimes he does, but I am sure this time he will see to it tha t this radier is reinstated into its former state to the satisfaction of all the members of the area. Thank you. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo): Mr Speaker, Sir, I should have a look at it, but a s far as I am aware, that radier had become a problem and that was the reason why m y Ministry had taken the decision to remove it. Nevertheless, I am going to enquire into it and let the hon. Member know. ALBION PHARE - BELLE VUE HOTEL 144 Mr R. Bhagwan (First Member for Beau Bassin & Petit e Rivi\u00e8re): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise an issue concerning the Ministr y of Local Government and Outer Islands and the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping. There is an old hotel called l'h\u00f4tel Belle Vue at Albion Phare, which has been unused for years and years. It has become a rep\u00e8re for drug trafficking, prostitution and all sorts o f evils. So, I am appealing to the Minister of Local Governm ent to look into this matter with the District Council. People of the region and me, whe n I was in Government, have tried for many years to find the relevant legislation. This build ing is also a danger to the people in the surroundings. It must be pulled down within the le ast possible time. So, could the Minister of Local Government see with the District Council abou t what type of legislation exists, together with the Ministry of Public Infrastructure which ha s a say as far as buildings are concerned, to have immediate action taken not only in the interes t of the public at Albion, but also the public at large who go to Albion Phare? Thank you. The Minister of Local Government and Outer Islands (Mr H. Aim\u00e9e): I will surely take up the matter with the District Council. VOLCY POUGNET STREET & DR. A. G. JEETOO HOSPITAL - SEWERAGE Mr R. Uteem (Second Member for Port Louis South & P ort Louis Central): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a matter concerning the hon. Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and Public Utilities on a problem at Volc y Pougnet Street and the vicinity of Dr. A. G. Jeetoo Hospital. Following the renovation of the hospital, there hav e been complaints regarding sewerage. I think that the Wastewater Authority has put certa in pipes and when there is heavy rain, it causes overflow, and there is a very strong smell w hich is incommoding the inhabitants. Could the hon. Deputy Prime Minister take the matter up w ith the Wastewater Authority to see to it that the necessary is done, so that this does not cause nuisance to the public in that region? The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and P ublic Utilities (Dr. R. Beebeejaun) : Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already visited the place on several occasions, and remedial measures are being considered. It is not only about Dr. Jeetoo Hospital, but about the whole surroundings, where there have been construct ions on the natural drains and sewer 145 network. So, I would make a plea that the problems are not only due to renovation of the hospital. PAILLES - WATER ACCUMULATION Mr V. Baloomoody (Third Member for GRNW & Port Loui s West): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the Minister responsible for the National Development Unit with regard to accumulation of rainwater at Pailles , more specifically behind the Livestock Feed Company, where not only there is a football ground but the weekly fair is held every Sunday. There is, in fact, a drain there, but I understand that the topography does not meet the needs, as it is either too high or too low. Whenever it rains, there is water accumulation, and this creates considerable inconvenience not only to the youth wh o want to play on the football ground, but also to the inhabitants and the vegetable sellers o f that fair on Sundays. So, would the hon. Minister look into the matter? Thank you. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo) : I will look into it, Sir. CUREPIPE/HIGHER PLAINES WILHEMS - WATER SUPPLY Mr S. Obeegadoo (Third Member for Curepipe & Midlan ds) : M. le pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais me faire la voix de mes mandants, parti culier les habitants les gens qu i ne peuvent pas cuisiner, qui ne peuvent pas se doucher apr\u00e8s une longue journ\u00e9e de travail, qui ne peuvent pas faire la vaisselle et qui ne peuvent pas laver le linge. Je la r\u00e9gion qui est desservie Vacoas. Voil\u00e0 o\u00f9 se probl\u00e8me, tout le monde sait que le de Mar c'est la r\u00e9gion de l'\u00eele il y a la plus forte pluviosit\u00e9. Nous avons eu... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : Non, excusez-moi! Please, the hon. Member cannot make a speech. I said that I have 14 Members who want to intervene. Give them an opportunity! The hon. Member should make his point. Mr Obeegadoo : Je termine, M. le Montagne Longue. Mr Speaker: No, I am sorry. The issue concerns water supply i n Plaines Wilhems, Vacoas and Moka. The hon. Member has to restrict h imself to that and the issue of water. Mr Obeegadoo : Nous avons des probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 La Vanille, La et demande qu'il n'y ait des d\u00e9ra pages. The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and P ublic Utilities (Dr. R. Beebeejaun) : Several points have been raised, Mr Speaker, Sir. The problem at La Vanille, La Reunion was settled last night. It was a leakage i n a pipe, which was within a solid concrete structure and detected with difficulty. But that i s not the issue. Concerning the issue in question, the hon. Member has said it. There is a problem at Mare aux Vacoas, and it is not a small problem. We are at 45% storage level when it shoul d have been about 80%. Seven hours of water supply is not negligible. We have to make som e efforts. There are some places which have four hours. (Interruptions) Yes, this is the situation! 147 (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : Order! Let the hon. Deputy Prime Minister answer! Dr. Beebeejaun: Yes, this is the situation in Mare aux Vacoas. Th ere are other regions where they have 18 or 24 hours water supply, depend ing on availability. The hon. Member is quite right. It is in the Mare aux Vacoas region. We are going to bring more water to Mare aux Vacoas, and we will make sure that we have water fo r the next 12 months as well. Thank you. (7.23 p.m.) POINTE AUX SABLES - COMPLEX GUILLARD - SEWERAGE SYS TEM Mrs A. Navarre-Marie (First Member for GRNW & Port Louis West) : Merci, M. le pr\u00e9sident. Je voudrais intervenir p\u00e9riode... Dr. Kasenally : Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order. The hon. M ember called me 'bachiara'. I can tell him that I am no ' bachiara'. (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : Who is the hon. Member? I did not hear it. I wa s concentrating on my paper and listening to the hon. Member. What happe ned? What is the incident? Hon. Minister Kasenally, what is the incident? Tell me what happ ened. You have to tell me who said it! Tell me! I will act. Dr. Kasenally : I just passed a remark to my friend. Mr Speaker : No! Tell me who is the person! Dr. said: \" zot is what I said. \"Amerde dimoune\" is not as lethal as... (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : No! Who is the hon. Member the hon. Minister is referring to? Dr. Kasenally : Hon. Baloomoody as usual! 148 (Interruptions) Mr Speaker : Hon. Baloomoody! Mr Baloomoody: The hon. Minister... Mr Speaker: No! Let me finish! I am on my feet. Is the hon. Member aware of how he creates problems in this House? We have another te n Members on the list, and we are wasting our time. Hon. Baloomoody, the hon. Minister has r aised a point of order saying that you have called him ' bachiara'. Did you call him a ' batiara' ? If you did, you should withdraw the word. Mr Baloomoody : I was not addressing myself to him. He was sayin g \"zot pe amerde dimoune sa bane la\" . I was talking to my friend. I used the word ' bachiara', but it was not addressed to him. Mr Speaker : If it was not addressed to him, be satisfied on t hat! (Interruptions) We leave it to him and to his conscience! Mrs Navarre-Marie: M. le pr\u00e9sident, je voudrais existe \u00e0 la rue Caverne et \u00e0 la ru e Odette Ernest. Je fais un pressant Merci, M. le pr\u00e9sident. The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and P ublic Utilities (Dr. R. Beebeejaun) : Mr Speaker, Sir, I will certainly look into the matter. (7.26 p.m.) CAMP LEVIEUX - NHDC - GRASS CUTTING Mr D. Nagalingum (Second Member for Stanley & Rose Hill) : Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise an issue that concerns both the Ministry of Housing and Lands and the 149 Ministry of Local Government. It concerns the NHDC at Camp Levieux, and I guess that this is the case in all the NHDC sites. Grass has not been cut for several months. To prevent health hazards like Chikungunya and other diseases that ca n spring up in these places, I appeal to both the Ministers of Housing and Lands and Local Govern ment to come up with a sort of permanent agreement so that grass be cut regularly by whateve r means in the NHDC complex. The Minister of Housing and Lands (Dr. A. Kasenally ): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been to visit the site with the hon. Member. Actually, the compound of the NHDC is under the syndic or the people there. They are supposed to cut the grass; otherwise, my Ministry will go and cut grass all over the island. (7.26 p.m.) MILITARY ROAD - REPAIRS Mr A. Ameer Meea (First Member for Port Louis Marit ime & Port Louis East) : Mr Speaker, Sir, I have an issue addressed to the hon. Minister of Public Infrastructure concerning the very bad state of Military Road in Constituency No. 3. I raised that issue some time back in August 2010, and I am, therefore, raising this issu e the second time in this august Assembly. May I remind the hon. Minister that everyday hundre ds of vehicles pass along this road which links Cit\u00e9 Martial region directly to that of Boule vard Pitot at Vall\u00e9e Pitot. This road is in a very bad state due to rainfall, and several potholes hav e been formed thereat. The drains are obstructed because it is not properly maintained, a nd the inhabitants have made several representations to the Municipality of Port Louis b ut, unfortunately, nothing has been done up to now. Therefore, I am re-appealing to the hon. Mini ster to look into that matter as soon as possible. Thank you. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo) : Mr Speaker, Sir, following the site visit that we conducted together with hon. Shakeel Mohamed, works order to the tune of Rs29 m. has already been issued, and work is starting in the days to come. (7.29 p.m) 150 CHEBEL - NHDC - BUS SERVICE Mr F. Quirin (Third Member for Beau Bassin & Petit e Riviere) : M. le pr\u00e9sident, avec votre permission, je vais me r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 une de mes questions en date du 27 juillet 2010 que comme libell\u00e9 dans ma question, c'\u00e9tait a lack of proper bus service au niveau de la r\u00e9gion. Les habitants eux-m\u00eames avaient sollicit\u00e9 la NTA en jui vue d'\u00e9tendre la route 182 jusqu'\u00e0 cette r\u00e9gion, tout en assurant le service vers Rose Hill. Cela ne fut pas possible, vu l'\u00e9troitesse de la rou te et l'absence de trottoirs de la r\u00e9ponse rapidement - \"After consultation with Rose Hill Transport Servic es limited, it was finally agreed to serve the locality with 29 seater buses. On 30 Jul y 2009, the company submitted an application to operate two 29 seater buses between Rose Hill and Chebel new NHDC complex. The application has already been publishe d and will be urged ttre fin au calvaire de ces habitants. Merci. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo): Mr Speaker, Sir, the application was already publis hed, and I have now to inquire into the cause why Rose Hill Tr ansport has not taken over these routes. If Rose Hill Transport fails to take it, then I have n o alternative but to seek the support of other companies. LA LAURA & GENTILLY, MOKA - BRIDGES Mr S. Dayal (Third Member for Quartier Militaire & Moka): Mr Speaker, Sir, the point which I am going to raise concerns the Minist ry of Public Infrastructure, National Development Unit, Land Transport and Shipping, the Ministry of Local Government and Outer Islands and the Ministry of Environment and Sustain able Development. In fact, it concerns the bridges at La Laura and Gentilly, Moka, which are i n a very poor state, and I am sorry to say that they can crumble at any time. Therefore, before an ything untoward happens, I would like to 151 appeal to the hon. Minister to take urgent and imme diate action. Also, at La Laura near the bridge, at the slightest rainfall, there is an over flow of water, and same thing at Malinga. I would like the hon. Minister to attend to these problems. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, National Dev elopment Unit, Land Transport and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo): Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is aware that, in fact, site visits have been conducted, the design has been wor ked out, a sum of approximately Rs25 m. to Rs30 m. has been earmarked for the project, and I h ave announced another Rs25 m. project at Dagoti\u00e8re. We have the whole country to look after , and we cannot put all the money in one constituency. CONSTITUENCY NO. 16 - WATER SUPPLY Mrs F. Labelle (Third Member for Vacoas & Floreal): Merci, M. je souhaite que vous ne me teniez pas rigueur, M. le pr\u00e9sident, si je parle moi-aussi du probl\u00e8me y a une fourniture de sept heures. Da la plupart des r\u00e9veiller \u00e0 faire la Je vous remercie, M. le pr\u00e9sident. The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy and P ublic Utilities (Dr. R. Beebeejaun): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have looked into this matter . We have discussed it at length. If we split the hours of supply, we will have lesser p ressure in the afternoon. We allow the pressure to build up, but I will look into it and s ee whether we can improve. But I will make an appeal, as we should also learn how to store water. We have now the water tank scheme, and those who cannot afford it will be able to obtain a help. KEWAL NAGAR & OLIVIA - PAVEMENT & STREET LIGHTING 152 Mr J. Seetaram (Second Member for Montagne Blanche & GRSE): Mr Speaker, Sir, my question would concern the hon. Minister of Loca l Government and Outer Islands and the hon. Minister of Public Infrastructure , National Development Unit, Land Transport and Shipping. It concerns the new installation of stre et lighting from Kewal Nagar to Olivia. It is a danger for the public at night, as it is very dark and there are trees on both sides of the road. The public usually uses that road to travel from Kewal Nagar to Olivia back and forth and, at night, it is a problem, and there is also no pavement on eith er side of the road. I am making an appeal to the hon. Ministers to look into the matter and see whether installation of street lighting can be done in that area from Kewal Nagar to Olivia, and w hether pavements also can be put, just to avoid this risk for the public that uses that road at night, mainly around 8.00 to 9.00 when the traffic is quite consistent. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, Land Transpo rt and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not aware whether we have any other village between Kewal Nagar and Olivia. If that is not the case, it is i mpossible for us to put up a footpath. But, as far as street lighting is concerned, we will have a loo k at it. ST LOUIS AVENUE, QUATRE BORNES - 'NO ENTRY' SIGN Mr K. Ramano (Second Member for Belle Rose & Quatre Bornes): M. le pr\u00e9sident, je dol\u00e9ance de la part des l'avenue St Lo uis \u00e0 Quatre Bornes la du 'No Entry' sign invers\u00e9e, car du rond point de Jean jusqu' \u00e0 Rose Hill, il n'existe aucune entr\u00e9e pour p\u00e9n\u00e9trer la r\u00e9gion de St Louis, et cela cause pas mal d'inconv\u00e9nients aux habitants de la r\u00e9gion. The Minister of Public Infrastructure, Land Transpo rt and Shipping (Mr A. Bachoo): Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a very technical issue, an d I will have to take it up with the TMRSU. At 7.37 p.m. the Assembly was, on its rising, adjou rned to Tuesday 29 March 2011 at 11.30 a.m. WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ICTA - CHAIRPERSON 153 (No. B/2) Dr. S. Boolell (Second Member for Curepip e & Midlands) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to the Information and Communication Technology Author ity, he will, for the benefit of the House obtain from the Authority, information as to the na me of the Chairperson thereof, indicating, since 2005 to date, the (a) allowances drawn; (b) number of meetings held, and (c) number of overseas missions undertaken, giving deta ils of the expenditure incurred in relation thereto. Reply (Minister of Information and Communication Te chnology): For the period January 2005 to date, the Board of the Information and Communication Technologies Authority has had two Chairpersons, namely, Mr Dev Ramdeo Err iah for the period January to July 2005 and Mr Trilok Dwarka from 16 December 2005 to date. During the seven-month period extending from January to July 2005, Mr Erriah, the then Chairperson, drew total allowances to the tune of Rs480,410, including fees paid to him a s Chairperson of the Postal Authority and as Chairperson of the Radio Frequency Management Comm ittee, and also a travelling allowance. Mr Erriah chaired ten Board Meetings of the ICT Aut hority and six Board Meetings of the Postal Authority, and during that period of January to Jul y 2005, that is seven months, he proceeded on mission overseas on 11 occasions, involving Rs202,9 21 as cost of air tickets and Rs396,437.25 as per diem . From August to 15 December 2005, the position of Ch airperson remained vacant. Mr Trilok Dwarka was appointed Chairperson of the B oard of the Information and Communication Technologies Authority on 16 December 2005. To date, he is still the Chairperson. During the period December 2005 up to end of February 2011, he has drawn allowances to the tune of Rs6,465,209, including fe es payable to him as Chairperson of the Postal Authority, the Radio Frequency Management Co mmittee, the National Cyber crime Prevention Committee and the Staff & Remuneration C ommittee, as well as a Member of the Universal Service Fund Management Committee. The f ees also include a travelling allowance. Mr Dwarka has chaired 80 Board Meetings of the ICT Authority, 22 Board Meetings of the Postal Authority and 18 committee meetings sinc e his appointment till now. During that 154 same period, that is from December 2005 to date, he has proceeded on 23 missions overseas, involving expenditure of Rs1,521,085.00 as cost of air tickets, Rs1,396,522.56 as per diem and Rs88,293.67 as participation fee. ELECTORAL REFORMS (No. B/10) Mr A. Ganoo (First Member for Savanne & Black River) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and Ext ernal Communications whether, in regard to Electoral Reforms, he will state if he has started consultations in relation thereto and, if so, where matters stand. Reply: Electoral reform remains on our agenda. In the electoral manifesto of the l'Alliance de l'Avenir , it is mentioned that we intend to have wide consultations about electoral reform. It is also mentioned in the Government Programme of 2010-2015. Let me quote paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Government P rogramme. Para 5 - \"The Constitution we inherited from the founding fa thers of the nation has served us well. However, no matter how well our institutions may be seen to be functioning, they need to be adjusted to help the country face new ch allenges. We need a constitutional regime that will strengthen our democracy, promote nation-building and further entrench the fundamental rights and freedom of all Mauritian s\". Para 6 - \"As part of this process of constitutional review, Government will start wide-ranging consultations and will appoint a team of constituti onal experts which will assess the application of the Constitution since 1968 and cons ider the appropriate constitutional reforms, including the reform of our electoral syst em\". In my reply to PQ 1B/376 last August, I stated that the process of consultations on electoral reform has started internally. As I said before, this is not a matter upon which w e should embark lightly. There are deep implications; Rodrigues is a glaring example o f what can go wrong. 155 We need wide consultations, not just among ourselve s but also with Constitutional experts. In fact, the former Government elected in 2000 set up a Commission on Constitutional and Electoral reform under the chairmanship of Just ice Albie Sachs of the Constitutional Court of South Africa. However, nothing came out of it because of disagree ments between the partners in Government. We intend to have further consultations with Consti tutional experts both international and local. In this regard, Professor Carcassone, who is a Fren ch Constitutional expert, will be in Mauritius in mid April so that he can give us his p reliminary views on the matter. He will be given a copy of the Sachs Report as well. Once the preliminary consultations with these const itutional lawyers have taken place, then we shall be in a position to have consultation s among the different political parties in the National Assembly as well as invite the views of ot hers. Therefore, as I explained before, no precise time-f rame can be set. However, I strongly believe that if we are to embar k on electoral reform, it should not come on the eve of the next general elections in 20 15. Otherwise, it might appear as if we are changing the goal posts just prior to the general e lections. The whole purpose is to strengthen democracy not weaken it. CANDOS HILL - SPECIAL MOBILE FORCE FIRING RANGE (No. B/11) Mr K. Ramano (Second Member for Belle Ro se & Quatre Bornes) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affai rs and External Communications whether he is aware that the Special Mobile Force Firing Ra nge at Candos Hill is a source of disturbance for the residents in the surroundings and, if so, w ill he, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to wheth er consideration will be given for its delocalization. 156 Reply: In my reply to Parliamentary Question B/296 on 29 April 2008, I indicated that, in the interests of the local inhabitants and their safety, Government had decided to relocate the Gallery Range at Candos to an alternative site. Accordingly, a site has been identified in the vici nity of Midlands Dam. The new site is of an extent of about 330 arpents of State land. Out of the 330 arpents of State land, 34 arpents have been leased to La Chartreuse Tea Manufacturing Company Limited, of which some 20 arpents are being occupied by 20 metayers . Two arpents have been leased to two tea planters. The Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security is making necessary arrangements to resume possession of the State land for eventual ve sting with the Police Department. I am informed that the planning and design phases f or the construction of the Gallery Range at Midlands have been completed. Necessary f unds have already been earmarked for that purpose during this Financial Year. An Indian expert has been deputed to Mauritius for the planning and construction of the New Gallery Range. However, pending the construction of the New Galler y Range at Midlands, the Gallery Range at Candos is currently being used with six fi ring lanes instead of eight, of a range of 300 metres instead of 600 to avoid possible risks of en dangering life and property in its immediate vicinity. UNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS & CRIME - WORLD DRUG REPORT (No. B/12) Mr V. Baloomoody (Third Member for GRNW West & Port Louis West) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and External Communications whether he has taken cognizance of the latest World Drug Report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in which Mauritius has been rank ed first in Africa for the second consecutive year for drug abuse and, if so, will he state the actions Government is proposing to take to strengthen the fight against drug abuse. Reply: I have taken note of the latest edition of the Wor ld Drug Report, which was released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on 23 June 2010 where Mauritius is ranked among the countries with the highest prevale nce of opiate use in Africa. 157 I indicated to the House, in reply to Parliamentary Question 1B/272 on 13 July 2010, on this very issue that the UNODC its elf has admitted that the 2010 edition of its report presents certain limitations such as irregul arity and incompleteness in reporting by Member States; the irregular intervals at which som e Governments report may result in absence of data in some years; the lack of regular data, fo r which UNODC tries to compensate by referring to other Government sources which can inf luence the reported trend in a given year; submitted questionnaires are not always complete or sufficiently comprehensive; and the wide range of the data collected are themselves subject to limitations and biases. These factors, no doubt, affect the quality, the quantity and the com parability of information received. In the report, mention is made of Mauritius amongst countries in the region with the highest prevalence of opiate use. However, the fig ures mentioned for Mauritius in the 2010 Report date back to 2007. On the other hand, for o ther African countries with which Mauritius has been compared, figures mentioned date back to b etween 2001 and 2006. In some cases, no mention of any figures has been made in the absence of recent reliable statistics. The figures contained in the 2010 World Drug Report in respect to Mauritius do not reflect the current drug situation in the country. In fact, the figures of 2007 have been used to analyse the situation in 2010 and even the figures of 2007, they were not co llected in 2007 but in previous years. Therefore, the figures relating to Mauritius contai ned in the report are misleading. The attention of the UNODC has been drawn to the sh ortcomings contained in the report in respect of Mauritius. It is worthwhile to note that, in 2004, a Rapid Sit uation Assessment and Response and Substance Abuse carried out in Mauritius, with the assistance of a consultant from the UNODC, estimated that the number of injecting drug users i n Mauritius among those aged 15-54 years as being between 17,000 and 18,000. Another survey ca rried out in 2009, still with the assistance of the UNODC and the World Health Organisation, est imated this figure as being in the range of 5,699 to 10,444, which represents a decrease of mor e than 50% as compared to figures for the year 2004. We can safely reach the conclusion that there has been a decrease in the number of opiate drug users during the past five years. I would like to inform House that, according to the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 2011 released by the United States Department of State on 03 March 2011, the 158 country report on the situation of illicit drug tra fficking in Mauritius reveals that Mauritius is not a major producer or exporter of illegal drugs, or a transit route for drug trafficking. Moreover, in regard to money laundering and financial crimes, th e report indicates that Mauritius is in the \"Other Jurisdiction Monitored\", a category where co untries and jurisdictions observed do not pose an immediate concern. My Government recognises that the drug problem is a global challenge and poses a serious threat to health, development and security to citizens of all countries. To address this problem, a multi-dimensional strategy has been adop ted, geared towards supply and demand reduction, education, treatment and very importantl y, rehabilitation. On the supply reduction front, the Anti-Drug and Sm uggling Unit, assisted by other Units and Branches of the Police Department, the Customs Department and the Mauritius Post Limited continue to clamp down on drug traffickers with sys tematic surveillance and making optimal use of advances of technology for tracking such offende rs. We are having positive results through the repressi ve measures taken by the law enforcement agencies. The figures speak for themse lves. The number of persons arrested in connection with drug-related offences has increased from 1,504 in 2000 to 1,899 in 2010. The large quantities of illicit drugs have also been se ized, for instance, in 2010 about 3 kg of heroin, 55 kg of cannabis and 20,301 tablets of subutex wer e seized. International cooperation and coordinated action ar e needed to address the worldwide challenge posed by drug trafficking and transnation al organised crime. In this regard, effective liaison is being maintained with neighbouring count ries, regional and international organisations to ensure the exchange of intelligence and expertis e. Insofar as legislative framework is concerned, we a re coming forward shortly with a new Asset Recovery Bill, which addresses difficulties c urrently being encountered for the forfeiture of assets of drug dealers. The Bill will provide f or the recovery of assets which are proceeds or instrumentalities of crime, of terrorist property, even in the absence of a criminal conviction. On the demand reduction and prevention side, we are continuing our prevention campaigns on substance abuse in schools, the youth, in families, in work places and in the communities. 159 In regard to treatment and rehabilitation of drug a ddicts, I am informed that NATReSA, in collaboration with other NGOs, is providing such facilities through 10 centres, including two in Rodrigues. In addition, there are three drop-in centres which provide counselling and support services. These services are provided free of char ge both on a day care or on a residential basis. Moreover, the Ministry of Health and Quality of Lif e, in collaboration with the NATReSA, has put in place a comprehensive harm redu ction programme. This programme includes the Methadone Substitution Therapy and the Syringe and Needle Exchange Programme, which started in 2006. As I have repeated on many occasions, the fight aga inst the drug scourge should concern each and everyone of us. This should not be a part isan issue. We, in the Government, have the political will to combat the drug scourge but we ne ed the support and collaboration of each and everyone to guarantee success. WOMEN - DECISION-MAKING LEVEL (No. B/13) Mrs A. Navarre-Marie (First Member for G RNW & Port Louis West) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and External Communications whether, in regard to the representation of women a t decision-making level, he will state the additional measures Government proposes to take for the uplifting thereof. (Withdrawn) EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT - AMENDMENTS (No. B/14) Mrs A. Navarre-Marie (First Member for G RNW & Port Louis West) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and External Communications whether, in regard to the proposed amendments to th e Equal Opportunities Act, he will state where matters stand. (Withdrawn) TSUNAMI EMERGENCY SCHEME - NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS PL AN (No. B/15) Mr R. Bhagwan (First Member for Beau Bas sin & Petite Rivi\u00e8re) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affai rs and External Communications whether, in regard to the National Preparedness Plan under t he Tsunami Emergency Scheme, he will - 160 (a) give details of the warning systems in force as at now; (b) state whether an audit thereof has been carried out and, if so, when, and (c) indicate the initiatives, if any, Mauritius has tak en to foster Regional and International Cooperation in connection therewith. Reply: In regard to part (a) of the question, the Cyclone and Other Natural Disasters Scheme 2010-2011 issued by my Office in November la st provides for a warning system for tsunami. Under existing arrangements, Tsunami Bulletins are issued by the Mauritius Meteorological Services and are based on advisories received from the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. The warning system for tsunami consists of three st ages, namely - (i) Tsunami Watch Bulletin (ii) Tsunami Warning Bulletin (iii) Tsunami Termination Bulletin The Tsunami Watch Bulletin implies that a strong ea rthquake has occurred in a region adjacent to the Indian Ocean and the likelihood of a tsunami being generated is evoked. This bulletin is issued as a means of providing an advan ce alert to areas that could be impacted by destructive tsunami waves. Members of the public, sea-goers and fishermen, in particular, are advised not to venture out at sea or on the beach; boats should be secured ashore and vessels are advised to proceed off lagoon. The situation is clo sely monitored. Watches are updated, as and when new information is received. The Tsunami Warning Bulletin confirms that a destru ctive tsunami will affect Mauritius/Rodrigues within the next 5-7 hours. In c ase the incident point is closer to Mauritius/Rodrigues, the lead-time will be correspo ndingly lesser. Plan for the evacuation of vulnerable coastal areas will be implemented. The Tsunami Termination Bulletin is issued after co nfirmation has been obtained to the effect that there is no significant danger of tsuna mi waves hitting the coasts. 161 In regard to part (b) of the question, the Central Cyclone and Other Natural Disasters Committee under the aegis of my office is responsib le for updating the tsunami warning system after consultation with all relevant stakeholders. The Tsunami Emergency Scheme was last updated in Oc tober 2010, and was subsequently presented to Government for endorsemen t. The audit of the tsunami warning system is carried out by way of simulation exercises both with local and international stakeholders. Locally, tsunami simulation exercises are carried o ut on a regular basis and involve all stakeholders including the police, the local author ities and the Mauritius Red Cross Society. On the regional front, a case in point is the tsuna mi simulation exercise \"Indian Ocean Wave 09\" organised by the Intergovernmental Coordination Gro up for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System on 14 October 2009 for 18 countries around the Indian Ocean Rim, including Mauritius. The simulation exercise aimed at identifying weakne sses and areas for improvement, with a view to enhancing preparedness and improving coordination throughout the region. It thus provided an opportunity for the Mauritius Mete orological Services and other local stakeholders to test their operational lines of com munications, review their tsunami warning and emergency response standard operating procedures, a nd promote emergency preparedness. The feedback obtained, following this simulation ex ercise, indicated that all stakeholders in Mauritius responded in a timely manner to the wa rnings issued by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. The last audit was carried out on Wednesday 16 Marc h 2011, that is, last week, by the UNESCO Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System for Regional Tsunami Warning Cent res, in which the Mauritius Meteorological Services successfully participated. This main objective of this exercise was to validate dissemination processes for tsunami bullet in notification messages between the Regional Tsunami Watch Providers and the National Tsunami Wa rning Centres. The next exercise is due to be conducted in October 2011. 162 In regard to the last part of the question, differe nt initiatives at international and local levels have been taken to reinforce the Tsunami Eme rgency Scheme. Following my participation in the Clinton Global In itiative in 2006, I personally forwarded to the US former President Clinton an act ion plan for the setting up of a Tsunami Early Warning System in Mauritius. Under this proj ect, Mauritius was granted an overall budget of US$ 332,463, which has been used for the purchas e, installation and commissioning of tide gauges, procurement of siren and satellite communic ation systems, purchase of radios for fishers and for the training of personnel, among others. T hese items of equipment and the acquisition of the technical skills have greatly contributed to st rengthen national capacity for Tsunami Early Warning and Response Systems. During my visit to the Nanyang Technological Univer sity of Singapore in September last, I visited the Earth Observatory of Singapore, which comprises the Faculty for Catastrophe Risk Management. After discussions, I invited the Direc tor to undertake a complete risk assessment for Mauritius and Rodrigues in the event of a tsuna mi. The Director has responded positively to my request, and the Mauritius Oceanography Institut e has already submitted all relevant data to the Singapore authorities to enable them to carry o ut a Tsunami Risk Assessment for Mauritius. During my official visit to Reunion Island in Janua ry this year, the functioning of the \"Centre Op\u00e9rationel de la Pr\u00e9fecture pour la Gestio n des Catastrophes\" was presented to my delegation. Arrangements for dealing with natural catastrophes were explained. I informed the French side that a Disaster Management Centre has a lready been established in Mauritius under the responsibility of the Commissioner of Police, a nd that I looked forward to greater collaboration between the two institutions. The French side has agreed to our proposal for assi stance in the formulation of a coordinated action plan to deal with problems relat ing to natural disasters, as well as assistance in the setting up of a proper legal and institution al framework to deal with such issues. The modalities for such assistance were finalised with the \" Pr\u00e9fet de la Reunion\" during his official visit to Mauritius last week. For its part, the Indian Ocean Commission is implem enting a project \"Pr\u00e9vention et Gestion des risques et des catastrophes naturelles\" as a regional initiative for early warning system for tsunami. This project provides, inter alia, for the exchange of information, training 163 and improvement of the level of preparedness and re sponse to natural calamities, including tsunamis. With a view to further enhancing cooperation for ea rly warning arrangements for tsunami, my Office has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services. Th is MoU provides for the establishment of cooperative linkages between the Mauritius Meteorol ogical Services and the Indian Institute, especially for tsunami early warning arrangements a nd preparedness, mitigation of tsunami hazards, as well as exchange of advisories/informat ion/data necessary for tsunami warning. ROUTE DES PAMPLEMOUSSES - TRAFFIC CONGESTION (No. B/16) Mr A. Ameer Meea (First Member for Port Louis Maritime & Port Louis East) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Hom e Affairs and External Communications whether, in regard to road traffic a t Route des Pamplemousses, Port Louis from its junction with Cit\u00e9 Laval Street to the Abercrom bie Roundabout, he will state if he is aware of the acute traffic congestion thereat during peak ho urs in the morning and in the afternoon and, if so, will he, for the benefit of the House, obtain f rom the Commissioner of Police, information as to if consideration will be given for the posting o f Police Officers thereat for the monitoring thereof. Reply: I am informed by the Commissioner of Police that, during peak hours, i.e. between 07.00 and 10.00 hours and 15.00 to 18.00 ho urs, approximately 10,000 vehicles coming to and from the Northern and Eastern regions via Te rre Rouge use the stretch of Pamplemousses Street , Port Louis, from its junction with Cit\u00e9 Laval Stree t to Abercrombie Roundabout, to enter the city centre and vice versa. Consequently, the traffic is slow and even stagnant for brief intervals along this stretch of the road. It must be brought out that buses from the North an d the East form a large part of the traffic. They embark and disembark passengers at s ome four bus stops found along this stretch of the road, and there is only one bus stop with a proper lay-by off the road. Other businesses, shops, schools and the Cit\u00e9 Martial fair, found on the same stretch of the road, also add to the vehicular flow. 164 During peak hours, two police officers perform fixe d point duties along that stretch of Pamplemousses Street as follows - one at the junction of Bernardin de St Pierre Stree t from Vall\u00e9e des Pr\u00eatres, and one at the junction of Nicolay Road. In addition, two riders from the Divisional Traffic Police, and two riders from the Traffic Branch perform mobile patrols on the stretch of tha t road, as well as the adjoining roads to ensure traffic fluidity. The traffic congestion problem along that stretch r esults from the limited capacity of the road to accommodate the intensity of the traffic fl ow during peak hours, and will not be alleviated by the posting of more police officers t hereat. However, in the long term with the implementation o f the Ring Road and Terre Rouge- Verdun projects, it is forecasted that the vehicle load along this road will be reduced by some 40% resulting in a more fluid traffic. BELLE TERRE - INCIDENT - 01 MARCH 2011 (No. B/17) Mr C. Fakeemeeah (Third Member for Port Louis Maritime & Port Louis East) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and External Communications whether, in regard to the incident w hich occurred on or about 01 March 2011 at Belle Terre in the course of which two vehicles wer e destroyed by fire, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to if any Police inquiry has been carried out thereinto and, if so, the outcome thereof. (Vide reply to PNQ) POLICE FORCE - PROMOTION EXERCISE (No. B/18) Mr C. Fakeemeeah (Third Member for Port Louis Maritime & Port Louis East) asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Home Affairs and External Communications whether, in regard to the Police For ce, he will, for the benefit of the House, obtain from the Commissioner of Police, information as to the number of - (a) Police Constables (b) Police Sergeants, and 165 (c) Police Inspectors who sat for the last promotional examinations, indicating the dates thereof in each case. (Vide reply to PQ No. B/6) R\u00c9UNION ISLAND - MAURITIAN NATIONALS - VISA (No. B/21) Mr J. Seetaram (Second Member for Montag ne Blanche & GRSE) asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integrati on and International Trade whether, in regard to the visa for Mauritian nationals travelling to R \u00e9union Island, he will state if he proposes to hold discussions with the authorities in R\u00e9union Is land with a view to facilitating the procedural requirements for the obtention thereof. Reply (The Prime Minister): I wish to inform the House that, prior to 2007, Mau ritian nationals had to obtain a visa before travelling to R\u00e9union Island. My government initiated discussions with the French authorities for relaxat ion of entry requirements for Mauritian nationals, and in April 2007, the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Mauritius signed an agreement with a view to facilitating the movement of Mauritian Nationals to Reunion Island. The Agreeme nt made provisions for Mauritian nationals to be exempted from visa for a stay of 15 days in R \u00e9union Island. A maximum period of stay of 120 days was allowed in a calendar year, provided t hat there was an interval of minimum seven days between each trip. The Agreement entered into force on 01 December 2007. The following requirements have to be complied with by Mauritian nationals - (i) they must hold a valid passport for the duration of their stay in R\u00e9union Island; (ii) they must have a valid return passage ticket; (iii) they must confirm booking for hotel room or an orig inal sponsorship letter for accommodation, known as a \"certificat d'h\u00e9bergement\" ; (iv) they should have sufficient funds to meet the cost of stay, that is, a minimum daily amount of Euro 56.20 for persons staying in a hotel and Euro 28.10 for persons staying at the place of friends or relative s; (v) they must have a travel insurance cover for a minim um amount of Euro 30,000, and 166 (vi) for persons travelling on business, they need to pr oduce appropriate documentary evidence. In December 2009, the French authorities further re laxed the movement of Mauritian nationals to R\u00e9union Island, whereby the traveller is entitled to a stay of three months in a period of six months. I understand that the difficulty faced by some Maur itian nationals travelling to R\u00e9union Island is that they produce to the immigration auth orities in R\u00e9union Island only a copy of the \"certificat d'h\u00e9bergement\" and not the original one. In the absence of the o riginal document, the Mauritian national is not granted authorisation to enter R\u00e9union Island and is sent back to Mauritius. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integrati on and International Trade has approached the \"Pr\u00e9fet de la R\u00e9union\" for greater flexibility in the implementation of e ntry requirements for Mauritian nationals. Also, during my visit in R\u00e9union Island in January last, new synergies for greater cooperation have been created at the highest level. It is proposed to open a Consulate-General of Mauritius in R\u00e9union Island with a view to further enhancing relations between the two sister islands and addressing consular issues in a more ef fective manner. In this context, a \"Groupe de contact\" has been set up comprising high officials from R\u00e9union Island and Mauritius which will discuss imp ortant bilateral issues. The first meeting of the \"Groupe de contact\" was held in Mauritius on 14 March 2011 and has amo ngst other things established a sub-committee to look at the facilita tion of movement of people between our two islands as well as cooperation for marketing jointl y our two islands as a complementary tourist destination. The issue of 'certificat d'h\u00e9bergement\" will be again taken up by the sub- committee. LA FONDATION POUR LA FORMATION DU FOOTBALL - FUNDS (No. B/46) Mr F. Quirin (Third Member for Beau Bass in & Petite Rivi\u00e8re) asked the Minister of Youth and Sports whether, in regard to La Fondation pour la formation du football , he will give details of the present financial sit uation of the Fondation , indicating the - (a) funds raised, and 167 (b) expenses incurred in projects, since the settin g up thereof. Reply: The Fondation pour la Formation du Football is a charitable Trust duly registered according to the Trust Act 2001 and is n ot accountable to my Ministry. However, upon my request, the Chairman of the Fondation has given the following information - (i) as at date, the Foundation has raised Rs11 m. since its creation in 2008; (ii) the above amount has been spent in financing nation al projects for the development of football in general, including - (a) setting up of around 70 Ecoles de foot , 13 regional technical centres and one national technical centre, known as the Centre Technique National Francois Blaquard ; (b) supply of football equipment, and (c) organising regular competitions for our young f ootball players. EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS ACT & EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT - AMENDMENTS (No. B/47) Mr V. Baloomoody (Third Member for GRNW & Port Louis West) asked the Minister of Labour, Industrial Relations and Em ployment whether, in regard to the proposed amendments to the Employment Rights Act and Employm ent Relations Act, he will state where matters stand. Reply: I would like to refer the hon. Member to the reply made to PQ 1B/625, wherein I informed, among others, that the proposals received from stakeholders in the context of the amendments to be brought to the labour legislation were being examined at the level of my Ministry. This exercise has already been completed and Government has set up a High Powered Committee under the chairpersonship of the Deputy P rime Minister and Minister of Energy and Public Utilities to re-examine the proposals receiv ed. Once the High Powered Committee completes its assignment, consultations will be hel d with relevant stakeholders at the level of the National Tripartite Forum prior to the introduction of the amendment Bills into the National Assembly. MOGAS & DIESEL - PRICE 168 (No. B/48) Mr K. Li Kwong Wing (Second Member for B eau Bassin & Petite Rivi\u00e8re) asked the vice-Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Economic Development whether, in regard to the retail price of mogas and diesel respectively, he will state - (a) the absolute and percentage increase in the rupee a mount per litre that has been caused by the Budget measures in respect of excise duty and VAT; (b) the percentage contribution of Government taxes, le vy and non-operational charges to the rupee price per litre, and (c) whether it is proposed to reduce the excise duty an d VAT or any other charges on petroleum products and, if not, the reasons therefo r. Reply: In the 2011 Budget, the rates of excise duty on mog as and on diesel were increased, but not the rate of VAT. The increase in excise duty on mogas was Rs1 a litr e, whilst the increase for diesel was 30 cents. In addition, the MID levy on those produ cts was increased by 15 cents. In respect of mogas, the current retail price is hi gher than the pre-budget price by Rs6.60 for each litre. Allowing for VAT, the total increa se in taxes on a litre of mogas after the budget measure is Rs1.32 only. Thus, only 20% of the incr ease in the price of mogas is due to budget increase in government taxes. In respect of diesel, the retail price has increas ed by Rs8 per litre against the pre-budget price, whilst total increase in taxes, including co nsequential impact on VAT, amounts to 52 cents only. Thus, the tax measures have contributed to o nly 6.5% in the increase in the retail price. Regarding part (b) of the question, the percentage contribution of government taxes, levy and non-operational charges to the retail price per litre has in fact fallen since the Budget. For mogas, it is currently at 47%, compared to 49% prior to 2011 budget. For diesel, the percentage contribution is presentl y 36% against 39% before the 2011 budget. As regards part (c) of the question, the reply is n o. The House should be aware that the rates of excise duty on mogas and diesel have remained fixed in rupee terms at Rs9.80 and Rs3.00 respectively for nearly a decade now, that is, 169 since 15 June 2002. During the period 2002 to 2010 , cumulative inflation has been 67%, which has led to significant erosion in the real value of tax collection. As a careful and responsible government, we have however adjusted the rate by on ly 10% in the last Budget. Before 15 June 2002, excise duty was levied on an ad valorem basis, at the rates of 150% for mogas and 25% for diesel. In other words, the rupee amount of excise duty was not constant but varied with the import price of those petroleum products. On that basis, had the excise duty structure not been kept in constant rupee terms, th e weight of excise duty on the retail price of mogas would not have been at 21% currently but woul d have been 48%. Likewise, for diesel, the burden would have been 25% instead of the curre nt 7.6%. Regarding VAT, as the hon. member is aware, it has been levied at a single rate, irrespective of the good or service, since its intr oduction in 1998; and even before that date, under the Sales Tax. There is no plan to bring any change to that long-standing policy. CWA - BOARD MEMBERS (No. B/49) Mr G.

Obeegadoo (Third Member for Curepi pe & Midlands) asked the Minister of Education and Human Resources whether, in regard to the Sixth Form classes and the HSC course of study, he will state - (a) the reasons behind the decision for lowering the en try requirement thereto, indicating when the decision was announced, and (b) whether GCE \"A\" Level in two subjects is now being considered as an alternative. Reply: As the House is aware, the Government Programme 201 0-2015 underscores the need to improve access to upper secondary education through the establishment of new and innovative pathways either in the academic or techn ical/vocational stream for students who have successfully completed School Certificate/GCE 'O' L evel. The implementation of this measure involves the pro vision of new opportunities for a greater number of students to access upper secondar y and post-secondary education, by introducing more flexibility in the system without compromising on the quality of education and its outputs. 171 Prior to 2011, the criteria applicable for promotio n to Lower Six and which were based on 4 credits at School Certificate/G.C.E 'O' Level was a constraint to many students who were denied the possibility of having access to H.S.C/G. C.E 'A' Level Studies, in our secondary schools. However, under the previous formula, stud ents having 3 credits at S.C/G.C.E 'O' Level were exceptionally allowed to be promoted to Lower Six only in the following circumstances - (i) in the event of a repeat at Form V level, they woul d thereafter be disqualified by virtue of their age for promotion to Lower Six that is, they should not have reached the age of 19 on 01 January in the year the y are admitted to Lower Six; (ii) in case they have already repeated Form V and becau se of internal rules, they cannot repeat more than once. This constraint faced by many students having 3 cre dits had to be addressed holistically in as much as seats were available in both State an d private secondary schools in the relevant subject combinations offered. The criteria had, therefore, to be reviewed such th at all students having passed SC/GCE 'O' Level with 3 credits be allowed to join Lower S ix, subject to their satisfying the requirement for subject combination as well as the age criterio n. In parallel with this strategic decision, we are ad vising students to further improve their 'O' Level qualification by sitting for the SC/GCE ' O' Level exams preferably while being in Lower Six. As Members may be aware, a policy announcement was made in early 2010 on the provision of increased opportunities for students t o follow HSC programs. Following a Government decision on 28 January 2011, the new cri teria were formalised. This measure will further facilitate access to educ ation at post-secondary and tertiary levels in line with our vision to have a Gross Tert iary Enrolment Ratio (GTER) of 72% in 2015. It is worthwhile mentioning that most universities accept admission with 2 'A' Levels, and it is increasingly becoming a worldwide trend. I am plea sed to inform the House that this new measure has benefited more than 1500 students havin g less than 4 credits and who have been promoted to Lower Six. 172 With regard to part (b), the major concern is to ob viate the wastage of precious human resources and improve efficiency in the system. We have come across a number of cases whereby students, despite having met the minimum re quirements for promotion to Lower Six, are not eligible for any subject combination in the ir school by virtue of their results. As a result, under the previous conditions these st udents would have had to repeat Form V or else, leave the school in case they had alread y repeated the class or were over-aged. With a view to offering such students the opportuni ty to obtain 'A' Level qualifications in a minimal number of subjects, it has been decide d to review the current practice and allow them exceptionally to join Lower VI with 2 subjects at 'A' Level, 2 subjects at Advanced Subsidiary (AS) level and General Paper. These students are being allowed to sit for at leas t 2 subjects at Principal Level. As for students who have passed in 2 subjects at GCE 'A' L evel, their qualification is equivalent to the same 2 subjects offered at HSC Level. The House would appreciate that, failing to usher i n this measure, would have deprived many of our students with three credits of the oppo rtunity to follow HSC classes and ultimately have access to post-secondary or tertiary education . We believe that the majority of these students come from deprived areas or from needy fam ilies. Education is in fact their major leverage to ensure upward social mobility. Hence, denying these students the possibility of promotion to Lower Six may further push them deeper into poverty instead of empowering them which is the primary mission of education. I wish to reiterate that the criteria for having a minimum number of credits are not per se a requirement of Cambridge. It was rather a decisi on taken administratively years ago, in view of a limited number of seats available in Lower VI in those days. Today, the situation has changed, and now that we h ave more than enough seats, there is no reason why students, especially the needy, shoul d be deprived of such opportunities.

Reply: I am informed by the Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Fund that the Chairperson of the Board is not entitled to a chauffeur driven car. However, as hon. Members of the House may be aware, the Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Fund (SILWF) operates 130 Community Centres across the island. As it has always been the practice in the past, the Chairperson is called upon to attend activities and functions which are regularly organi sed in these centres for the local community. Moreover, the Chairperson has to attend meetings at the SILWF and the parent Ministry, as well as site visits. With a view to facilitating the responsibilities of the Chairperson, the Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Fund has traditionally put a chauffe ur driven car at his disposal, as and when required. Overtime allowances paid to the driver who has conv eyed the Chairperson for the period January 2007 to February 2011 are as follows - S/N Month/Year Rs (i) January-December 2007 105,672.92 (ii) January-December 2010 117,589.04 (v) January-February 2011 24,110.62 It is to be noted that overtime allowances paid to the driver is calculated on hours worked and his salary, which has increased with the Pay Re search Bureau (PRB) Report of 2003 and 2008.

Reply: I am informed that the existing lay-by located in front of Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9 State Secondary School is already being used by the dedic ated school buses catering for students attending that school. Given that this lay-by has been constructed within the school premises, for the purpose of alighting and boarding of Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9 SSS stud ents exclusively, and for their own convenience, the question of converting it into a p ublic bus stop cannot be considered on safety grounds.

Reply: 39 families occupying State land at Cit\u00e9 La Cure ( behind the National Housing Development Company) were granted a building site l ease over the subject in August 2005. Prior to the finalisation of the lease agreements, it was found that the site at Cit\u00e9 La Cure is prone 180 to flooding during heavy rainfall due to its proxim ity to Latanier River. Hence, in 2008, Government decided to relocate these 39 families to Karo Kalyptis, Batterie Cass\u00e9e, Roche Bois for security reasons. The plot allocation at Karo Kalyptis, Batterie Cass \u00e9e, Roche Bois is expected to be finalised soon. MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - PRIV ATE OFFICE (No. A/11) Mr G.

Reply: Construction works at the sport complex at Harris S treet have been temporarily stopped due to abandonment of site by the contracto r. In fact, due to unsatisfactory performance of the c ontractor, my Ministry had notified him of its intention to terminate his contract unless a ll works are completed by 31 Dec 2010. Thereafter, the contractor submitted a revised prog ramme of work with 15 March 2011 as completion date. However, as at that date, the contractor had failed to complete all outstanding works claiming inclement weather as justification and is absent on site. My Ministry has therefore already initiated action to terminate the contract. The outstanding works will now be entrusted to dist rict contractors of the Ministry of Public Infrastructure, NDU, Land Transport & Shippi ng.

Reply: As regards part (a) (i), the number of old age pens ioners, i.e. those above 60 years of age, as at end-December 2010 was estimated by th e Central Statistics Office at 153,179. As for part (a) (ii), according to the CSO, the num ber of workers in the private sector and in the public sector (i.e. central government, para statal bodies, local authorities and Rodrigues Regional Assembly) as at end-December 2010 respecti vely is as follows - Monthly Salary Range (Rupees) No of employees 183 Private Sector Public Sector Up to 5,000 83,600 940 5,001 to 12,000 153,200 Total 324,000 99,870 As regards part (b), it has always been the practic e to provide the yearly wage compensation on the basis of loss of purchasing pow er for the preceding financial year. For the financial year 2010, the rate of inflation estimated by the CSO at the time of tripartite discussions was 2.7%. In spite of the di fficult economic times, Government has in 2011 provided compensation at the rate of 3.2% for all t hose earning up to Rs5,000 per month, which is well above the inflation rate. The same higher rate of compensation of 3.2% has b een granted to all old age pensioners and all recipients of basic invalidity pensions, ba sic widows' pension and social aid. For any loss in the purchasing power in the current financial year, compensation will be determined by the National Tripartite Mechanism for implementation as from 01 January 2012.
