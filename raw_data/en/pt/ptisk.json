The abdomen is divided into three sections: anterior, flanks, and posterior. The peritoneum is a smooth, serous membrane that covers abdominal structures and lets the viscera move withi n the abdomen without friction. o Intraperitoneal solid organs include the liver, spleen, and gallbladder. o Retroperitoneal solid organs include the kidneys and pancreas. o Hollow abdominal organs include the stomach and the small and large intestines . o Hollow genitourinary structures include the bladder and ureters. o Vascular structures include the abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, renal arteries, and inferior vena cava. Assessment Clues to a potential abdominal injury may come from the patient's report of symptoms, history, mechanism of injury, and assessment findings. o Abdominal pain, rigidity, guarding, or spasms are classic symptoms of abdominal injury. Pain may also be referred to the shoulder. o The m echanism of injury, such as blunt or penetrating trauma, a motor vehicle crash , or a fall, can suggest abdominal injury. In abdominal injury, inspection may reveal asymmetric chest wall movement, abdominal distention or other abnormal co ntour, and abdominal bruises, abrasions, or lacerations. Auscultation may detect absent bowel sounds, bowel sounds in the thoracic cavity, or an abdominal bruit. Palpation may uncover pain, rigidity, tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, fullness or a doughy consistency, crepitus, or pelvic instability. Initial Stabilization and Emergency Department Interventions For a patient with abdominal or genitourinary trauma, first secure the airway, breathing, and circulation. Start two large -bore intravenous ca theters and administer fluids, blood products, analgesics, and antibiotics, as ordered. Obtain specimens for baseline laboratory tests. Perform additional interventions in the emergency department: o Unless the patient has signs of urethral damage, insert a urinary catheter to monitor urine output. o Insert a gastric tube to decompress the stomach. o Admit the patient for surgery or observation or provide discharge instructions. If the patient's condition permits, prepare for diagnostic evaluation, as ordered. o Common tests include radiography, computed tomography, focused assessment sonography in trauma peritoneal lavage , and exploratory laparoscopy . o Other imaging studies resonance imaging, retrograde urethrography, cystography, arteriography, and intravenous pyelography. o If the patient is too unstable for imaging studies, prepare for exploratory surgery and hemorrhage control. o Obtain specimens for additional laboratory tests, as indicated.

LESSON OUTLINE Specific Abdominal Injuries Splenic injury commonly results from blunt trauma, as in falls and motor vehicle crashes . It causes left upper quadrant pain, Kehr sign, and significant hemodynamic instability. Splenic injuries are graded by severity. Stable patients are managed nonoperatively. Surgery is reserved for unstable patients. Liver injury may result from blunt or penetrating trauma and causes right upper quadrant pain and bruising and referred pain in the right shoulder. Major hepatic damage almost always causes hemodynamic instability. Hepatic injuries are graded by severity, which helps determine the need for surgery. More than 50 percent of adults with liver injury receive nonoperative treatment. Stomach injury usually occurs with penetrating trauma and multio rgan, multisystem injuries. It causes left upper quadrant pain, abdominal muscle rigidity, gross blood in gastric aspirate, and free air on abdominal radiography. Intestinal injury can result from blunt or penetrating trauma, which can lead to intestinal r upture and peritoneal contamination. It causes abdominal tenderness and rigidity, crepitus, and signs of peritoneal contamination. Surgery is required. Pancreatic injury is likely to result from penetrating retroperitoneal trauma. It causes epigastric or back pain, Cullen sign, and an altered lipase level. When surgery is needed, the pancreas is preserved as much as possible. Diaphragmatic rupture may stem from blunt or penetrating trauma. It causes respiratory compromise, bowel sounds in the chest, cardiac compression, and radiography that shows abdominal contents in the chest. Immediate surgery is required. Vascular injury can result from blunt or penetrating trauma. Hemorrhage can lead to metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. Without surgical repair, severe hemorrhage and death can occur. o Foreign bodies in the stomach or rectum result from ingestion and other causes. In body packing, a condom or other drug wrapper can rupture, causing toxic effects. Depending on the foreign body's size, shape, and location, removal may occur in the emergency department or surgical suite. Specific Genitourinary Injuries Most genitourinary injuries result from blunt force and are no t immediately life threatening. Renal injury causes flank or abdominal tenderness, Grey Turner sign, a mass or hematoma over the flank, and hematuria. Renal injuries of grade I to III do not usually require surgery. Higher grades may require nephrectomy. Ureteral injury rarely occurs but may result from penetrating trauma. Consider this injury in any trauma patient with worsening abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, or an unexplained fluid collection. Surgical repair is needed. Bladder injury typically is associated with pelvic injuries from motor vehicle crashes , falls, and physical ass aults. It may cause hematuria, suprapubic pain, an inability to urinate, localized bruising, abdominal distention, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture requires exploratory laparotomy and repair. Extraperitoneal inju ry needs bl adder drainage only.

LESSON OUTLINE Urethral injury mainly affects men. Posterior -segment injuries are related to pelvic ring fractures. Anterior -segment injuries result from external blunt or straddle mechanisms. Manifestations include blood at the meat us; localized pain, swelling, and bruising ; a high -riding prostate gland; and hematuria. Most injuries require cystostomy and injury repair. Urethral foreign bodies usually result from self -insertion. Common complaints include dysuria, pain, discharge, hematuria, swelling, or abscess formation. Management calls for removing the foreign body and treating complications. Penile injury commonly takes the form of a fracture. Manifestations include a popping sound followed by pain, swelling, and rapid detumesc ence. Surgery is essential to prevent deformity, impotence, and other complications. Testicular injuries include contusion, hematocele, rupture, dislocation, and torsion. Findings may include severe scrotal pain, swelling, and bruising . Apply ice and provi de analgesics while the patient awaits urologic consultation. Straddle injury occurs when a patient falls and takes the brunt of the fall on the perineum. Treatment calls for laceration repair and hematoma evacuation and drainage. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Individuals with serious mental illnesses are more likely than other individuals to use the emergency department. According to the Emergency Nurses Association position statement, patients with mental illness or substance abuse disorders should receive care that is safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable, and patient -centered. Patient Management Perform a focused medical assessment that includes vital signs; medical, mental health, substance abuse, psychosocial, social, and environmental histories; cognitive examination; visual inspection; and specimen collection for screening tests. Perform a mental status examination. Note appearance, activity level, behavior, speech, attitude toward the interviewer, level of consciousness, thought content, affect and mood, cognition, reality contact, memory, and confidence in the in formation given. Behavioral Health Disorders Agitation may cause restlessness, physical aggression, purposeless motor behavior, and heightened arousal. o Treatment focuses on patient stabilization and reduction of manifestations. Lorazepam (Ativan), haloperi dol (Haldol), and other drugs may be used. o Use behavioral restraints or seclusion only when other means have been exhausted or when a threat to life exists. Restraint orders must be time specific. A restrained patient requires continuous face -to-face obser vation and assessment every 15 minutes. Anxiety is a complex feeling of apprehension, fear, and worry often accompanied by pulmonary, cardiac, and other physical sensations. It may be mild or severe. o Because anxiety can mimic other disorders, obtain specimens to rule out metabolic disorders; use chest radiography and electrocardiography to rule out cardiopulmonary disorders; and obtain MRI or CT scans to check for an organic brain disorder, as ordered. o Treat acute anxiety with social support, time, an d an anxiolytic, preferably a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam (Ativan). Provide reassurance in a calm, quiet room. Panic disorder is extreme anxiety with personality disorganization and a lack of functional abilities. It may occur with obsessive -compulsiv e disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, social phobias , generalized anxiety disorder, or some combination. o Because panic disorder can mimic serious medical problems, such as asthma, dysrhythmias, and metabolic problems, the physician must rule these ou t. o Manifestations include an urge to flee or escape, a str ong sense of impending doom, increased heart and respiratory rates, and other findings. Obtain specimens or prepare for diagnostic tests, as ordered. o If indicated, administer oxygen, monitor pulse oximetry, monitor cardiac function, and frequently measure vital signs. Explain the cause of panic disorder but remain empathetic. Don't imply that it's nothing serious. Expect to give benzodiazepines, provide a mental health referral, and if suicidal idea tion or other factors warrant, arrange for inpatient treatment.

LESSON OUTLINE Eating disorders typically affect young woman and may lead to starvation, self -mutilation, suicide attempt, and binging and purging, which can be life threatening. o Anorexia n ervosa is characterized by severe weight loss to the point of significant physiologic consequences. Suspect anorexia in patients who present with extreme weight loss, a history of food refusal, dehydration, and flat affect or near catatonia. Provide rehydr ation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and referra l for medical and psychiatric treatment or chemical dependency. o Bulimia nervosa is a chronic eating disorder characterized by eating binges followed by self - induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic a buse, prolonged fasting, or excessive exercise. A bulimic p atient may be a normal weight or overweight and may have muscle weakness, abdominal pain, heartburn, sore throat, muscle cramps or carpopedal spasm, chest pain, and menstrual irregularity. ED care includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, treatment of complications of vomiting or laxative use, and admission to treat severe electrolyte imbalances, dysrhythmias, or other complications. Expect a referral for psychotherapy. Grief is the normal r esponse to the perception of loss. Bereavement is the state of having experienced a significant loss. o Assessment findings aid in the differential diagnosis of grief, complicated grief, major depressive disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder. They also help differentiate physical symptoms of grief from the effects of hypothyroidism, substance abuse, medications, cardiac disease, and pulmonary disease. o For grieving individuals, provide social support, empathy, and acceptance. Teach about short - term use of benzodiazepines or sleep medications, if prescribed. Depression is a potentially life -threatening mood disorder that may lead to \u2014or be caused by \u2014 substance abuse. Suspect depression when a patient has at least five characteristic findings, such as persiste nt sadness, appetite or weight change, and fa tigue, for at least 2 weeks. o Gather assessment data to help differentiate depression from other disorders, such as alcohol abuse, chronic fatigue syndrome, drug interactions, and liver or renal failure. Use a standard tool to assess the patient's risk of suicide. o Treatment of depression may include tricyclic or cyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Risk of suicide is relatively high in ED patients. Asses s for s igns of suicide risk, such as talking about suicide, seeking lethal means to commit suicide, hopelessness, social withdrawal, anger, substance abuse, and insomnia. Standard tools for evaluating suicide risk include the Beck Depression Inventory, the SAD PERSONS scale, and the IS the PATH WARM? scale. o Your main goal is to keep the patient and staff safe. Secure all firearms, other weapons, and medications during care. Pursue the treatment goals of prompt psychological and psychiatric evaluation and referral. Bipolar disorder is characterized by unpredictable phases of euphoria or depression of varied duration, possibly with long periods of stability between them. o Manifestations of the euphoric phase include mania with rapid or pressured speech, incre ased socialization, hypersexuality, flight of ideas, flamboyance, and impulsiveness. Manifestations of the depressive phase are similar to those of clinical depression, such as slowed body movements, lack of eye contact, tearfulness, and memory loss. o Treat ment calls for medication, such as lithium (Lithobid) or clonazepam (Klonopin), and referral to a mental health or substance abuse professional.

LESSON OUTLINE Violence is great physical or emotional force, usually exerted to damage or otherwise abuse some thing or someone . Homicidal behavior is violence with the intent to kill another person. When caring for a violent patient, take measures to protect yourself and ensure patient safety. Observe for signs of escalating behavior that may lead to violence, such as a louder voice, fidgeting or verbal sounds, and buildup of energy. o To help de -escalate behavior that may lead to violence, use defusing techniques such as avoiding arguing and threatening body language, calmly but firmly outlining the limits of the setting, and reducing stimulation in the setting. Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic disorder that results in fluctuating, gradually deteriorating, or relati vely unstable disturbances in thinking, behavior, and perception. o Manifestations include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. Tests cannot diagnose schizophrenia, but may be used to rule out psycho sis due to treatments or organic disorders. o Arrange for a psychiatric consultation as soon as organic processes are ruled out. Use physical or chemical restraints, if ordered. As prescribed, administer an antipsychotic, such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) o r haloperidol (Haldol). o Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a life -threatening adverse effect of antipsychotic therapy. It may cause fever; muscle rigidity; decreased level of consciousness, blood pressure, appetite, and urine output; and increased pulse rat e and white blood cell count. o Treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome may include supportive therapy, ventilator assistance, dialysis, antipsychotic discontinuation, and administration of dantrolene (Dantrium), bromocriptine (Parlodel), or both. Substa nce abuse accounted for nearly 2 million ED visits in 2008. Substance abusers are at high risk for suicide, homicide, and overdose. Immediate treatment of withdrawal or overdose focuses on patient stabilization. Complications of substance abuse can include human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis, and abscesses. After the patient is stabilized, provide a referral to an appropriate substance abuse treatment program. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Etiology Most burns are thermal burns . They may result from scalds (the most common cause), flames (the next most common cause), flash (the third most common cause), or contact with a hot object. Electrical burns occur when electricity passes through the body and meets resistance from body tissues. They cause external burns at the entry and exit sites and extensive internal damage between these sites. Lightning flows around the body, creating a shock wave that can cause fractures and dislocations. Chemical burns denature the protein in tissues or cause cell desiccation. Although a chemical burn may appear superficial, it may actually be deep. Pathophysiology Three zones of damage occur in a burn: central zone of coagulation, zone of stasis, and zone of hyperemia. The burn's fate depends on resolution of the zone of stasis. The body responds to a burn with varying degrees of tissue damage, cellular impairment, and fluid shifts. Large burns produce a hypermetabolic state that causes many harmful derangements, including hepatic dysfunction, hypovolemia, decreased cardia c output, capilla ry leaks, central nervous system dysfunction, and renal failure. Cardiovascular changes begin immediatel y after a burn and may include massive fluid and electrolyte shifts and effects in every organ system. Burn Assessment Describe the depth of a thermal burn by the damage to the skin layers, which may be superficial, partial thickness, or full thickness. Depth is most accurately assessed 48 to 72 hours after the burn because edema formation peaks then. Use the rule of nines to estimate the e xtent of a thermal or chemical burn. Modify the rule of nines for pediatric patients. For an electrical burn, describe its extent anatomically instead. The severity of a burn depends on the extent and depth of the injury and the patient's age, concomitant injuries, smoke inhalation, and pre -existing diseases. If the burn is severe, transfer the patient to a specialized burn care center. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Smoke Inhalation Smoke inhalation (inhalation injury) is the major cause of death from fires. It is a syn drome of several problems. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the greatest killer of fire victims. Compared to oxygen, carbon monoxide has 240 times more affinity for he moglobin. This causes tissue hypoxia. The carboxyhemoglobin level determines the severity of the poisoning. Cyanide poisoning can occur during a fire and affects oxygen use. It can rapidly result in coma, apnea, cardiac dysfunction, sev ere lactic acidosis, and death. Upper airway obstruction is usually associated with facial burns that cause edema , secretions, and airway blockage at or above the vocal cords. The management of airway edema calls for early intubation or tracheostomy. Although thermal injury below the vocal cords is rare, steam or chemical inhalation may cause lower airway and lung in jury. Bronchoscopy reveals airway erythema, edema, carbonaceous debris, and ulceration. The injury may quickly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patient Management Because a burn victim may have other injuries, perform a primary survey of the pa tient, using the ABCDE mnemonic, which stands for airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure and environment. When assessing the airway , look for sig ns of respiratory distress and smoke inhalation injury. Early intubation is recommended. Admi nister antidotes, as indicated. Administer 100% oxygen to displace carbon monoxide and cyanide from their binding sites. Consider the use of hyperbaric oxygen if the patient's carboxyhemoglobin is exceptionally high. Administer a cyanide antidote, if order ed. Ensure the patient's breathing , which may be restricted by circumferential full -thickness burns of the chest. Prepare for an escharotomy if eschar limits chest expansion and prevents gas exchange. Because a burn victim has a high risk of hypovolemia, a ssess for signs of circulatory compromise . Establish one or two intravenous catheters. Calculate fluid requirements using an accepted formula, such as the Parkland or Baxter formula. Adjust the amount and type of fluid based on the patient's response. No f ormula exists for calculating fluid replacement in electrical injuries.

LESSON OUTLINE To prevent disability and the effects of exposure , remove the patient's clothing and jewelry, perform a head -to-toe assessment, assess the burn, and adjust the room temperature to prevent heat loss. Obtain specimens for blood and urine tests . Also , prepare the patient for diagnostic tests such as chest radiography, other imaging studies, and 12 -lead electrocardiography. Protect the patient from infection by observing scrupulous aseptic technique. For a patient who will be discharged, also d\u00e9bride the burn, apply a topical antibiotic, and cover the wound with a fluffy dressing. As ordered, provide tetanus immunization. Because burns are exquisitely painful, keep the wou nds covered, administer opioids intravenously, and administer an anxiolytic agent to reduce anxiety that can increase pain . If the patient develops neuropathic pain, manage it with low -dose tricyclic antidepressants or sodium channel blockers. Defer wound care until the patient is stabilized. Remove clothing, cover the wound with clean sheets, and assess for circulatory comprom ise. Provide care that is appropriate for the type of burn. o For a thermal burn , clean it with mild soap and water, remove ruptured b listers, and apply a topical antibacterial. Do not cover a facial burn. o For a chemical burn , irrigate it with tap water or normal saline solution and rinse the areas adjacent to the burn. If the chemical is dry, brush it off before irrigation. After irriga tion, treat a chemical burn like a thermal burn. o For an electrical burn , gently clean with sterile water or normal saline so lution, apply a deep - penetrating topical agent, and apply a light dressing. Also, assess for compartment syndrome. If it is present, prepare for a fasciotomy. o For a tar or asphalt burn , cool the tar, loosen it with mineral oil or a solvent, apply oil or ointment, and cover the burn with a light dressing. Document the patient's temperature on arrival and recheck it frequently. To minimi ze heat loss, keep the patient covered, give warmed intravenous fluids, and increase the room temperature.

Valves separate these four chambers to prevent the backflow of blood. The heart muscle is oxygenated by blood from the right and left coronary arteries , which fill only during diastole. Capillar y blood enters venules that join to form cardiac veins , which drain into the coronary sinus and then into the right atrium. Some cardiac veins drain directly into the cardiac chambers. The heart has three layers: the epicardium (outer layer where coronary arteries lie), myocardium (middle, muscular layer), and endocardium (inner layer that is also the surface of the valves). The pericardium is a fibrous sac that surrounds the heart. Cardiac tissue has automaticity (ability to initiate electrical activity). The sinoatrial node spontaneously depolarizes 60 to 100 times per minute. Impulses normally travel to the atrioventricular node and then to the bundle of His , which terminates at the Purkinje fibers , triggering ventricular contraction. The cardiac cycle h as two phases. During diastole , the ventricles fill as the aortic and pulmonic valves close and the mitral and tricuspid valves open. During systole , the ventricles contract, the aortic and pulmonic valves open, and the atrioventricular valves close. Cardi ac output (amount of blood ejected by the heart per minute) measures the heart's effectiveness as a pump. Cardiac output = Heart rate x Stroke volume (amount of bl ood ejected by each heartbeat). The autonomic nervous system regulates cardiac activity. Para sympathetic nerve stimulation tends to slow cardiac conduction, contraction, and function. Sympathetic nerve stimulation tends to speed up these factors. Stimulation of alpha receptors causes vasoconstriction; beta 1 receptors cause increased heart rate, co ntraction, automaticity, and conduction; beta 2 receptors cause peripheral vasodilation and bronchodilation; an d dopaminergic receptors causes vasodilation. Dysrhythmias A dysrhythmia is any cardiac rhythm other t han normal sinus rhythm. Rhythm interpretation requires systematic evaluation of the rate, rhythm, P waves, QRS complexes, P wave -QRS complex relationship, and PR intervals.

LESSON OUTLINE In a normal sinus rhythm , the rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute (in an adult),and the rhythm is regular. P waves are present. A P wave precedes each QRS complexes, which has a normal duration (0.04 to .011 seconds). PR intervals are normal (0.12 to 0.20 seconds). o Sinus bradycardia is similar to normal sinus rhythm, except that the rat e is less than 60 beats per minute. o Sinus tachycardia is similar to normal sinus rhythm, except that the rate is 100 to 180 beats per minute, and the P waves can merge with T waves as the rate increases. o Sinus arrhythmia is similar to normal sinus rhythm, except that the rate increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration, and the rhythm is slightly irregular. Premature atrial complexes are ectopic beats initiated by an irritable atrial focus. They usually are transient, but may lead to another at rial dysrhythmia or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation causes an atrial rate of 400 beats or more per minute. The ventricular rate varies, but the rhythm is irregularly irregular. It produces no P waves, which le ads to no P wave -QRS complex relationship and no PR intervals. Atrial flutter has an atrial rate of 230 to 350 beats per minute, a ventricular rate that varies, and a regular or irregular rhythm. The P waves become saw -toothed flutter (F) waves, and two or more F waves can appear for every QRS complex. Wandering atrial pacemaker causes a rate of 50 to 100 beats per minute and a regular or slightly irregular rhythm. P waves have at least three different configurations. They precede each QRS complex, but can be obscured by it. The PR interval is variable. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has a rate of 100 to 280 beats per minute. The rhythm is regular, but starts and stops. P waves are often distorted and obscured in the QRS complex, which can be normal or wide. PR inter vals are short or absent. A common pre -excitation syndrome, Wolff -Parkinson -White syndrome causes short PR intervals, delta waves, wide QRS complexes, and inverted ST segments and T waves. Premature junctional complex causes a normal or slow rate and irreg ular rhythm. P waves can be absent, present before or after the QRS complex, or inverted. PR intervals can be less than 0.12 seconds. o Junctional escape rhythm has a rate of 40 to 60 beats per minute, accelerated junctional rhythm causes a rate of 60 to 100 beats, and junctional tachycardia causes a higher rate. In all three dysrhythmias, the rhythm is regular. P waves can be absent, present before or after the QRS complex , or inverted. PR intervals can be less than 0.12 seconds.

LESSON OUTLINE Premature v entricular complexes produce a rate that varies and an irregular rhythm. P waves occur with each sinus beat, but not before premature ventricular complexes. QRS complexes can be normal or wide and bizarre. PR intervals are normal with sinus beats, but not before premature ventricular complexes. o Idioventricular rhythm causes a rate of 20 to 40 beats per minute and a regular or irregular rhythm. QRS complexes are wide and bizarre, and P waves and PR intervals are absent. o Ventricular tachycardia is associated with a rate of 100 to 250 beats per minute and a regular rhythm (monomorphic) or irregular rhythm (polymorphic). QRS complexes are wide and bizarre, and P waves and PR intervals are absent. o Ventricular fibrillation causes the ventricles to quiver, producin g a rapid rate and irregular rhythm. P waves, QRS complexes, and PR intervals are absent. Asystole is the complete absence of ventricular activity and indicates prolonged cardiopulmonary compromise and arrest. Mortality is extremely high . In pulseless elec trical activity, some cardiac activity is present, but no pulse is palpable, requiring basic and advanced life support. This preterminal rhythm can be reversed if the underlying cause is identified and immediately treated. Use the mnemonic for the 6 Hs and 5 Ts to remember possible causes. In first -degree atrioventricular block, the rate usually is 60 to 100 beats per minute. The rhythm, P waves, and QRS complexes are normal, but PR intervals are prolonged. o In second -degree atrioventricular block, type I, the PR interval lengthens with each cycle until a QRS complex is dropped. Then the pattern repeats. o In second -degree atrioventricular block, type II, one or more atrial impulses are not conducted through the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. With th is dysrhythmia, P waves outnumber QRS complexes. However, PR intervals remain constant. o In third -degree atrioventricular block, the atrial rate can be 60 to 100 beats per minute, and the ventricular rate can be below 60 beats per minute. The rhythm is regu lar. Third -degree atrioventricular block occurs when none of the impulses generated in the sinoatrial node are conducted through the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. A conduction abnormality, bundle branch block, prevents or delays impulse passage from the bundle of His to the Purkinje fibers. This causes wide, bizarre QRS complexes. Blocks may be rate -related, transient, or permanent. Long QT syndrome is a conduction abnormality that can be congenital or caused by drugs that prolong the QT interva l.

LESSON OUTLINE A pacemaker can be used to pace the atrium, ventricle, or both. A pacing artifact (spike ) appears on an electrocardiogram tracing when the device delivers a pacing stimulus to the heart. Pacemaker malfunctions include failure to pace, failure to capture, and failure to sense. In pediatric patients, fibrillation, flutter, and atrioventricular blocks rarely occur. These patients are more likely to experience rhythms that are too fast or too slow (for their age) or are absent. Therapeutic Electrical Interventions Defibrillation is the nonsynchronous delivery of energy to the heart during any phase of the cardiac cycle. This energy depolarizes all heart cells, in terrupting dysrhythmias and letting the sinoatrial node resume normal pacemaking . Defibrillation is the definitive intervention for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. o Automated external defibrillators and manual defibrillators can be used. To help remember the steps of using an automated external defibrill ator, recall the mnemonic PAAS , which stands for Power, Attach, Analyze, and Shock. o Coordination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation is crucial to patient outcomes. Synchronized cardioversion is used when the patient is hemodynamically unst able from a sustained tachydysrhythmia (other than sinus tachycardia) or when physical and pharmacologic interventions have not slowed the rhythm. In synchronized cardioversion , energy delivery is timed to correspond with the QRS complex. This avoids shock delivery during the relative refractory period, which can induce ventricular fibrillation. A pacemaker is an electrical device that can be used to electrically stimulate the heartbeat when the heart's intrinsic electrical system cannot generate a rate tha t supports cardiac output. Pacemakers can be used temporarily or permanently. In the emergency department, transcutaneous pacing is commonly used as a temporary intervention for unstable patients with symptomatic bradycardia; second -degree atrioventricular block, type block. An implantable cardioverter -defibrillator is a small generator used in patients at risk for life - threatening dysrhythmias, especially ventricular dysrhythmias. A surgeon places the device under the skin in the chest wall or abdominal cavity. The mini -generator monitors the patient's rhythm, providing pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation based on the patient's needs and the device's capabilities and programming.

LESSON OUTLINE Cardiac Arrest Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. Four rhythms can lead to sudden cardiac arrest: ventricular fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, asystole, and pulseless (PEA). Arrest commonl y results from myocardial infarction, but may also have other causes. Management begins with basic life support. Begin with chest compressions then ensure a patent airway and adequate ventilation. Perform defibrillation as soon as the defibrillator becomes available; however, ensure that chest compressions precede each defibrillation attempt. First -line drug therapy for managing cardiac arrest is epinephrine (Adrenalin) or vasopressin (Pitressin). Other drugs may be used to manage cardiac arrest related to specific disorders, including sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. R emember that management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia requires immediate defibrillation followed by chest compressions and then medication administration. After successful resuscitation, further evaluation determines the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest and appropriate treatment. Treatment depends on the patient's cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic status. o To manage symptomatic bradycardia , administer atropine and consider transcutaneous pacing or a continuous infusion of dopamine (Intropin) or epinephrine. o For a stable patient with narrow -complex tachycardia , assist with vagal maneuvers and administer adenosine (Adenocard). o For a n unstable patient with narrow -complex tachycardia , prepare for emergency synchronized cardioversion. o For a stable patient with wide patient with wide -complex monomorphic ventricular tachycardia , prepare for synchronized cardioversion. o If the patient with wide -complex polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is unstable, immediate defibrillation is the priority. o If the patient has a wide -complex polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with prolonged QT syndrome and is stable, prepare to administer magnesium sulfate. Pacing and beta -blockers may also be considered. o If the patient has a wide -complex polymorphic ven tricular tachycardia associated with myocardial ischemia , prepare to treat with amiodarone, beta -blockers, and cardiac catheterization for revascularization. o Fluid volume management depends on the patient's hemodynamic status. Usually, normal saline or lac tated Ringer's solution is used . Avoid using dextrose -containing solutions during resuscitation because they can cause adverse effects on cerebral tissue.

LESSON OUTLINE o Additional pharmacologic intervention may be required to improve cardiovascular performance, including: Diuretics , such as furosemide [Lasix] such such as nitroglycerin (Nitrostat) or nitroprusside to decrease cardiac workload by reducing preload and afterload o After cardia c arrest, some patients may benefit from therapeutic hypothermia . Acute Coronary Syndrome Acute coronary syndrome is a continuum of coronary artery disease that includes unstable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and non -ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. All of these disorders initially produce similar signs and symptoms: o Chest pain that m ay radiate to the jaw or left arm o Anginal equivalent symptoms , such as nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, indigestion, dyspnea, palpitations, and dizziness To assess chest pain , obtain a brief, accurate history. Use the PQRST mnemonic to collect information systematically. Ask about anginal equivalent symptoms. This information aids in the differential diagnosis of chest pain, which may be caused by cardiovascular and other disorders. During the physical examination , assess for diaphoresis, anxiety, altered hea rt rate and rhythm, hypertension, S 3, systolic murmur, pericardial friction rub, and jugular vein distention. Obtain a 12 -lead electrocardiogram within 10 minutes of patient arrival in the emergency department. Different leads can detect ischemia or infarc tion in different areas of the heart. Criteria for significant electrocardiogram changes include ST -segment elevation or depression, abnormal Q waves, and T -wave inversions. Acute myocardial infarction location: anterior, lateral, inferior, posterior , or right ventricular. Continuous monitoring of one or more leads is essential. Cardiac biomarkers include myoglobin, t roponin kinase rise faster than creatine kinase. Myoglobin rises the fastest, but is not cardiac specific. Additional diagnostic tests may include chest radiography and echocardiography. To remember basic medications for acute coronary syndrome, recall the mnemonic MONA , which stands for morphine, oxygen, nitroglycerin, and aspirin. Give other medications as clopidogrel infarction is the most time -sensitive entity. Because time is muscle, work quickly to restore perfusion. As ordered, prepare for reperfusion b y percutaneous coronary intervention, with or without stent placement, or fibrinolytic therapy. To evaluate the effectiveness of reperfusion, use cardiac angiography, reassess chest pain and ST -segment changes, and monitor for reperfusion dysrhythmias.

LESSON OUTLINE Heart Failure In heart failure , one or both ventricles fail s to function adequately as a pump. This causes severe dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, weakness, abdominal discomfort, dependent edema, jugular vein distention, bilateral crackles, and S 3. Diagnostic tests include 12 -lead electrocardiography, chest radiography, complete blood count, and electrolyte, blood creatinine, cardiac biomarker, and serum B -type natriuretic peptide levels. for managing heart failure inc lude high -Fowler positioning; administration of oxygen; support the precipitating condition. Pericarditis Pericarditis (pericardial sac inflammation) may result from acute myocardial infarction, trauma, infection, or neoplasms. It may cause fever, chills, dyspnea, severe chest pain, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, pericardial friction rub, malaise, ST -segment elevation. Treatm ent calls for oxygen, sedation, analgesics, bed rest, and possibly anti -inflammatory agents and steroids. Aortic Aneurysm An aneurysm is a dilated portion of an artery caused by a weakness in the arterial wall, which is usually due to atherosclerosis. Aneurysms may be fusiform, saccular, or dissecting (which results in a tear in the artery). Rupture can lead to exsanguination, shock, an d death. Signs and symptoms depend on the aneurysm's location and size, but rarely occur early. o A leaking or ruptured abdominal aneurysm typically causes extreme back pain and abdominal pain and tenderness on palpation. o A leaking or dissecting thoracic ane urysm may cause chest pain that radiates to the back, dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, apprehension, tachycardia, unilaterally absent pulses, differences in blood pressure on the right and left sides, hypertension or hypotension, and hemiplegia or paraplegia. -match, and cardiac biomarker levels. The main treatment goals are control of pain, anxiety, and blood pre ssure. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Hypertensive Crisis In hypertensive emergencies , the blood pressure must be lowered in 1 to 2 hours to prevent end - organ damage. Hypertensive crisis may result from hypertension, renal parenchymal disease, endocrine disorders, symp athomimetic drugs, and certain food -drug interactions. In hypertensive crisis, the systolic pressure exceeds 240 mm Hg or the diastolic pressure exceeds 140 mm Hg. This leads to cardiovascular manifestations, such as heart failure and chest pain, and neuro logic manifestations, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, visual disturbances, altered mental states, and seizures. Patient management requires monitoring of electrocardiogram findings and vital signs, particularly the blood pressure, which is most accurately measured via an arterial line. After obtaining vascular access, administer and titrate a vasoactive drug, such as nitroprusside (Nitropress) or nicardipine (Cardene), to reduce the systolic pressure no lower than 160 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure to a level that's appropriate for the patient's condition.

LESSON OUTLINE Child Maltreatment In the United States, one in five children experiences some form of child maltreatment, which is any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential harm, or the threat of harm to a child. To help identify maltreatment , compare detailed history data and assessment findings for congruency. Observe child, caregiver, and staff interactions , and note child and caregiver indicators of child abuse or neglect. The most common form of child maltreatmen t is neglect , the intentional or unintentional omission of needed care and support. A neglected child may be unkempt, left unattended, dressed inappropriately for the weather, malnourished, or diagnosed with failure to thrive. Neglect can be physical, medi cal, educational, or emotional. o Failure to thrive is a condition in children whose growth persistently and significantly deviates from the norms for their age and sex based on national growth charts. Physical abuse is the intentional injury of a child youn ger than age 18 years by a parent or caregiver. It is characterized by injury, torture, maiming, or the use of unreasonable force. However, children rarely tell anyone about it. The child may display physical findings, such as cutaneous, skeletal, or crani al injuries as well as behavioral changes. o Abusive head trauma (formerly called shaken baby syndrome) is a constellation of signs and symptoms that result s from violent shaking, impact, or both. It causes a triad of acceleration - deceleration injuries: subd ural hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, and diffuse o Factitious disorder by proxy (formerly called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is a complex condition in which a parent, usually the mother, knowingly makes a child ill or fabricates an illness f or secondary gain or attention through the child's illness. o Conditions that mimic physical abuse include sudden infant death syndrome, hemophilia, other blood disorders, Mongolian spots, increased vena caval pressure from vigorous crying, coining, cupping, and osteogenesis o In the emergency department, care for the child's injuries comes first. Then, obtain a detailed history, paying close attention to the sequence of events and risk factors for maltrea tment in the child, caregiver, or community. o During the physical examination, document all injuries. Measure, draw, and describe their location and color and note induration and scarring. Prepare for skeletal surve ys and blood tests, as ordered. o If you sus pect maltreatment, consult a forensic interviewing expert to conduct the caregiver Interviews. Take a nonjudgmental approach and convey genuine concern and understanding. o Report suspected maltreatment, as required by your state. Pediatric sexual abuse invo lves acts where a caregiver uses a child for sexual gratification or profit. o Sexually abused pediatric patients may present with anogenital complaints, nonspecific symptoms, sexually transmitted infections, or behavioral symptoms. o If the abuse occurred wit hin 72 hours or caused bleeding, pain, or discharge, immediately perform a physical examination and collect forensic evidence . o The most important part of the sexual abuse evaluation is the pediatric patient's history , which usually is the basis of the diag nosis of sexual abuse. If possible, work with a multidisciplinary team to provide care . o Prepare the child for the physical examination, offering lots of choices and answ ering all questions truthfully.

LESSON OUTLINE o Assist with a general head -to-toe exam ination , assessing the anogenital area last. Collect specimens for culture and sensitivity and other laboratory tests. o Conditions that mimic sexual abuse include unintentional trauma, urethral prolapse, hemangioma, inflammatory bowel disease, and perianal streptococcal infection. o Document findings accurately. Use quotation marks and draw pictures. Emotional abuse is a repeated pattern of damaging interacti ons between caregiver(s) and the child that becomes typical of the relationship. It almost always occurs with other forms of child maltreatment. Because child maltreatment is a complex problem that requires the expertise of various professionals, many faci lities take a multidisciplinary approach . The medical record may be needed in a child maltreatment case and the healthcare professional who examined the child may be called to testify . If a child dies suddenly and unexpectedly, follow your facility's policies and procedures and use a checklist for child death in the emergency department. Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence occurs between two people in a close relationship, in cluding current and former dating partners and spouses. It aff ects people of all ages, social and cultural groups, and sexual orientations. It is more common among pregnant women and those who belong to certain racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Alcohol and drug abuse are comorbid factors for intimate partner violence. Other risk factors are related to the victim, relationship, and community and society. Residing in a rural area ma y be an additional risk factor. The cycle of violence has three phases. Phase one includes increased tension, anger, and blaming. Phase two includes battering, the use of objects as weapons, sexual abuse, and verbal threats and abuse. Phase three is a calm state marked by apology. Battering can have physical, emotional, and psychological effects on the victim. It can have long - lasting effects on children, such as low self -esteem and cognitive function. Your primary roles are to ensure the recognition and care of injuries, offer victims a chance to tell their story, and initiate interventions and referrals to help victims plan for safety . Use a three -question screening tool for intimate partner violence . A positive response to any of these questions requires exploration when the patient is away from the partner. The patient may present with medical complaints , such as pain or urinary trac t or sexually transmitted infection, or with trauma -related injuries especially on the head, face, neck, and areas usually covered by clothing. During the physical examination, assist in the collection of evidentiary material. Make arrangements for advocac y services and follow -up appointments for primary care. Ideally, have a social worker meet with the victim to help develop a safety plan. Document all findings thoroughly . Record the patient's words in quotation marks. Use a body map to mark the injuries' location and size and take instant photographs of them. If possible, call on a forensic nurse examiner. Report intimate partner violence , as required in your state. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Use the mnemonic RADAR to recall the key elements of care: o Routinely ask p atients about intimate partner violence. o Ask them directly, using specific questions. o Document the assessment findings and injuries. o Assess victim safety. o Review the possible options with the victim and provide referrals. Elder and Dependent Adult Maltreatment Elder and dependent adult maltreatment affects men and women of all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. An elder is an individual age 65 years or older. A dependent adult is an individual age 18 years or older who cannot protect his or h er own interests or cannot perform or obtain services to meet essential human needs due to a physical or mental condition that requires assistance from another. All categories of maltreatment include harm or threatened harm to the health or w elfare of the vulnerable adult. o The primary categories of maltreatment include neglect (the most common form) and physical, psychological or emotional, and financial abuse . o Other types of maltreatment include a violation of personal rights, abandonment, and self - neglec t. About 90 percent of maltreated elders and dependent adults know the perpetrator. Factors that increase the risk of someone harming an elder include economic, careg iver-related, social, and physical factors. The more dependent the patient is, the more li kely he or she is to be abused. When screening for maltreatment , begin with general questions about the patient's perception of safety at home. Then ask more specific questions about maltreatment, such as \"Are you ever physically hurt or confined to your r oom?\" During the history and physical assessment , stay alert for clues to maltreatment. Clues to physical abuse include bruises, patterned burns, lacerations, and alo pecia. Clues to neglect include dehydration, malnutrition, untreated pressure ulcers, and poor personal hygiene. Clues to psychological abuse include uncommunicativeness, fear, suspicion, chronic health problems, and emotional distress. The primary goal of intervention is protection from immediate and future harm . o A secondary goal is breaking t he cycle of maltreatment . o Interventions include referrals to community agencies for continued monitoring, support services to reduce caregiver stre ss, close healthcare follow -up to prevent healthcare \"shopping,\" reports to adult protective services with pa tient removal from a harmful environment, and the use of 24 -hour supervision by a home care agency.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology A susceptible host is one who lacks effective anatomic and physiologic resistance to a pathogen. An organism's pathogenicity determines the extent to which it produces overt disease or its power to produce disease. Modes of pathogen transmission include contact (direct and indirect), airborne, and droplet. Infection Prevention in Acute Care Common nosocomial infections include urinary tract, surgical site, and bloodstream infections and pneumonia. The most significant risk factor for nosocomial infections is incorrect (or lack of) hand hygiene. Perform hand hygiene before and after every patient contact. To avoid occupational ex posure to pathogens, use safe techniques (such as not recapping needles by hand), dispose of used needles properly, use safety features on medical devices, and wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Hepatitis A Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes acute infectious illness that does not lead to chronic infection or liver disease. It is typically transmitted by the fecal -oral route when a person consumes feces - contaminated food or water. Hepatitis A may be asymptomatic or cause severe symptoms. It usually progresses through four clinical phases: incubation or preclinical phase, prodromal or preicteric phase, icteric phase (marked by jaundice), and convalescent phase. Hepatitis A immunization is recommended for people who plan to travel repeatedly or live fo r a long time in an area with a high risk of infection and for children living in communities with the highest rates of infection. For a patient with hepatitis A, maintain enteric precautions for the first 2 weeks of illness. As ordered, administer hepatit is A vaccine, immune globulin (IG), or both. Hepatitis B Hepatitis B virus (HBV) commonly causes acute and chronic infection. It is transmitted through contact with blood or body fluids of an infected person. Transmission may also occur through sexual or close household contact, mother -to-infant transmission, reuse of unsterilized need les or syringes, and medical procedures. Hepatitis B is the major infectious occupational hazard for healthcare workers. All people who are positive for hepatitis B surface an tigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) are potentially infectious. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Hepatitis B virus may cause acute illness or subclinical infection followed by an acute recover y or chronic hepatitis. It may also lead to fulminating disease. o A short prodromal ph ase may cause flulike symptoms. o Then , the preicteric phase may cause a fever, malaise, and serum sickness -like effects. o Next , the icteric phase may cause dark urine, light -colored stools, and jaundice. The most effective way to control thi s infection is the hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis C Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. It is transmitted parenterally through direct contact with human blood. Hepatitis C has an insidious onset and a severity that ranges from no apparent disease to fulminating, fatal disease. Alcohol use and coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are the major risk factors for disease progression. Diagnosis depends on det ecting antibodies to hepatitis C virus in the blood. No vaccine exists to prevent hepatitis C, and immune globulin is not effective for postexposure prophylaxis. Therefore, healthcare workers must observe all precautions. Hepatitis D Hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes infection only in the presence of active hepatitis B. Hepatitis D and B viruses are transmitted by similar routes. Hepatitis D usually has an abrupt onset and produces signs and symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B. The infection may be se lf-limiting or may progress to chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B vaccine prevents hepatitis D. However, hepatitis B immune globulin, immune globulin , and hepatitis B vaccine do not protect hepatitis B virus carriers from hepatitis D virus infection. Hepatitis E Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the major cause of enterically transmitted non -A, non -B hepatitis. It is transmitted by the fecal -oral route, mainly through consumption of contaminated water or food. Hepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis but does not cause chronic infection. Diagnosis of hepatitis E requires detection of elevated levels of specific antibodies to the hepatitis E virus . Reduction of the prevalence of hepatitis E requires g ood personal hygiene, high -quality standar ds for public water supplies, and proper disposal of sanitary water.

LESSON OUTLINE Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus infection progresses through three stages \u2014early, mid, and late \u2014 that show a progressive decline i n immune function and CD4 counts and a rise in opportunistic infections. Then the advanced stage occurs. This stage is characterized as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) . This is when significant o pportunistic infections develop and the CD4 count is at its lowest . Human immunodeficiency virus is transmitted primarily through unprotected sex, contact between open skin or mucosa with body secretions, use of contaminated needles or syringes, infected blood transfusion, transplantation of infected tiss ue or organs, and perinatal transmission, The most commonly used screening test for human immunodeficiency virus infection is the enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No vaccine exists against human immunodeficiency virus infection. Prevention relies on controlling virus transmission through patient counseling and postexposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs, if appropriate. To minimize your occupational risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission, use barrier precautions, use safety devic es on medical equipment, and properly dispose of contaminated materials. Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Infection Methicillin -resistant S.aureus is common nosocomial pathogen that is resistant to beta -lactam antibiotics such as methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin. When a person is colonized, bacteria live on the skin but cause no harm. Methicillin -resistant S. aureus colonization can occur in the nose, pharynx, axilla, rectum, and perineum. Infection refers to bacterial invasion into tissue and growth. Infection may occur when the bacteria enter a break in the skin. A methicillin -resistant S. aureus infection typically starts as s mall red bumps, which can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses that require surgical draining. Systemic infection can be fatal. A methicillin -resistant S. aureus infection most commonly affects people with weakened immune systems. These people are oft en in hospitals and healthcare facilities such as nursing homes and dialysis centers . Transmission of a hospital -acquired infection occurs mainly via the hands of healthcare workers. Vancomycin is one of the few antibiotics still effective against methicil lin-resistant S. aureus . Community -acquired skin infections remain responsive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Observe standard precautions and contact precautions for all patients who present with open or draining skin or soft -tissue infections, those wh o are known to be infected with methicillin -resistant S. aureus , or those who are at high risk of the infection.

LESSON OUTLINE Tuberculosis (TB) Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which can be transmitted by airborne particles or droplet nuclei. M. tuberculosis usually infects the lungs . However, it can affect other parts of the body, including the brain, the kidneys, or the spine . If untreated, tuberculosis can be fatal. Worldwid e, the incidence , prevalence, and death rates of tuberculosis are on the decline. T he number of new tuberculosis cases in the United States continues to decline. In multidrug -resistant tuberculosis , the bacilli are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifam pin, the two most powerful antitubercular drugs. Extensively drug -resistant tuberculosis is resistant to the most powerful first -line and second -line drugs and seriously threatens tuberculosis control. Tuberculosis infection (latent tuberculosis ) causes no symptoms and is not contagious. Active tuberculosis disease produces signs and symptoms such as a persistent productive cough, weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats, and pleurisy. Diagnosis is confirmed by sputum sample, chest radiography, a nd tuberculin skin test. For a patient with active tuberculosis disease, observe airborne precautions, administer antitubercular drugs, and provide supportive care.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review Dentition consists of two main structures: the teeth and the periodontium. Primary teeth begin to erupt at age 6 months. Permanent teeth begin to erupt at age 5 to 6 years . Each ear is divided into three sections: external ear (auricle, ear canal, and tympanic membrane), middle ear (ossicle s, round and oval windows, and e ustachian tube), and internal ear (bony labyrinth). The nose is a mostly cartilaginous structure that warms, filters, and moistens inhaled air, provides a sense of smell, and is the primary passage for air to reach the lungs. The throat (pharynx) is composed of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The bony structures of the face include the vomer, mandible, and six pairs of bones. Four pairs of sinuses (air -filled pockets) are the ethmoid, frontal, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses. At the temporomandibular joint, the mandible connects to the tempora l bone. Patient Assessment For a patient with a dental, ear, nose, throat, or facial emergency, perform a focused assessment. Use inspection and palpation to examine affected structures, as needed. Dental Emergencies Odontalgia (dental pain) usually resul ts from caries. Affected teeth may be tender on percussion and sensitive to heat, cold, and air. When odontalgia is accompanied by facial or neck swelling, the patient needs prompt assessment and treatment to prevent the spread of infection. Treatment includes antibiotics, topical anesthetics, nerve blocks, and analgesics until the patient receives definitive dental care. Tooth eruption can cause pain, irritability, disrupted sleep, nasal discharge, crying, diarrhea, drooling, dehydration , and low -grade fev er. Treatment may include acetaminophen (Tylenol), oral and intravenous fluid administration, saline irrigation, nonopioid analgesics, sparing use of topical anesthetics. Pericoronitis (gum inflammation in the pericoronal flap) results from impacted molars and may cause extreme pain, earache, sore throat, fever, inflamed tissues, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and trismus. Treatment may include warm saline or peroxide irrigation and mou th rinses, incision and drainage, antibiotics, and follow -up with an ora l-maxillofacial surgeon. Fractured tooth is the most common dental injury in the emergency department. The Ellis classification system describes different types of fractured teeth and aids in planning their treatment. Because fractured teeth are commonly a ssociated with facial trauma, the priority is to secure the airway, breathing, and circulation. Tooth avulsion occurs when a tooth is torn from its socket. Handle an avulsed tooth by the crown. Ideal treatment is rinsing the tooth and placing it back in th e socket as soon as possible. If this is not possible, transport the tooth in Hank solution, milk, or saline solution or under an alert patient's tongue. Refer the patient to a dentist or oral surgeon. Dental abscesses may be periapical or periodontal. The y usually are confined, but some infections can spread to the head and neck, causing different manifestations. Treatment calls for opioids, antipyretics, antibiotics, possibly incision and drainage, and follow -up with an oral surgeon, dentist, or ear, nose , and throat specialist. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Gingivitis (gum inflammation) is the most common cause of tooth loss. It causes red, swollen gum margins, bleeding, pain, difficulty chewi ng, and low -grade fever. Topical anesthetics, analgesics, and oral antibiotics are indicated, along with teaching about dental hygiene and referral to a dentist. Ludwig's angina is the spread of an existing dental infection or cellulitis into three mandibular spaces. It causes swelling in the neck and submandibular tissue (which displaces the tongue superiorly), pain, trismus, muffled voice, dysphagia, drooling, fever or chills, and dyspnea. Priorities in the emergency department include maintaining the airway, breathing, and circulation; relieving pain; and administering intravenous antibiotics. Ear Emergencies Ear inflammations may affect the external, middle, or inner ear. They produce varying manifestations but almost always cause pain. o Otitis externa affects the external ear canal and auricle and usually results from b acterial infection. Signs and symptoms typically include pain, swelling, redness, and purulent drainage of the auricle and ear canal. To treat otitis externa, keep the ear dry, apply heat, and provide analgesics and antibiotics. o Otitis media is the most common infection for which antibacterials are prescribed in pediatric patients. In patients younger than age 3, signs and symptoms include irritability, fever, night waking, poor feeding, balance problems, ear pain, and rubbing or pulling the ears. In older patients, effects include ear pain, hearing loss, ear popping or fullness, and dizziness. Expect to treat otitis media with antipyretics, analgesics, topical anesthetic otic solutions, and antibacterial agents or observation. o Otitis i nterna (labyrinthitis) usually results from a viral infection but may have other causes. It produces severe vertigo, nystagmus, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Treatment requires bed rest, meclizine (Antivert), antiemetics, fluid, and antibiotics. Mastoiditis (mastoid process inflammation) usually results from untreated acute otitis media. Manifestations include pain in the ear and mastoid area; fever; red, bulging displaced auri cle; and history of otitis media. The patient requires hospitalization for 24 to 38 hours of intravenous antibiotics followed by referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Ruptured tympanic membrane usually results from a bacterial infection but may have other causes. Its signs and symptoms include pain, bloody or purulent ear drainage, hearing loss, vertigo, fever, and a slit -shaped or irregular tympanic membrane on otoscopic examination. Management includes antibiotics, analgesics, and antipyretics. Drainage requires gentle suctioning \u2014not irrigation. Most cases of ruptured tympanic membranes heal spontaneously. A foreign body in the ear is most likely to be cerumen and to affect patients younger than age 5. It may cause earache; purulent, foul -smelli ng ear drainage; decreased hearing; and a sense of fullness in the ear. Irrigation usually is best for removing impacted cerumen but should not be used for vegetables or other soft materials . Mineral oil or 2% lidocaine (Xylocaine) is used to kill live ins ects for removal. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Nasal Emergencies Rhinitis (nasal mucosa inflammation) is characterized by edema of the nasal membranes, vasodilation, discharge, and obstruction. Common effects include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, headache, w atery or itchy eyes, throat irritation, malaise, mild fever, and a decreased sense of smell. Management includes antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, analgesics, and the patient sh ould take nasal decongestants for 2 to 3 days only. Epistaxis (nosebleed) may originate in the anterior or posterior nose. Anterior bleeding is usually acute and comes from Kiesselbach plexus. Posterior bleeding is usually chronic, tends to be more profuse , and commonly affects older patients with hypertension. While observing universal precautions, help the patient sit upright, tilt the head down, and pinch the nares. Once the bleeding site is identified, provide treatment for anterior epistaxis, including topical vasoconstrictors, direct pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, chemical or electrical cautery, or packing (if needed). For posterior epistaxis, insert a posterior nasal pack, if possible, monitor for respiratory obstruction, and give antihypertensives as ordered. A foreign body in the nose usually affects pediatric patients and is discovered when a unilateral, purulent nasal discharge occurs. Other signs and symptoms may include nasal pain and fullness, foul - smelling discharge, epistaxis, sinus fever , and edematous nasal mucosa. Nasal positive -pressure techniques are used first to try to remove the foreign body. If these do not work, a topical anesthetic and vasoconstrictor may be instilled and the object removed with a hooked probe or forceps. Throat Emergencies Pharyngitis (pharynx inflammation) is usually viral, benign, and self -limiting. Signs and symptoms include a bright red throat, swollen tonsils, white or yellow exudate on the tonsils and pharynx, swollen uvula, and enlarged tender cervical and tonsillar nodes. For bacterial pharyngitis, treatment consists of antibiotics, antipyretics, and analgesics, and possibly tonsillectomy. Laryngitis (vocal cord inflammation) may accompany an upper respiratory infection or can occur alone. It may cause voice loss, upper respiratory effects, and dyspnea or stridor . Treatment includes voice rest, steam inhalation, increased fluid intake, and topical anesthetic throat lozenges. Tonsillitis (palatine tonsil inflammation) usually results from a streptococcal infection. Signs and symptoms include a sensation of fullness in the throat, ear pain, jaw or throat tenderness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, white or yellow exudate on the tonsils, and foul breath. Warm saline gargles, topical anesthetic nalgesics, antipyretics, and can result from untreated suppurative tonsillitis. The abscess is unilateral and causes dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice, painful swallowing, trismus, anxiety, fever, malaise, and dehydration. Treatment may require fluids, antipyretics, analgesics, needle aspiration (or surgical incision and drainage), antibiotics, and referral to an eye, ear, and nose specialist .

LESSON OUTLINE Facial Emergencies Sinusitis (mucous membrane in flammation in the paranasal sinuses) usually results from an upper respiratory infection or allergic rhinitis. It causes dull, achy pain and tenderness on palpation over the sinus, fever, anorexia, nausea, edematous discharge, and re duced transillumination. Nasal decongestant sprays may provide immediate relief but should not be used for more than 3 days. Other treatments include isotonic saline nose drops, increased fluid intake, warm compresses, antibiotics, analgesics, and referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. Temporomandibular joint dislocation usually results from opening the mouth too wide, such as when yawning or laughing. The patient reports pain due to muscle spasms and displays chin protrusion, open mouth, and droo ling. Treatment is reduction, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and a soft diet for 3 to 4 days. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Historic Events Disasters and emergencies are natural or manmade events that dramatically affect life and property in catastrophic proportions. Although rare, they are largely unpredictable and inevitable. Historic events reinforced the need for a national coordinated disaster response. They showed that advance planning, training, and preparation related to the roles, responsibilities , and resource management strategies are essential. Advance planning ensures that the right personnel, equipment, and supplies are available to the people and communities who need them most. Disaster Management Local emergency managers request interstate a nd intrastate assistance before the affected state's governor activates a federal disaster response. Activation occurs when local and state resources are exhausted or insufficient to handle the incident. o Phases of the disaster management cycle include: Mitigation (planning for the disaster response) Preparedness (taking steps to prepare for a potential disaster) Response (acting immediately after the event to save life, limb, and property) Recovery (slowly returning to what is now considered normal life) The federal government refers to domestic incident management and disaster preparations from an all-hazards perspective (including any potential hazard that threatens a jurisdiction within our country's borders). Evolution of Disaster Management Disaster m anagement and preparedness began in the Cold War and Civil Defense era. The Federal Emergency Management Agency started in the 1960s and has since evolved. In 1988, The Stafford Act authorized most of today's federal disaster response activities. In 1992, the Federal Response Plan identified emergency support functions as a way to organize needed activities to provide federal support. In 1996, the Emergency Management Assistance Compact let states help each other with disasters in advance of, or instead of, Federal Emergency Management Agency aid. In 2003, National Incident Management System provided a nationwide template to enable federal, state, local, and tribal governments to work together to manage domestic incidents. The federal government's response r equires coordination, leadership, and resources applied quickly and efficiently to large -scale incidents. The National Incident Management System became an essential part of the health care system through the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Pro gram.

LESSON OUTLINE National Incident Management System One of the best practices in the National Incident Management System is the Incident Command System, a standard, on -scene, all -hazards incident management system. This system was developed more than 30 years ago, after a devastating wildfire in California. When communication and coordination problems hampered firefighters' effectiveness, Congress mandated a command and control system that delineates job responsibilities and the organizational str ucture for managing day -to-day operations in multiple -fire situations. The Incident Command System was recognized as effective and, in 2008, was adapted for use in other incidents. Incident Command System The National Incident Management System requires al l federal, state, local, tribal, private sector, and nongovernmental personnel with a direct role in disaster management and response (including ED personnel) to be trained in the National Incident Management System and Incident Command System. Federal Eme rgency Management Agency's Emergency Management Institute and some local and state providers offer approved training courses that meet National Incident Management System competencies. The Incident Command System revolves around the Incident Commander, who has overall responsibility for incident response. The command staff includes a deputy commander or liaison officer, safety officer, and media liaison. The response staff includes personnel in planning, operations, logistics, and finance. Each group has fo ur to six members. Each group's leader reports to the group above. This chain of command keeps each group focused on tasks and allows clear communication. In the hospital, the highest -ranking officer becomes the Incident Commander. The emergency department falls under operations. The Operations leader directs teams of doctors, practitioners, and nurses. Teams may include triage, alternate treatment areas, critical treatment areas, holding areas, and other areas. Communication Because normal telephone commun ication may not be possible, internal communication may occur via battery -powered, hand -held radios; internal wireless phone systems; or runners with written messages. Transmit only essential information briefly and clearly. For external communication , rad io communication is vital. The emergency department should be able to reach emergency services, law enforcement, fire departments, and other essential responders.

LESSON OUTLINE Triage During a mass causality incident (sudden influx of ED patients or vic tims), use disaster -style triage and normal standards of care and protocols. During a disaster (sudden influx of ED patients or victims that completely overwhelms emergency personnel and resources), use field disaster t riage. Briefly assess and tag each vi ctim as: o Green (minor). Definitive treatment may be delayed up to 48 hours with no significant deterioration of condition. o Yellow (delayed). Treatment is needed within 12 to 24 hours, but can wait until more seriously injured victims receive care. o Red (immediate). Victims should receive stabilization and definitive treatment or transport to a treatment facility. o Black (deceased or dying). Victims have injuries that are beyond treatment with the limited resources available. Disaster Triage During disaster t riage, categorize victims based on injuries \u2014and available resources. Reevaluate victims frequently and recategorize if needed. Never lower the initial triage designation. Don't abandon victims categorized as black. Use your facility's disaster triage system, such as the START triage system . In this system, ask all adult victims who can walk to move to a specific location. Tag them green. Then move to each remaining victim and assess for breathing, perfusion, and level of consciousness. Tag them as desc ribed in the system. If appropriate, use the JumpSTART system for children, which adds a few rescue breaths and assessment of the respiratory rate and level of consciousness. In the ED, prioritize victims in order: chest and abdominal injuries, obvious or suspected fractures, and obvious injuries or illness. Do no harm. Handle triaged victims based of their triage tag. For example, use alternate holding areas for patients with gr een, yellow, and black tags. Always consider contamination. Communication between the incident scene triage site and the hospital's triage area includes how many victims the hospital can receive, where they should be taken, the nature of the injuries, and how many of each category need care. Standards of Care It is impossible to meet the usual standards of care during a disaster. Every hospital should have an all -hazards disaster plan that includes specific protocols and triggers for implementing these prot ocols to direct victim care if a disaster or a mass casualty incident occurs. The evacuation plan should address where to move patients and how to deal with supplies and equipment needed by existing patients and new disaster victims.

Lesson Outline Credent ialing Disaster Responders The National Emergency Responder Credentialing System verifies the identity and qualifications of emergency response personnel and can help prevent access to a disaster site by unauthorized personnel. Because this system is not i n all 50 states, hospitals should establish a procedure for granting emergency privileges to nonhospital employees who volunteer during a disaster. Comprehensive national training for health care professionals requires consensus on the operational definiti ons of disaster preparedness. Training exercises should incorporate nationally formulated core competencies across all responder and receiver roles. Personal Preparedness The nurse should be personally prepared because disasters can affect them and their f amilies. Take steps to ensure your survival in your home, unaided, for at least 3 days. Attitude is vital. Panic will kill the most prepared individual, but an attitude of survival will save someone who has nothing to help them. Maintain a heightened awar eness of what is happening around you. Homeland Security Mission Areas Emergency nurses can be leaders in personal and community domestic preparedness in four Homeland Security mission areas: o Prevention includes disaster planning, gathering supplies, and r elated tasks. For a table of personal and professional prevention activities , see the Key Resources section . o Protection involves organizing, training, maintaining equipment and supplies, conducting drills, and improving performance based on the results of drills. o Response relates to assessing the situation, activating resources, coordinating responses, and demobilizing. o Recovery involves identifying needs and resources and promoting community and personal restoration.

The right patient o Ensure the right patient by verifying that the name on the order sheet or medication record and the name on the patient's wristband agree o The second unique identifier may include the patient's date of birth or medical record number. Never use a room number to confirm patient iden tity. 2. The right medication o Confirm the right medication by reading the label or medication form three (3) times: 1) when picking up the medication or bottle; 2) when preparing the medication for dispensing; and 3) when throwing the unit -dose package away o r prior to putting the bottle back in the drawer or cupboard where it is stored. o Know the use of the specific medication and the expected dosage ranges . 3. The right dosage o Use a drug reference book or your pharmacist to confirm the correct dosage. 4. The right time o Administering the correct medication in the correct dose within the acceptable time frame. \"On time\" is usually within 30 minutes of (before or after) the time ordered. Follow your facility's policy regarding the acceptable time frame. 5. The right rout e o The right route refers to the route by which the medication is to be administered. 6. The right documentation o The right documentation refers to charting activities before, during, and after drug administration, including the time the medication was administered (as soon after delivery as possible).

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE V C(H) D x x = X H C(D) 1 Metric System The most widely used measurement system is the metric system. The metric system is a decimal system based on multiples of 10 and fractions of 10. A gram is the metric system's basic unit of measurement for weight. A liter is the metric system's basic unit of measurement for volume or capacity. Prefix for Larger Unit Prefix Meaning Example Kilo 1000 (one thousand) 1 kilogram (1kg) = 1000g Hector 100 (one hundred) 1 hectogram (1 hg) = 100 g Deka 10 (ten) 1 dekagram (1 dag) = 10 g Apothecary System The apothecary system is often referred to as the fractional system because in the apothecary system any amount less than 1 is expressed as a fraction. The apothecary system can be traced back to the Middle Ages; however, it is being phased out and replaced by the metric system. The only unit of apothecary measure commonly used by the lay public is pounds (1 kg = 2.2 lb). Prefix for Smaller Unit Prefix Meaning Example Deci 0.1 (one tenth) 1 decigram (1 dg) = 0.1 g Centi 0.01 (one hundredth) 1 centigram (1 cg) = 0.01 g Milli 0.001 (one thousandth) 1 milligram (1 mg) = 0.000001 nanogram (1 ng) = 0.000000001 g Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE In the apothecary system, the basic unit of measure for weight is the grain (gr) and the basic unit of measure for volume is the minim. The grain and the minim are the smallest units in the apothecary system. The larger units of measure in this system are the dram (dr) and the ounce (oz). 1 gr (1 grain) = 60 mg 1 oz (1 ounce) = 30 mL 1 lb (1 pound) = 2.2 kg Household System The household system of measurement is used primarily in the home setting. The basic units of measurement in the household system are the teaspoon, ta blespoon, and cup. Measurements in the household system are less accurate than measurements in the metric system because of inconsistencies in the capacities of the spoons, cups, glasses, and droppers available in the home. It is important to stress with the patient that the same teaspoon or dropper must be used to measure each dose. 1 teaspoon (tsp) = 60 drops 1 tsp = 5 mL 3 tsp = 1 tablespoon (T) 1 T = 15 mL 1 cup (c) = 8 ounces (oz) 1 c = 240 mL 1 oz = 2 T 1 oz = 30 mL Critical Care and Pediatric Medications Many medications used in critical care and the majority of pediatric medications are ordered according to the patient's weight (in kilograms). To calculate the dose of a medication ordered according to the patient 's weight, two steps are required. 1. Determine the patient's weight in kilograms (kg). 2. Determine the amount to be given on the basis of the patient's weight in kilograms. Medication administration frequently involves the need to determine the concentration (dose) of medication per milliliter of solution. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Safe Dosage Range It is important to verify that a specific ordered medication dosage falls within the medication manufacturer's safety parameters. To determine this: 1. Calculate the patient 's weight in kilograms. 2. Multiply the number of kilograms by the dosage ordered per kilogram. 3. Check the medication package insert (prepared by the drug manufacturer and included in the medication package), your hospital's formulary, or with a pharmacist t o determine the safe dose range for that drug. 4. Multiply your patient's weight by the minimum daily dose and then by the maximum daily dose. If the dose ordered falls between the minimum and maximum daily doses, then the dose ordered is considered to be wi thin the safe dosage range.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. KEY RESOURCES Dimensional Analysis Method The dimensional analysis method utilizes factor labeling to calculate the dose of medication to be administered. It is important that you memorize the most common conversions before you b egin to implement this method. The three factors utilized to calculate medication doses are the drug label factor, conversion factor, and drug order factor. The drug label factor is referred to as \"V\" (the form of the on -hand medication you want to admini ster and its dose in grams, milligrams, micrograms, grains, milliliters, units, etc.). Examples of drug label factors are as follows: 1 capsule = 250 mg 1 tablet = 4 mg 5 mL = 10 units The conversion factor allows you to build into the mathematical equat ion the conversions you need to calculate the correct medication dosage. The drug order factor refers to the desired dose to be administered. The dimensional analysis method uses the following formula: V (the form you want to administer) = V (vehicle) X C (H) X D H (on hand) C (D) 1 (drug label) (conversion (drug factor) order) Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The anterior pituitary gland produces thyroid -stimulating hormone (T and triiodothyronine (T 3). epinephrine and mineralocort icoids, such as aldosterone. The pancreas secretes insulin and glucagon. Patient Assessment Endocrine complaints can include fatigue, weakness, polyuria, polydipsia, electrolyte imbalances, weight changes, and mental status changes. Ensure the patient's ai rway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and assess the neurologic status. Work to identify a stressor or precipitating event. Diabetic Emergencies Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) results from the depletion of circulating insulin and can cause hyperglycemia, dehydration, electrolyte depression, and metabolic acidosis. o It usually develops in younger type 1 diabetics in less than 2 days and may be triggered by infection, illness, stress, substance abuse, or noncompliance with the insulin regimen. o Initial signs a nd symptoms include polydipsia, polyuria, fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. Later findings include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal cramps, decreased level of consciousness, hyperthermia, Kussmaul respirations, and fruity breath odor. o Management req uires monitoring, oxygen, fluids, regular insulin, electrolytes, and possibly other treatments. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life -threatening emergency marked by an extremely increased blood glucose level, hyperosmolarity, and little or no ketosis . o It usually develops in older type 2 diabetics over days or even weeks and may be triggered by infection, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, treatment noncompliance, undiagnosed diabetes, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Presenting signs and symptoms are subtle and include vague abdominal pain, anorexia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Later findings include headaches, blurred vision, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, coma, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and hypotension. o Management requires oxygen, fluids, regular insulin, potassium, continuous cardiac monitoring, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Hypoglycemia is a life -threatening emergency marked by a low blood glucose level. o It usually affects patients wit h type 1 diabetes and may result from iatrogenic insulin effects, pancreatic tumors, adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, congenital metabolic disorders, diet, physical stress, liver disease, pregnancy, alcohol, change in insulin or antidiabetic agents, or certa in medications. o The most dramatic effects of hypoglycemia are neurologic alterations, such as abnormal mentation, irritability, confusion, difficulty speaking, ataxia, paresthesias, headaches, and stupor. o For a conscious patient with an intact gag reflex, treatment calls for the oral administration of 10 to 15 g rams of simple carbohydrate. For a lethargic or unconscious patient, treatment requires intravenous dextrose (preferred) or intramuscular glucagon. All patients need frequent blood glucose measuremen t. Alcoholic Ketoacidosis Alcoholic ketoacidosis is an acute metabolic emergency that occurs 24 to 36 hours after an alcoholic patient abruptly stops drinking. It causes an increased ketone level and a high anion gap as well as abdominal pain and tendernes s; nausea ; vomiting ; signs of alcohol withdrawal ; tachypnea ; tachycardia ; altered mental status ; cool , dry skin ; and a breath odor of ketones. Treatment includes 5% dextrose in normal saline solution, potassium, magnesium, thiamine, close monitoring, seizu re precautions, and supportive care. Pituitary Disorders Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by polyuria and a urine osmolarity of less than 200 mOsm/kg and can be life threatening. It takes one of two forms. o Central diabetes insipidus is linked to im paired secretion or release of antidiuretic hormone, which can result from head trauma, surgery, tumors, or idiopathic or genetic causes. Treatment calls for fluids and hormone replacement. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the ki dneys cannot properl y concentrate urine, which usually results from a genetic or acquired disorder. Treatment requires correcting hypokalemia and hypercalcemia, discontinuing causative drugs, giving thiazide diuretics, and restricting salt intake. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) causes the pituitary gland to release excess antidiuretic hormone. o Causes include central nervous system or pulmonary diseases, carcinomas, drugs, and idiopathic causes. o The syndrome is marked by dilutional hy ponatremia, which decreases urine output while causing fluid overload. Other findings include weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal and muscle cramps, sudden weight gain without edema, headache, fatigue, and serious neurologic alterations. o Manage ment depends on the severity of hyponatremia, but may include free water restriction, intake and output monitoring, hypertonic saline solution, loop diuretics, and demeclocycline (Declomycin). Thyroid Emergencies Hyperthyroidism is charact erized by an over active thyroid gland and excess thyroid hormone production. Causes include Graves disease, thyroid tumors or nodules, thyroiditis, thyroid hormone ingestion, and certain drugs. o Thyroid storm is an acute, life -threatening complication of p oorly managed hype rthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. o Thyroid storm causes severe hypermetabolism with hyperthermia, agitation, tachydysrhythmias, and tremors. Other signs and symptoms include altered mental status, delirium, syncope, coma, exhaustion, and cardiac failure. o beta -blockers, propylthiouracil, cooling blankets, fluids, and Myxedema coma is characterized by a hypoactive thyroid gland and slowed metabolism. It may be due to autoimmune thyroiditis, ablation therapy, iodine deficiency, tumor activity, drug therapy, and pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction. o Signs and symptoms include fatigue , decreased activity tolerance, shortness of breath, weight gain, tongue swelling, progressive mental deterioration, psychiatric symptoms, weak respiratory effort, respiratory failure, cardiac changes, wide ST segments and T waves, prolonged QT intervals, cool , pale skin, low body temperature, and other effects. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Management requires thyroid hormone replacement, mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, warm blankets or heated humidified mist, and supportive care. Adrenal Disorders Acute adrenal insufficiency is a rare, life -threatening depletion of adrenal glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. It can result from Addison disease, sudden withdrawal of long -term steroid therapy, adrenal gland removal or injury, pituitary gland destruction, and such factors as stress, trauma, surgery, or infection. o Signs and symptoms may be insidious, such as headache, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, palpitations, and gastrointestinal disturbances. With adrenal crisis, they may include sudden pain in the abd omen, lower back, or legs; severe vomiting and diarrhea; high fever; dehydration; hypotension; decreased level of consciousness; and electrolyte imbalances. o The cornerstones of treatment are management of the ABCs, glucocorticoid replacement, and correctio n of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine -producing tumor in the adrenal medulla. o Manifestations result from excess catecholamines and include severe hypertension (along with headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis), vision disturbances, fatigue, anxiety, pallor, tremors, fever, chest and abdominal pain, and mental status changes. o Management calls for control of the effects of excess catecholamines, alpha -blockers, continuous cardiac monitoring, and intravenous fluids. Cushing syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to increased glucocorticoid levels, usually from exogenous steroid administration. o This typically causes a cushingoid appearance with moon face, buffalo hump, and fat deposits above the clavicles. o Cushing syndrome is not an emergency, but excess glucocorticoids can have multisystem consequences and increase the risk of adrenal crisis if steroids are abruptly stopped (or not increased during an acute illness).

LESSON OUTLINE Heat -related Emergencies Heat edema occurs in nonacclimated people during prolonged standing or sitting. It causes foot and ankle swelling that resolves in a few days with rest, elevation, and support hose. Heat cramps are severe cramps in specific muscles after exertion in a hot, humid environment. It results from salt depletion and excess water consumption and is treated with removal from heat, rest, and electrolytes. Heat exhaustion results from prolonged heat exposure that causes dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Extreme t hirst occurs rapidly. Treatment calls for a cool environment, clothing removal, moist cloths, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and temperature and cardiac monitoring. Heat exhaustion may progress to heat stroke. Heat stroke , the most emergent and life -threatening heat illness, is marked by a temperature of 104F (40C) and neurologic changes. Old age, some drugs, and other factors increase the risk of heat stroke. Management aims to rapidly reduce the core temperature and treat complications. In the ED, aggressive cooling measures include ice water gastric or peritoneal lavage, tepid water sprays, cooling blankets, and other interventions until the rectal temperature is 102F (39C) or less. Cold -related Emergencies Chilblains are the painful inflammation of small blood vessels in the skin that occur as a result of sudden warming from cold temperatures. They cause local areas of itching, redness, and recurrent edema on exposed or poorly insulated body parts. It is pai nless but may evolve into plaques or sma ll ulcerations. Treatment calls for using a warm environment, gradually warming the affected parts, and protecting them from further cold -related injury. Nonfreezing cold injury causes peripheral tissue damage in cold, wet feet. The feet are cold, damp, numb, and edematous. Repeat exposure can lead to lymphangitis, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, and liquefaction gangrene. Treatment requires drying the feet and gradually rewarming them. Frostbite occurs when ice crystals form in intracellular spaces, which ca n cause irreversible damage. If the patient also has hypothermia, treatment of hypothermia takes priority. o In superficial frostbite, injured tissue is friable. Apply warm soaks, elevate the extremity, keep the room warm, and maintain bed rest for days. o In deep frostbite, skin changes can progress to blisters, edema, mottling, and eventually gangrene. To maintain tissue viability, perform rapid rewarming under controlled conditions in the emergency department. If severe vasoconstriction occurs, prepare for a n escharotomy. Hypothermia occurs when the core temperature drops and cellular activity and organ function progressively decrease. This commonly causes central nervous system and cardiovascular effects, including atrial and ventricular fibrillation. Hypoth ermia may be mild, moderate, or severe. As appropriate, perform active or passive rewarming using internal or external techniques. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Drowning Drowning refers to respiratory impairment due to submersion in liquid. Risk factors include alcoho l intoxication, boating, seizure disorders, and others. Outcome severity depends on the duration of submersion, water temperature, and time until basic life support is performed. Complications are mainly pulmonary but may include cardiovascular, neurologic , hematologic, and renal problems. o Signs and symptoms include decreased or increased respirations, decreased heart rate and blood pressure, cold skin, dilated pupils, hypothermia, and vomiting. o In the hospital, focus on stabilizing the airway, breathing, a nd circulation and continuing rewarming. The most important factor in determining the outcome is the patient's response to resuscitation. Diving Emergencies Arterial gas embolism is the most serious and dangerous diving emergency. Exhaling during a control led, slow ascent prevents air embolism. This emergency appears seconds to minutes after ascent. o The classic presentation is a sudden onset of unconsciousness within minutes of reaching the surface after a dive. Depending on where the air bubbles lodge, the patient may have signs of myocardial infarction, neurologic problems, spinal injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or o Treatment may require intubation, positive -pressure ventilation, 100% oxygen, needle thoracentesis, left lat eral positioning, advanced life support, recompression, and hyperbaric oxygen chamber therapy. Nitrogen narcosis occurs when nitrogen becomes dissolved in a solution. It causes neurodepressant effects (similar to those of alcohol) that usually begin at dep ths of 100 feet or more and resolve with ascent. Decompression sickness results from rapid ascent, when nitrogen bubbles obstruct blood flow and impair tissue perfusi on. Effects include cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, joint pain, and neurologic signs and symptoms. Treatment requires high -flow oxygen, fluid replacement, steroids, aspirin, and symptomatic care. Definitive treatment is recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The squeeze occurs when air is trapped in hollow chambers, such as the ears, sinuses, pulmonary tree, gastrointestinal tract, and teeth. If the diver descends deeply without exhalation, it can cause severe, sharp pain. Treatment depends on th e severity and affected area, but may include decongestants, oral steroids, antibiotics, a nd consultation with an otolaryngologist or dentist. Barotrauma of ascent is the opposite of the squeeze and produces pain in air -filled chambers during ascent. It su bsides gradually without treatment.

LESSON OUTLINE Bites and Stings The venom from snakebites can cause cardiotoxic, neurotoxic, hemotoxic, or a combination of effects. Local reactions include edema, pain, petechiae, ecchymosis, lo ss of limb function, and necrosis. Systemic reactions include neurologic effects, nausea, vomiting, diaphore sis, syncope, metallic or rubber taste, paralysis, excess salivation, difficulty speaking, vision disturbances, muscle twitching, paresthesia, epistaxis, ptosis, and blood in stool, vomitus, or sputum. o Initially, stabilize the airway, breathing, and circul ation. Keep the patient calm and supine, and initiate cardiac monitoring and intravenous fluids. Immobilize the limb below heart level, remove constrictive jewelry and clothing, mark the border of advancing edema every 15 minutes, and consult the Poison Co ntrol Center. o Continue treatment by cleaning the wound and administering analgesics, tetanus prophylaxis, and antivenin, as ordered. Iguana bites usually are nontoxic. Gila monster and Mexican bearded lizard bites can cause pain and swelling and progress t o systemic reactions, including shock and anaphylaxis. Treatment includes wound care, tetanus prophylaxis, and analgesics. Dog and cat bites are the most common animal bites. Cat bites have a high risk of infection. Dog bites are more likely to cause sever e tissue injury. Treatment for both includes wound cleansing, tetanus prophylaxis, high -pressure irrigation, analgesics, and possibly rabies prophylaxis. Some wounds also need antibiotics. Human bites may cause a laceration, puncture, crush injury, soft -tissue tearing, or amputation. They are more infectious than bites from most other animals. Treatment is similar to that for other animal bites except that all patients with human bites should receive prophylactic antibiotics. Black widow spider bites cause a local reaction within minutes, including pain out of proportion to the size of the single bite. The venom is neurotoxic and may also cause respiratory difficulty, headache, syncope, weakness, chest and abdominal pain, seizures, and shock. The three main treatments are pain relievers (such as opioids), muscle relaxants, and intravenous calcium gluconate. If possible, administer antivenin.

LESSON OUTLINE Brown recluse spider bites cause cytotoxic and hemolytic effects, including necrotic arachnidism that leads to tissue necrosis and skin sloughing. The bite typically is painless and produces a central papule and erythema in 6 to 12 hours. Tre atment is controversial but can include cold compresses, analgesics, limb elevation, and wound cleansing. If indicat ed, treatment may also require antibiotic and tetanus prophylaxis, systemic steroids, and necrotic skin excision. Scorpion stings inject neurotoxic venom that causes immediate local pain, edema, discoloration, hyperesthesia, numbness, and agitation. System ic reactions may range from wheezing and vision disturbances to seizures and anaphylaxis. To manage scorpion stings, apply ice or cool compr esses and local anesthetics. Severe systemic envenomation requires supportive and symptomatic care in a monitored ho spital setting. Hymenopteran stings may be cytotoxic, hemolytic, allergenic, or vasoactive. Except for honeybees, most hymenopterans sting repeatedly. Effects range from local reactions (such as edema of the extremity) to anaphylaxis. Treatment requires im mediate stinger removal followed by ice application and antihistamines for severe reactions. Tick bites can cause several d iseases. Principal management consists of prompt tick removal followed by supportive therapy. o Manifestations of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, headache, and a pink, macular or petechial rash. Treatment includes antib iotics. o Lyme disease produces signs and symptoms in three stages. The most effective antibiotic regimen remains controversial. o Tick paralysis is primarily an ascending motor paralysis that develops over 1 to 2 days. After tick removal, manifestations shoul d gradually improve within 48 to 72 hours. Supportive care is required during this time.

ENA: EMERGENCY NURSING ORIENTATION Lesson Notebook: Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Vascular Access Lesson Outline Key Resources Preceptor Exercise s Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review : Water Water has many important metabolic functions. The average adult consumes 1,500 to 2,000 mL of water and excretes 1,500 mL of urine daily. Intracellular fluid contains two -thirds of total body water. Extracellular fluid contains one -third of total body water. Thirst is the primary regulator of water intake. It is triggered by hypothalamic receptors in response to increased plasma osmolality or decreased body fluid volume. Renal regulation of wat er balance affects tonicity and body water. In response to changes in glomerular filtrate tonicity, antidiuretic hormone is secreted or inhibited, reabsorption or excretion. Through the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system, the kidneys r egulate the volume of body water. Anatomy and Physiology Review : Electrolytes Sodium is the principle cation (positively charged electrolyte) in the extracellular fluid. It is primarily responsible for osmotic pressure. The sodium level is maintained by th e renin -angiotensin - aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, and a system mediated by atrial natriuretic factor. Chloride is the principle anion (negatively charged electrolyte) in the extracellular fluid. The serum chloride level is passively regul ated by the serum sodium level and is inversely related to the bicarbonate level. Potassium is the most abundant cation and exists mainly in the intracellular fluid. It is primarily responsible for cell membrane potential and is part of the sodium -potassiu m pump. The distal and collecting tubules in the kidneys control the potassium level. Calcium exists mainly in bones. When it moves into the blood, half is bound to plasma proteins and half is ionized and metabolically active. Calcium is needed for muscle contractions, bone and brain metabolism, clotting, and lung surfactant. Parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and vitamin D regulate the calcium level. Phosphorus is essential for carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. A delicate balance between calcium a nd phosphorus is needed to promote bone density and prevent osteoporosis. Parathyroid hormone regulates the phosphorus level. Magnesium is the second most important intracellular cation. Renal tubular reabsorption may regulate the magnesium level.

LESSON OUTLINE Fluid Imbalances Water imbalances may result from underlying diseases, iatrogenic causes, environmental factors, or psychological abnormalities. Water deficiency is almost always associated with a loss of sodium. Treatment typically includes infus ion of normal saline (0.9%) solution or half -normal (0.45%) saline solution. Solutions may be: o Isotonic, which keep more fluid in the vascular space o Hypotonic, which shift fluid into the intracellular space o Hypertonic, which shift fluids from the cells to the extravascular space o Crystalloid, which increase the intravascular volume through the volume given o Colloid, which pull fluid into the vascular space through osmosis. Blood and blood products are natural colloids used to replace blood losses and replenis h clotting factors. Water excess has various causes. Treatment aims to remove fluid without causing electrolyte abnormalities and usually requires diuretics and fluid restriction. Electrolyte Imbalances The anion gap calculates the balance between positive and negative electrolytes with this formula: Na+ - (Cl- - HCO 3-). The reference range is 10 to 14 mmoL/L. Sodium abnormalities usually occur with chloride abnormalities. Hyponatremia is common and may be treated with normal saline solution, hypertonic (3% ) saline solution, and furosemide (Lasix). of hypernatremia aims to restore fluid volume and osmolarity orally or intravenously (with dextrose 5% in water or hypotonic saline solution). Hypochloremia requires replacement of chloride and sodium an d careful monitoring of electrolyte levels. Hyperchloremia receives the same treatment as hypernatremia. Hypokalemia is treated with potassium supplements. Intravenous supplements are administered slowly and with an infusion pump to prevent cardiac dysrhyt hmias. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes calcium chloride or gluconate to rapidly neutralize neuromuscular effects; glucose, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate to reduce the serum potassium level; and beta 2-agonists, diuretics, or an ion exchange resin, if n eeded. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Calcium abnormalities usually occur with phosphorus and magnesium abnormalities. Hypocalcemia is easily managed with intravenous calcium but requires careful monitoring of the calcium level, cardiac rhythm, and blood pressure. Treatment of hypercalcemia depends on the cause but usually includes intravenous hydration, diuretics, and possibly glucocorticoids. Phosphate imbalances are associated with a reciprocal calcium imbalance. Mild hypophosphatemia may call for oral supplement s and a high -phosphorus diet. Severe hypophosphatemia may require intravenous sodium or potassium phosphate. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia demands phosphate restriction, an oral phosphate -binding drug, saline, and diuretics. Magnesium abnormalities common ly accompany other electrolyte abnormalities. Mild hypomagnesemia can be corrected with oral supplements and a high -magnesium diet. Severe hypomagnesemia may require intravenous or intramuscular magnesium saline and hemodialysis. Vascular Access The choice of vascular access site depends on the urgency of the situation, the condition of the patient's veins, and the characteristics of solutions o r medications to be infused. Peripheral vascular access is used routinely and is a basic nursing skill. Central venous access may be used for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, infusing certain concentrated or vasoactive medications, or gaining access when p eripheral access is not easily obtained. Intraosseous access (needle insertion into bone marrow) is also used for emergent vascular access when peripheral access cannot be readily obtained.

They care for the physical, psychological, and social trauma that occurs in patien ts who have been assaulted or abused. Forensic nurses also have a specialized knowledge of the legal system and collect evidence, provide medical testimony in court, and provide consultation to legal authorities.\" Nurses with forensic trai ning provide care to patients whose reasons for being in the emergency department are likely to lead to a civil or criminal proceeding, legal hearing, or arbitration. History of Forensic Nursing Forensic nursing began in the early 1980s and is linked to sc ientific developments in clinical forensic medicine. The seeds of forensic nursing were sown at least 10 years earlier with the rape victim advocate movement and the creation of the first sexual assault forensic evidence kits. Emergency Nurse Roles and Res ponsibilities In the United States, all 50 states and the District of Columbia require emergency nurses and other healthcare professionals to report the suspected maltreatment of children and older or dependent adults. Fewer states mandate the reporting of intimate partner violence or crimes in general. It is important to know the reporting requirements in the jurisdiction where you work. Nursing documentation is valuable as forensic evidence and should provide an accurate, unbiased picture of what you hear , see, and smell when providing patient care. The consistent organization of documentation leads to reliable routines: o When documenting the patient's history, include patient statements in direct quotations , whenever possible. In the medical record, patient statements and excited utterances (spontaneous statements made under duress) may be medical exceptions to hearsay in court. o Avoid sanitizing patient statements or substituting medical terms. Record patient statements verbatim . o Remain objective in your documentation. Replace terms such as alleged and claimed with reported or suspected . Instead of using the term refused , use declined, said, stated, or reported . As the first person to come in contact with victims of violence, you must recognize, collec t, and preserve the forensic evidence . Keep in mind that the first priority is to ensure that the patient is medically stable. The Emergency Nurses Association identifies forensics as a part of emergency nursing practice. Forensic evidence is any tangible item or recorded material that is pertinent to the legal proceedings of the court . It may be tangible, intangible, or trace evidence.

LESSON OUTLINE Always wear gloves when collecting and handling evidence to prevent contamination. o Semen may be collected from a p repubescent patient's body up to 24 hours after the incident but may linger on clothing longer. Semen may be collected from adult patients many days after an assault and may extend the time for collecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DN A) evidence up to 1 week, depending on the jurisdiction. o To preserve evidence on clothing , do not cut through damages areas. Place two clean sheets on the floor and lay each piece of patient clothing separately on the top sheet. Collect the top sheet and t he sheet from the ambulance stretcher and hospital stretcher. Place each piece of clothing in a separate paper bag, seal it with tape, date and initial the tape, and document the clothes that were collected, including a brief description. o Assess for stains on the pati ent's skin. If detected, swab each stain with a sterile, cotton - tipped applicator that is moistened with sterile water. Air dry the swab, pack it in a clean envelope, write the stain's appearance and location on the envelope, and initial over t he tape. o If a patient has firearm injuries, place paper bags over the patient's hands until law enforcement officials can test them for gunpowder residue . o Collect other debris on a sheet of folded, clean white paper, using a swab or rubber -tipped forceps. Refold the paper and place it in an envelope as you would handle a swab. For minute debris, collect it with transparent tape, place the tape on a glass slide, wrap it in white paper, and then seal and label it. o Use rubber -tipped forceps to collect bullets or other projectiles . Place each projectile in a separate, small rigid container with sterile gauze and put holes in the lid. Do not label bullet wounds and entrance or exit wounds. o Handle needles and knives with great care, using rubber -tipped forceps. Pa ckage them in cardboard boxes or tubes, glass tubes, or gauze -filled specimen containers with air holes. A forensic evidence recovery kit should be available in the ED. The kit should contain all the supplies needed to collect and preserve clothing, swabs, debris, projectiles, and other physical evidence along with a procedure manual for evidence collection. To be accepted in court, physical evidence must be accompanied by documentation that demonstrates the item's location and the responsible party at all times. If the chain of custody is not maintained or documented, an entire case may be lost. Each time the evidence changes hands, such as turning evidence over to a police officer, a receipt must be generated and signed by both parties. Such a paper trail demonstrates a continuous chain in the custody of the evidence, and each individual who has contact with the evidence becomes a link in that chain. o To accurately document the location of injuries or physical evidence, include a body diagram or map and photographs along with the written or computerized nursing note. o On a body diagram , clearly include the location and type of injury or evidence collected as well as a brief description . Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Photographs should n ot replace body diagrams because th ey may be lost or poorly representative. Take a series of photographs, following the rule of thirds . To begin, photograph the front of the patient from 6 feet away. Next, photograph the patient's injury one-third the distance (4 feet away) and finally take a close -up at one -third the distance (2 feet away) with and without a scale, such as a ruler or penny. Use the correct medical -forensic terms when describing wounds. o Bruises result from blunt or compressive forces that damage blood vessels, which lead to bleeding under the skin or in another organ. o Ecchymosis is usually caused by a slow, hemorrhagic blood leak into the skin due to aging, medications, or a m edical or hematolog ic disorder. o Lacerations result from the tearing or splitting of the skin or another organ by a blunt or shearing force. o Cuts or incisions are caused by cutting the skin or another organ with a sharp object, such as a knife or scalpel. o Ligature strangulati on takes place when a cordlike object is wrapped around the neck and tightened. Common ligatures include ropes, electrical wires, telephone cords, clothes, torn sheets, and even very long hair. Ligature strangulation usually leaves a ligature mark that is a combination of a compression bruise and an abrasion. o Manual strangulation occurs when the assailant compresses the patient's neck using some part of his or her body, such as the hands or arms (as in a headlock). Visible injuries to the neck after manual strangulation can be rare . A loss of bowel and bladder control is common in patients strangled to unconsciousness or near -unconsciousness. Close supervision and monitoring for 24 hours is recommended while watching for respiratory complications. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs fluids and nutrients and stores and eliminates wastes. The esophagus moves food by peristalsis. The lower esophageal sphincter prevents regurgitation of stomach contents into the esophagus. The stomach stores food and combines it with gastric juices. The pyloric sphincter controls food movement from the stomach to the duodenum. The small intestine absorbs nutrients and other produ cts of digestion and transports residue to the large intestine, which absorbs water and electrolytes and forms and stores feces. The liver performs many metabolic functions, such as nutrient metabolism, gluconeogenesis, drug metabolism, and bile production . The pancreas secretes insulin, regulates the glucose level, and secretes pancreatic juices. The gallbladder collects , concentrates, and stores bile. The peritoneum supports the abdominal organs and acts as a conduit for their blood and lymph vessels and nerves. This semipermeable, serous membrane covers the liver, spleen, stomach, and intestines. Assessment Abdominal pain is a common chief complaint in the emergency department and may be related to gastrointestinal, urinary, or reproductive disorders. For systematic pain assessment, a useful tool i s the PQRST mnemonic, which stands for provokes, quality, radiation, severity, and time. Conduct an abdominal examination in this order: inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. Complete auscultation before percussion and palpation because percussion and palpation can alter bowel sounds. Findings that accompany abdominal pain may include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever and chills, feces or blood in emesis, diarrhea, black or clay -colored stools, and fatty, foul -smelling, frothy stools. These additional findings can help identify the cause of the pain. Specific Gastrointestinal Emergencies Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract and may cause bright -red blood or black , \"coffee ground\" material in vomitus as well as bright -red blood in stools or black, tarry stools.

LESSON OUTLINE Upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be variceal (usually from portal hypertension) or nonvariceal bleeding (usually from esophageal or duodenal erosion). Variceal bleeding may cause weakness, low - grade fever, right upper quadrant pain, and hypotension. Nonvariceal bleeding may cause hematemesis, melena, pallor, and hypovolemia. o Initial management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding calls f or oxygen, fluids, cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, catheterization, and gastric lavage. o Tests include complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, coagulation, radiography, and electrocardiography. o Endoscopy can identify the site of upper gas trointestinal bleeding and control bleeding. Medications and surgery may also be used to stop the bleeding. o Complications include aspiration, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and hypovolemic shock. Lower gastrointestinal bleeding may result from hemorrhoids , diverticula, angiodysplasia, colonic polyps, and colon cancer. Its cardinal sign is hematochezia. Other manifestations include abdominal pain, painless bleeding, hypovolemia, and diarrhea. o Management of severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding requires hos pitalization for fluid resuscitation, diagnosis, and treatment. Once stable, the patient may undergo colonoscopy, radionuclide imaging, or mesenteric angiography. o Anticipate e ndoscopic therapy and treatment for diverticula, angiodysplasia, and hemorrhoids. Surgery may be needed for exsanguination. In gastroesophageal reflux disease, reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus causes mucosal damage. Typical symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, and dysphagia. Other manifestations may inclu de chest pain; nocturnal choking; sleep apnea; recurrent pneumonia or ear, nose, and throat infections; loss of dental enamel; and chronic halitosis. o When gathering the history, ask about medications, disorders, and foods that may lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease. o After eliminating more serious disorders, ED management includes antacids, histamine 2- receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors.

LESSON OUTLINE Appendicitis usually results from obstruction of the appendiceal lumen and can lead to rupture into the peritoneum. o Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain (especially the classic pain at McBurney's point), nausea, vomiting, malaise, anorexia, tachycardia, chills, and fever. o Testing may include white blood cell count, ultrasonography, comp uted tomography, and urinalysis. o Definitive therapy for appendicitis is surgery. Complications can include perforation, peritonitis, and abscess formation. Acute cholecystitis involves inflammation of the gallbladder and is usually associated with gallston e disease. The phrase \"fair, fat, fertile, flatulent, 40 - or 50 -year -old female\" summarizes the major risk factors for gallstone development. o The primary symptom is sudden, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, usually after eating fried or fatty foods. Other manifestations may include low -grade fever, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, jaundice, and weight loss. o A wide range of tests may be ordered, including complete blood count, urinalysis, serum electrolyte iminodiacetic acid scanning. o Definitive treatment for cholecystitis is surgery. Interventions may include administration of crystalloids, antiemetics, opioids, and antibiotics; nasogastric tube insertion; and monitoring of vital signs and fluid intake and output. Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas. Although the exact cause is unknown, it is characterized by the release of activated digestive enzymes into the pancreas and surroundin g tissues. This causes tissue damage in the pancreas and nearby structures and may lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. o A clinical hallmark of pancreatitis is abdominal pain that originates in the epigastric region and radiates to the back. Other signs and symptoms include abdominal and rebound tenderness, guarding, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, low -grade fever, tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and hypoactive or absent bowel sounds. o Besides serum amylase and lipase levels and ot her blood tests, the patient may undergo radiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography. o Management calls electrolytes, antiemetics, analgesics, When diverticula become inflamed, diverticulitis develops. Inflammation occurs when fecal matter becomes trapped in the pouches, causing trauma to the intestinal lining. Infection commonly results. o Signs and symptoms include persistent pain in the left lower quadrant, cramping, constipation, and (with infection) fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. o Tests may involve complete blood count, urinalysis, abdominal and barium enema radiography, and computed tomography. o Treatment may call for rehydration, bowel rest, gastric tube insertion, preparation for surgery, and administration of anticholinergics, opioids, and antibiotics.

Bowel obstruction may be partial or complete and mechanical (as from intussusception) or nonmechanical (as in paraly tic ileus). The most common cause is adhesions from abdominal surgery. o Signs and symptoms vary with the obstruction's location. Abdominal pain may be severe, colicky, crampy, intermittent, and wavelike. Other findings may include abdominal distention, tend erness, and rigidity; constipation; hyperactive and hypoactive bowel sounds below the obstruction, respectively); fever; tachycardia; hypotension; nausea; and vomiting. o Tests include complete blood count and other blood tests, arterial blood gas analysis, radiography, and computed tomography. o Management includes administration of fluids, electrolytes, and antibiotics; monitoring of abdominal changes, pain, and fluid intake and output; gastric tube insertion; and preparation for surgery. o Life-thre atening complications include peritonitis, bowel strangulation or perforation, renal aspiration, hypovolemia, and intestinal ischemia or infarction. Acute gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestinal lining caused by vira l, protozoal, bacterial, or parasitic agents. o Signs and symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, hyperactive bowel sounds, fever, headaches, and anal excoriation from diarrhea. o Laboratory tests may include complete blood count, el ectrolyte levels, and stool cultures. o Treatment requires identifying the causative agent and resting the gastrointestinal tract. Expect to replace fluid and electrolytes and administer antiemetics. As soon as diarrhea subsides, start the modified BRAT die t, with bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review In the female reproductive system, external genitalia include the Bartholin and Skene glands. Internal genitalia include the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The last three structures are located inside the peritoneal cavity. The female reproductive cycle consists of ovulation and menstruation. Changes in hormone levels prepar e the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. If the ovum is not fertilized, the endometrium sheds the inner lining as menstrual flow. The average menstrual cycle occurs once every 28 days, and menstruation lasts 2 to 7 days. Assessment To obtai n an accurate history, the nurse must establish a rapport with the patient and ensure confidentiality and privacy because many people consider this a sensitive topic. During the interview, ask about menstruation, current vaginal bleeding, sexual activity, pain during sex, pregnancy, birth control, vaginal discharge, other vaginal symptoms, and any additional problems. Because a woman may have blood loss and hypovolemia, ensure the ABCs, assessing for hemodynamic changes. Then perform a focused evaluation of the abdomen. As ordered, obtain specimens for diagnostic tests, such as urinalysis, pregnancy test, complete blood count and other blood tests, and cultures for sexually transmitted infections. Also prepare for ultrasonography, computed tomography, and ma gnetic resonance imaging, as indicated. Specific Gynecologic Emergencies Vaginal bleeding is excessive when it saturates more than eight pads or twelve tampons per day. On average, a tampon holds about 5 mL of blood; a pad holds about 5 to 15 mL. o Types of abnormal vaginal bleeding include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and menometrorrhagia. In nonpregnant women, abnormal vaginal bleeding can result from hormonal imbalances, gynecologic or systemic disorders, trauma, infections, malig nancies, drugs, and other causes. o Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding. It is confirmed only after organic and structural causes have been ruled out. Usually, it results from anovulation. o After obtaining a hi story of past and current menstruation and other data, obtain specimens and prepare for pelvic or intravaginal ultrasonography. o For a hemodynamically unstable patient, focus on resuscitation and stabilization. For a stable one, teach about oral contracepti ves and iron supplements if prescribed and refer to a gynecologist for further evaluation.

LESSON OUTLINE Pelvic (lower abdominal) pain has many causes and may be acute, cyclic, or chronic. o Primary dysmenorrhea is marked by crampy, low, midline pain due t o prostaglandin - mediated uterine contractions and arteriolar spasms. It typically causes pain that precedes menstrual flow by up to 24 hours and subsides after menses begins. Management calls for nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs. o Secondary dysmenorrhea is characterized by cyclic menstrual pain associated with pelvic pathology, such as endometriosis. Both types of dysmenorrhea require gynecologic referral. Endometriosis commonly causes cyclic pain when endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. A defin itive diagnosis of endometriosis typically requires laparoscopy. However, common ED tests include pregnancy test, complete blood count, and urinalysis. As ordered, manage pain with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and opioids. Mittelschmerz is characterized by sudden, sharp, unilateral pelvic pain with ovulation. Expect to provide antiprostaglandin therapy with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs for pain relief. Ovarian cysts are fluid -filled or semi -fluid -filled sacs in an ovary. o Follicular c ysts develop during the first 2 weeks of the menstrual cycle, cause pelvic discomfort, and regress spontaneously over 1 to 3 months. If ruptured, they cause sudden, sharp pelvic pain that resolves over a few days. o Less commonly, corpus luteal cysts develop in the latter half of the menstrual cycle and usually regress at the end of the cycle. If ruptured, they produce sharp pelvic pain and bleeding and may lead to hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary and its fallopian tube twist. It causes severe unilateral nausea; vomiting; fever; leukocytosis; flank, back, or groin pain; and rebound pain and guarding. After confirmation by ultrasonography, the disorder requires surgery to untwist the torsion. Analgesics manage pain u ntil surgery occurs. Vaginal discharge normally is odorless and clear to milky white. Infection alters the amount, color, and odor of the discharge and causes itching, burning, or irritation. o Types of vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis (with a thin mal odorous white to gray discharge), vaginal candidiasis (with a thick, odorless, white, cottage cheese -like discharge), and trichomoniasis (with a copious, frothy, malodorous, white to greenish -yellow discharge). o Oral or intravaginal antibiotic selection dep ends on the type of vaginitis and infecting organism. Pelvic inflammatory disease is an infection of the upper reproductive tract, usually as a result of an ascending sexually transmitted infection. o Signs and s ymptoms include lower abdominal or pelvic pain that increases with movement (causing the PID shuffle), mucopurulent vaginal discharge, vaginal or postcoital bleeding, dyspareunia, fever, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. Gynecologic examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness, mucopurulent cervicitis, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. o Because complications include tuboovarian abscess, infertility, and perihepatic inflammation, treatment requires analgesics and outpatient or inpatient therapy with antibiotics. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Tuboovarian abscess occurs when bacteria invade a disrupted ovarian capsule. With rupture, bacteria spill into the peritoneal space, which may lead to bacteremia and septic shock. Effects include a high fever, severe pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, purulen t vaginal discharge, and vaginal bleeding. Treatment calls for hospital admission, analgesics, intravenous antibiotics, and surgery for incision and drainage. Bartholin's glands may develop a cyst, a painless lump that resolves with warm sitz baths. A Bart holin's gland abscess is a primary infection of the gland that causes pain when sitting or walking, increasing labial pain, labial swelling and redness, and a palpable mass that is red, tender, and fluctuant. Treatment may include incision and drainage, wo rd catheter placement, wound culture, sitz baths, analgesics, and gynecologic follow -up. Although most sexually transmitted infections are preventable, they commonly occur. Without treatment, they can cause such complications as salpingitis, infertility, s pontaneous abortion, puerperal or perinatal infection, cancer, and hepatitis. o Genital herpes usually is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2, which may produce painful grouped vesicles or ulcerative and crusted lesions as well as fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, lymphadenopathy, dysuria, and urine retention. Treatment calls for antivirals, analgesics, and sitz baths. The patient is likely to experience recurrences and should avoid sex during these periods. o The h uman papillomavirus is responsible for gen ital warts, which typically are single or multiple papular eruptions in cauliflower -like, plaquelike, or other shapes. Their color may vary from skin -toned to erythematous or hyperpigmented. Treatment aims to remove symptomatic warts (by cryotherapy, electrodessication, or other methods) and to induce wart -free periods. A vaccine is available to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the human papillomavirus in females. o Chancroid results fro m Haemophilus ducreyi and causes a papule or pustule that then becomes a painful shallow ulcer surrounded by an erythematous ring. Related signs and symptoms include dyspareunia, vaginal discharge, fever, weakness, and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes). The patient should receive appropriate antibiotics and should avoid sex until the ulcers are healed. o Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum and occurs in three distinct phases. The primary phase causes a single, painless genital ulcer (chancre) and nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy. The secondary phase produces a dull symmetric rash on the palms and soles, fever, chills, lethargy, patchy alopecia, lymphadenopathy, loss of the lateral third of the eyebrows, and nonspecific findings. The tertiary (la tent) phase produces findings that range from meningitis to dementia to thoracic aneurysm. Treatment requires penicillin G benzathine, doxycycline, or tetracycline.

LESSON OUTLINE o Chlamydial infection is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial inf ection. In most people, it is asymptomatic. However, it may cause dysuria, mild abdominal pain, urethral itching, and vaginal or urethral discharge. Azithromycin or doxycycline may be used to treat the infection. Complications in men differ from those in w omen. o Gonorrhea is the second most common sexually transmitted infection and frequently appears with chlamydial infection. Women with gonorrhea may be asymptomatic carriers or have cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease. In men, gonorrhea is likely to involve the urethra, epididymis, and prostate gland and cause fever, chills, and a rash. Treatment calls for ceftriaxone or cefixime.

The subdural space lies below the dura mater. Hematomas can occur in these areas because the middle meningeal artery is in the epidural space and the bridging veins span the subdural space. Cerebrospinal fluid is made in the choroid plexus, which emerges from blood vessels in the pia mater. The skull contains brain tissue (80%), circulating blood (10%), and cerebrospinal fluid (10%). The brain cannot store oxygen or glucose, but requires a continuous supply of both to function. Intracranial pressure normal ly is 0 to 15 mm Hg. It can be monitored with an invasive device. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is calculated by subtracting the intracranial pressure ( ICP) from the mean arterial pressure (MAP): CPP = MAP - ICP. The CPP should be maintained at 50 to 7 0 mm Hg. Patient Assessment After assessing and managing the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), focus the initial assessment on D (disability). Assess neurologic function by evaluating: o Level of consciousness o Score on the Glasgow Coma Scale , which rates the patient's best eye opening, verbal response, and motor response o Cranial nerves II through XII (For an unconscious patient, assess cranial nerves II [pupillary response], V [corneal reflex], and IX and X [gag reflex].) Observe for early signs of increased intracranial pressure , such as increasing headache or motor deficits, behavior changes, nausea, vomiting, speech or vision disturbances, and sluggish or ovoid pupils. Stay alert for late signs of increased intracranial pressure , such as decreasing responsiveness, impaired brainstem reflexes, decerebrate or decorticate posturing, irregular respirations, fixed and dilated pupils, arrhythmias, and Cushing's triad (systolic hypertension, widening pulse pressure, and bradyca rdia). o Note vital sign changes that suggest increased intracranial pressure. Specific Head Injuries Focal injuries occur in a specific area and are associated with a g rossly observable brain lesion. o Minor focal injuries include scalp lacerati ons and linear skull fractures. o More severe focal injuries include depressed and basilar skull fractures, subdural hematomas. injuries are more widespread and have no grossly observab le brain lesion. Diffuse injuries include: o Mild trau matic brain injury (concussion) o Diffuse axonal injury, which may be mild, moderate, or severe Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Patient Management Primary brain injury occurs at the time of the trauma, when the brain stru cture is damaged. Secondary brain injury develops over hours to days after the primary brain injury as a result of a mismatch between cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate. Priority interventions for preventing secondary brain injury include avoiding: o Hypotension o Hypoxia o Sustained intracranial pressure elevation o Hypothermia or hyperthermia The Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines recommend intracranial pressure monitoring for all patients with a postresuscitation score of 8 or less on the G lasgo w Coma Scale and abnormal computed tomography of the brain. Patients with certain other conditions also require intracranial pressure monitoring. Treatment for increased intracranial pressure should begin when the pressure exceeds 20 mm Hg. Interventions t o reduce intracranial pressure are: o Environmental - Control pain, regulate body temperature, and minimize noxious stimuli, such as noise and light. o Pharmacologic - Administer hyperosmolar therapy, such as with mannitol or hypertonic saline solution , and va sopressors as ordered. o Surgical - Prepare the patient for surgery, such as drilling burr holes. Perform ongoing assessment s of level of consciousness, Glasgow Coma Scale scoring, cranial nerves, and vital signs. o As appropriate, prepare the patient for hospital admission or discharge to home.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review Blood is a suspension of erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), platelets (thrombocytes), and other particles in an aqueous colloid solution. Plasma is a fluid that contains blood cells, electrolytes, and other substances. The primary plasma protein is albumin. Other proteins include globulins and fibrinogen. Erythrocytes transport oxygen and carbon dioxide. Their outer stroma contains antigens A, B, and Rh factor. T he inner stroma contains hemoglobin, which comes in 300 types. Leukocytes defend the body against infection. Six types of leukocytes exist in the blood: neutrophils, eosinophils, plasma cells. Platelets provide hemost asis by clumping at the injury site to form a platelet plug and seal leaking capillaries. Hemostasis prevents blood loss after vascular damage through vasospasm, platelet aggregation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. The coagulation cascade is a complex netw ork of 12 clotting factors. Patient Assessment When obtaining a history, particularly note new -onset fever, weakness, cough, rash, or dyspnea. Ask about spontaneous bleeding or other signs of bleeding and about a personal or family history of hematologic o r oncologic disorders. Obtain a medication and a diet history as well as a history of allergies or toxic exposures. During the physical examination, inspect for skin changes, such as pallor, jaundice, cyanosis, purpura, petechiae, and ulcerations. Also ass ess for changes in other systems, such as joint deformity or limited movement in the musculoskeletal system. Review the results of a complete blood count, including the cell count and the differential count. Hematologic Emergencies Anemia is a decrease in red blood cells or a deficiency in their ability to carry oxygen. o Acute anemia usually is caused by blood loss, such as from trauma, and is treated with oxygen, intravenous fluids, and possibly blood transfusion. o Chronic anemia develops gradually as a resu lt of diminished red blood cell production or increased bone marrow destruction. Patients usually receive outpatient treatment for the underlying cause. Sickle cell disease is an inherited genetic disorder that commonly affects people of African descent. I t causes red blood cells, when deoxygenated, to become sickle shaped and clump together, obstructing capillary blood flow. Factors that increase the risk of sickling include low oxygen levels, dehydration, infection, acidosis, high altitude, cold, and stre nuous exercise. Sickle cell disease causes severe pain and other findings. o Complications include vaso -occlusive , hematologic, and infectious crises, notably acute chest syndrome, priapism, and a shortened life span.

LESSON OUTLINE Leukemia is a malignant disorder of blood and blood -forming organs characterized by excessive, abnormal growth of leukocyte precursors in the bone marrow. o Leukemia may be acute or chronic and lymphoblastic or myelogenous. o Leukemic cells invade the spleen, lymph nodes, and other vascular regions, causing fatigue, fever, weight loss, bone pain, and other findings. Treatment includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, blood transfusion, antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. Thrombocytopenia is an abnormall y decreased platelet count, which can result from sepsis, tumors, severe bleeding, and other causes. o In immune thrombocytopenic purpura, immune autoreactive antibodies can increase platelet destruction. The universal presenting signs are bruising and petec hiae. Treatment usually is unnecessary. o In chronic immune thrombocytopenia, the platelets' life span is shortened to a few hours. Early findings include ecchymoses, menorrhagia, mucous membrane bleeding, and epistaxis. Treatments include prednisone (Deltas one), splenectomy, and other drugs. Hemophilia is a group of clotting disorders, including hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and von Willebrand's disease. Hemophilia is an inherited, sex -linked disorder that almost always affects men. Morbidity and mortality are related to bleeding into an injured site. o Hemophilia causes major bruises and bleeding after even minor trauma. It also can cause hemarthrosis (bleeding into a joint), which can lead to arthritis and joint destruction. Depending on the type of hemophilia, treatment may require fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and clotting factors. o Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is the most common hereditary blood coagulation disorder. Clotting usually affects the veins, leading to thrombi, emboli, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Treatment calls for anticoagulants. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a disorder that involves simultaneous clotting and bleeding. It can be triggered by infection, shock, severe trauma, neoplasm, and obstetric complications. Manifestati ons result from thrombosis and bleeding. o Treatment goals include treating the trigger, restoring tissue perfusion, and balancing clot formation, breakdown, and prevention. Specific treatments include oxygen; intravenous fluids; transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and platelets . ; and possibly heparin . Drotrecogin alfa (Xigris) is no longer recommended . Oncologic Emergencies o In neutropenia, the absolute neutrophil count is decreased, which increases the risk of bacter ial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections. Neutropenia is commonly associated with cancer treatments. o Infection may cause only a fever, yet an infection in a neutropenic patient can result in death within hours. o Antibiotics should be administered immedi ately, even before the laboratory reports the test results. o Tumor lysis syndrome results from massive breakdown of tumor cells, which may occur spontaneously or may result from chemotherapy or radiation therapy. o Leakage of intracellular contents causes ele ctrolyte imbalances, especially hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperuricemia. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Hydration is the most important intervention. Other interventions include administration of sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, allopurinol (Aloprim), phosphate -binding agents, (Proventil), and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate). o Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone occurs when tumors release antidiuretic hormone, leading to fluid retention, hyponatremia, and cellular swelling. Neurologic effects are common, and life-threatening cerebral edema can result. o Treatment includes fluid restriction, hypertonic sodium chloride infusion, diuretic administration, seizure precautions, and pat ient monitoring. o Superior vena cava syndrome occurs when a mechanical obstruction, such as from advanced lung cancer, impedes venous return from the head and arms. o Gradual swelling of the face, neck, or arm may be accompanied by dyspnea, chest pain, and hoarseness. With acute onset, life -threatening cerebral edema and airway obstruction can occur. o Semi -Fowler's positioning promotes breathing and reduces swelling. Treatment depends on the cause but may include chemotherapy \u2014or vascular access removal and fibr inolytic and anticoagulant administration. o Spinal cord compression commonly results from vertebral body erosion due to tumors. Symptomatic spinal cord compression is an emergency because irreversible neurologic damage may occur in hours. o Manifestations may include back pain, leg weakness or paralysis, paresthesias, sensory loss, loss of deep tendon reflexes, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. o In an emergency, treatment includes intravenous dexamethasone (Decadron) and radiation therapy. Otherwise, refer the patient to an oncologist for chemotherapy or percutaneous vertebroplasty. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Types of Influenza Influenza A viruses can cause pandemics (global outbreaks). Influenza A and B viruses can cause outbreaks of seasonal influenza. Influenza C viruses can cause mild illness but not an epidemic or pandemic. Twentieth -Century Pandemics The 1918 Spanish flu was caused by influenza A (H1N1), affected 20% to 40% of the world 's population, and killed 20 million people. It was unusual because it was very deadly and killed young , healthy adults. The 1957 Asian flu was caused by influenza A (H2N2) and occurred in two waves. The first wave affected schoolchildren, young adults, and pregnant women. The second wave affected older adults. The 1968 Hong Kong flu was caused by influenza A (H 3N2) and was milder than the 1957 Asian flu, which may have provided some immunity to those who had been exposed to it. This pandemic peaked near school holidays, which reduced the rate of infection. Recent Pandemic Flu Scares The 1976 H1N1 (swine flu) out break met with a swift response in this country, and vaccine was shipped to state health departments. After more than 40 million people received the vaccine, several developed Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and the vaccination program was suspended. The 1977 H1N1 outbreak spread rapidly and caused epidemic disease in children and adults younger than age 23 worldwide. A similar virus had appeared in 1957 and may have provided some immunity to the 1977 strain in those older than age 23. The 1997 H5N1 (a vian flu) outbreak was unusual because the virus was transmitted directly from chickens to people. Although millions of chickens were slaughtered to prevent the spread, the virus remains dangerous. o The H5N1 virus has met all of the criteria to start a pand emic except the ability to spread efficiently and sustainably among humans. o Avian flu has a relatively long incubation period (2 to 8 days). o Initial signs and symptoms include a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums. Respiratory distress, hoarseness, and pulmonary crackles on inhalation are common findings. o Late signs and symptoms include respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and laboratory abnormalities. o Antivirals, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) , can reduce viral replication and improve survival if given within 48 hours of symptom onset. o No vaccine is available. A vaccine specific to the virus strain causing the pandemic cannot be produced until a new pandemic influenza virus emerges and is ident ified. The 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) outbreak caused such effects as fever, malaise, cough, anorexia, runny nose, sore throat, and gastrointestinal distress. It targeted young adults, pregnant women, and people with obesity or pulmonary disease. Oseltamivir wa s effective if given within the first 48 hours.

LESSON OUTLINE Seasonal Influenza Seasonal influenza is caused by a set of common viruses that infect humans annually. It usually results in mild respiratory illness. The person is contagious 1 day before symptoms occur and 5 to 7 days after they occur. Everyone age 6 months and older should be vaccinated. People with the highest risk of seasonal flu are those under younger than age 5 or older than age 65, pregnant women, and people with a medical disorder , such as asthma or heart disease. Adaptability and Mutation Viruses can mutate and infect species other than the usual host. In reassortment, a single host is coinfected with two strains of the influenza virus, which exchange genetic material with each oth er or with the host. The virus changes quickly and significantly, which can lead to virulence and sudden pandemic. In adaptive mutation, the virus' ability to bind to human cells increases slowly, which is a more gradual process. Preparedness Planning The Department of Health and Human Services has a Pandemic Influenza Plan that reflects international guidelines and matches the National Response Plan. Pandemic planning is a shared responsibility and requires international, national, state, local, corporate, and other plans. The World Health Organization has identified six phases of a pandemic that provide a framework for federal responses. Each country is responsible for surveillance of a novel influenza virus that can be transmitted in humans. Virologic surveillance tracks the actual influenza virus. Disease surveillance tracks influenza - related illnesses and deaths. Criteria for diagnostic evaluation vary with the patient's signs, symptoms, and history. Nonpharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an epi demic in the community. To save lives, focus on reducing transmission. o Mitigation strategies include case containment measures (such as voluntary case isolation and antiviral prophylaxis), social -distancing measures (such as classroom dismissal and distanc ing of adults at work), and infection control measures (such as hand hygiene and cough etiquette). o Antivirals and nonpharmaceutical interventions can delay and flatten the epidemic peak, which allows more time for vaccine development and antiviral producti on. o Matching the intensity of the interventions with the severity of the pandemic helps maximize the public health benefit and minimize negative secondary effects. Healthcare workers may need to take extra precautions to prevent and control influenza in healthcare facilities. o Manage all patients with fever and respiratory symptoms according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. These include using visual alerts, containing respiratory secretions by respiratory hygiene and cough etiq uette, masking and separating people with respiratory symptoms, and taking droplet precautions. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o For patients who have (or are suspected of having) avian or other influenza, use isolation precautions. These include standard, contact, and airborne precautions as well as eye protection. For hospitalized patients, continue these precautions for 14 days after symptom onset, until another diagnosis is established, or until test results indicate no influenza infection. o If you develop fever, resp iratory symptoms, or conjunctivitis within 1 week after caring for a patient with avian or another emerging influenza, seek medical care, notify your facility's occupational health and infection control personnel, stay home for 24 hours after the fever resolves, and practice respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Impact of a Pandemic o A severe influenza pandemic could lead to high l evels of illness, death, social disruption, and economic loss. With many people ill at once, everyday life would be disrupted. Schools and businesses may close, and public transportation and other bas ic services may be interrupted. o Healthcare facilities may be overwhelmed, and nontraditional sites , such as schools , may be used as care centers. Because the supply of antivirals and other materials or equipment may be limited, decisions about who receives them may lead to a public backlash.

LESSON OUTLINE Mechanical Ventilation Indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation include failure to protect o r maintain a patent airway, inadequate oxygenation, and ineffective ventilation. Emergency departments typically use two types of positive pressure ventilators: volume -controlled ventilators (which terminate inspiration after delivering a specific volume o f gas) and pressure - controlled ventilators (which terminate inspiration after achieving a specific pressure). Ventilator modes help maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation and reduce the work of breathing. The physician orders the mode and ventilator settings, including the respiratory rate, tidal volume, fraction of inspired oxygen, inspiratory/expiratory ration, and pressure limits. To prevent lung injury from mechanical ventilation, you may use permissive hypercapnia, setting a low tidal volume and pressure -limited ventilation. For a mechanically ventilated patient, continuously monitor the heart rate, electrocardiogram pattern, end -tidal carbon dioxide level, and pulse oximetry reading. Keep ventilator alarms on at full volume. If an alarm sounds, disconnect the patient; ensure airway, breathing, and circulation; use a self-inflating resuscitation bag, if needed; and troubleshoot the ventilator. Observe for complications of mechanical ventilation, including hypotension, volutrauma, barotrauma, auto -PEEP, oxygen toxicity, and infection (ventilator -associated pneumonia). Invasive Monitoring Arterial blood pressure monitoring provides continuous measurement of the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures. The most common catheter -insertion site is the radial artery. On the arterial waveform, the dicrotic notch separates the systolic and diastolic pressures. Though uncommon, complications can include ischemic tissue necrosis, infection, thrombus, vasospasm, embolus, right -sided heart preload. It helps evaluate fluid status, cardiac function, and the effects of medications and is especially useful in early goal -directed therapy for sepsis. Central venous pressure normally rang es from 2 to 6 mm Hg. Complications usually are associated with line insertion and include pneumothorax, hemothorax, arterial puncture, bleeding, infection, and deep vein thrombosis. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring assesses cardiovascular function via a balloon -tipped, multilumen catheter in the right heart and pulmonary vessels. The catheter measures cardiac parameters, including cardiac output, cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pre ssures, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, systemic vascular resistance, stroke volume, stroke volume index, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Complications may include balloon rupture, knotting, pulmonary artery perforation, thrombus, embolus, dysrhyth mias, and valve damage. Intracranial measures the relationship among the brain's components: cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and brain tissue. When the volume of one component increases, the other(s) must decrease to maintain a normal intracranial pressure of 0 to 15 mm Hg. Monitoring devices include a ventriculostomy catheter, subdural probe or catheter, epidural sensor, intraparenchymal probe, and subdural screw. The reference point for zeroing the intracranial pressure transducer is the foramen of Monro (at the tragus). The threshold for treating increased intracranial pressure varies with the patient's age. Complications include infection; ventricular collapse, herniation, or hemorrhage; fluid or air entering the system; cerebrospinal fluid leakage; and occlusio n.

LESSON OUTLINE Sepsis Sepsis is the leading cause of death in the critical care unit. It exists on a continuum of inflammatory response that includes infection, bacteremia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, a nd multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Sepsis results from a series of complex cellular, humoral, and inflammatory reactions that cause systemic inflammation and coagulation. Diagnosis usually is based on a detailed history and physical assessment finding s. Laboratory test results vary with the stage of sepsis. In the emergency department, the priorities for treating severe sepsis and septic shock are supporting airway, breathing, and circulation; identifying sepsis early; providing early hemodynamic stabi lization and support; identifying the source of the infection; and promptly administering antibiotics. Specific treatments for sepsis include fluid resuscitation, blood pressure control (preferably with norepinephrine or dopamine ), improvement of oxygen delivery with packed red blood cells or dobutamine, administration of broad -spectrum antibiotics until the causative organism is identified; and possibly administration of recombinant activated protein C and hydrocortisone. The nurse should also obtain spe cimens from all sources for culture and sensitivity testing. Treatment of sepsis and septic shock is time dependent and labor intensive and requires close collaboration with the critical care department.

KEY RESOURCES Terms Related to Mechanical Ventila tion Acute lung injury A severe form of acute respiratory distress characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography, a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (pulmonary wedge pressure ) of less than 18 mm Hg, and a PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio of less than 300. Acute respiratory distress syndrome Acute lung injury with a PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio of less than 200. Barotrauma Lung tissue damage due to high airway pressures. Alveolar rupture may lead to pneumo thorax, pulmonary interstitial edema, and pneumomediastinum. Fraction of inspired oxygen The proportion of oxygen in inspired air, which ranges from 0.21 (21%) to 1.0 (100%). The fraction of inspired oxygen of ambient air normally is 0.21. Functional res idual capacity The volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of normal expiration. Ideal body weight The expected weight of a person based on sex and height. For males, this equals 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 ft. For females, this equals 45. 5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 ft. Inspiratory/expiratory ratio The duration of inspiration to expiration. Normally, expiration is passive and twice as long as the active inspiration, and the inspiratory/expiratory ratio is 1:2. Inspiratory flow The rate (in L/min ute) at which a breath is delivered on a ventilator. The higher the flow, the faster the breath is delivered. Inspiratory time The time over which a tidal volume is delivered or a pressure maintained (depending on mode). It is set as inspiratory/expiratory ratio or inspiratory flow. Mean airway pressure The average pressure to which the lungs are exposed over one inspiratory -expiratory cycle. Minute ventilation The volume of air that moves in and out of the lungs in 1 minute. It is the product of the tidal volume and respiratory rate. Peak inspiratory pressure The pressure in the lungs at peak inspiration, as measured on the ventilator manometer. Plateau pressure A constant pressure value maintained during the inspiratory phase of ventilation. It is measured by pressing the pause or hold button during mechanical inspiration. Positive end -expiratory pressure A therapy used in mechanical ventilation to provide constant airway pressure at the end of expiration and increase the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of expiration (functional residual capacity). Ideally, it increases the surface area of the alveoli to decrease blood shunting through the lungs and improve gas exchange. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

KEY RESOURCES Terms Related to Mechanical Ventilatio n Sensitivity The amount of negative pressure that a patient must generate to trigger a mechanical ventilator into the inspiratory phase. Tidal volume The volume of air inspired or expired in a single breath during regular respiration. Volutrauma Volume -related overdistention injury of the alveoli caused by mechanical ventilation. Ventilation/perfusion ratio The ratio of pulmonary alveolar ventilation to pulmonary capillary perfusion, which normally is 0.8. A high ventilation/perfusion indicates dead space ventilation. A low ventilation/perfusion indicates shunt ventilation. Ventilatory rate The volume of air passing through the lungs per minute. Also called frequency.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The face is an intricate arrangement of bones and air -filled cavities that help protect the brain. It is divided into the upper, middle, and lower thirds. Maxillofacial trauma can affect five cranial nerves. o The oculomotor and trochlear nerves (cranial nerves III and IV) control eyeball movement. o The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) governs facial sensation and jaw movement. o The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye and is responsible for abducting the eye. o The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which has five branches, controls facial expression and taste in the an terior tongue. Patient Assessment Because damaged facial structures can cause airway obstruction, the first priority is to assess and secure the airway. To manage the airway, use a bag -mask device to deliver oxygen and assisted ventilations, insert an orop haryngeal or nasopharyngeal airway as needed, and assist with orotracheal intubation. After ensuring the patient's airway and breathing, address circulation and hemorrhage control because facial bleeding can lead to hypovolemia. Methods of controlling blee ding include direct pressure, pressure dressings, ice packs, manual reduction of a severe fracture, and vessel ligation or embolization. Perform a focused assessment of the face, including the soft tissues, bones, symmetry, mouth, teeth, jaws, eyes, ears, nose, and related cranial nerves. Evaluate the eyes before lid edema interferes with this assessment. Assess vision, pupil responses, symmetry, and extraocular movements and check for any abnormalities. Soft Tissue Trauma Facial bites by animals or humans are easily infected and require meticulous cleansing with soap and water and irrigation with warmed saline solution. Use the mnemonic RATS to recall appropriate management: Rabies prophylaxis, Antibiotics, Tetanus prophylaxis, and Soap. Facial abrasions (r oad rash) can cause tattooing (epidermal staining). To prevent this, inject a local anesthetic and scrub vigorously with mild soap. Remove gunpowder similarly, but scrub with a hard brush. Remove glass fragments by applying and then removing tape. Facial l acerations require specific care based on their location. Never shave the eyebrows. Align the vermillion borders of the lips to prevent step -off deformity. Inspect mouth injuries for debris, crushed tissue, tooth fragments, bleeding, and signs of infection . When the tongue is lacerated, check for other oral lacerations from the teeth. Drain and dress an ear hematoma to prevent cauliflower ear. With a deep chee k laceration, check for damage to the parotid gland, parotid duct, and facial nerve branches.

LESSO N OUTLINE Nasal Fractures Nasal fractures are the most common facial fractures. They cause swelling, deformity, bleeding, and crepitus. Initial management focuses on controlling bleeding with direct pressure, ice compresses, and nasal packing. Treatment ma y include splinting, setting the fracture, and avoidance of nose blowing. Naso -orbital -ethmoidal fractures result from a direct blow to the face that fractures the medial orbital wall, nose, and ethmoid sinus. These fractures cause pain, vision problems, p eriorbital and upper facial edema and ecchymosis, epistaxis, traumatic telecanthus, of intracranial injuries. Maxillary Fractures Maxillary (midface) fractures are caused by significant force and usually involv e several facial structures. They may be classified as Le Fort I (lower third), Le Fort II (middle third), and Le Fort III (complete craniofacial separation involving orbital complex) fractures. Each type produces specific effects and complications, but th ey all cause severe facial pain, upper lip anesthesia or paresthesia, and some vision disturbances. Management includes aggressive airway control. If endotracheal intubation is not possible, prepare for cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy. Suction frequently and position the patient upright and leaning forward. Apply ice compresses, administer antibiotics and tetanus immunization as ordered, and prepare the patient for surgical repair. Zygomatic Fractures Fractures of the zygoma usually result from blunt facial trauma and may take two forms. o Zygomatic arch fractures cause pain in the lateral cheek, inability to close the jaw, and swelling, crepitus, and asymmetry over the arch. o Tripod fractures affect the zygomatic arch, posterior infraorbital rim, and fro ntozygomatic suture. They can cause step deformity, or asymmetry, periorbital edema, circumoral or subconjunctival ecchymosis, and pain exacerbated by jaw motion. Orbital Blowout Fractures Orbital blowout fractures result from blunt forc e to the globe, which abruptly increases the orbital pressure. Signs and symptoms include diplopia, altered extraocular movements, orbital pain or loss of sensation, periorbital edema and bruising, enophthalmos, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and orbital bony deformity.

LESSON OUTLINE If a ruptured globe is suspected, shield the eye to prevent further injury and arrange for an emergency ophthalmologic consultation. Postpone surgery until swelling diminishes. Until then, apply ice compresses, elevate the head of the bed, give antibiotics and nasal decongestants, and tell the patient not to strain or blow the nose. Mandibular Fractures Mandibular fractures, the second most common facial fractures, usually result from a severe blow to the face. Malocclusion is t he cardinal sign. Other findings vary with the fracture site (the condyle or the angle, body, or symphysis of the mandible). Likely signs and symptoms include point tenderness and crepitus, step -off deformity, trismus, decreased range of motion, facial asy mmetry with swelling and ecchymosis, lower lip and chin paresthesia, sublingual hematoma, and tears in the external ear canal or tympanic membrane. Treatment requires surgery for open reduction and internal fixation or jaw wiring. ED care includes letting the patient sit upright, applying ice compresses, using oral saline rinses, giving antibiotics, and repairing lacerations.

The skeleton provides support, strength, movement, and protection to the body and organs. Bones store minerals and are involved in blood cell production. The periosteum covers the bones and provides a point for muscle attachment and for the blood supply to underlying bone tissue. Ligaments are bands of elastic fibrous connective tissue that connect bone to bone. Te ndons are nonelastic fibrous cords that connect muscle to bone. Cartilage is dense connective tissue between the ribs and vertebrae; in the nasal septum, ear, larynx, trachea, and bronchi; and on articulating surfaces. Joints are sites where two bones conn ect. They provide mobility or stability. Synovial joints have two articulating surfaces covered with cartilage and are surrounded by a lubricating bursal sac. Patient Assessment For a patient with musculoskeletal trauma, conduct a primary survey, assessing the airway, breathing, circulation, and disability (ABCD) and intervening as needed. If the mechanism of injury suggests more than an isolated extremity injury, completely expose and examine the body for other injuries. After the primary survey, conduct a secondary survey by inspecting and palpating any orthopedic injuries. As part of the focused musculoskeletal assessment, perform a neurovascular assessment that includes the five Ps: pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness. Perform genera l management. Remove constrictive jewelry and clothing. Control bleeding. Immobilize the injured area. Use sterile normal saline solution to rinse an open fracture with obvious bone protrusion or a deep laceration. Elevate the injured extremity. Intermitte ntly apply ice packs. Obtain radiographs. Blood loss can be significant with certain fractures. Frequently reassess vital signs to detect hypovolemia. Provide initial immobilization with one of four basic types of splints: soft, hard, inflatable air or vacuum, or traction splints. Soft-Tissue Injuries Soft-tissue injuries can involve the skin, muscles, tendons, cartilage, ligaments, veins, arteries, and nerves. Common skin injuries include abrasions, avulsions, contusions, hematomas, lacerations, and punctu re wounds. Most soft -tissue injuries require the same nursing care. Assess the injured area for wounds, swelling, hematomas, bleeding, and neurovascular status changes. o Apply a soft, bulky dressing. o Elevate the injured area and apply ice packs. o Obtain radi ographs. o Administer analgesics, as prescribed. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Administer antibiotics for significant, contaminated wounds. o Provide written discharge instructions about RICE: rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Fingertip injuries commonly result from a crush injury of the distal phalanx. If a subungual hematoma forms, trephination may be needed to release the blood and relieve the pressure. In a traumatic amputation, ensure the ABCs and then irrigate, dress, and elevate the stump. To preserve the amputat ed part for replantation, wrap it in saline -moistened gauze and seal it in a plastic bag or container. Put the container on crushed ice and water. Replantation of an amputated part depends on the replantation team availability, amount of damage to the atta ched and amputated parts, preservation method for the amputated part, and time since the injury. In an impaling injury, first stabilize the impaled object. After radiography shows the object's trajectory, remove the object (usually during surgery). Gunshot wounds require wound care and evidence preservation, using rubber -tip forceps to remove projectiles, placing each one in an individual container with sterile gauze. Tendon and muscle ruptures are common sports injuries. Complete tears may require surgery . Incomplete ones need rest and ice application. The Thompson test can help diagnose an Achilles tendon rupture. Crush injuries may require orthopedic, surgical, neurosurgical, or vascular surgical intervention. With significant tissue necrosis, crush synd rome can develop. Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling, compression, or restriction increases the fascial compartment pressure to the point that it interrupts microvascular circulation. Irreversible tissue damage occurs in 4 to 6 hours of ischemia, so prompt physician notification is essential. Common causes of peripheral nerve and artery injuries include lacerations, penetrating wounds, fractures, and dislocations. Complete nerve disruption causes a loss of all functions and usually requires surgical repair. A strain is a weakening or overstretching of a muscle at its point of attachment to the tendon. Manifestations and management depend on the classification of the strain as first -degree (mild), second -degree (moderate), or third -degree (severe). A sprain occurs when a joint exceeds its normal limit and damages the ligaments. Manifestations and management depend on the classification of the sprain as first -degree (mild), second -degree (moderate), or third -degree (severe), which involves ligament teari ng. Knee injuries are common soft -tissue injuries that may require the use of crutches so the patient does not bear weight on the affected joint. Fractures Patients with a fracture (bone disruption or break) may have angulation, deformity, pain, regional and point tenderness, swelling, immobility, crepitus, bony fragment protrusion, impaired neurovascular status, and possibly shock. Fractures are closed (simple) when the skin is intact. They are open (compound) when the skin is disrupted over or near the fr acture site. Open fractures are contaminated, require antibiotics, and may require surgical debridement. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Emergency nursing care includes immobilizing the fracture, establishing vascular access, irrigating the wound, covering it with a dry st erile dressing, verifying the tetanus immunization status, obtaining radiographs, and preparing for surgery, if indicated. Common complications include hemorrhage, neurovascular compromise, and infections that lead to limb dysfunction or loss. Long -term co mplications include nonunion, deformity, disability, avascular necrosis, and Volkmann contracture. Fat embolism syndrome is a life -threatening complication. Healing can take weeks to months and depends on the type of bone, type of fracture, degree of oppos ition, immobility, and patient's general health. Upper torso fractures include clavicular and scapular fractures. Upper extremity fractures may ulna, radius, navicular (scaphoid), carpal, and metacarpal bones as well as the phalanges. Pelvic fractures have a relatively high mortality rate. Less severe, non -weight -bearing injuries require bed rest and traction. Unstable, weight -bearing fractures require external or internal fixation devices. Pelvic vessel hemorrhage may require angiograph y and embolization. Hip fractures require early immobilization with Buck's traction followed by surgical intervention. Lower extremity fractures may involve the femur, patella, tibia (most common long bone fracture), fibula, talus, tarsal and metatarsal bo nes, calcaneus, and phalanges. Dislocations Dislocations and subluxations occur when a joint exceeds its normal range of motion. In a dislocation (complete joint disruption), the articular surfaces are no longer in contact. In a subluxation (less severe di sruption), the articular surfaces maintain some contact. To minimize vessel and nerve damage, joint disruptions should be reduced as soon as possible. Manifestations of dislocations typically include severe pain, point tenderness, joint deformity, swelling, inability to move the joint, and signs of neurovascular compromise. For a dislocation, perform these general interventions: Splint the joint in the position that it is found. Assess neurovascular status distal to the injury. Assess for concurrent fractures. Administer analgesics, muscle relaxants, sedatives, or all three, as prescribed. Consult an orthopedic surgeon. Assist with reduction. After reduction, reassess neurovascular status, obtain radiographs, and immobilize the joint. Common complica tions include ischemia, aseptic necrosis, and recurrent dislocations. Dislocations may affect the acromioclavicular joint, shoulder, elbow (such as nursemaid's elbow in pediatric patients), wrist, hand, finger, hip, knee, patella, ankle, foot, and toe. Reduction Issues The goals of fracture and dislocation reduction are to restore anatomic alignment, allow bone healing, and preserve function. Reduction may be closed or open (surgical) and is particularly important for intra -articular fractures, especially in weight -bearing bones.

LESSON OUTLINE Traction may be initiated in the emergency department to align and immobilize a fracture of the femur or proximal tibia. Types of traction include traction splints (such as Hare or Sager splints), skin traction (Buc k's traction), and skeletal traction (applied with a Steinman pin, which is drilled into the distal femur or proximal tibia and attached to a stirrup with traction). Splints are used to immobilize extremity injuries. Before splint application, assess neuro vascular status and skin integrity, dress all wounds, clean and dry the extremity, remove all jewelry, and pad bony prominences. After splint application, provide a referral for cast application when the initial swelling resolves. Also provide discharge in structions. Assisted Ambulation To fit axillary crutches, ensure that each arm piece is 2 inches below the axilla, the crutch tips are placed 6 inches to each side and front, and each hand piece allows elbow flexion of 30 degrees. o Teach a patient with axil lary crutches how to use a three -point gait for little or no weight - bearing. Also demonstrate how to go up and down stairs on crutches and how to change positions (from sitting to standing) with crutches. To fit a cane, ensure that the elbow is flexed at 3 0 degrees when the cane is held next to the heel. Also have the patient use the cane on the side opposite the injury. To fit a walker, make sure both elbows are flexed at 30 degrees. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Domestic and Foreign Threats Nuclear, biologic, and chemical agents are practical tools for terrorism because small quantities can achieve a high impact. They are easy to conceal and transport , are hard to detect , and may be inexpensive and readily made from available components . They may have no characteristic odor or other physical characteristics . Terrorist acts are planned and then perpetrated with lit tle or no warning; constitute a federal crime; may involve secondary devices intended for rescuers; and have a greater potential for death and destruction than natural and manmade disasters. Mass casualty incidents involving nuclear, biologic, or chemical agents cause widespread anxiety, panic, and fear of exposure or contamination. They may worsen psychogenic illnesses, causing otherwise healthy people to visit the emergency department. Nuclear -Radiologic Threats Nuclear threats may result from a nuclear installation or reactor, thermonuclear weapon, or improvised nuclear device. Radiologic threats may result from a radiologic exposure device or radiologic dispersal device. Radiation may be ionizing and nonionizing. Only ionizing radiation poses health ri sks. Ionizing radiation includes alpha and beta particles, gamma rays, neutrons, and x -rays. Radiation measurement factors include activity, exposure, absorbed dose, and dose - equivalent. To protect against the effects of ionizing radiation, limit time spe nt near a radioactive source, remain as far away from the source as possible, and shield with proper materials (clothing or paper for alpha particles; thick plastic or wood for beta particles; lead shielding for gamma rays or x -rays; and concrete, earth, o r water for neutrons). Irradiation results form exposure to ionizing radiation. Contamination occurs when radioactive material is on or inside the body. Incorporation of radioactive material begins when radiosensitive cells and tissues take up radioactive contamination. Decontamination should begin at the scene. If not possible, contaminated patients must enter the emergency department through a separate, protected entrance or be isolated until a decontamination tent can be set up. Don protective clothing, including surgical gloves and shoe covers. Remove the patient's clothing, place it in plastic bags, and label it radioactive. Cleanse exposed skin with soap and water and shampoo hair; repeat until the contamination level shows no significant reduction be tween washes. Trim the nails and scrape under them. Acute radiation syndrome (acute illness due to significant, penetrating partial - or whole - body irradiation) progresses through four stages: prodromal stage, latent stage, manifest illness, and recovery or death. The syndrome has four subdivisions: o Cutaneous radiation injury occurs with doses as low as 2 Gy (200 rads). Findings are itching, tingling, edema, erythema, ulcerations, desquamation, and necrosis. o Hematopoietic syndrome occurs with doses of 0.3 t o 0.7 Gy (30 to 70 rads). Destruction of bone marrow stem cells and similar cells and tissues results in pancytopenia, sepsis, and hemorrhage. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Gastrointestinal syndrome occurs with doses of 6 to 10 Gy (600 to 1,000 rads). Mucosal lining bre akdown and intestinal wall sloughing result in diarrhea, severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Subsequent systemic effects can include fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, and anemia. o Central nervous system syndrome occurs with doses of 20 to 50 Gy (2,000 to 5,000 rads). It produces nervousness, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and death. To treat radiation exposure, stabilize the patient; decontaminate and assess for effectiveness; and treat trauma, burns, or other in juries according to trauma protocols. Biologic Agents Biologic threats include bacteria, viruses, and toxins. o Bacteria are single -celled microorganisms that may form spores and produce an inflammatory reaction in tissues. o Viruses are the simplest pathogens, consisting of protein -coated ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Viruses require a host cell and can cause various cell -specific diseases. Viral diseases may lead to vascular damage and multiple system organ failure. o Toxins ar e natural poisons that are more deadly than comparable amounts of any manmade chemical agent. Toxins or their precursors may exist in the household garden (such as ricin) or in the kitchen pantry (such as botulinum). Many biologic agents are contagious fro m person to person. Infection methods or delivery routes include inhalation , ingestion, and dermal contact. The Cen ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categorize biologic threats based on ease of dissemination, transmissibility, potential for hig h morbidity and mortality, potential for social disruption, surveillance needs, and ease of production. o Category A agents can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, can result in high mortality rates, and can have a major impact on pu blic health . These agents might cause public panic and social disruption and require special action for public health preparedness. They include anthrax, plague, tularemia, smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers, and botulism. o Category B agents include organis ms that are moderately easy to disseminate, result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality rates, and require specific enhancements of the CDC's diagnostic capacity and enhanced disease surveillance. They include brucellosis, epsilon toxin, food safe ty threats, glanders, melioidosis, psittacosis, Q fever, ricin toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, typhus fever, viral encephalitis, and water safety threats . o Category C agents include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of availability, ease of production and dissemination, and potential for high morbidity and mortality rates and major health impact. They include emerging infectious diseases , such as the Nipah virus and the hantavirus. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Epidemiologic clues of a biologic attack or infectious outbreak include infections that are unusual for a particular geographic region or age group; increased deaths among immunocompromised patients; multiple, similar outbreaks of disease; multiple, drug - resistant pathogens; increased numbers of sick and dying animals; physical evidence; and agent delivery device. Category A Bacterial Diseases Anthrax ( Bacillus anthracis ) is Spore inoculation may cutaneous anthrax. Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal anthrax. Inhalation may lead to inhalational (respiratory) anthrax. o Cutaneous anthrax causes pruritus and papular lesions that become vesicular and ulcerative. Ulcerative areas may have moderate to severe edema. Lesions develop a black eschar in 1 to 2 weeks. o Gastrointestinal anthrax causes upper gastrointestinal tract infection that results in edema, lymphadenopathy, and sepsis. Lower gastrointestinal tract infection produces bloody diarrhea, ascit es, abdominal pain, and sepsis associated with a partially necrotic lower intestine. o Inhalational anthrax causes flulike manifestations. After 2 to 6 days of incubation, it causes dry cough, myalgia, fatigue, and fever. After a brief improvement, a sudden high fever, respiratory distress, shock, and death may occur. Patients may develop mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis. Chest radiography shows bilateral pulmonary effusions and a widened mediastinum. o To manage anthrax, f ollow all standard precautions . Avoid contact with wound drainage. Obtain specimens for culture and sensitivity testing and administer appropriate antibiotics, as prescribed. Plague is a lymphatic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis , a non -spore -forming, gram -negative bacil lus. o Bubonic plague is transmitted to the regional lymph nodes, causing adenitis or buboes. Bubonic plague is not contagious from person to person. o Bubonic can become septicemic plague by spreading through the lymphatic vessels, seeding the vasculature, an d predisposing the patient to abnormal coagulation in the vessels, which leads to gangrene. Bacteremia and severe sepsis follow, and the infection can spread to the lungs, liver, spleen, or kidneys. Meningitis may occur. Septicemic plague is not contagious from person to person. o Direct inhalation of the bacillus results in pneumonic plague with bacteremia and sepsis. It causes multilobar hemorrhagic, necrotizing bronchopneumonia. Pneumonic plague represents the most significant biowarfare or terrorist threa t, as it is highly contagious and spread via respiratory droplets. o Manifestations of bubonic plague begin 2 to 8 days after a bite from an infected flea. Signs and symptoms include chills; fever; weakness; and buboes in the axilla, groin, or cervical regio n. If untreated, it progresses into a fatal septicemic or possibly secondary pneumonic plag ue. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o After 1 to 6 days of incubation, pneumonic plague causes high fever, myalgia, chills, headache, chest pain, and cough with bloody sputum. If untre ated, dyspnea, cyanosis, and shock may lead to death. o For confirmed bubonic plague, follow standard precautions. Observe strict respiratory droplet precautions for 72 hours for patients who are being ruled out for pneumonic plague or are diagnosed with pro bable pneumonic plague. Administer antibiotics, as prescribed. Anticipate antibiotic prophylaxis for people living in the same household as patients with the bubonic or septicemic plague, and for all contacts of patients with pneumonic plague. Tularemia is a potentially fatal illness caused by the non -spore -forming bacterium Francisella tularensis , a dangerous potential biologic Tularemia may result from ingestion, contact, or aerosol inhalation, but is not transmitted person to person. o Infection ca n occur when bacilli come in contact with mucous membranes, the gastrointestinal tract, or the lungs. Signs and symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure, but can take up to 14 days . Tularemia presents as a flulike illness , with sudden fever, chil ls, headache, sore throat, dry cough, diarrhea, muscle aches, and progressive weakness. Other findings include pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath , hemoptysis, Hilar lymphadenopathy, and sepsis. o Observe standard p recautions for patients who are suspected of h aving tularemia. Diagnosis is based on results of a Gram stain of sputum and blood cultures. A designated national reference laboratory aid s in rapid diagnostic testing and identification. Administer an antimicrobial, as prescribe d. Category A Viral Diseases Smallpox is caused by one of two poxviruses: variola minor or variola major. Variola major causes a highly virulent and contagious disease that spreads from person to person by aerosols or droplet nuclei via cough, sneeze, and direct contact. o Smallpox inoculation occurs via face -to-face encounters or contact with infected body fluids or contaminated objects or bedding. Incubation ranges from 7 to 17 days, after which the virus spreads to lymph nodes and multiplies. o The first signs of s mallpox may include high fever, malaise, headache, aches, nausea, and vomiting. During the next 2 to 4 days , a rash develops on the tongue and in the mouth. It spreads to the face, arms, legs, hands , and feet, and evolves into fluid -filled, painful bumps t hat thicken and develop a char acteristic central depression . During this time, the high fever decreases, but rises again when the bumps turn into sharply raised pustules that crust over and scab. The patient is contagious until the scab s fall off. Death re sults in 30% of patients . o Assess and care for the patient in a negative -pressure environment and observe strict airborne and contact infection control precautions. Diagnosis is based on presentation, positive tissue cultures, or positive virus identificat ion by electron microscopy. Administer antivirals as prescribed and immune globulin. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Vaccination remains the most effective prevention. The CDC recommends smallpox vaccination only for laboratory staff members who work with orthopox viruse s and for public health and health care response team members . Viral hemorrhagic fever is an illness caused by a ribonucleic acid virus: Filoviridae (Marburg disease and Ebola virus (Lassa fever), Flaviviridae (yellow fever), or Buny aviridae (Rift Valley fever). Infections usually are transmitted by insect bites or contact with infected body fluids. o Viral hemorrhagic fever causes high fever, myalgia, rash, weakness, hypotension, prostration, jaundice, bleeding complications, and multisystem organ failure. o Place the patient in a private room and observe standard, droplet, and contact precautions. Consider airborn e precautions including negative pressure for a patient with respiratory involvement or one who is undergoing pulmonary p rocedures that stimulate coughing. If ordered, administer ribavirin. Avoid needle punctu res and anticoagulant therapies, which are contraindicated. Most viral hemorrhagic fevers do not have a vaccine, except for yellow fever. Category A Toxins Toxins are poisons naturally produced by living organisms. Toxins tend not to be transmitted by contact or spread from person to person. They are usually ingested, but aerosol versions can be inhaled. Examples include botulinum (the only CDC -classified category A age nt), ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin spore -forming, anaerobic bacillus that produces botulinum toxin and is the most poisonous substance by weight currently known. Botulism is a neuroparalyti c disease that naturally occurs in three forms: foodborne botulism, infant botulism, and wound botulism. o Signs of botulism begin 6 hours to 2 weeks after exposure and are the same for all forms of botulism, including inhalational. Findings depend on the do se and the rate and amount of toxin absorbed. Neurologic effects include symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis and bulbar palsies. When paralyzed by the toxin, patients retain their senses and are fully aware, but cannot respond. o Patients typically requi re prolonged intensive care, parenteral nutrition, and mechanical ventilation for months. Antitoxin must be given early in the disease. o To manage botulism, observe standard precautions. Administer type -specific botulinum antitoxin early (after rapid diagn osis) , as ordered. Chemical Agents Chemical agents are categorized by their chemical makeup and effects on the body. Most chemical agents are classified as nerve agents, vesicants, blood agents, or pulmonary and choking agents. Most are liquids and are dispersed as aerosols. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Nerve agents are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. They include tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, and VX. Exposure can occur through inhalation, skin or eye contact, ingestion, or injection and is toxic in all amounts wit h little difference between a lethal and survivable dose. o Nerve agents disrupt nerve impulse transmission and overstimulate nerves, producing nicotinic, muscarinic, and central nervous system effects. o Mild or moderate exposure may cause localized sweating , fasciculations, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dyspnea. Severe exposure may cause unconsciousness, seizures, apnea, and flaccid paralysis. T he effects of are SLUDGEM: salivation and increased secretions, and miosis. o Decontamination and antidote administration are critical. For an exposed patient, remove the clothing and thoroughly decontaminate, provide respiratory support, and administer antidotes, as ordered. Vesicants (blister agents) are manmade chemicals. They include sulfur, three variations of nitrogen mustard , lewisite, and phosgene oxime. Vesicant exposure usually occurs via contact or inhalation, but may result from ingestion of contaminated food or water. o Mustard agents affect the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, and blood -forming organs. Exposure is not immediately painful on contact and has a latent reaction period. In contrast, lewisite produces immediate pain and discomfort. Su lfur mustard is a terrorist threat because it is inexpensive and can be dispersed as a droplet or vapor. The mustard agents and phosgene oxime do not have an antidote. The antidote for lewisite is British antilewisite (BAL). o Vesicant exposure can cause eye tearing and conjunctivitis, eyelid swelling, blepharospasms, itching, redness, ophthalmic injury, burning and blisters, throat and mucous membrane burning, hoarseness, shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, pulmonary edema, and death. Substantial mustard gas exposure can induce bone marrow stem cell suppression, leukopenia, and subsequent decreased immunity. o Treatment for vesicant exposure includes im mediate decontamination , care for eye exposure, and bronchodilator administratio n, if ordered . Blood agents include cyanides, which act on cells and kill quickly by interfering with the blood's ability to transport oxygen to tissues. Cyanide may be absorb ed into the body through inh alation, contact, or ingestion. o Cyanide exposure caus es anxiety ; agitation; tachypnea; -red skin; and death. o Treatment includes immediately placement i n a well -ventilated area or in fresh air and supplemental oxygen; decontamination by immediately removing the patient's clothes in a clean air environment; and administration of treatments for acute cyanide poisoning, as ordered, including an antidote kit. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Pulmonary and choking agents include chlorine, phosgene, ammonia, and other chemicals that stress the respiratory tract and irritate and damage lung tissue. Primarily an inhalation threat, exposure may also occur via skin or eye contact o r ingestion. o Affected patien ts may smell like the agent to which they were exposed or may report the acrid, pungent odor of chlorine or the scent of new -mown hay (the characteristic odor of phosgene). Exposure to pulmonary or choking agents can result in eye irritation, conjunctivitis, coughing, wheezing, chest tightne ss, headaches, nausea, choking sensation, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory distress, pulmonary edema. Moderate to severe exposure to some agents may result in a relatively asymptomatic or latent period (for hours) that usually precedes dyspnea, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema caused by simple exertion. o Treatment includes removing the patient from the source of the agent ; decontamination with large volumes of tap water; maintaining a patent airway; preparing for intubation, if needed; using in a high -Fowler's pos ition to promote chest excursion and ease respirations; and p roviding care for eye exposure.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology The nervous system has two divisions: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system includ es the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of 31 pairs of spinal nerves and the autonomic nervous system. The brain's major blood supply comes from two pairs of arteries that connect to form the circle of Willis. The structure of the anterior circulation provides a redundant blood supply to certain areas of the brain. The anterior circulation provides about 80% of the brain's blood supply. The posterior circulation supplies the remainder. The autonomic nervous system has two divisi ons: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system controls the fight -or-flight response, releasing energy, increasing the heart rate and blood pressure, and causing other responses. The parasympathet ic nervous system triggers opposite responses, which conserve the body's energy. Patient Assessment After assessing and managing the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), focus the initial assessment on D (disability). Assess neurologic function by ev aluating: o Level of consciousness o Eye opening, motor, and verbal responses using a standardized tool, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale o Cranial nerves II through XII, which includes the pupillary response o Motor strength o Sensory function Specific Neurologic Em ergencies Headache is one of the mo re common complaints in the emergency department and may be a symptom of a minor problem or a life -threatening disorder. o When assessing a patient's headache, stay alert for clues to a serious problem: No previous history of headache, pain or symptoms that are different from usual for the patient, and description of \" the worst headache of my life\". o Triage as emergent any patient with a headache and focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, or vision loss. o Tension, c luster, and migraine headaches vary in presentation and management but usually respond to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic pain relief. o Headaches from temporal arteritis or subarachnoid hemorrhage are medical emergencies that present with distinctive findings. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Seizures result from abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain. Many types exist. o Febrile seizures commonly affect pediatric patients. o Seizures may be partial (beginning in a localized part of the brain) or generalized (beginning in the entire brain). Partial seizures may be complex (with loss of consciousness) or simple (without loss of consciousness). o Generalized seizures fall into six categories: tonic -clonic, absence, tonic, atonic, clonic, and myoclonic. The two most common t ypes are tonic -clonic and absence seizures. o Initial seizure management involves maintaining an open airway and preventing patient injury. Other care priorities include stopping the seizure, preventing a recurrence, and investigating the cause. o In status ep ilepticus, seizure activity lasts at least 5 minutes. This is a medical emergency. Stroke is an abrupt loss of neurologic function from an acute interruption of blood flow to the brain. About 85% of strokes are ischemic (caused by vessel occlusion). The r est are hemorrhagic (caused by bleeding). o An ischemic stroke occurs when a thrombus or an embolus blocks a cerebral vessel. Transient ischemic attacks are warning signs that blood flow is impaired and an ischemic stroke may occur. o Nursing care for an acut e ischemic stroke includes maintaining the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) ; getting a rapid computed tomography (CT) scan; establishing a timeline to determine if the patient is el igible for fibrinolytic therapy; preparing for fibrinolytic therap y; and supporting the patient and family. o A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an intracranial vessel ruptures and blood leaks into the surrounding brain tissue, subarachnoid space, or ventricular system. Subtypes o Nursing care for a hemorrhagic stroke includes maintaining the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation); performing f requent neurologic examinations; maintain ing cerebral controlling intracranial pressure; preparing the patient for surger y or other definitive treatment; and supporting the patient and family. Meningitis is an inflammation of the arachnoid and pia mater, two meningeal layers covering the brain and s pinal cord. It may be caused by fungi, viruses, or bacteria. o Bacterial meningitis is a neurologic emergency and an infection control emergency. Most affected adults present with the classic triad of fever, stiff neck, and decreased level of consciousness. o Nursing care for bacterial meningitis includes maintaining the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) ; placing the patient in respiratory isolation; administering antibiotics, antipyretics, and corticosteroids; performing ongoing neurologic examinations ; and providing other comfort measures.

LESSON OUTLINE Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an acute, progressive demyelinating disease that usually begins after recovery from a respiratory infection or gastroen teritis -like illness. o The syndrome causes paresthesia s in the extremities, decreased deep tendon reflexes, ascending paralysis, and cranial nerve dysfunctions. When paralysis reaches the intercostal muscles and diaphragm, respiratory failure can occur. o Depending on symptom severity, the patient may need supp lemental oxygen, noninvasive breathing support, or intubation. To prevent lethal dysrhythmias, use succinylcholine with extreme care, if at all. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic disease marked by muscle weakness due to the inability of receptor sites on neur ons to be activated. o Signs and symptoms may include painless weakness that improves with rest, drooping eyelids, diplopia, and weakne ss when chewing and swallowing. o Myasthenia gravis may be diagnosed by using edrophonium in the Tensilon test. Treatment is mainly supportive. If respiratory failure occurs, the patient may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease caused by inflammatory demyelination in the central nervous system. o Multiple sclerosis is characterized by disturbances in vision and fine and gross motor functions. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis is the most common form. o No cure or preventive measures exist for multiple sclerosis. Treatment focuses on preserving neurologic function, av oiding stress and other triggers of attacks, and decreasing the severity of exacerbations. Daily medications help decrease the frequency and severity of attacks. Ventricular shunt problems commonly inc lude malfunction and infection. o Regardless of the cause , shunt malfunction causes signs of increased intracranial pressure. Surgery is the definitive treatment. o Infections usually cause fever, signs of meningeal irritation, signs of inflammation around the shunt, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. Treatment calls for intravenous antibiotics. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review Pregnancy is a hyperdynamic, hypervolemic state with many physiologic changes that allow the mother's body to nourish the growing fetus. The most significant changes of pregnancy affect the cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, and hematologic systems. Patient Assessment and Emergency Management History taking for a patient with an obste tric emergency should include questions about her last normal menstrual period, estimated date of confinement, obstetric history, current signs and symptoms, prenatal care, and other factors. The priorities remain airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). The focused obstetric assessment includes the evaluation of the abdomen, uterus, fetus, and perineum. The age of fetal viability is 24 weeks' gestation. The fetus' best chance of survival is to support the mother's life. First -Trimester Emergencies In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized ovum implants anywhere other than in the endometrium. o Up to 50 percent of affected women have a history of salpingitis or p elvic inflammatory disease . o Signs and symptoms include amenorrhea, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, a nd possibly Kehr's sign. o Medical treatment calls for methotrexate (Folex) administration and follow -up with beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( -hCG) tests. o Surgical treatment calls for salpingostomy (if an unruptured pregnancy is in the ampulla) or salpin gectomy. Abortion is any interruption in the pregnancy before the fetus is viable. o Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is the primary cause of vaginal bleeding in women of childbearing age. o Types of abortions include threatened, inevitable, incomplete, comp lete, missed, and septic. Half of all threatened abortions result in complete or incomplete abortions within a few hours. o Depending on the type of abortion, the treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring, fluid administration, suction curettage , and emotion al support.

LESSON OUTLINE Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy Preeclampsia is marked by elevated blood pressure and proteinuria that develop after 20 weeks' gestation. Eclampsia is defined as a seizure in a patient with preeclampsia. o Mild preeclampsia m ay be asymptomatic, but severe preeclampsia can cause end -organ effects. o Treatment calls for oxygen, intravenous access, fetal monitoring, lateral recumbent positioning, and magnesium sulfate to prevent and treat seizures. HELLP syndrome is a life -threaten ing form of preeclampsia that causes multiple organ damage and may require treatment with an emergency cesarean section. The syndrome takes its name from its characteristics: o Hemolysis o Elevated liver enzyme levels o -Trimester Emergen cies In placenta previa, the placenta presents before the fetus because it is implanted in the lower uterine segment instead of the upper uterine wall. o Types of placenta previa reflect how much of the placenta covers the os: complete, partial, or marginal (low) implantation. o Painless , bright red, vaginal bleeding in the last half of pregnancy suggests placenta previa. Abruptio placentae (placental separation from the uterine wall) accounts for about 30 percent of bleeding in late pregnancy. Bleeding may be frank or occult. o Vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain or contractions in the third trimester suggest abruptio placentae. o The patient with placenta previa or abruptio placentae needs monitoring in the labor and delivery unit and possibly emergency cesarean section. Normal Delivery Labor is characterized by three stages: o First stage - From contraction onset to complete cervical dilation o Second stage - From complete cervical dilation to the delivery of the neonate o Third sage - From the delivery of the neonate to the delivery of the placenta Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE After assessing the mother and fetus, assist with the delivery or transport the mother to the labor and delivery unit. To assist with delivery: o Put the mother on a stretcher and obtain a sterile disposable d elivery kit. o Cover one hand with a sterile towel or 4x4 gauze pad. o Apply gentle pressure to the neonate's head as it crowns. o Check and manage the umbilical cord. o After hea d delivery and rotation, hold the head gently in both hands. o Apply gentle downward pr essure to deliver the anterior shoulder and upward pressure to deliver the posterior shoulder. o Carefully support the head as the rest of the body is delivered. Assess and resuscitate the neonate by drying, warming, positioning, suctioning, and providing ta ctile stimulation. Perform additional measures if needed. o At 1 and 5 minutes after birth, obtain an Apgar score, rating color , pulse, reflex irritability , muscle tone , and respiratory effort. The d elivery of the placenta usually occurs 5 to 10 minutes after the delivery of the neonate. Apply gentle traction, but do not pull on the umbilical cord because this could cause uterine inversion. Complicated Deliveries In a prolapsed umbilical cord, the cor d precedes the fetus through the birth canal, becomes trapped when the fetus passes through the birth canal, and obstructs fetal circulation. Care aims to relieve pressure on the cord and minimize fetal anoxia. In shoulder dystocia, the fetus' shoulders ha ve difficulty passing through the pelvis. The McRoberts maneuver and the application of suprapubic pressure may facilitate delivery. In a breech delivery, the head is delivered last, which typically requires cesarean section. However, if the neonate has be en delivered to the level of the umbilicus, delivery may occur in the emergency department because time is of the essence . In meconium aspiration syndrome, meconium enters fetal lungs during delivery, causing respiratory distress. Meconium -stained neonates who are not vigorous at birth should have endotracheal suctioning with a meconium aspirator. With the delivery of twins or other multiple births, the main objective is safe delivery of all fetuses. Take one fetus at a time as they come. In amniotic fluid embolism, amniotic fluid leaks into the mother's venous circulation during labor or delivery, causing a sudden severe pulmonary obstruction and respiratory arrest, which is usually quickly followed by cardiac arrest.

LESSON OUTLINE Post partum and Other Emergencies Postpartum hemorrhage is any bleeding that causes hemodynamic instability and the expulsion or extraction of the placenta and membranes. Causes of postpartum hemorrhage include the five Ts: uterine atony (tone), laceration or h ematoma (trauma), retained disorders (thrombosis), and (traction). Postpartum hemorrhage usually responds to rest, and fundal massage. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterized by simultaneous clotting and bleeding and can occur in patients with severe abruptio placentae, postpartum hemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, or fetal death in utero. Postpartum infection can occur in vaginal lacerations, cervical tears, ep isiotomy sites, placental implant sites, and retained tissue. Molar pregnancy (hydatidiform mole) is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease, which is abnormal cell growth in tissue that would give rise to the placenta.

KEY RESOURCES Delivery in the Emergency Department If an emergent delivery is imminent, place the mother on a stretcher and obtain the equipment necessary for delivery. Obtain a sterile disposable delivery kit, which usually has most of the equipment needed for an emergent delivery. o Do not place the equipment between the mother's legs. Put it on a surface beside the stretcher. Make sure that you have the minimum essential equipment, including cord clamps, scissors, towels, and a bulb syringe. Put on appropriate attire and cover one hand with a sterile towel or a 4 \u00d7 4 inch gauze dressing to assist the physician, as needed, during the delivery. The physician will: o Apply gentle pressure to the neonate's head as it crowns to prevent an explosive delivery and the possible tearing of the peri neum. o Check for the umbilical cord around the neonate's neck. If you find the cord and it is loose, carefully slip it over the neonate's head. If it is tight, clamp it in two places and cut it. o After the head is delivered and has rotated, hold it gently in both hands. o Apply gentle downward pressure to assist with the delivery of the anterior shoulder. Use gentle upward traction to assist with the delivery of the posterior shoulder. o Carefully support the neonate's head. After the shoulders are delivered, ex pect the delivery of the rest of the body to emerge quite rapidly. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Maternal and Fetal Trauma In pregnant women, trauma is the leading cause of death and disability not related to childbirth or pregnancy. The initial approach and nursing priorities for pregnant and nonpregnant trauma patients are the same, but interventions for pregnant patients are intended to benefit two patients \u2014the mother and the fetus . Blunt trauma is the most common mechanism of injury in pregnant patients, often due to motor vehicle crashes, falls, and assaults. Trauma due to battery is also common . Anatomy and Physiology of Pregnancy During pregnancy, the uterus becomes an intraabdo minal organ and shifts the intestines to the upper abdomen. Uterine blood flow increases greatly, and uterine injury may be asso ciated with abdominal injury. Maternal pelvic fractures are associated with fetal skull fractures and intracranial hemorrhage and major maternal blood loss. Cardiovascular changes include deviation of the heart's axis by 15 degrees, electrocardiogram changes, ectopic beats, increased maternal blood volume and resting heart rate, and decreased blood pressure. After about 20 weeks' g estation, supine positioning causes the uterus and fetus to compress the vena cava and aorta, which can reduce cardiac output and uterine and fetal perfusion. Fetal distress may be the first sign of maternal hemorrhage and hypovolemia. Pulmonary changes include elevated diaphragm, flared ribs, increased maternal oxygen consumption, diminished oxygen reserve, increased respiratory rate, elevated PaO 2 and decreased PaCO 2 levels, epistaxis, and airway engorgement. Gastrointestinal changes include bowel shiftin g; constipation; decreased bowel sounds; reduced muscle guarding, rigidity, or rebound tende rness; delayed gastric emptying; and increased risk of aspiration. Genitourinary changes include increased risk of bladder injury and urinary tract infections, urin ary frequency, and decreased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Musculoskeletal changes include loosened ligaments, flexible pelvis, more forward center of gravity, lordosis, and unsteady gait. Central nervous system changes , such as altered mentat ion, seizures, and hypertension, may result from pregnancy -induced hypertension or a head injury. Endocrine changes range from impaired glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes to hypothyroidism and Sheehan's syndrome. Hematologic changes include incre ased plasma volume, white blood cell count, sedimentation rate, and clotting factors as well as decreased hematocrit and hem oglobin level and fibrinolysis.

LESSON OUTLINE Age-Related Considerations Adolescent mothers may lack prenatal care, not know the gestational age, and experience preterm labor. Mothers of advanced age have a higher risk of fractures, complications of pregnancy and trauma, and fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Patient Assessment Maternal compensato ry mechanisms preserve vital maternal functions at the expense of the fetus. Restoring maternal perfusion is the best way to support fetal perfusion. During the primary survey and interventions , follow these variations: o Airway - Suction nasal gently and us e nasal airways cautiously to reduce the risk of nosebleeds. Logroll the patient off the backboard as soon as possible. At more than 20 weeks' gestation, use pillows or foam wedges to tilt her at least 15 degrees laterally or manually displace the uterus. o Breathing - Administer oxygen, which is critical for fetal survival because the fetus cannot tolerate hypoxia. o Circulation - The mother can lose 1,500 mL of blood before signs of shock occur. Give isotonic crystalloids or Rh -compatible blood. Use vasopress ors cautiously in cardiogenic or distributive shock. Don't use them for hypovolemic shock. o Disability - If you detect neurologic deficits, consider pregnancy -induced hypertension and head trauma as possible causes. o Exposure and Environmental Control - Quic kly expose the skin to reveal life -threatening injuries. Use a blanket to maintain privacy and body heat. During the secondary survey , obtain a standard trauma history and gynecologic and obstetric data. Perform a head -to-toe assessment for injuries and a focused obstetric assessment of the: o Abdomen - Note any signs of injury, irregular shape, fetal movement, masses, tenderness, and contractions. o Uterus - Serially measure the fundal height. Increasing height may signal intrauterine bleeding or uterine injur y. o Fetus - Obtain a baseline fetal heart rate or evaluate fetal heart tones. The rate initially increases with hypoxia or hypotension, but falls below 110 beats per minute in severe hypoxia. Continuous fetal monitoring may be indicated for a fetus at more than 20 weeks' gestation. o Perineum - Assess the perineum for crowning, fetal presentation, injury, blood, and fluids. If blood is present, determine the source. Amniotic fluid signals an amniotic membrane leak or rupture and the risk of infection and early delivery. Diagnostic studies may include ultrasonography, focused assessment with sonography in trauma, computed tomography, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Laboratory tests shou ld in clude standard trauma profiles with careful interpretation becaus e of pregnancy. Pay attention to antibody screening for Rh immune status and Kleihauer -Betke test results, which may direct Rh immune globulin administration.

LESSON OUTLINE Mechanisms of Injury o In pregnant women, blunt trauma usually results from motor vehic le crashes, falls, and assaults. It can cause uterine injury with fetal and maternal complications. It also may lead to fetal skull fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, and clavicle and long -bone injuries. o Penetrating injuries typically involve gunshot or s tab wounds, which usually require surgical exploration. o Burns can lead to fetal mortality and carbon monoxide poisoning. Immediate care is the same for pregnant and nonpregnant patients, except that silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene) cream should not be used. o Electrical injuries can be more serious for the fetus than the mother because amniotic fluid conducts electrical current, which may cause fetal death, oligohydramnios, or growth retardation. Consequences of Trauma o Preterm labor is the most common complication in pregnant trauma patients. Contractions usually are self -limiting, but tocolysis may be ordered to halt preterm labor in an injured but hemodynamically stable patient. To assess uterine activity and fetal response, cardio tocography should begin early. o Abruptio placentae (separation of a normally implanted placenta before the fetus is born) may result from blunt trauma. Classic signs and symptoms include vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, abdominal and back pain, and ute rine hyperactivity. Management requires crystalloid infusion, specimen collection for blood tests, and immediate surgical delivery if a viable fetus is in distress. o Uterine rupture is an uncommon, catastrophic injury that may result from blunt trauma. Its manifestations may include blood or meconium in urine, hypovolemic shock, acute pain followed by no pain, uterine tenderness, palpation of fetal limbs outside the uterine borders, abnormal uterine contour, vaginal bleeding, and fetal distress. Early detect ion and repair of minor lacerations may prevent maternal hemorrhage and fetal compromise. Hysterectomy is almost always indicated. Special Considerations o In maternal cardiac arrest , cardiopulmonary resuscitation aims to sustain circulation and perfusion for the mother and fetus. Variations in technique are required. Perform compressions slightly higher on the maternal sternum. Manually displace the uterus laterally during chest compressions. Perform endotracheal intubation cautiously and administer high -flow oxygen. Monitor arterial blood gas and serum pH levels. Use vasopressors cautiously. For defibrillation, remove any internal fetal monitor and place the paddles one rib interspace higher than usual. o Primary indications for perimortem cesarean section include evidence of fetal heart tones and viability (gestational age of 24 weeks or more). To ensure uteroplacental perfusion , perimortem cesarean section should begin while maternal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed. One resuscitation team is needed for the mother and one for the neonate. Work quickly: The time between the maternal arrest and fetal delivery determines fetal survival. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Maternal or fetal stress may require emergency delivery of a neonate. A neonatal team skilled in neon atal assessment and treatment should be prepared for neonatal resuscitation , which occurs simultaneously with assessment. The team should: o Provide warmth, clear the airway, dry the neonate, and provide stimulation. o Provide positive pressure ventilation (if the heart rate is below 100 beats per minute ) and monitor oxygen saturation. o If the heart rate remains below 100 beats per minute after 30 seconds, correct ventilation. As indicated, intubate the neonate and begin chest compressions coordinated with posit ive pressure ventilation. o If the heart rate remains below 60 beats per minute after chest compressions and positive pressure ventilation, administer epinephrine (Adrenalin). o Calculate the Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. KEY RESOURCES Apgar Scoring The Apgar score is a descriptive tool that document s the neonate's status after delivery. Generally scored during or after resuscitation and stabilization at 1 and 5 minutes, this tool describes the neonate's physiologic condition in five categories: color, heart rate, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and respiratory effort. When the 5-minute score is less than 7, the Apgar score should be determined every 5 minutes until the neonate is 20 minutes old . The sc ores are not used for decision making during resuscitation. The scores are affected by interventions, gestational age, maternal medications, and cardiorespiratory and neurologic conditions, such as malformations and hypoglycemia . The American Academy of Pe diatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have proposed a n expanded Apgar score to record the correlation of neonate's status with resuscitative interventions. Narrative documen tation detailing interventions , such as venti lation, med ications, and oxygen, should accompany the scoring. Apgar Score Gestational Age: __________ Weeks Sign 0 1 2 1 Minute 5 Minutes 10 Minutes 15 Minutes 20 Minutes Color Blue or pale Acrocyanotic Completely pink Heart rate Absent Less than 100 beats per minute Greater than 100 beats per minute Reflex irritability No response Grimace Cry or active withdrawal Muscle tone Limp Some flexion Active motion Respiration Absent Weak cry: Hypoventilation Good: Crying Total Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Epidemiology, Anatomy, and Physiology Every year in the United States, ocular injuries affect about 2 million people, especially young people. These injuries are the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, but nearly 90% of them are preventable. The eye is a complex organ composed of many small parts that are all vital to normal vision. Critical parts of the eye include the cornea, iris, crystalline lens, anterior and posterior chambers, retina, rods, cones, and optic nerve. Patient Assessment Patient assessment begins with a detailed history that inve stigates symptoms (especially pain and vision changes), details the mechanism of i njury and events surrounding it, uncovers a history of eye trauma or disease or significant medical disorders, and determines the patient's tetanus immunization status. Physi cal examination includes visual acuity assessment; external eye examination for swelling, redness, tearing, trauma, or drainage; inspection of pupil size, shape, and reactivity; anterior segment assessment; extraocular muscle testing using the six cardinal fields of gaze; and possibly additional assessments, such as fluorescein staining, intraocular pressure measurement, and ophthalmoscopic examination. Patient Management Specific patient management depends on the disorder, but may include removing contact lenses, irrigating the eye, instilling eye medications, and patching the eye, if indicated. o Irrigation removes chemicals, small foreign bodies, or other substances from the eye. Depending on the type of exposure, rinse the eye with a small amount of normal saline solution (such as to flush out fluorescein stain) or with multiple liters of irrigation solution (such as to treat a chemical burn of the eye ). o As prescribed , instill eye drops or ophthalmic ointments to decrease pain, provide antibiotic therapy, c hange the pupil size, reduce ocular allergic reactions, or cleanse the eye. o If globe rupture is suspected, apply an eye shield and patch the unaffected eye to minimize eye movement. If an object is impaled in the eye, stabilize it to prevent shifting and f urther injury. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Traumatic Ocular Injuries Traumatic ocular injuries may result from blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, and burns. o Blunt trauma can cause orbital fractures (which usually involve the orbital floor and orbital rim), hyphema (bl ood in the answer chamber of the eye), and subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding between the conjunctiva and sclera). o Penetrating trauma can result in globe rupture (which causes an abrupt increase in intraocular pressure), corneal abrasions and lacerations (which are common injuries caused by a contact lens or other object scratching the epithelial layer), conjunctival or corneal foreign bodies (which may be removed by swabbi ng the eye or using an eye spoon or small - gauge needle), and intraocular foreign bo dies (which require antibiotic and tetanus prophylaxis and may need to be removed surgically) . o Burns may result from chemicals (which require copious irrigation before further assessment), heat (which commonly affect s the eyelids but rarely the globe), or radiation (which cause s symptoms 8 to 12 hours after exposure). Nontraumatic Ocular Injuries Nontraumatic ocular injuries may result from infections, retinal emergencies, and glaucoma. o Ocular infections include lid infections (such as hordeolum, chalazion, and blepharitis), corneal infections (such as keratitis and viral ketatoconjunctivitis), herpes and herpes zoster ophthalmicus), conjunctivitis (which bacterial, viral, or allergic), uveitis and iritis ( which are inflammations of the uveal tract, including the iris, ciliary body, and choroid), and orbital cellulitis (which is a life -threatening infection deep in the structures of the eyeball). o Retinal emergencies include central retinal artery occlusion ( an ocular emergency that requires restoration of retinal circulation in 60 to 120 minutes to prevent permanent vision loss) and retinal detachment (which occurs when the retina tea rs, allowing vitreous humor to seep between the retina and the choroid). o Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. It results from inadequate or incomplete drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber, which leads to a dangerous increase in intraocular pressure. Treatment aims to lower t he intraocular pressure as quickly as possible. General Discharge Instructions For a patient with an ocular emergency, discharge instructions address good handwashing, eye medication administration, follow -up care, limited use of the affected eye(s), and the resumption of driving and use of power tools only when permitted by the physician .

KEY RESOURCES Procedure for Visual Acuity Assessment 1. Have an ambulatory patient stand 20 feet from the Snellen chart. 2. Test the uninjured eye first by having the patient cover the injured eye with a spoon, patch, card, or hand. 3. Then have the patient cover the uninjured eye and test the affected eye. 4. Finally, test both o f the patient's eyes uncovered. 5. Record visual acuity as a fraction. The numerator represents the distance to the chart, and the denominator represents the distance from which a normal eye can read the lines. For example 20/50 means that this patient can read at 20 feet what a person with 20/20 vision can read at 50 feet. Record the lowest line on the chart that the patient can read, including the number of mistakes made on that line. For example, \"Right eye, 20/20\" means the patient can read the 20/20 line with no mistakes. \"Left eye 20/25 - 1\" means the patient can read the 20/25 line with one mistake . 6. If the patient cannot read the first line of the Snellen chart at 20 feet, place him or her 10 feet from the chart and have him or her read the lines. Then record acuity with 10 as the numerator, such as 10/50. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc.

KEY RESOURCES Examples of Documentation o f Visual Acuity Documentation Examples Visual Acuity Examination Findings 20/20 Standing at 20 feet, the patient can read what the normal eye can read at 20 feet. 20/20 - 2 Standing at 20 feet, the patient can read what the normal eye can read at 20 feet, but misses two letters . 20/200 Standing at 20 feet, the patient can read what the normal eye can read at 200 feet. The patient is considered legally blind if the reading is obtained while he or she is wearing glasses or contact lenses. 10/200 When the patient cannot read the letters on a Snellen chart, have the patient stand half the distance from the chart. Record the findings as the distance the patient is standing from the chart over the smallest line he or she can read. CF/3 ft The patient can count fingers (CF) at a maximum distance of 3 feet. HM/4 The patient can see hand motion (HM) at a maximum distance of 4 feet. LP/position The patient has light perception (LP) and can determine the direction from which it is coming. LP/no position The patient has light perception but cannot tell the direction from which it is coming. NLP The patient nas no light perception .

Improved surgical techniques, establishmen t of brain death criteria, passage of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, and immunosuppressive drug development have made transplants more common. In 1984, Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act, which established the Organ Procurement and Transpl antation Network. Under the law, all U.S. transplant centers and organ procurement organizations must be members of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to receive funds through Medicare. The Network facilitates organ matching and placement; maintains a national registry for organ matching; develops policies and procedures for organ recovery, distribution, and transportation ; collects data; and educates others about donation and transplantation. Hospitals who are Network members must contact th eir local organ procurement organization about patients whose death i s imminent or who have died in the hospital. Only organ procurement organization staff or trained hospital staff (designated requestors) should approach families about organ donation. Organ Donation Best Practices The Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative identified these best practices: o Demonstrate accountability through a collaborative, integrated relationship among hospitals, local organ procurement organizations, transplant centers, and medical examiners' offices. o Obtain early referral of potential donors. o Express cultural competency in providing information to families. o Use presumptive consent when discussing donations with families. o Have in -house coordinators, who represent the local organ procurement organization, assist in the donation and procurement process. In the standard approach to organ donation, requestors act as grief counselors, view themselves as advocates for donors' families, use value -neutral languag e, take a passive approach, and raise the possibility of donation. Their request for consent is nonpresumptive, such as \"If you decide to donate...\" In the presumptive approach , requesters are part of a specialized medical team, view themselves as advocates for donors and recipients, use value -positive language, take and active approach, and speak affirmatively about donation. Their request for consent is presumptive, such as \"When you decide to donate...\" Strategies to Increase Organ Donation o Living donors can donate an entire kidney, part of the liver, pancreas, and intestines; and all of part of a lung. Most living donations occur between family members or close friends. o Criteria for living donors include physical fitness, good health, age from 18 to 60, and lack of diabetes mellitus, cancer, hypertension, and kidney or heart disease. Living donors must weigh the benefits and risks for themselves and recipients. o Donation after cardiac death is possible. Non -heart -beating donors are categorized to help determin e suitability for organ donation: I (dead on arrival), II (unsuccessful resuscitation), III Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. (anticipated cardiac arrest), IV (cardiac arrest in a brainstem -dead donor), and V (unexpected cardiac arrest in an intensive care unit patient). Category I donors can give tissues, such as heart valves and corneas. Category II donors can provide kidneys. Category III, IV, and V donors can donate all organs except the heart. o The organ recovery procedure follows these steps: o The family decides to withdraw mechanical o r artificial life support. o The patient is identified as a suitable candidate for organ donation. o The legal next of kin provides consent for donation. o The physician withdraws mechanical or artificial life -support measures under controlled circumstances in t he surgical setting. o The donor is pronounced dead. o The organs are recovered. The Donation Process o Before organs or tissues are retrieved, four key steps must be completed: o Determination and declaration of death - The law defines death as irreversible cessation of circulatory or respiratory functions OR irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain, including the brainstem. Medical problems, such as septicemia, communicable disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and cancer, may prevent the donation of organs and some tissues. o Approval from the m edical examiner, as required by state law - The medical examiner should be notified if the death was a homicide or suicide, was accidental, occurred within 24 hours of admission, followed a coma -like state, or affected a person age 18 or younger . o Notification of the local organ procurement organization o Consent from next of kin - Depending on state law, the donor's family or next of kin must sign an organ donation consent form, even if the patient had designated himself or herself as a donor when alive. The Impact of Family Presence on Organ Donation o Studies show that family mem bers who remain with relatives during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and invasive procedures report that the experience removed doubt about what was happening and reinforced that everything possible was done. Give families the option to be present in these situations when clinical findings indicate that the patient may not survive, according to your facility's policy. Family Support During Donation o Notification of death must occur before organ or tissue donation is discussed. The family needs to know that ev erything possible was done to prevent death, that the best possible death occurred, or both. Family members are grieving and may not be able to discuss anything immediately after notification of death. They need time to grieve and to grasp what has happene d before they can consider another critical decision. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Provide family assessment and support. Provide a private, comfortable, quiet area and gives them a chance to share their loss and grief. Offer them a chance to view the deceased's body with a support person, such as a chaplain. Use terms such as \"death\" and \"dead,\" not euphemisms. Assess the family's culture and religion and its effect on donation, but don't avoid discussing donation based on assumptions about the culture or religion. Ad vocate for the patient's decision and support the family's choice about donation. Ensure that the involved parties receive accurate information about donation. o Family education should provide detailed, understandable information about donation. Inform them that donation is performed promptly, strictly confidential, and leaves physical marks that do not interfere with open casket or other funeral arrangements. Explain that organ retrieval takes 4 to 5 hours in the surgical suite. Also, explain that a coordin ator from the local organ procurement organization will be available for support during the donation process. The Procurement Process o Solid organs for donation include the liver, kidneys, heart, pancreas, intestines, and lungs. The organ procurement proces s follows these steps: o The organ procurement organization assigns transplantable organs to compatible recipients. o The organ procurement team convenes. o The team transports the donor to the operating room on mechanical or artificial support and hemodynamical ly maintains the donor in the operating room. o The team removes the organs, examines them, flushes them with a preservative, and packs them in a sterile container for transport or for immediate transplant of the heart, heart and lung, or a single lung. o Afte r retrieval, the team withdraws support measures for the donor. o Tissues for donation include the corneas, bones, pancreatic islet cells, bone marrow, ligaments, tendons, heart valves, skin, veins, and middle ear. Tissue retrieval is less complex and time s ensitive and may occur in the emergency department, morgue, or surgical suite. The maximum time for tissue recovery after asystole is about 6 to 10 hours for heart valves, 10 hours for bone, and 24 hours for corneas and skin. o For eye recovery, maintain the deceased donor in a refrigerated room, elevate the head of the bed to 20 degrees, instill artificial tears in each eye, and then tape the eyes closed with paper tape. Place cool compresses over the eyes. o For heart valve recovery, expect the surgeon to remove and examine the heart, dissect and examine the valves, and send specimens for serologic testing. The organ procurement organization briefly quarantines the valves and then releases them for homograft t ransplant. o For skin recovery, expect the surgeon to use a dermatome to recover skin, treat the skin with antibiotics, and surgically prepare it for grafting. The organ procurement organization stores the skin at 70\u00b0 F (21 C). Financial Considerations The donor's family does not pay for any costs related to organ or tissue donation from the time the patient is declared dead through organ procurement. The recipient, the recipient's third -party insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid pays for all costs related to th e donation. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Definitions and Classification of Pain \"Pain is whatever the person experiencing it says it is, and it exists whenever the patient says it does.\" Pain is \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.\" o Acute pain occurs suddenly, acts as a protective mechanism, is easy to localize, and subsides as healing occurs. o Chronic pain persists for months to years, is difficult to localize, and may result from advancing disease, treatment, or a preexisting medical problem. Pathophysiology of Pain Pain involves sensory, emotio nal, behavioral, and spiritual factors. Nociceptors (pain receptors) are stimulated by chemical, thermal, or mechanical stimuli. As a result, nerve action potentials are transmitted to the dorsal horn fibers. o Myelinated A -delta fibers transmit fast pain, p roducing sharp pain sensations. o Unmyelinated C fibers transmit slow pain, causing throbbing, deep visceral pain. Neurons in the brain let the patient perceive the pain's location, quality, and intensity. The body modulates (alters the perception of) pain v ia the pain -inhibitory (antinociceptive) response system. Endogenous opioids, such as endorphins, inhibit pain impulse transmissio n in the brain and spinal cord. Pain Theories The gate control theory describes a gate that can be opened and closed to manage pain. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods can close the gate to pain. The specificity theory states that injury activates specific pain receptors and that the severity of pain is related to the amount of injury. The neuromatrix theory states that c hronic pain is caused by nerve impulse patterns generated in the brain by a network called the body -self neuromatrix, which includes the patient's feelings, experiences, and genetics. Physiologic Consequences of Pain Pain produces harmful effects on the bo dy, including vasoconstriction; increased heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen consumption; atelectasis; pneumonia; sepsis leading to death; immune system suppression; physical changes; and psychologic al injury.

LESSON OUTLINE Myths and Barriers Related to Pain Management Myths can adversely affect pain management and sho uld be dispelled. They include: o The negative effects of o pioids outweigh their benefits. o Physiologic signs of pain, such as tachycardia and grimacing, are more reliable than patie nt self-report. o Most patients who request pain medication are addicted to opioids and are exhibiting drug - seeking behavior. Barrier s can adversely affect pain management and should be broken. They include: o Disparities exist in treating minorities and women . o Physicians and nurses lack education about pain management. o High -risk patients, such as geriatric, pediatric, cognitively impaired, and non -English -speaking patients, receive inadequate treatment. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which drug exposure results in a reduction of one or more of the drug's effects over time. In some patients, it causes the need for higher doses to achieve the same analgesic effects. Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that often includes tolerance and causes a wit hdrawal syndrome if the drug is abruptly stopped or its dose is reduced. Addiction is a primary, chronic, neurobiological disease characterized by impaired control over drug use, compulsive drug use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Pseudoaddiction includes behaviors of addiction (frequently asking for more analgesics or higher doses) that resolve when the pain is adequately treated. Adult Pain Management When the patient arrives in the emergency department, assess pain with a tool su ch as the PQRST mnemonic, which stands or precipitating factors; quality; radiation; severity; and timing. To assess severity, use a rating scale, such as the 0 -to-10 scale. To manage pain, follow the steps of the World Health Or ganization pain ladder. Pain Management Principles Use nonpharmacologic interventions as adjuncts to analgesics or alone. These include: o Distraction, such as listening to music or reading o Physical therapies, such as positioning and elevating the extremitie s o Thermal therapies, such as heat or ice application For mild pain, use pharmacologic agents, as prescribed. These include: o Acetaminophen (Tylenol), which has daily dose limitations to prevent hepatotoxicity o Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, which may cause gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications For mild to moderate pain, use mild opioids as prescribed. These include: o Oxycodone (OxyContin) o Hydrocodone (Vicodin) o Codeine Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE For moderate to severe pain, use strong opioids, as prescr ibed. o Morphine sulfate and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) are the primary options. o Fentanyl (Duragesic) is an option with a rapid onset and short duration of action. o Meperidine (Demerol) is discouraged because it has neurotoxic effects. To promote rapid analgesic management, nurse -initiated analgesic protocols let triage and other nurses administer analgesics before a physician evaluation. Protocols may include nonpharmacologic interventions, nonopioid administration, or oral administrati on of combinations of drugs that contain opioids. Pain Management Challenges Patients with abdominal pain or multiple trauma may have inadequate pain management because some people mistakenly believe that analgesics should be denied until a diagnosis is ma de. In reality, analgesics should be given cautiously. Patients with acute pain episodes from sickle cell disease should receive a high triage level (such as level 2 using the Emergency Severity Index) and should receive an intravenous opioid within 15 minutes of arrival. For painful procedures, such as urethral catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion, wound repair, and venipuncture, intervene to reduce procedural pain. For procedural sedation, watch for the appropriate depth of sedation, which may be m inimal sedation (anxiolysis), or analgesia, or general anesthesia. o Familiarize yourself with commonly used drugs for procedural sedation, such as midazolam (Versed), fentanyl monitor airway patency, pulse oximetry, patient responses to stimuli, pain, vital signs, and cardiac function. Pediatric Pain Management Pediatric patients account for one -third of E D visits. Contrary to myths, they experience and remember pain and can safely receive opioids. A facial expression of distress is the most consistent behavioral indicator of pain in infants. For verbal pediatric patients, self -report is the standard for pa in assessment. Several pain rating scales may be used for pediatric patients. These are examples: o For patients under age 7, the FLACC scale assesses face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability. o For patients age 3 and older, the FACES Pain Rating Scale or Oucher scale is appropriate. o For those ages 5 and older, an abbreviated numeric (0 -to-5) scale is useful. To relieve pain, nonpharmacologic interventions depend on the pediatric patient's age. For example, parental involvement, swaddling, touching, positio ning, and suckling are appropriate for an infant. Allowing the choice of parental involvement, distraction, video games, trivia, deep breathing, guided imagery, music, praise, and ice or heat are appropriate for an adolescent. Pharmacologic interventions t o reduce procedural pain include sucrose, vapocoolants, and topical anesthetics, such and tetracaine (LET). For mild to severe pain, pediatric patients receive the same nonopioids and opioids as adults but in different dosages. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE For procedural sedation, pediatric patients usually receive midazolam (Versed), ketamine (Ketalar), or propofol (Diprivan). Discharge Education Before discharge, teach the patient about analgesic doses, schedules, side effects, the need to avoid extra doses of acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and the need to seek care for unrelieved pain.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. KEY RESOURCES Coding Tips for Using CRIES Crying The characteristic cry of pain is high pitched. If no cry occurs or the cry is not high pitched, score 0. If the cry is high pitched but the infant is easily consoled, score 1. If the cry is high pitched and the infant is inconsolable, score 2. Requires oxygen for saturation above 95% Look for changes in oxygenation. Infants in pain manifest decreased oxygenation as measured by transcutaneous monitoring or pulse oximetry. If no oxygen is required, score 0. If less than 30 percent oxygen is required, score 1. If more than 30 percent oxygen is required, score 2. (Consider other causes of change in oxygenation, such as atelectasis, pneumothorax, or oversedation.) Increased vital signs Note: Measure blood pressure last because this may awaken the infant, causing difficulty with other assessments. Use baseline preoperative parameters from a nonstressed period. Multiply the baseline heart rate by 0.2. Then add this to the baseline heart rate to determine the heart rate, which is 20 percent over the baseline. Do likewise with the blood pressure. Use the mean blood pressure. If the heart rate and blood pressure are either u nchanged or less than the baseline, score 0. If the heart rate and blood pressure are increased by less than 20 percent of the baseline, score 1. If either one is increased more than 20 percent over the baseline, score 2. Expression The facial expression most often associated with pain is a grimace. This may be characterized by lowered brows, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the nasolabial furrow, and open lips and mouth. If no grimace is present, score 0. If a grimace alone is present, score 1. If a grimace and a noncry vocalization grunt are present, score 2. Sleepless This parameter is scored based on the infant's state during the hour preceding this recorded score. If the infant is continuously asleep, score 0. If the infant awakens at frequent intervals, score 1. If the infant is awake constantly, score 2. Source: Krechel, S., & Bildner, J. (1995).

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Palliative Care Palliative care is a comprehensive and specialized approach to managing patients and families who face a life-threatening or severe advanced illness . It focuses on alleviating physical, psychologic al, emotional, and spiritual suffering and promoting the quality of life. End-of-life care is a phase of palliative care that usually focuses on caring for a patient who is imminently dying. Fewer life -sustaining treatments are employed or recommended during t he end - of-life phase. Certain signs and symptom s are common at the end of life, including pain, dyspnea, nausea and vomiting, and constipation. o Pain may be acute or chronic. Pain control often involves the use of narcotic analgesics such as opioids. If a patient presents with oversedation or respiratory depression, administer very low doses of naloxone (Narcan) to reverse the adverse effects without reversing the analgesic effects. Abruptly reversing the analgesic and adverse effects with naloxone may prec ipitate abstinence syndrome. o Dyspnea is a sense of breathlessness or a shortness of breath. To assess dyspnea, use a numeric rating scale, s uch as the modified Borg scale. Management of dyspnea should focus on identifying the underlying cause and interveni ng with disease -modifying treatments, as appropriate. Pharmacologic interventions include the use of oxygen, opioids, and anxiolytics. Nonpharmacologic interventions include patient positioning (high -Fowler's position), distraction, guided imagery, and the use of a fan to move air across the face. Because dyspnea is subjective, you must tailor treatments to the amount of dyspnea the patient subjectively experiences. o Although nausea and vomiting has many causes, ultimately, it is chemoreceptors in the brain and gastrointestinal tract that release neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine) which produce nausea and vomiting. Different antiemetics work on different neurotransmitters. Antiemetics include anxiolytics (such agents, dopamine antagonists, serotonin antagonists, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and adjuncts (such as dexamethasone) o Constipation can be painful and distressing. Several types of laxatives are available to treat constipation, including stimulants, osmotics, detergents, lubricants, and large -volume enemas. To care for a patient and family's emotional, psychological, social and spiritual needs, communicate clearly and frequently, encourage the patient and family to seek support from their social network, anticipate their needs, and allow the family to be present during resuscitation. Work with other disciplines, such as social services or chaplaincy services to develop policies and procedures for death notification, bereavement services, follow -up contact, and written information about what to do after a death. Although resuscitative measures are the standard of care, they may not be appropriate for all patients near the end of life. Discuss with the survivors and su rrogate decision makers which interventions are appropriate for the situation. Death notification can occur in person or by telephone . It includes four stages: Prepare, Inform, Support, and Afterward. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Bioethical Issues An advance directive is an advance declaration by a person of treatment preferences if he or she is unable to communicate his or her wishes. Advance directives come in three types: living will, durable power of attorney for h ealth care, and do -not-resuscitate (DNR), do -not-attempt -resuscitation (DNAR), or allow -natural -death (AND) orders. Patients and surrogate decision makers have the right to refuse or withdraw life -sustaining measures at any time. The principles of autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence justify the practi ce of self - determination. The principle of double effect involves distinguishing the intended and unintended consequences of an action. For example, administering an opioid is intended to have a good effect but it also has a known harmful effect. Although beyond the scope of this lesson, it is important to differentiate between assisted suicide and euthanasia. o Assisted suicide is the act of providing the means to commit suicide, knowing that the recipient plans to use th e means to end his or her life. o Euth anasia is when s omeone other than the patient commits an act with the in tent to end the patient's life. Healthcare providers must balance the need to master skills, such as endotracheal intubation, cricothyrotomy , and central line placement, and the need to respect the patient and the wishes of the survivors in performing these skills postmortem. o According to the Emergency Nurses Association position statement, specified criteria should be met by individuals seeking to perform these postmortem procedures a nd consent must be obtained from the family. The medical examiner or coroner's office in the county where the patient died usually makes the decision to perform an autopsy. Review your emergency department's policies and procedures that delineat e when to contact the medical examiner or coroner. Care of the Caregiver The d eath of a child, a fetal demise, a mass casualty, the death of someone the clinician knows, or a particularly horrific, traumatic death can profoundly affect the clinician. Recogniz ing the signs and symptoms of compassion fatigue (burnout) and posttraumatic stress is important to maintaining a healthy home and work life . Coping strategies may include: o Asking to be relieved from care responsibilities and tak ing a break o Asking for a reassignm ent to another part of the emergency department o Discuss ing the event with a colleague or friend o Attend ing a critical incident stress debriefing o Using self-reflection to reflect on how you feel after exposure to the event. Focus ing on what you did right o Paying attention to any physical symptoms, thoughts, and feelings and compar ing them with your normal responses o Follow ing basic health principles, such as incorporating physical exercise, meditation, humor, music, relaxation, proper nutrition, and adequate re st Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Data Collection Subjective data are pieces of information that the patient, family, significant other, or caregiver provides verbally. It reflects the person's perception of the problem and is information that the patient or family member has chosen to impart. Objective data are factual findings that can be observed or measured. They may be obtained through physical assessment, physiologic measurements, and laboratory and diagnostic tests. Components of the Initial Patient Assessment The primary assessment aims to immediately identify and address life -threatening conditions by sequentially evaluating the patient's airway, breathing, circulat ion, disability, and exposure, using the ABCDE portion of the A -I mnemonic. It focuses mainly on objective data and limits subjective data to a brief statement of the patient's injuries or chief complaints and the mechanism of injury. In the first seconds , form a general impression based on an adult patient's general appearance, posture, motor activity, speech, affect, mood, and degree of distress. For a pediatric patient, observe the Pediatric Assessment Triangle: general appearance, work of breathing, an d circulation to the skin. o Airway - Assess airway patency. Remove any airway obstruction, position the airway for patency, insert an airway, and protect the cervical spine. o Breathing - Determine respiratory effectiveness and identify breathing abnormalitie s. Assist breathing with oxygen therapy, mouth -to-mouth ventilation, or bag -mask ventilation. Assist with endotracheal intubation, if needed. o Circulation - Evaluate pulses, capillary refill, skin color, temperature, and moisture. Initiate chest compression s, defibrillation, synchronized cardioversion, and medications, as indicated. Treat dysrhythmias. Control bleeding. Establish intravenous access and administer isotonic crystalloids or blood products, as prescribed. o Disability - Assess the level of conscio usness and pupil size and reactivity. To conduct a brief neurologic assessment, use a tool such as AVPU (alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive). Identify the possible cause of a decreased level of consciousness. Treat the patient, as indicated. o Exposure and en vironmental control - Identify signs of underlying illness or injury. Expose the entire body and cover it to prevent heat loss. After addressing emergent threats, the secondary assessment aims to identify all clinical indications of illness or injury using the FGHI portion of the mnemonic. o Full set of vital signs - Measure the patient's temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure with the patient in two or three positions. Also measure body weight and height. Perform serial measurements to detect s ubtle and serious vital sign alterations. o Focused adjuncts - Arrange for focused adjuncts, such as cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, exhaled carbon dioxide monitoring, urinary catheter insertion, gastric tube insertion, and completion of radiographic, di agnostic, and laboratory studies. o Family presence - Facilitate the family's presence in the treatment area and support their involvement in patient care. Provide explanations about care and procedures and use resources to support their emotional and spirit ual needs . Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Give comfort measures - Assess pain (the fifth vital sign) with a tool such as the PQRST mnemonic: Provoking factors, Quality, Radiation, Severity, Timing of onset and duration. Use a developmentally appropriate standardized too l to evaluate pain severity, such as the 0 -to- 10 pain scale for adults or Wong -Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale for pediatric patients from ages 3 to 10. Provide nonpharmacologic comfort measures, such as positioning the patient and applying a cold pack. o History - Collect history data while performing a head -to-toe assessment. Discuss the patient's chief complaint, history of current illness or injury, past medical history, current medications, and allergies. To help organize and obtain an adequate history, use the AMPLE mnemonic: Allergies, Medications, Past medical and surgical history, Last meal eaten, and Events leading to the illness or injury. As time permits, elicit a family and social history. Be sure to identify and address communication needs relat ed to vision, hearing, or language. o Head-to-toe examination - Inspect and palpate the head and face, including the skin, bones, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Assess level of consciousness using a standardized tool such as the Glasgow Coma Scale. It the pati ent has a decreased level of consciousness, use the AEIOU -TIPPS mnemonic as a guide to possible causes: Alcohol, Epilepsy or electrolytes, Insulin (hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia), Opiates, Uremia, Trauma, Infection, Poison, Psychosis, and Syncope. Inspect and palpate the neck to detect jugular vein changes, tracheal deviation, point tenderness, dysphagia, and other abnormalities. On the chest, record respirations, observe the anterior and lateral chest walls, palpate for bony deformity and other changes, auscultate breath sounds and heart sounds. Perform more detailed assessments for patients with dyspnea, abnormal breath sounds or chest pain. To assess the abdomen, inspect it thoroughly, auscultate bowel sounds, gently palpate all four quadrants, test eme sis or stool for blood, and fully investigate gastrointestinal complaints. To evaluate the pelvis and perineum, observe for lacerations, other skin changes, and bleeding; assess genital concerns, vaginal bleeding, priapism, and tone; consider pregnancy; and if the patient is pregnant, assess fetal heart tones. Inspect all four extremities. Note pulses, limb movement, and sensation. Inspect and palpate for pain, tenderness, deformities, and o ther problems. Assess neurovascular status distal to any injury site. o Inspection of posterior surfaces - Evaluate the patient's back and posterior aspects of the arms and legs. Observe for patterned injuries or other injuries that suggest abuse. Palpate the vertebral column for tenderness and deformity. If needed, perform a rectal examination.

LESSON OUTLINE Special Patient Populations Because of their extremes in age, pediatric and geriatric patients have unique anatomic and physiologic characteristics. Obstetric and bariatric patients have change s in body habitus . Patients from all four populations exhibit assessment -related differences in airway, breathing, circulation, disability (neurologic status), vital signs, and other areas. Examples of variations in pediatric patients include smaller, more easily occluded airways; use of diaphragmatic breathing under age 8; a proportionally greater circulating volume; use of the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale; decreasing heart and respiratory rates with age; and the need to assess immunization status and developmental stage. Examples of variations in geriatric patients include loose dentures that may obstruct airways, limited chest excursion, decreased cardiac output at rest, gait and ambulation changes, decreased respiratory rate and increased blood pressure, and the likelihood of comorbidities and polypharmacy. Examples of variations in obstetric patients include predisposition to nosebleeds and airway obstruction, decreased pulmonary reserve and increased oxygen co nsumption, hypervolemia and hypercoagulability, increased heart rate and blood pressure variations based on trimester, and need for fetal heart tone assessment, fundal height measurement, and perineal assessment. Examples of variations in bariatric patient s include difficulty with bag -mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation, increased work of breathing and diminished breath sounds, hypervolemia and muffled heart tones, increased risk of stroke, increased heart and respiratory rates, and the likelihood of comorbidities. Ongoing Assessment Perform ongoing assessments to identify the patient's response to interventions and detect improvement or deterioration in the patient's status. Follow facility protocols, which may require you to repeat: o The trauma score calculation on arrival and 1 hour after ward o Vital sign measurements and the neurologic assessment every 15 minutes for a patient receiving fibrinolytic therapy o The pain rating 30 minutes after administering parenteral opioids Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Many significant anatomic and physiologic differences exist based on the patient's age. Most of these differences appear in the respiratory and circulatory systems. o Age-related differences can affect the airway, breathing, circulation, disability (neurologic system), and exposure. o Other age -related differences include variations in body weight, metabolic rate, insensible fluid loss, bone calcification, drug metabolism, and head and neck. Additional concerns in neonates include the immature thermoregulatory system, immature immune system, and limited glycogen stores. The pediatric developmental stages include neonate, infant, toddler, preschooler, school -age child, and adolescent. Throughout childhood, pediatric patients undergo changes in physical and motor development, intellectual and psychosocial development, language development, expression of pain, and understanding of death. Pediatric Assessment Triangle The Pediatric Assessment Triangle is the initial assessment of a pediatric patient using visual and auditory clues. It includes general appearance, work of breathing, and circulation to the skin. Initial Assessment The primary assessment consists of evaluating the pediatric patien t's airway, breathing, circulation, and disability (neurologic status). It includes an assessment of the level of consciousness; respiratory effort, rate, and quality; skin color, temperature, and capillary refill; and pulse rate and quality. The secondar y assessment includes vital sign measurements, pain assessment, history and a head -to- toe survey (or a toe -to-head survey for a neonate). To gather the pediatric patient's history, use the CIAMPEDS mnemonic. This stands for Chief complaint, Immunizations a nd isolation, Allergies, Medications, Past medical history and parent's or caregiver's impression of the patient's condition, Events surrounding the illness or injury, Diet and diapers, and Symptoms associated with the illness or injury. Respiratory Emerge ncies Unrecognized respiratory compromise is almost always the precursor to cardiac arrest. Assess the patient's respiratory rate and pattern, work of breathing, quality of breathing, and breath sounds. Use a cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter and assess f or decreased level of consciousness and increased work of breathing and fatigue.

LESSON OUTLINE Asthma is a common chronic illness marked by airway hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus plugging. Wheezing is the obvious sign and is accom panied by tachycardia, retractions, and anxiety. As ordered, via metered corticosteroids, and fluids. Bronchiolitis is a viral infection that can be life -threatening in high -risk pediatric patients (those who are under age 3 months, are premature, or have heart or lung disease or chromosomal abnormalities). It usually results from respiratory syncytial virus infection. Treatment requires nasal suctioning, oxygen, and f luids. Prevention calls for palivizumab (Synagis). Croup is a viral inflammation of the subglottic area that usually affects patients younger than age 3. Common signs and symptoms include tachypnea, tachycardia, inspiratory stridor, expiratory wheezing, re tractions, hypoxemia, and cool mist, corticosteroids, and nebulized racemic epinephrine. Epiglottitis is the most emergent acute bacterial upper airway obstruction of childhood. The incidence of epiglottitis in children has si gnificantly declined since the H. influenzae type B conjugate (Hib) vaccine became part of routine early childhood immunizations. The primary pathogen to cause epiglottitis is now Group A beta -hemolytic Streptococcus . It can cause a sudden onset of anxiety , sore throat, muffled voice, respiratory distress, stridor, drooling, tripod positioning, flushing, and a high temperature. Known or suspected epiglottitis requires hospitalization for intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Foreign body aspiration may cause a complete or partial airway obstruction, which initially causes choking, gagging, wheezing, or coughing. Complete obstruction is an acute emergency. Initial treatment calls for immediate removal of the object using back slaps and chest thrusts for infants (or abdominal thrusts for older patients). Pertussis (whooping cough) is an acute respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. It progresses through four stages. After the incubation and catarrhal stages, the paroxysmal stage causes fever and a w hooping spasmodic cough that can lead to hypoxia, gagging, vomiting, and exhaustion. The patient requires isolation, a calm and quiet environment , suctioning, nasopharyngeal culture and sensitivity testing, humidified oxygen, and antibiotics. The convalesc ent stage follows. Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and causes findings that vary with age, such as fatigue and failure in infants, nonproductive cough and mild dyspnea in young children, and night sweats, fever, fatigue, decreased acti vity, and anorexia in older children. The tuberculin skin (Mantoux) test is the most important diagnostic tool. Treatment calls for rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide in a two -phase treatment plan. In pediatric patients, pneumonia usually results from a viral infection but may be caused by bacteria and other organisms. The infection leads to fluid in the lungs, fever, cough, tachypnea, and other respiratory manifestations. Treatment varies but typically includes oxygen, antipyretics, inhaled bronchodilat ors, fluids, and antimicrobials. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Pneumothorax is a collection of air in the pleural space that results in the partial collapse of one or both lungs. Manifestations depend on how much air escapes but may include tachypnea, dyspnea, grunting, hypoxia, asymmetric chest expansion, and diminished breath s ounds on the affected side. Chest tube insertion and closed drainage may be needed to reexpand the lung. Monitoring for tension pneumothorax is also needed. Cardiovascular Emergencies Cardiovascular emergencies fall into three categories : Inadequate heart function (rhythm disturbances and heart failure), inadequate circulating volume (hypovolemia), and inadequate fluid distribution (distributive shock, as in sepsis and anaphylaxis). Cardiovascular assessment focuses on skin color and turgor, capillary refill, level of consciousness, mucous membranes, anterior fontanel, pulse quality, and vital signs. Rhythm disturbances may be fast, slow, or absent. Two fast rhythms \u2014sinus tachycardia and supraventricular tach ycardia \u2014are the major rhythm disturbances in pediatric patients. Slow rhythms include bradycardia (an ominous sign) and junctional and idioventricular rhythms, which are usually terminal. Absent rhythms include asystole, pulseless electrical activity, and ventricular fibrillation. Heart failure results from the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In pediatric patients, it usually results from congenital heart disease. Signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, cough, wheezes, crackle s, cyanosis, delayed capillary refill, pallor, poor appetite, and failure to thrive. Treatment includes inotropics, diuretics, and afterload -reducing drugs. Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and decreased fluid intake lead to dehydration . Dehydration may be mild, moderate, or severe. Manifestations include changes in mental status, skin perfusion, heart rate, pulse quality, urine output, and blood pressure. Unless fluid volume is replaced, hypovolemic shock can ensue. Hypovolemic shock can cause tachycardia; pale, cool, mottled skin; prolonged capillary refill; decreased pulse pressure; decreasing mental status; and hypotension. Management requires supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, fluid bolus administration, collection of blood and urine samples, and cold s tress prevention. Sepsis is a profound, life -threatening bacterial infection in the blood. Septic shock is a type of distributive shock that results in massive vasodilation. Diagnosis is based on suspected infection, hyperthermia or hypothermia, and other signs of decreased perfusion. ED management focuses on preserving vital functions. Adequate ventilation and oxygenation are the first priorities. Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction with a rapid onset and potential to cause death. Common manifestati ons include hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips, respiratory compromise, and reduced systolic blood pressure. In addition to supporting the ABCs, treatment includes epinephrine, fluids, antihistamines, and corticosteroids. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Neurologic Em ergencies The neurologic assessment has four components: level of consciousness, pupil response, vital signs, and movement. To assess the level of consciousness, consider using the simple mnemonic AVPU, which stands for Alert, responsive to Verbal stimuli, responsive to Painful stimuli, and Unresponsive. For a more detailed evaluation, use the pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale, which assesses eye opening and motor and verbal responses. Seizures are involuntary movements or changes in sensation, behavior, or cons ciousness caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In young children, seizures caused by fever are common and self-limiting. During a febrile seizure, treatment includes patient safety, seizure control, and temperature reduction. Other causes of seizures are infection, trauma, toxic exposure, metabolic disturbances, brain tumor, and anoxia. Manifestations may include lip smacking, staring, muscle contractions, or a sudden loss of consciousness. Treatment calls for airway management, injury preve ntion, and seizure control with drugs, such as diazepam (Valium). Status epilepticus is prolonged continuous seizure activity, which can lead to cerebral anoxia and ischemic brain damage. Priorities include airway maintenance, oxygenation, and rapid termi nation of seizure activity with anticonvulsants, such as benzodiazepines.

Key Resources Anatomical and Physiologic Features of Pediatric Patients and Their Clinical Implications Assessment Pediatric Feature Clinical Implications Airway Large tongue relative to size of oropharynx It is a common cause of airway obstruction. Obligate nose breathers Infants younger than age 4 months may develop respiratory distress from nasal congestion. Smaller airway diameter This allows small amounts of blood, mucus, edema, or small foreign objects to easily obstruct the airway and increase the resistance to flow. Cricoid cartilage as narrowest area It provides an anatomical seal for uncuffed or cuffless endotracheal tubes in patients younger than age 8. Larynx more anterior and cephalad This increases the risk for aspiration, which causes an airway obstruction. Cartilaginous larynx It increases the risk of airway compression with hyperflexion or hyperextension, resulting in an airway obstruction. Short neck and trachea It allows the endotracheal tube to be easily dislodged with head movement. Also, it increases the risk of right mainstem intubation. Breathing Less effective compensatory mechanisms In respiratory distress, the work of breathing and respi ratory rate are initially increased. However, the patient tires easily, resulting in rapid decompensation. Higher metabolic rate It results in a more rapid respiratory rate and an increased use of oxygen and glucose. Respiratory rate that varies with age The normal respiratory rate is inversely related to age (the younger the child, the higher the rate). Patients with sustained respiratory rate of more than 60 breaths per minute are at risk for a respiratory failure. A slow or irregular respiratory rat e in an acutely ill infant or child is an ominous sign. Thin chest wall Breath sounds from one lung field are easily transmitted to another. Cartilaginous sternum and ribs; compliant chest wall In respiratory distress, it often causes retractions, which can result in the inability to generate an adequate tidal volume. Poorly developed intercostal muscles This requires a pediatric patient to depend on the diaphragm for respirations. Diaphragm positioned flat It causes anything that impinges on diaphragm movement to impede respirations. Ribs horizontally oriented This prevents increasing tidal volume when stressed. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. Key Resources Assessment Pediatric Feature Clinical Implications Fewer smaller alveoli It provides less surface area for gas exchange. Circulation Increased circulating blood volume: Infant: 90 mL/kg Child: 80 mL/kg Adult: 70 mL/kg It means small volume loss can lead to circulatory compromise. Higher percentage of body water for body weight (Infants have 40% of body water in the extracellular compartment, which decreases to 20% by adolescence.) They can become dehydrated more rapidly. Faster heart rate That means that the normal range varies with age. Myocardium less compliant with less contractile mass and limited stroke volume This causes the cardiac output to be maintained by increasing the heart rate, rather than the stroke volume. Cardiac output falls quickly with heart rates of more than 200 beats per minute or bradycardia. Tachycardia may be an early sign of s hock. Higher cardiac output in infants than in adults That increases the oxygen demand but depletes the cardiac output reserve. Strong compensatory mechanisms They can maintain cardiac output for a long time. However, a rapid deterioration occurs when the pediatric patient becomes exhausted. Hypotension is a late sign of circulatory compromise because the patient remains normotensive until 25% of the volume is lost. Immature renal function in infants It causes dehydration to occur rapidly due to the i nability to concentrate urine. Normal urine output is 2 to 3 m L/kg/hr in an infant; 1 to 2 mL/kg/hr in a child; and 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/hr in an adolescent. Poorly developed sympathetic nervous system in neonates This increases the sensitivity to parasympathe tic stimulation, such as suctioning or defecating, and may lead to a bradycardic response. Disability Immature reflexes present at birth. Babinski's and Moro reflexes are normal findings. Babinski's reflex is normal until a pediatric patient begins to wal k. Closure of anterior fontanel between ages 12 and 18 months This allows increasing the skull size to accommodate the gradual increase in intracranial pressure. Level of consciousness It is greatly affected by adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Flexion as the infant's normal body posture This is a useful finding related to normal neurologic function. Immature autonomic nervous system in infants It limits body temperature control in response to environmental changes. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. Key Resources Assessment Pediatric Feature Clinical Implications Exposure Inability to produce heat through shivering (in infants under age 3 months) They must burn brown fat for thermogenesis (nonshivering thermogenesis), which increases the metabolic rate and increases the use of oxygen and glucose. Higher body surface area -to-weight ratio It increases the risk of hypothermia. Significant heat loss occurs from the skin on the infant's large head. Hypothermia may result in respiratory depression, impaired peripheral oxygen delivery, cardiac irritability, metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and a decreased level of consciousness. Additional Differences Age-related changes in body weight For accurate fluid and medication administration, weigh all pediatric patients on presentation to the ED. If that is not possible: Use a length -based resuscitation tape, such as the Broselow\u00ae tape, to estimate the pediatric patient's weight, if 35 kg or less. For a patient older than age 1: Weight in kg = (2 x Age in years) + 10 For a patient younger than age 1: Weight in kg = (Age in months \u00f7 2) + 4 High metabolic rate with limited glycogen stores It increases the use of glucose, glycogen storage, and the risk of hypoglycemia. Be sure to obtain a point -of-care blood glucos e level when an infant is admitted to the emergency department to assess for hypoglycemia. Greater insensible fluid loss (Two - thirds of an infant's insensible fluid loss occurs through skin. The other third occurs through respiration.) This requires a proportionally greater maintenance fluid requirement. Incomplete bone calcification In the absence of a fracture, this does not rule out an injury to the underlying structures. Altered metabolism of medications in young children due to immature liver f unction This places young children at risk for adverse drug reactions. Proportionally larger and heavier head compared to body It produces a higher center of gravity and increases the risk of a head injury because the patient tends to fall headfirst. Weaker neck muscles and a large, heavy head in infants A rear -facing car seat is recommended for infants and toddlers younger than age 2. Increased risk of infection in infants because the immune system continues to mature during the first year after birth This requires diagnostic tests, especially cultures of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, to help identify an infection because infants have fewer signs and symptoms of an infection other than an altered temperature.

Key Resources FLACC Scale The FLACC pain scale was designed to assess pain in pediatric patients from ages 2 months to 7 years. FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability): 2 Months to 7 Years Categories Scoring 0 1 2 Face No particular expression or smile Occasional grimace or frown; withdrawn, disinterested Frequent to constant frown, clenched jaw, quivering chin Legs Normal position or relaxed Uneasy, restless, tense Kicking or legs drawn up Activity Lying quietly, normal position, moves easily Squirming, shifting back and forth, tense Arched, rigid, or jerking Cry No cry (awake or asleep) Moans or whimpers, occasional complaint Crying steadily with screams or sobs; frequent complaints Consolability Content, relaxed Reassured by occasional touching, hugging, or being talked to; distractible Difficult to console The FLACC: A behavioral scale for scoring postoperative p ain in young children. Pediatric Nursing, 23, 293-297. Us ed with permission. To use the FLACC pain scale, follow these steps: 1. Observe each of the five FLACC categories: face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability. For a pediatric patient who is awake, observe for 2 minutes. For one who is asleep, observe for 5 minutes. 2. For each category, assign a score of 0 to 2 based on this table. 3. Total the scores for all five categories. FLACC provides a pain assessment score of 0 and 10. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Family Presence Many professional organizations support the option of family presence during invasive procedures and resuscitation. Family presence is an extension of family -centered care, which is fundamental to pediatric emergency care. Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary Emergencies In pediatric patients, common chief complaints include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. For any gastrointestinal complaints, the nurse should obtain a pertinent history; inspect, auscultate, and palpate the abdomen; and prepare for diagnostic tests. Gastroenteritis typically causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor feeding. Morbidity results from dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. If oral rehydration cannot correct the fluid deficit, the patient should receive in travenous crystalloid solutions. Appendicitis is the most common disorder that requires surgery during childhood. Manifestations include periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased bowel so unds. Without surgery, the appendix may rupture, causing peritonitis. The c lassic presentation of a hernia is an asymptomatic , painless bulge that becomes more prominent with crying, defecating, coughing, or laughing. In an incarcerated hernia, the protrud ing intestine may be constricted and circulation may be impaired. The hernia may be manually reduced but eventually may require surgery. In intussusception, a proximal part of the intestine telescopes into a more distal part of the intestine. It produces bilious vomiting, characteristic currant -jelly stools , and intermittent spasms of pain. If a barium enema does not correct the problem, surgery is required. Pyloric stenosis causes projectile, nonbilious vomiting after feeding in infants from birth to age 5 months. The disorder requires admission for surgical pyloromyotomy. Testicular torsion typically causes severe testicular pain, scrotal edema, nausea, and vomiting. If manual or surgical detorsion occurs in 6 hours, testicular salvage is likely. Urinary t ract infections cause different signs and symptoms in pediatric patients of different ages. When urinalysis and urine culture and sensitivity testing reveal bacterial infection, treatment calls for antibiotics. Endocrine Emergencies Diabetic ketoacidosis i s a life -threatening emergency characterized by hyperglycemia, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia or ketonuria due to insulin deficiency. As hyperglycemia progresses, diabetic ketoacidosis causes nausea, vomiting, lethargy, altered mental statu s, Kussmaul respirations, and abdominal pain. After supporting the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation, management focuses on correcting metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances, restoring fluid volume, stopping ketogenesis, and avoiding comp lications.

LESSON OUTLINE Hematologic Emergencies Sickle cell disease is an inherited hemoglobinopathy marked by hemoglobin S, which causes red blood cells to become sickle shaped when deoxygenation occurs. This disease may cause a vaso - occlusive, aplastic , or sequestration crisis as well as acute chest syndrome. The g oals of treatment for sickle cell disease are pain management ; oxygenation ; hydration ; electrolyte replacement ; rest; blood replacement , as needed ; and antibiotics , as required. Contagious and Infectious Diseases Infectious diseases that cause skin rashes and have long -term consequences include measles, chickenpox, scarlet fever, roseola, and petechial rash (from meningitis). Impetigo is a skin infection that causes lesions that ooze serous flu id and crust over. Oral or intramuscular antibiotics effectively treat most cases of impetigo. Scabies is caused by itch mites and produces severe itching, wheals, papules, vesicles, and threadlike burrows. It requires treatment with permethrin 5 percent . Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection cause various problems that require physical and psychological support. T he treatment aims to prevent infections and complications, recognize complications early, t reat opportunistic infections, support optimal general health, and prevent disease transmission. A methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection typically causes fever, fatigue, and a nondraining boil or abscess that is red, firm, warm, and painful. T he treatment includes wound drainage , culture and sensitivity testing , and the administration of antibiotics and antipyretics. Cellulitis can result from any injury that breaks the skin, such as an insect bite, abrasion, or surgical procedure, and allows organisms to enter. It causes inflammation of the affected area, usually without a fever. Intravenous antibiotics are the usual treatment. Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis that mainly affects pediatric patients younger than age 5 . Without treatment (high -dose y -globulin and aspirin), the patient may develop cardiac sequelae, such as aneurysms of the coronary arteries. Lyme disease is a systemic, tick -borne illness that causes a characteristic lesion known as erythema migrans. Earl y Lyme disease may be treated with oral antibiotics. Late Lyme disease may require intravenous antibiotics. The p revention of tick bites helps prevent the disease. Meningitis usually results from a bacterial infection and is a common cause of death and dis ability in pediatric patients. Although nuchal rigidity is a classic sign of meningitis, it rarely occurs in infants. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis provides a definitive diagnosis. T he treatment calls for the administration of antibiotics and intravenous fl uids and aggressive management later in the disease. Meningococcemia can occur with or without meningitis and can be rapidly fatal. It causes fever, chills, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, petechiae, and purpuric lesion. Meningococcemia requires aggres sive management with oxygen administration, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic and possibly vasopressor administration.

LESSON OUTLINE The m anifestations and treatment of encephalitis vary with the cause. Care usually includes supportive measures, such a s antipyretic administration, frequent neurologic assessments, fluid restriction, and electrolyte level monitoring. Hair Tourniquet Hair tourniquets usually affect the toes, fingers, or external genitalia, causing excessive crying and redness in the affect ed area. The hair or thread usually is removed with fine scissors and forceps or dissolved with a depilatory agent. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Nonbullous lesions are small, moist, honey -colored lesions with crusted edges. Bullous lesions are larger and rupture, leaving a scaly appearance. Most are commonly found on the face but can spread throughout the body. Implement standard precautions. Apply topical antibiotic ointment for 3 days. If there is no improvement, add oral antibiotic. Administer oral antibiotic s for widespread lesions. Admit infants for intrav enous antibiotic therapy. Keep the pediatric patient out of school or daycare until 24 hours after therapy has begun.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. Philadelphia: Saunders. Two types of methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections exist: health care -associated (HA) and community -acquired (CA). Community -acquired MRSA has evolved from a res istant S. aureus strain to an entirely new strain that carries a different gene for Panton - Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and leads to leukocyte destruction and tissue necrosis. It results in more serious infections of soft tissues and skin that include absces s formation, cellulitis, pneumonia, and even necrotizing fasciitis. Community -acquired MRSA infection has increased in incidence and mainly affects pediatric populations, especially athletic teams. Teach the patient and caregivers the importance of completing the antibiotic therapy, if prescribed. Cover the infected area until resolved . Scabies Sarcoptes scabei , the itch from Habif, T.P. (2010). Clinical dermatology: a color guide to diagnosis and therapy (5th ed.). Edinburgh: Mosby. Lesions can be papules, vesicles, or pustules. They are most commonly found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists and elbows, the web area of fingers, and on the toes, in the groin, and on the buttocks. Infants have lesions over the body, including the head, palms, and soles. Implement standard precautions. Administer two topical treatments of permethrin 5%, 1 week apart. Thoroughly clean the clothing, bedding, towels, and seat covers. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. Viral Exanthemas The two most common viral exanthemas are measles and chickenpox (varicella). Most viral exanthemas are preventable diseases because prophylactic vaccines exist and are administered during early childhood. Pediatric patients who acquire these ill nesses usually have not received the expected measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) or varicella vaccines. In some cases, pediatric patients who have received the varicella vaccine may acquire a mild disease state. Measles (rubella) and chickenpox (varicella) are d efined as reportable infectious diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fever, fatigue, and skin rash occur. Isolate the patient immediately until the diagnosis is confirmed or refuted. Encourage fluid consumption. Offer mild analgesics, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin), as prescribed. Follow age - related guidelines for dosing. Administer antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), to manage itching. Use a cool mist vaporizer in the room. Suggest tha t caregivers offer tepid baths to alleviate itching or offer oatmeal or baking soda baths. Teach the patient and caregivers to have the patient wear loose cotton clothing and avoid scratching. Advise them to change the linens daily.

Measles (Rubeola) Illness results from paramyxovirus (genus Morbillivirus). Image R.L., Goldman, L., & Ausiello, D.A. (2008). Cecil medicine (23rd ed.). Philadelphia: Saunders. The other type of measles (rubella, also called German measles or 3 -day measles) is caused by the togavirus. Rubella infection is rarely a cause for concern but is a reportable infectious disease. Cough occurs. Koplik's spots appear. Skin rash begins as discreet maculo - papules that ultimately coalesce to form an extensive maculo - papular rash that begins at the neck behind the ears and extends down to the rest of the body. Implement airborne and contact precautions. Dim the lights because photophobia often occurs. Administer analgesics, such as codeine or another oral opioid, as prescribed, for moderate headache or persistent cough that interferes with adequate rest and sleep. Chickenpox Varicella zoster virus is the causative organism. Image courtesy of David Effron, MD. Infection in pregnant women poses a risk of fetal congenital anomalies or death. Varicella pneumonia is a risk in severe cases. Skin rash progresses through stages, from papule to vesicle to pustule, before finally becoming crusted over. All stages of the rash can be present at any time until the viral process has run its course. Implement airborne and contact precautions. Consider the pediatric patient contagious until all rash lesions have crusted over. Continue isolation until this occurs, usually during the third week of infection. Teach caregivers to apply calamine topical lotion to the rash lesions. Begin oral acyclovir (Zovirax) therapy, as prescribed. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) HIV-1 or HIV -2 virus is transmitted by Signs and symptoms vary and may include: Fever Implement stan dard precautions.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The genitourinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and external genitalia. The kidneys produce urine to regulate fluid and electrolyte balance. The ureters transport urine to the bladder for temporary storage. Urine drains from the bladder to the outside via the urethra. The exte rnal structures of the male genitourinary system also have reproductive functions. The renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system and antidiuretic hormone are feedback -loop systems that maintain fluid homeostasis. Patient Assessment During the history, thoroughl y assess genitourinary complaints, such as changes in urination, genital lesions, discharge, hematuria, and pain. Obtain a medication, employment, sexual, and menstrual history. Ask about a history of hypertension, diabetes, infections, urinary calculi, an d other conditions that may be related to genitourinary disorders. During the physical examination, perform a general survey; inspect the abdomen and external genitalia; palpate tender areas, the abdomen, bladder, and testes; and auscultate for fetal heart tones in a pregnant woman. If indicated, assess catheter patency, assist with perform ing a vaginal examination, or palpate the prostate gland. As ordered, obtain a urine specimen for urinalysis and a blood sample for chemistry values. Also, prepare the patient for bladder ultrasonography and residual volume measurement i f needed. Specific Renal Disorders Acute kidney injury is deterioration in renal function that develops over hours or days and causes nitrogenous wastes to accumulate. It causes fluid, electrolyte, and acid -base imbalances, such as volume overload, hyperka lemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The diagnosis is based on changes in the serum creatinine level, glomerular filtration rate, or urine output. The patient may need emergency dialysis. The complications of peritoneal dialysis access include peritonitis and exit site infections, which may cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and cloudy dialysate. Treatment may require antibiotics or access device replacement. Complications of hemodialysis access include clotted vascular acce ss (treated with fibrinolytics) and site infection or septicemia (treated with antibiotics and possibly device replacement).

LESSON OUTLINE Rhabdomyolysis results from skeletal muscle destruction that releases myoglobin, which can lead to acute kidney in jury. Although the patient may present with muscle pain, the primary diagnostic indicator is a serum creatine kinase level at least five times above normal. Treatment may require fluids, electrolytes, diuretics, and sodium bicarbonate to increase urine out put and flush myoglobin out of the kidneys. Urinary tract infections usually result from Escherichia coli and cause urinary frequency and urgency, dysuria, hematuria, suprapubic discomfort, and cloudy urine. If the infection progresses to pyelonephritis, t he patient may have dull flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, pyuria, hematuria, malodorous urine, chills, fever, leukocytosis, and vomiting. Urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis are other genitourinary infections. All require treatmen t with antibiotics and may be prevented with lifestyle changes. Interstitial cystitis causes recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and surrounding area but usually produces varying signs and symptoms that mimic those of other disorders. Treatment involves anti -inflammatories, antidepressants, pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron), nerve stimulation, bladder training, bladder instillation with medications, and lifestyle changes. Urinary calculi are masses of calcium, struvite, or uric acid crystals and protein that precipitate in the kidneys and cause urinary tract obstruction. When they move, calculi cause back pain that radiates, an urge to void, dysuria, renal colic, and hematuria. Helical computed tomography is the gold standard for diagnosis. Inter ventions include pain management, increased fluid intake, intake and output measurement, straining of urine (with testing of solid material), and patient education. Male Genitourinary Emergencies Testicular torsion (sudden twisting of the spermatic cord) c auses the vascular compromise of the testes. If detorsion occurs within 6 hours, testicular salvage is likely. If more than 12 hours have elapsed, the salvage rate approaches 0 percent, and the ischemic testicle must be removed. Torsion usually affects ado lescents with an anomaly of the tunica vaginalis. Epididymitis usually results from a sexually transmitted infection and affects males under age 35. Manifestations include severe scrotal pain, spermatic cord tenderness, edema, fever, pyuria, urethral discharge, and a positive Prehn's sign. Treatment calls for antibiotics, antipyretics, analgesics, bed rest, and avoidance of sex and physical strain. Priapism is a persistent, painful erection that is not associated with sexual desire. It causes severe pain that increases with the duration of the erection, urine retention, and sexual intercourse. The goal of treatment is pain management and acute detumescence. Complications can include impotence. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Sexually Transmitted Infections Sexually tr ansmitted infections include chancroid, and bacterial vaginosis. These infections can present with various signs and symptoms, including discharge, le sions, and pruritus and burning at the urethra, vagina, perineum, or pharynx. Common tests include culture and sensitivity testing of lesions or drainage, a serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, wet mount, and urinalysis with culture and sensitivity testing. Treatment usually requires antibiotics as well as discharge teaching about sexual abstinence until the treatment is complete and the lesions are healed, the need for partner treatment, the use of condoms, follow -up in 7 to 10 days, and the consideration of human immunodeficiency virus testing. Complications of untreated sexually transmitted infections include endocarditis, arthralgias, meningitis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, proctitis, and sterility. Prevention Because mos t genitourinary disorders are preventable, the nurse should teach patients about safe sex practices, dietary modifications, changes in hygiene practices, and methods to control diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure. The nurse can also help prevent acut e kidney injury by maintaining intravascular volume, supporting blood pressure, and minimizing exposure to nephrotoxic agents.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The upper airway includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The lower airway includes the larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli (functional units of the pulmonary system). During i nspiration , negative intrathoracic pressure in the pleural cavity pulls air into the lungs. During expiration , the negative pressure decreases, and air is passively expelled. Cellular o xygenation depends on adequate oxygen supply, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, and the ease of oxygen release to the cells. The oxygen -hemoglobin dissociation curve describes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Respiration is the exchange of oxygen and carbon di oxide at the cellular level. Ventilation is the mechanical flow of air into and out of the lungs. Perfusion refers to the transport of blood to the tissues. Assessment Assess and manage airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) and assess to detect conditi ons that may lead to hypoxia, hyperventilation, or hypoventilation. Ensure airway patency. Assess the work of breathing, noting signs of distress. Identify abnormal breathing patterns, such as tachypnea and Biot's respirations. Auscultate breath s ounds to detect normal and abnormal sounds. Obtain a respiratory -focused h istory . Monitor oxygen saturation, cardiac rhythm, and vital signs; administer oxygen; and prepare for tests, such as chest radiography and arterial blood gas analysis. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is an inflammation usually caused by a virus. It causes sore throat, stuffy nose, cough, wheezes, and possibly fever, chest discomfort, and fatigue. Chest radiography distinguishes acute bronchitis from pneumonia. Treatment may call for fluids, irritant avoidance, cough medications, inhaled bronchodilators, and vaporizer use. Pneumonia Pneumonia is an inflammation usually caused by an acute bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, cough, hemoptysis, dyspn ea, pleuritic chest symptoms, and consolidation and crackles on auscultation. Diagnosis requires sputum culture and sensitivity testing and Gram staining, chest radiography, pulse oximetry, and blood work. Treatment includes oxygen, antibiotics, fluid and electrolyte monitoring, and teaching about pneumococcal vaccination and smoking avoidance.

LESSON OUTLINE Asthma Asthma is a reversible obstructive disease of the lungs. It is characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in response to certain triggers. Manifestations include cough, wheezes, prolonged expiration, reduced peak expiratory flow rate, increased work of breathing, accessory muscle use, decreased level of consciousness and air movement, and low oxygen saturation. Asthma can be controlled, not cured. Care includes oxygen, pulse oximetry, measurement of the peak expiratory flow rate and end -tidal carbon dioxide level, drug administration, arterial blood gas analysis, and trigger avoidance. Drugs c ommon ly used to treat asthma and other respiratory emergencies include bronchodilators (including long - and short -acting beta 2 agonists and immunomod ulators. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a progressive, irreversible syndrome marked by diminished inspiratory and expiratory lung capacity. It includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is associated with smoking. Signs and symptoms include barrel chest, chronic cough, distant breath sounds, and tachypnea. With acute exacerbation, the patient may have worsening dyspnea, increased sputum, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, wheezes, crackles, and signs of respira tory distress, such as pursed lip breathing and tripod positioning. Management includes oxygen, nebulized medications, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and possibly antibiotics. Emphysema causes permanent enlargement of the respiratory tract distal to the terminal bronchioles as well as alveolar wall damage or destruction. Chronic b ronchitis affects the larger airways, causing bronchial inflammation and increased mucus production. Pulmonary Embolus A pulmonary embolus is undissolved material that occludes a pulmonary vessel and obstructs distal circulation. It can be fatal in 1 hour of symptom onset and stems from blood stasis, vessel wall damage, and altered coagulation. Dyspnea is common. Other effects include tachycardia, tachypnea, and right ventricular failure. Although pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for d iagnosis , spiral computed tomography and other, less risky tests may be used first. Treatment may include cardiac monitoring, oxygen, analgesics, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, anticoagulants, fibrinolytics, embolectomy, and umbrella filter placement in the inferior vena cava.

LESSON OUTLINE Pulmonary Edema Pulmonary edema is a life -threatening complication of an acute event. It may be cardiogenic (resulting from cardiac compromise) or noncardiogenic (resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome). Patients exhibit cardiovascular manifestations from flui d overload and respiratory manifestations from impaired oxygen exchange across the alveolar -capillary membrane. Selected signs and symptoms include severe dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, tachypnea, and white or pink frothy sputum. Interventions include oxygenation, bronchodilators, high -Fowler's positioning, positive end - expiratory pressure, Spontaneous pneumothorax may occur with or without an underlying pulmonary condition and may be primary, secondary, or iatrogenic. Findings may include dyspnea, chest pain on the affected side, subcuta neous emphysema, cyanosis, and hypotension. Interventions can include pulse oximetry, oxygen, observation, and tube thoracostomy or needle aspiration. Inhalation Injury For a patient with an inhalation injury, consider asphyxiant (especially carbon monoxid e) exposure, thermal or heat injury, and smoke poisoning. Carbon m onoxide displaces oxygen from hemoglobin. The carbon dioxide level determines symptom severity, which ranges from mild headache and vertigo to dysrhythmias, seizures, coma, and cherry red sk in. Airway maintenance and oxygen are required. Heat i njury usually affects the upper airways, causing mucosal erythema, edema, and blisters. Intubation may be used to maintain airway patency. In smoke p oisoning , inhalation of toxic gases can lead to pulmo nary edema in 24 to 48 hours. Interventions include oxygen, pulmonary toilet, bronchodilators, and possibly mechanical ventilation and positive end -expiratory pressure. If the patient was exposed to cyanide, administer a cyanide antidote kit or hydroxocoba lamin (Cyanokit). Foreign Body Aspiration Aspiration usually occurs in pediatric and geriatric patients. Foreign bodies include food, bone fragments, nails, pins, small toys, coins, medical instrument fragments, and dental appliances. Upper airway aspirati on is obvious and immediately life threatening. Lower airway aspiration may be asymptomatic or cause coughing, gagging, and choking. Treatment depends on severity. It may require basic life support, object removal by laryngoscopy, or cricothyrotomy. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

In wet drowning, asphyxiation causes airway relaxation, which lets water enter the lungs. In dry drowning, no water enters the lungs because airway relaxation occurs after cardiac arrest and cessation of breathing. Manifestations include respiratory distress, bronchospasm, and spinal cord injuries. Treatment may call for airway maintenance, cervical spine stabilization, oxygen, intubation and mechanical ventilation, fluids, laboratory tests, gastric tube and urinary catheter insertion, and core rewarming.

LESSON OUTLINE Overview Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the recipient's explicit consent. Anyone can be a sexual assault victim. If a victim did not want the sexual contact, then the assault was not his or her fault. Perpetrators commit sexual assau lt to dominate, abuse, and humiliate. Although a sexual assault occurs every 2 minutes nationwide, most victims still do not report assaults , primarily because of self -blame or guilt. Men are raped for the same reasons women are raped: power, control, and humiliation. About 73 percent of sexual assaults are committed by someone known to the victim. This is called acquaintance (date) rape . Statutory rape refers to the legal age of consent for sexual conduct, penetration, or both. The terms victim and survivo r are used interchangeably for patients who have experienced abuse, assault, or other personal violations . Psychological Impact Although emotional responses to sexual assault vary greatly, short -term reactions commonly include anxiety, panic attacks, and f ear of death. If psychological effects persist and interfere with normal functioning, it is referred to as rape -trauma syndrome . This syndrome is marked by nightmares or flashbacks, social withdrawal, avoidance behaviors, and exaggerated startle or hyperal ertness. Emergency Department Care Establishing trust is an essential part of emergency care. Remind the patient that he or she did not cause the assault a nd has the right to decide what to do with his or her body and not to be hurt or violated. Arrange fo r support from the patient's friend, relative, or partner and from a crisis advocate. When caring for a sexual assault victim, follow treatment protocols established by your state and facility. Use the evidence collection kits and standardized documentatio n forms provided. A sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) is a registered nurse with advanced education in forensic examinations of sexual assault victims. In most hospital -based programs, a sexual assault nurse examiner is on call 24 hours a day and will r espond within 1 hour to conduct a medical -forensic examination. Sexual assault response teams (SART) are multidisciplinary groups of community professionals that work together in the victim's best interests. A team usually includes a sexual assault nurse e xaminer, local law enforcement official, rape advocate, and prosecutor. Sexual Assault Evaluation Sexual assaults meet the psychological distress criteria for emergent triage priority , which is category 2 on the Emergency Severity Index. Place the patient in a safe, secure room as soon as possible and expect a physician or mid -level provider to perform a medical screening examination to rule out an emergency medical condition. Sexual assault is a legal determination, not a medical one. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE The patient must give informed consent for medical treatment, evidentiary examination, and photography. Inform the patient if the nurse and the facility are legally required to report the sexual assault, but tell them it is their decision whether or not to report it to law enforcement officials. Evidence can be collected at the time of the ED visit, and the patient may decide later whether or not to file a po lice report. Obtain an assault -specific history to determine the type of evidence to collect. Most evidence can be collected up to 72 hours after the assault. A few types of evidence may be collected beyond this time limit. Drug -facilitated sexual assault is the use of drugs to cause sedation or amnesia in order to perpetrate a sexual assault. Common date -rape drugs are flunitrazepam and other benzodiazepines, gamma -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and ketamine (Ketalar). Because they have a short half -life, the nurse should obtain a first -voided urine specimen from any patient who may have been assaulted and had a memory loss or was found unconscious. Wear personal protective equipment for the physical examination . Have the patient undress on the evidence kit paper placed on a hospital sheet. Put each piece of clothing evidence in a separate paper bag. Perform a head -to-toe physical assessment, noting all injuries, documenting their characteristics, and using a body map. Collect swabs from all orifices inv olved in the sexual assault as well as other forms of evidence. Assist with a pelvic examination for a female patient or inspection and swabbing of the penis and scrotum for a male patient. Label all swabs and slides and ensure that they are dry before sen ding them to the forensic crime laboratory. Photographs can supplement the medical -forensic history and physical findings. Sexual assault does not necessarily cause genital or other trauma. The forensic evidence chain of custody is the line of possession f or the evidence until it is processed and presented in court. To maintain the integrity of the evidence, the nurse must be able to verify its whereabouts at all times. After the examination, offer the patient a shower, clean clothes, food, drink, and a pil low and blanket. Patient Discharge For sexual assault victims, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend s prophylaxis against these sexually transmitted infections : trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, recommend s considering prophylaxis against the human immunodeficiency virus infection and hepatitis B . In addition, the CDC recommend s pregnancy prophylaxis , preferably with levonorgestrel (Plan B One - Step). This progestin -only pill is more effective and better tolerated than estrogen -containing drugs. Encourage the patient to be re-examined in 10 to 14 days to detect new infections, complete hepatitis B immunization (if indicated), complete counseling and treatment for other sexually transmitted infections, and monitor for side effects and compliance related to human immunodeficiency virus prophylaxis.

LESSON OUTLINE Testifying in Court The judge may qualify a sexual assault nurse examiner as an expert witness who can give opinion testimony and offer conclusions about his or her findings. If you are called to testify as an emergency nurse, review only the patient's medical record and the facility's policies and protocols related to the case. Make your curriculum vitae available to attorneys. When on the stand, be objective and truthful, act as an unbiased witness, and do not take the position of an advocate .

LESSON OUTLINE Pathophysiology Review In shock, cellular metabolism switches from aerobic to anaerobic to try to meet cellular energy needs. In anaerobic metabolism, lactate, hydrogen ions, and inorganic phosphates accumulate in cells. The small amount of adenosine triphosphate created by anaerob ic metabolism is insufficient to maintain cellular function, and irreversible damage may result. Global cellular damage triggers the body to initiate a systemic inflammatory response. In this response, the immune system and other systems initiate a cascade of biochemical changes to try to protect the body. The stress of shock triggers gluconeogenesis. The resulting hyperglycemia impairs cell growth and metabolism and white blood cell function. Inadequately perfused cells trigger compensatory mechani sms to try to restore and maintain homeostasis. o Baroreceptors trigger sympathetic stimulation and peripheral vasoconstriction to increase circulating volume and maintain blood pressure. o The sympathetic nervous system releases epinephrine and norepinephrine , constricting the arterioles and veins. o When shock occurs, the body preferentially perfuses the brain. However, as the mean arterial pressure continues to fall, blood is shunted away from the cerebral cortex to maintain perfusion of the brainstem. o In resp onse to decreased kidney perfusion and sympathetic nervous system activation, the kidneys release renin, starting the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone response, which increases circulating volume and cardiac output and decreases urine output. o The sympathetic nervous system stimulates the adrenal glands to release epinephrine and norepinephrine. This leads to a stress response that ultimately causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol, which raises the blood glucose level, causes water and sodium retention, and suppresses the immune system. o As shock progresses, epinephrine triggers glycogenolysis in the liver, which makes more glucose available to meet the cells' energy needs. Also, hepatic vessels constrict to redirect blood flow to other vital organs. o Lacti c acid buildup results in metabolic acidosis, which increases the ventilation rate. This compensatory mechanism helps maintain acid -base balance, maximizes oxygen delivery to the alveoli, and increases oxygen delivery to the cells. Without compensatory mec hanisms, shock is progressive, moving through three stages and ultimately resulting in death. o In the compensated (nonprogressive) stage, compensatory mechanisms increase end -organ perfusion. Aerobic metabolism changes to anaerobic metabolism, and lactic ac id is produced. Signs and symptoms include altered mental status, increased pulse and respiratory rates, and pale, cool skin. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o In the uncompensated stage, these mechanisms begin to fail, leading to cellular derangement that causes organ dea th. Signs and symptoms include increasing heart and respiratory rates; cool, clammy skin; decreased capillary refill; increased anxiety and confusion; nausea; vomiting; and pulse pressure changes. o In the irreversible (refractory) stage , no treatment can re verse shock. Types of Shock Hypovolemic shock (the most common type) results from inadequate fluid volume in the intravascular space. It may be caused by significant fluid loss, as in excessive vomiting or diarrhea, traumatic injury, gastrointestinal or va ginal bleeding, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, posterior nosebleed, osmotic diuresis. It also can result from fluid redistribution (third -space sequestration), as in burns or sepsis. o Hemorrhagic shock is due to the loss of whole blood. It has four classes (ba sed on percent of blood loss) that affect the pulse and respiratory rates, blood pressure, pulse pressure, level of consciousness, and urine output in different ways. Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart fails to function adequately as a pump. Cardiac output decreases, and tissue perfusion diminishes. Cardiogenic shock can result from myocardial septum, and dysrhythmias. Distributive shock results from disruption of the sympathetic nervous system's control of vessel tone, which leads to vasodilation and maldistribution of blood volume and blood flow. It is categorized by its cause as sepsis, anaphylactic, or neurogenic. o Septi c shock is sepsis with refractory hypotension. agents include gram -negative and fungi, viruses, and infection -induced mediators. o Anaphylactic shock is a profound hypersensitivity with a systemic antigen -antibody response. Common allergens include certain insect venoms, pollens, foods, and antibiotics. Acute manifestations occur suddenly and may include hypotension, altered mental status, cardiac arrest, signs of histamine release, anxiety, shortness of breath, nau sea, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, urticaria, and sensations of burning and itching. o Neurogenic shock, the rarest type, usually is associated with acute spinal cord disruption from trauma or spinal anesthesia. Its causes include spinal cord injury above the l evel of T6, brain injury, hypoxia, anesthesia, depressant drugs, and hypoglycemia in insulin shock. Initial findings include hypotension, bradycardia, and warm, dry skin. Obstructive shock results from mechanical obstruction or compression of the great vei ns, pulmonary arteries, aorta, or myocardium, which prevents adequate circulating volume. It may result from an embolus, thrombus, pericardial tamponade, or tension pneumothorax. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Clinical Manifestations of Shock When tissue perfusion decre ases, the body considers only three organs essential: the lungs, heart, and brain. Common respiratory changes are tachypnea, increased respiratory depth, altered breath sounds, and hyperresonance or dullness on thoracic percussion. In the circulatory syste m, an increased pulse rate precedes a weak, thread y pulse and differences between central and peripheral pulses. An increased diastolic pressure and narrowed pulse pressure gives way to decreased diastolic and systolic pressures. The jugular veins are flat tened in hypovolemia, but full in obstructive or cardiogenic shock. Tachycardia occurs initially, but may lead to bradycardia, heart block, and ventricular dysrhythmias. Distant heart sounds and dysrhythmias signal specific causes of shock. In the neurolog ic system, level of consciousness reflects shock and its progression. Early signs of decreased cerebral perfusion include restlessness, anxiety, and confusion. The skin displays p allor, cyanosis, diaphoresis, and cooln ess. Capillary refill exceeds 2 second s. Urine output falls below normal. The blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels increase as renal perfusion decreases. In the gastrointestinal system, bowel sounds become hypoactive or absent, peristalsis ceases, and the serum amylase level increases. The blood glucose level increases. Managing Shock Assess the patient to detect clinical, historical, and laboratory findings that suggest shock. Suspect shock in anyone with a significant history or any of these findings: tachycardia; altered mental status; delayed capillary refill; decreased urine output; pale, cool skin and extremities; and hypotension. During the history, ask about factors that increase the risk of shock, including injuries that affect organs and can cause significant blood loss, recent ex posure to infection, presence of an invasive device, history of immunocompromise or a disorder that increases the risk of decreased tissue perfusion, u se of m edications that may alter compensatory mechanisms or increase the risk of complications or excessi ve blood loss, and recent surgery or immobility. Perform resuscitation with the primary assessment. To correct hypoxia, provide adequate oxygenation. To m anage circulation and perfusion, first identify the type of shock, which determines the management str ategy. o For hypovolemic shock due to diarrhea and vomiting, administer isotonic crystalloids and an antidiarrheal or antiemetic agent, as ordered. o For hemorrhagic shock, stop the bleeding and restore tissue and organ perfusion, such as with fluids and blo od products. o For cardiogenic shock, treat the underlying cause and enhance the effectiveness of the pump, such as with antidysrhythmics, sympathomimetics, or a mechanical device. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o For obstructive shock, identify the obstruction and perform interventions to eliminate it, such as by performing an emergency needle thoracentesis in tension pneumothorax. o For septic shock, perform fluid resuscitation with a crystalloid or colloid equivalent at 20 mL/kg. o For anaphylactic shock, remove the antigen and reverse the effects of the biochemical mediators by giving fluids and epinephrine and placing the patient flat with the legs elevated. o For neurogenic shock, restore vasomotor tone by giving fluids and possibly vasopressors. In shock, the body works to restore acid -base balance. When tachypnea occurs, compensatory respiratory alkalosis results. As anaerobic metabolism increases, the serum pH falls. Because an elevated serum lactate level and a base deficit are serum markers for tissue ischemia, obtain bl ood samples for baseline and serial laboratory tests. The b ase deficit is calculated based on the levels of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO 2), pH, and serum bicarbonate. To correct metabolic acidosis, provide oxygen, ventilation, fluids, medications, and possibly sodium bicarbonate, as ordered. For hemodynamic monitoring in shock, frequently measure blood pressure and assess for signs of hypoperfusion, such as altered mental status, urine output, and skin color and temperature. Use pulse o ximetry to detect hypoxia. U se invasive blood pressure monitoring only in refractory shock states. Avoid r outine use of pulmonary artery catheters. Obtain specimens for laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, b lood t ype and screen or cross - match, s erum chemistry, blood glucose, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. Obtain specific radiographic studies and prepare for other diagnostic tests, such as electrocardiography and peritoneal lavage, as ordered. Complications of shock can include mul tiple organ dysfunction syndrome (the most deadly) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Special Populations Pediatric patients increase cardiac output by increasing heart rate, can sustain arterial pressure despite significant volume loss, and can l ose 25 percent of circulating volume before displaying signs of shock. Hypotension, lethargy, and bradycardia are ominous signs. Early signs of shock include tachycardia; tachypnea; pale, cool, mottled skin; delayed capillary refill (most sensitive sign). Replace lost volume with intravenous crystalloid. Geriatric patients are less able to tolerate changes in end -organ perfusion, have reduced compensatory mechanisms due to the physiologic changes of aging, are predisposed to hypothermia, and may have a furt her weakened response to shock due to a pre-existing diseases. Pregnant patients have hypervolemia and can remain normotensive with up to 1,500 mL of blood loss. Position the patient on her left side, manually displace the uterus to the left, or elevate he r right hip with towels to prevent vena cava syndrome, which can reduce volume by 30 percent . Take aspiration precautions because of the increased risk of aspiration. Treat suspected hypovolemia to prevent placental vasoconstriction.

These injuries are most likely to affect male Caucasians between ages 16 and 30. The most common mechanisms of injury are motor vehicle crashes , falls, and penetrating trauma. Costs range from $238,109 to just under $3 million per year. Anatomy and Physiology Review The spinal column consists of 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral (fused into one), and 4 coccygeal (fused into one) vertebrae. Intervertebral disks separate these 26 units from each other. The vertebral column supports and protects the spinal cord. The spinal cord is the cable of nerves from the midbrai n to the second lumbar vertebrae. It regulates body functions and movements by transmitting nerve impulses between the brain and the body. White matter surrounds its butterfly -shaped core of gray matter, which is divided into dorsal, lateral, and ventral h orns. The white matter consists of multiple spinal tracts. Among the ascending tracts, the dorsal column controls proprioception, pressure, and vibration; the lateral spinothalamic tract controls pain and temperature; the anterior spinothalamic tract regul ates light touch, pressure, and itch; and the spinocerebellar tract controls proprioception to the cerebellum. Among the descending tracts, the pyramidal tracts regulate voluntary skeletal muscle control, and extrapyramidal tracts govern automatic skeletal muscle control. Thirty -one pairs of spinal nerves exit the spinal cord bilaterally and provide pathways for involuntary responses to specific stimuli. These nerves innervate voluntary striated muscles and are responsible for most communication between the spinal cord and the body. Each spinal nerve has a posterior (dorsal) root that transmits sensory impulses from the periphery (in dermatomes) to the spinal cord, and an anterior root that transmits motor impulses from the spinal cord to the periphery. Spin al nerves at different levels innervate selected muscles, causing specific patient responses. For example, nerves at C5 innervate the deltoid, biceps, and brachioradialis muscles, producing shoulder and elbow flexion. Nerves from T2 to T12 innervate the intercostals, affecting vital capacity. Dermatomes are areas of skin innervated by sensory fibers of a single dorsal root of a spinal nerve. The spinal cord's vascular supply arises from the vertebral arteries and aorta. The anterior and posterior spin al arteries branch off the vertebral artery at the cranial base and descend parallel to the spinal cord. They cannot develop collateral blood flow so injuries to them are devastating. The spinal cord consists of ascending ( sensory) pathways and descending (motor) pathways that transmit impulses from and from the brain and other parts of the cord. Mechanisms of Injury Motor vehicle crashes account for 38.5% of all spinal injuries. Major risk factors for these injuries include speeding; driving while distract ed, sleepy, or under the influence of a substance; and not using proper restraints. Movements that can injure the spinal cord include hyperextension, hyperflexion, axial loading, compression, and overrotation and distraction.

LESSON OUTLINE History Facto rs that suggest spinal trauma include the mechanism of injury, a history of a significant event, altered mental status, seizure activity since the event, and complaints of neck or back pain. If the patient is unconscious or received paralytics in the field , ask prehospital providers about the mechanism of injury and any spontaneous movement since the event. Physical Assessment In the initial assessment , evaluate ventilatory effort and observe for incontinence, decreased ability to move, altered sensation, and priapism. In the focused spinal assessment , evaluate strength, symmetry of movement, sensory status of dermatomes, and sacral or perineal sensation. Gently palpate the entire vertebral column crepitus, and step -off deformity . Diag nostic Studies For spinal trauma patients, radiography is used to assess vertebral alignment, identify fractures or ligament injuries, and identify spinal cord compression. If needed, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used. To be class ified as having a low probability of injury, the patient must meet these NEXUS criteria : no midline cervical tenderness, no focal neurologic deficit, normal alertness, no intoxication, and no painful or distracting injury. Spinal Protection During prehospital care , paramedics should initiate spinal protection in all trauma patients. They should initiate spinal protection, using a spinal backboard, a rigid cervical collar, straps, lateral devices beside the head, and extra padding if needed to reduce the risk of flexion or compensate for kyphosis. During emergency department care, maintain cervical spine protection on any patient whose mechanism of injury, symptoms, or physical findings suggest spinal trauma. If the patient is not immobilized, perform manual in -line stabilization of the head and apply a rigid cervical collar. Follow facility protocol to determine when to remove the backboard because its use increases the risk of respiratory compromise and skin breakdown. Logrolling a patient off a back board requires a team approach, usually with four people, and a specific procedure. The leader stabilizes the patient's head and cervical spine during logrolling. Perform cervical spine stabilization , generally which a four -person team, according to the ap proved procedure. Some patients ( such as those with airway compromise, neck deformities, or penetrating injuries) may not be able to tolerate lying flat, and massive neck swelling from a penetrating injury may prohibit cervical collar use. For such patient s, use towel rolls and tape to safely secure them to the board for injury evaluation. If the patient arrives wearing a sports helmet, remove it carefully to maintain cervical spine protection. To accomplish safe helmet removal , use a two -person procedure.

LESSON OUTLINE Patient Management To achieve stabilization , clear the airway using a controlled chin lift or jaw thrust, consider using an advanced airway, check for bleeding as a cause of hypotension, and administer intravenous crystalloids and possibly a vasopressor as ordered. For a patient who presents shortly after a spinal cord injury, give high -dose methylprednisolone (Solu -Medrol), if ordered, to limit spinal cord edema, reduce ischemia, and prevent cellular death. This controversial treatment inc reases the risk of wound infections, pneumonia, pressure ulcers, and urinary tract infections. Because poikilothermia is a risk, maintain body temperature by warming the room, warming fluids, applying warm blankets, and monitoring the patient's temperature . During the secondary assessment, perform additional Interventions , as needed. For example, insert a urinary catheter or gastric tube, remove the backboard as early as possible, pad bony prominences, and keep the patient dry. If ordered, provide cervical traction by assisting with cervical tong or halo device application. Then obtain a cervical radiograph and perform a neurologic assessment. After tongs are applied, make sure the weights hang freely. If a halo device is used, tape devices for emergency rem oval (including a wrench) to the vest. To provide psychosocial care , answer the patient's and family's questions honestly, facilitate the family's presence, and offer supportive care. Vertebral Column Injuries Vertebral fractures or dislocations can result from injury to the bony column, supporting ligaments, or both. Four categories of vertebral fractures exist: o Simple fractures are linear fractures of the spinous or transverse process, facets, or pedicles. Cord compression is rare. The vertebral column is aligned. o Compression (wedge) fractures affect the vertebral body, but the posterior wall remains intact. Spinal cord compress ion may occur. o Comminuted (burst) fractures are multiple fractures of the vertebral body associated with axial loading. They may result in spinal cord injury. o Teardrop fractures are small fractures of the anterior rim of the vertebrae due to force to the mandible or forehead. A fragment may impinge on the cord. Vertebral fractures are classified as stable or unstable based on their potential for cord injury or impingement during healing and for injured bony displacement during healing or afterward with normal loading. Spinal Injuries The initial impact from blunt or penetrating trauma results in primary spinal cord injury , in which the neurons receive actual damage. Common causes of primary injury include vertebral fractures or dislocations, torn ligame nts, and spinal cord transections. Secondary injury may develop minutes after the initial injury. Microscopic hemorrhages and edema or patient mishandling lead to spinal cord hypoperfusion . Secondary injuries extend the primary injury, increase morbidity, and limit future recovery.

LESSON OUTLINE A spinal cord injury at any level may lead to muscle flaccidity, loss of reflexes below the lesion, and an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, pressure ulcers, and pulmonary emboli. The injury level deter mines other effects. Spinal shock usually occurs immediately, and the injury level decides its intensity and duration. It typically causes flaccid paralysis, loss of sensation and deep tendon reflexes, and bowel or bladder dysfunction below the injury leve l. It may last for several days. Neurogenic shock , a form of distributive shock, may also occur with injuries above T6. It causes bradycardia, hypotension, and warm, dry skin. It increases spinal cord hypoperfusion and requires intravenous crystalloids and possibly vasopressors to prevent further spinal cord damage. Specific Spinal Cord Injuries A complete spinal cord injury is characterized by total loss of motor function and sensation distal to a spinal cord injury. Findings include flaccid paralysis and loss of sensory function and all reflexes below the level of injury; bilateral external leg rotation; loss of autonomic fu nction; paralytic ileus; and priapism. Functional motor recovery is rare. Incomplete spinal cord transections cause partial preservati on of the motor tract, sensory tract, or both below the level of injury. They may cause four clinical syndromes: o Central cord syndrome results from hyperextension and causes a loss of motor function in the arms and possibly a partial loss in the legs. o Ante rior cord syndrome usually results from hyperflexion and is characterized by paralysis below the injury with preservation of proprioception and touch. o Posterior cord syndrome results from hyperextension and causes impairment or loss of light touch and prop rioception, but preservation of motor function and pain, temperature, crude touch, and pressure sensations. o Brown -S\u00e9quard syndrome typically results from penetrating trauma and produces same - sided mo tor paralysis and opposite -sided sensory deficit. Two nerve root injuries commonly may result from nerve root compression, usually due to vertebral fractures or disc herniation. o Conus medullaris syndrome results from compression at T12 and causes leg paralysis with variable sensory deficits below the injury l evel and loss of rectal sphincter tone. o Cauda equina syndrome results from compression below L1 and causes saddle paresthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence, and lower extremity weakness. Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormality (SCIWORA) SCIWOR A is a syndrome that may result from the increased ligamentous elasticity in young people. Increased elasticity leads to transient spinal cord subluxation, spinal cord stretching, and vascular compromise. The syndrome causes a brief episode of arm weakness or paresthesia followed by neurologic deficits hours to days later. Prognosis is variable and depends on the degree of neurologic involvement and resolution rate. Magnetic resonance imaging can detect SCIWORA.

LESSON OUTLINE Autonomic Dysreflexia Autonomic dysreflexia is a syndrome of exaggerated sympathetic responses to noxious stimuli. It may occur any time after spinal shock has subsided. Failure to manage its signs and symptoms can lead to a crisis with severe consequences , including death. Com mon manifestations include bitemporal throbbing headache, head and neck sweating, and systolic hypertension. Other effects are blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, nausea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and sweating and flushing above the spinal lesion wit h pallor below the lesion. Intervene promptly . Examine the patient carefully to identify the cause , such as urine retention or fecal impaction. Raise the head of the bed and monitor the blood pressure. If needed, insert or irrigate a urinary catheter. As o rdered, administer medications to treat constipation, urine retention, or hypertension.

Key Resources Rigid Cervical Collar Application A properly fitted collar fits between the point of the chin and the suprasternal notch, resting on the clavicles and supporting the lower jaw. If your facility uses adjustable cervical collars, follow these steps: 1. Determine the appropriate size of the cervical collar by measuring from the patient's chin to the top of the shoulder. Place your fingers on top of the shoulder where the collar will rest and measure the distance to the point of the chin (not the angle of the jaw). 2. Compare this distance on the collar by placing the same number of fingers below the black fastener. The correct size is equal to th e measurement between the edge of the rigid plastic at the bottom of the collar (not the foam portion of the collar) and the sizing window. 3. Assemble the collar by moving the chin piece up until the correct color is in the sizing window. Then lock it in pla ce. 4. Slide the back portion of the collar under the patient's neck until you see the Velcro on the patient's other side. 5. Slide the collar up the sternum until the chin piece fits snugly under the chin. 6. Secure and fasten the Velcro. Note: Always follow the m anufacturer's directions for correct application of the cervical collar. Source: Emergency Nurses Association . (2007).

Key Resources Procedure for Logrolling Patient Off Backboard Putting a patient on a backboard is indicated for transporting a patient with a potential spinal injury, such as the slip and fall outside the cafeteria. Removing the patient from the backboard requires a team approach, usually with four team members. The leader is responsible for stabilizing the patient's head and cervical spine while logrolling the patient off the backboard. 1. The le ader applies manual in -line stabilization by placing his or her hands on each side of the patient's head , over the cervical collar . 2. The leader directs assistant 1 and assistant 2 to position themselves on the same side with one at the patient's shoulders and one at the patient's hips. On the leader's count, the team logrolls the patient toward the assistants. The spine must remain straight, without any twisting motion. The leader should ensure that the patient's nose remains in line with the umbilicus. 3. Assistant 3 removes the backboard. 4. On the leader's count, the team rolls the patient back to the supine position. 5. The leader releases the manual in -line stabilization. Source: Emergency Nurses Association . (2007).

Note that some patients (such as those with a compromised airway, neck deformities, or penetrating injuries) may not be able to tolerate lying flat, and massive neck swelling fro m a penetrating injury may prohibit the use of a cervical collar. For such patients, use towel rolls and tape to safely secure them to the board and allow evaluation of their injuries. 1. The leader stands at the patient's head with the hands on each side of the patient's head. Throughout the procedure, the leader maintains manual in -line stabilization by holding the hands on the patient with the fingers along the mandible. 2. Assistant 1 a ssess es the motor and sensory functions by asking the patient to wiggle hi s or her toes and fingers . This assistant also t ouch es the patient's arms and legs to determine sensory response. 3. Assistant 2 applies and secure s an appropri ately fitting cervical collar, f ollow ing the directions for sizing that come with each collar. An i ll-fitting collar can cause pain, occlude the airway, or fail to give appropriate immobilization. 4. Assistant 3 s traighten s the patient's arms and legs . 5. If the patient needs to be transported to the ED, the team puts him or her on a backboard. To do this, assistants 1 and 2 stand so that they are both on the same side of the patient at the shoulders and hips. Assistant 3 is responsible for the backboard. 6. On the leader's count, the team rolls the patient on the backboard as a unit. 7. The team p laces the straps so that the patient is secured to the backboard at the shoulders, hips, and proximal to the knees. 8. The team f urther immobilize s the patient's head with head blocks or towel rolls. Do not place tape or straps across the chin. 9. The team m aintain s manual in -line stabilization until the head and neck are immobilized. 10. The team r eassess es the patient's motor and sensory functions after the patient is immobilized.

LESSON OUTLINE Substance Abuse and Dependence Substance abuse is the maladaptive use of a substance that leads to impairment, distress, or both as manifested by any of these in a year: failure to fulfill major role obligations (or curtailment of obligations) at work, school, or home due to substance abuse; use of a substance when it is physically hazardous; substance -related legal problems; and conti nued use despite adverse social or personal effects. Substance dependence is the maladaptive use of a substance that leads to impairment, distress, or both as manifested by any three of these in a year: tolerance to the effect of a substance; withdrawal symptoms when the substance is stopped; increased quantity or use over a longer time than intended; unsuccessful efforts to cut down or quit; increased time devoted to getting or using the substance or recovering from its effects; c urtailment of o rdinary act ivities in favor of substance use; continued substance use despite knowledge of its adverse effects. Consequences of substance abuse and dependence include: depression; relapse of drug abuse; drug overdose; bacterial endocarditis, hepatitis, thrombophlebit is, pulmonary emboli, malnutrition, or respiratory infections caused by intravenous drug use; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from shared needles; unsafe sexual practices ; increased risk of specific cancers; and problem s with memory and concen tration. Substance abuse occurs among people of all socioeconomic groups and ages. The 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) reported that more than 20 million individuals over age 12 had abused substances within the previous month. Addiction Drug addiction is a biological disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite harmful consequences. Drug dependence refers to a patient's need for a drug in order to function. It is not synonymous with drug addiction. Some drugs, such a s beta -blockers, do not cause addiction, but can cause physical dependence. Other drugs, such as cocaine, cause addiction without leading to physical dependence. Drug tolerance is the need for a higher dose to attain the same effect. It is usually associa ted with addiction, but is not a defining characteristic. No single gene has been found to cause drug addiction, but family predisposition is a risk. The risk of addiction is higher in males. A drug affects the brain faster when inhaled or injected than w hen ingested. Nursing Considerations Signs and symptoms can range from mild sedation to life -threatening compromise. Ensure the patient has a patent airway , is breathing effectively, and has adequate circulation . Treat life-threatening injuries and assess for drug -related problems . For patients with unusual behavior, obtain a urine specimen for toxicology screening. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Ask about the patient's history of substance use and substances used before coming to the emergency department. Obtain a histo ry of previous treatment for substance abuse, blackouts or seizures, withdrawal symptoms or overdoses, family history of drug or alcohol problems, preexisting physical conditions, current medical status, physical or sexual abuse or assault, and violence to ward self or others. Once the patient is medically cleared, consult with and refer to a psychiatric nurse, social worker, or drug treatment center for treatment of the sub stance abuse problem. Substances of Abuse Drugs of abuse are commonly classified as cannabinoids, depressants, dissociative anesthetics, hallucinogens, opioids and prescription drugs and over -the-counter medications. o Cannabinoids include hashish and marijuana. Effects include euphoria, slowe d thinking and reaction time, confusion, and impaired balance and coordination. Health consequences include cough, respiratory infections, impaired memory and learni ng, increased heart rate, anxiety, panic attacks, tolerance, and addiction. o Depressants include alcohol, gamma -hydroxybutyrate (GHB), benzodiazepines and r educed anxiety, feelings of well -being, lowered inhibitions, slowed pulse and breathing, lowered blood pressure, and poor conce ntration. Health consequences include fatigue; confusion; impaired coordination, memory, and judgment; addiction; respiratory depression and arrest; and death. o Dissociative anesthetics include ketamine, phencyclidine, and dextromethorphan. Effects include increased heart rate and blood pressure and impaired motor function. Health consequences include memory loss, numbness, nausea, and vomiting. o Hallucinogens include lysergic acid diethylamide, mescaline, and psilocybin. Effects include altered states of pe rception and feeling and nausea. Health consequences include persistent perception disorder (flashbacks). o Opioids and morphine derivatives E ffects include pain relief, euphoria, and drowsiness. Health consequences include nausea, constipation, confusion, sedation, respiratory depression and arrest, tolerance, addiction, unconsciousness, coma, and death. Intravenous use of heroin (or other intr avenous drugs) increases the risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis, skin abscesses, soft tissue infections, phlebitis, and bac terial endocarditis. o Stimulants include amphetamine, cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and nicotine. Effects include increased heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism; and feelings of exhilaration, energy, and increased mental alertness. Health consequences include rapid or irregular heartbeat, reduced appeti te, weight loss, heart failure, and insomnia. o Inhalants include household products, such as air fresheners, solvents, spray paints, gases, nitrites, and other aerosols. Effects include stimu lation, loss of inhibition, headache, nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, incoordination, and wheezing. Health consequences include frostbite to the roof of the mouth, unconsciousness, cramps, weight loss, muscle weakness, depression, memory impairment, card iovascular and neurologic damage, and sudden death . Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Commonly abused prescription and over -the-counter medications include opioids, other pain relievers, sedatives, hypnotics, drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cough and cold medications. Different medications produce different effects and health consequences. Tobacco and Nicotine Forms of tobacco include cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Nicotine causes a short -term increase in the blood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow from the heart. It als o causes vasoconstriction . Carbon monoxide reduces oxygen in the blood , decreasing the amount of oxygen delivered to vital organs and tissues. Long -term tobacco abuse is linked to many health problems, including cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchitis. Alcohol and Alcoholism In the United States, alcohol is the most commonly used psychoactive su bstance and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Alcohol intake results in diminished judgment and impulsiveness, which leads to risky, reckless behavior. Excessive intake can cause severe impairment, respiratory compromise, blackouts, unconsciousne ss, and death. Alcohol consumption affects all organs and body systems. o Cardiovascular effects include initially depressed myocardial contractility and peripheral vasodilatation, causing a mild drop in blood pressure and a compensatory increase in heart rate and cardiac output. Hypertension and dysrhythmias occur with three or more drinks per day. o Central nervous system effects are altered sleep stages, peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's psychosis, cognitive problems, and memory l oss. o Gastrointestinal effects include esophagitis, gastritis, vomiting, Mallory -Weiss tears, esophageal varices, gastric cell atrophy , pancreatitis, fat accumulation in liver cells, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. o In males, genitourinary effects are erectile dys function, decreased sperm production, and testicular atrophy. In females, they include infertility, spontaneous abortion, and amenorrhea. o Hematopoietic effects may be anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated mean corpuscular volume, and bleeding disorders. o Integ umentary effects include telangiectasia, seborrheic dermatitis, skin atrophy, hair loss, rosacea, bruising, jaundice, and spider angioma. o Other effects include nutritional deficiencies, increased r isk of fracture, and a decreased triiodothyronine level. Fetal alcohol syndrome is ch aracterized by abnormal facial features, growth abnormalities, decreased muscle tone and poor coordination, delayed development, and heart defects. Withdrawal occurs in four stages : autonomic hyperactivity, hallucinations, neuronal excitation, and delirium tremens. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The thoracic cavity extends from the top of the sternum to the diaphragm. The thoracic skeleton provides bony protection to the structures that lie within the chest cavity; it includes the sternum, ribs, costal cartilages, and thoracic vertebrae. Internal thoracic structures include organs and structures of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Assessment Emergently assess a patient with suspected thoracic injuries because chest injuries can cause death within minutes. Assess the patient's airway patency. o Observe for patient vocalization; airway obstruction by the tongue; loose teeth or foreign objects in the mouth; blood, vomitus, or other secretions; and edema. o As needed, perform life -saving interventions. Open the airway while maintaining neutral cervic al spine alignment, clear the patient's airway, use an airway adjunct, and prepare for endotracheal intubation. Assess the patient's breathing. o Observe for spontaneous breathing, rise and fall of the chest, breathing rate and pattern, accessory muscles use , diaphragmatic breathing, skin color, integrity of the soft tissues and bony structures of the chest, bilateral breath sounds, tracheal deviation, and jugular vein distention. o As indicated, perform appropriate interventions. Give oxygen via nonrebreather mask; provide ventilatory support; apply a three -sided assist with needle thoracentesis or emergency resuscitative thoracotomy; and prepare for chest tube insertion, autotransfusion, or pericardiocentesis. Assess the patient's circulati on. o Note the central pulses' strength and rate ; skin color, temperature, and moisture; capillary refill time; heart sounds; the arms; and extremity pulses. o Intervene as needed. Control external bleeding with direct pressure, establish two large -bore intravenous lines, infuse warmed crystalloids, monitor and treat dysrhythmias, monitor oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry, prepare for autotransfusion or pericardiocentesis, anticipate blood products, and assist with emergency r esuscitative thoracotomy. Chest Wall Injuries Rib fractures are caused by blunt force or crush injuries . Fractures may occur in one or more ribs, most often in the fourth through tenth ribs. o Signs and symptoms include pain or tenderness at the fracture si te, shallow respirations, subcutaneous emphysema, or crepitus. o Treatment includes good pulmonary toilet, early mobilization, avoidance of chest binders and strapping, and possible hospital admission or internal fixation with plates and screws. Pain managem ent may include oral analgesics, transdermal or intravenous opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or intercostal blocks. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE In flail chest, fractures occur in two or more adjacent ribs in two or more places, or the sternum is detached bilaterally from the costal cartilage. o Signs and symptoms include pain and difficulty breathing. Right after the injury, muscular splinting of the chest may mask a flail chest until hours later when intercostal muscles fatigue and paradoxical move ment becomes obvious. o Treatment focuses on oxygenation, fluid administration, and rarely , surgical stabilization. Pain management includes a patient -controlled analgesia pump; administration of oral, transdermal, or intravenous analgesics; the use of an intercostal block or indwelling epidural catheters. Sternal fractures result from tremendous force. The most common site is the junction of the manubrium and sternum. A sternal fracture raises the risk of cardiopulmonary injury, including pulmonary contus ion, blunt cardiac injury, and pericardial tamponade. o Manifestations of sternal fractures are dyspnea, localized pain with movement, hypoventilation, chest wall ecchymosis, sternal deformity, and crepitus. o Treatment includes pain relief, baseline electroca rdiography, or operative reduction. Traumatic asphyxia results from severe thoracic compression caused by a strong crushing mechanism that persists for a time. o Signs and symptoms include cyanosis of the face and neck, subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhag es, moon -shaped face, and transient neurologic findings. o Treatment includes supporting the patient's airway and ventilation, preventing secondary cerebral injury, and elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Pulmonary Injuries Laryngeal injury commonl y results from striking the anterior neck on the steering wheel or dashboard or sustaining a karate blow or \"clothesline\" injury. o Signs and symptoms laryngeal tenderness, subcutaneous of landmarks. o Treatment includes observation; keeping the head of the bed elevated 30 to 45 degrees; providing humidified air; keeping the patient NPO and on voice rest; giving oxygen, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, or otics; and preparing for cricothyrotomy, tracheostomy, or surgery. Tracheal injury may be blunt or penetrating. o Noisy breathing may be the only sign of partial obstruction. Absent breathing may indicate complete obstruction or disruption. Diagnostic evalua tion includes bronchoscopy, computed tomography, intubation, tracheostomy, or surgery. Bronchial injury is unusual and often overlooked. Blunt chest trauma that causes bronchial injury has a high mortality rate because the diagnosis is delayed or missed. o Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, tachycardia, diminished or absent breath sounds, hemoptysis, subcutaneous emphysema, tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift, Hamman's crunch, bilateral tension pneumothoraces, and persistent emphysema or air leak after chest tube insertion. Bronchoscopy confirms the diagnosis. o Treatment may be limited to airway support until inflammation and edema resolve. However, a patient with a significant tear requires surgery.

LESSON OUTLIN E Pneumothorax is air accumulation in the pleural space that causes partial or complete lung collapse as negative intrapleural pressure is lost. It may result from a blunt or penetrating injury. Lung laceration, often associated with rib fractures and air leak, is the most common cause of pneumothorax with blunt trauma. Open pneumothorax occurs when an opening in the chest is more than two -thirds the diameter of the trachea. Tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulation in one pleural space forces the t horacic contents to the opposite side of the chest. o Signs and symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased or absent breath sounds (or normal breath sounds due to thoracic cavity resonance), hyperresonance on percussion, tachycardia, and tac hypnea. Open pneumothorax may also cause hemoptysis, hypotension, a sucking or hissing sound on inspiration, and bubbles or froth around the wound. Tension pneumothorax may also cause a feeling of impending doom, dysrhythmias, hypotension, jugular vein dis tention, and tracheal deviation. o Treatment includes observation and serial chest radiographs, or chest tube insertion. For open pneumothorax, it includes placing a sterile, nonporous, three -sided occlusive dressing over the injury and operative closure of an open chest wound. For tension pneumothorax, it may also include needle thoracentesis and insertion of a needle with catheter into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the injured side. A hemothorax is free blood in the pleural space . It results from bleeding from the lung parenchyma and injury to the heart and major vessel or internal mammary arteries. A common cause is intercostal artery injury that leads to bleeding into the pleural space. o Signs and symptoms include chest pain, sho rtness of breath, decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side, dullness on chest percussion, and signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock and respiratory distress. o Treatment includes chest tube insertion, administration of high -flow oxygen, intravenous fluid replacement, autotransfusion, and surgery. Pulmonary contusion is the most common, potentially lethal, chest injury. It occurs when the underlying lung parenchyma is damaged, causing edema and hemorrhage. o Signs and symptoms include dyspne a, hemoptysis, hypoxia, and possible chest wall abrasion or ecchymosis. o Treatment includes semi -Fowler's positioning, airway suctioning, chest physiotherapy, intubation and mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, and fluid restriction. Diaphragmatic injury may result from blunt or penetrating trauma. o It causes dyspnea, abdominal or epigastric pain that radiates to the left shoulder, bowel sounds in the chest, and decreased breath sounds on the affected side. o Early identification and pro mpt surg ical repair can avoid morbidity and mortality from visceral herniation or strangulation and cardiopulmonary compromise. Cardiac and Great Vessel Injuries Blunt cardiac injury includes heart injuries due to blunt trauma to the anterior chest. o Signs and symptoms usually are nonspecific, but may include chest pain that does not respond to vasodilators, abrasions or ecchymosis on the anterior chest, dysrhythmias, and 12-lead electrocardiogram changes. Most fatal dysrhythmias and cardiac failures occur within 24 to 48 hours of the injury. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o For a patient with an abnormal echocardiogram, provide symptomatic treatment. For a patient with normal serial electrocardiogram tracings or one who remains asymptomatic for 24 hours, no further treatment is required. Penetrating cardiac injury usually results from person -against -person violence or industrial incidents. o Most victims of penetrating cardiac injuries arrive in cardiac arrest or with significant hypotension caused by cardiac tamponade or hemorrhage. o Treatment may include thoracotomy. Cardiac tamponade occurs when rapid blood accumulation in the pericardial sac decreases ventricular filling. Gunshot and stab wounds in the chest are likely causes. o Signs include hypotension, muffled heart tones, jugular vein distention, air hunger, agitation, and decreased level of consciousness. o Treatment may include pericardiocentesis and surgery. Aortic disruption is associated with horizontal or vertical acceleration or deceleration injuries, such as in high -speed motor vehicle crashes and falls from a great height. o It may cause chest or interscapular pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, loud systolic murmur over the precordium, signs of hemorrhagic shock, blood pressure discrepancy in the right and left arms, an d elevated blood pressure and pulses in the arms and decreased or absent blood pressure and pulses in the legs. o Treatment may include intravenous catheters and surgical repair (traditionally the definitive treatment) or use of beta -blockers and antihyperte nsives. Esophageal Injuries Esophageal injury almost always results from penetrating trauma. Instrumentation during a procedure, such as endoscopy or intubation, is the most common cause. Caustic substance ingestion and crush and blast injuries also can ca use this injury. o Findings may include neck, upper back, chest, or abdominal pain; dysphagia; dyspnea; subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and chest; Hamman's crunch; shock out of proportion to the apparent chest injury; pneumothorax or hemothorax without ri b fracture; chest tube drainage with particulate matter. Treatment involves surgery. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved.

ENA: EMERGENCY NURSING ORIENTATION Lesson Notebook: Toxicologic Emergencies, Part 1 Lesson Outline Key Resources Preceptor Exercise Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Toxicology and Resources Toxins can affect the body through ingestion, inhalation, injection, ocular exposure, or dermal contact. The amount of a toxin needed to cause harmful effects varies greatly. Toxicologic resources for nurses include the Poi son Control Center ( 1-800-222-1222) and computer applications, such as Micromedex\u00ae . Patient Assessment Obtain history data to identify the substance, time and acuity of exposure, amount of toxin, signs and symptoms, prior treatment, and whether the poisoni ng was intentional or accidental. Perform a physical examination and review test results, particularly noting changes in blood pressure, temperature, eyes, bowel sounds, skin, gums, muscles, heart, nervous system, and kidney and liver function. Also check for pulmonary edema and acid -base disorders. On blood and urine toxicology screens, note any substances detected. Patient Management While ensuring the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation, identify the toxin involved. Throughout care, maintain pat ient safety, protect others, and support the patient. To limit toxin absorption, use decontamination, as appropriate. For gastrointestinal decontamination, perform gastric lavage, administer activated charcoal (in repeat doses, if needed), administer a binding agent, or perform whole bow el irrigation. For dermal decontamination, place the patient in a well-ventilated, isolated area; remove clothing; brush dry substances away; and rinse with copious amounts of water. For ocular decontamination, irrigate with copious amounts of water. To enhance elimination, administer a cathartic or prepare the patient for hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or hemofiltration, as ordered. To provide substance -specific interventions, administer an antidote (if available) and alkalini ze the urine. Specific Toxicologic Emergencies Toxic alcohols include ethanol as well as methanol, isopropanol, and ethylene glycol, which exist in household products. Exposure may cause central nervous system and respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting followed by findings that depend on the type of alcohol. For a methanol and ethylene glycol overdose, administer intravenous ethanol or fomepizole (Antizol) as the antidote. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Pesticides include organophosphates and carbamates, which are cholinesterase inhibitors. With toxic exposure, pesticides may cause muscarinic, nicotinic, and central nervous system effects; respiratory arrest; and chemical pneumonitis. Besides dermal decontamination, treatment may require ventilation or administration of atropine, pralidoxime (2-PAM) , or benzodia zepines. Heavy metals include lead, mercury, zinc, arsenic, and cadmium, which are by -products of industry. Ingestion can cause gastrointestinal, cardiac, respiratory, reproductive, and nervous system effects. Inhalation can result in asthma, chemical pneu monitis, pulmonary edema, and lung cancer. Perform decontamination, provide supportive care, and administer chelation therapy, as ordered. Iron overdose is a common, severe poisoning in pediatric patients under age 6. Mild toxicity may cause vomiting, abdo minal pain, and diarrhea. Severe toxicity may be fatal. Effects occur in four phases. Administer the antidote deferoxamine (Desferal) , as ordered, and provide supportive care. Hydrocarbons (petroleum distillates) exist in household and industrial products. Toxicity can result from pulmonary aspiration (emesis, coughing, wheezing, and life -threatening chemical pneumonitis), systemic absorption (central nervous system depression, dysrhythmias, hepatic or renal failure, and hemolysis), or dermal or ocular cont act (irritation and chemical burns). Treatment depends on the type of exposure. Caustics are acids (with a pH below 3) and alkalis (with a pH above 11). Contact can cause severe burns, and inhalation can cause respiratory distress. Other effects also occur . Treatment of caustic toxicity is supportive and includes irrigation with copious amount of soap and water. Food poisoning results from bacterial invasion or toxin formation after spore or bacteria ingestion. It is difficult to distinguish from viral gast roenteritis and is usually self -limiting. Treatment is supportive and includes antibiotics and, if indicated, antitoxin for Clostridium botulinum. Toxic plants may have hallucinogenic, anticholinergic, neurotoxic, cardiovascular, or other effects. Provide supportive care and consult the Poison Control Center for more interventions.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Specific Toxicologic Emergencies Acetaminophen appears in over -the-counter and prescription drugs. Although toxicity initially produces mild effects, it can cause life -threatening hepatotoxicity. Effects develop in four phases. N- acetylcysteine is the antidote. Salicylates, such as aspiri n (Bayer) , appear in prescription and nonprescription drugs. Severe toxicity can cause metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, renal failure, seizures, and coma. Treatment may include activated charcoal, hydration, urine alkalinization, mec hanical ventilation, and drugs, such as ibuprofen (Motrin) , usually have low toxicity. Typical effects include gastrointestinal manifestations, drowsiness, and acidosis. Other effects may include renal and hepat ic disorders and seizures. Treatment is based on signs and symptoms. Central nervous system stimulants include legal and illegal drugs, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and cocaine, which stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. In toxicity, their effect s range from mild (such as insomnia and hyperactivity) to severe (such as hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis). Treatment is supportive and based on signs and symptoms. Opiates include such drugs as morphine (MS Contin) and heroin. They act on the central nerv ous system, producing sedation, euphoria, analgesia, and amnesia. In addition, they can cause specific effects related to intoxication, a substance -abuse lifestyle, and withdrawal. Perform general and supportive interventions and administer the antidote na loxone (Narcan) , as ordered. Antidepressants include tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which produce fewer adverse effects and are relatively safe in overdoses. Tricyclic antidepressants cause neurologic, respiratory, a nd cardiac toxicity and anticholinergic effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may cause life -threatening serotonin syndrome. General and supportive interventions are needed. Patients and substance abusers use sedative -hypnotics . Overdose s accoun t . Their toxic effects vary, but common concerns include central nervous system and respiratory depression and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Treatment is largely supportive. Digitalis glycosides include digoxin (Lanoxin) , digitoxin (Crystodigin) , and certain plants. Toxic ity causes a decreased level of consciousness, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and visual changes. After activated charcoal administration, expect to give the antidote digoxin immune FAB (Digibind) . confusion, nausea, vomiting, and may call for calcium, glucagon (GlucaGen) , atro pine, a vasopressor, hypotension, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, dysrhythmias , seizures, and coma. Treatment may require atropine, glucagon, glucose, magnesium, and a vasopressor. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Triage Systems In traffic director triage, a nonclinical person greets each patient upon presentation in the emergency department and decides if the patient should go to the waiting room or to an open bed in the emergency department. In spot check triage, a staff member greets each patient upon presentation in the emergency department and notifies the registered nurse, who then does a brief assessment to assign triage acuity. In comprehensive triage, an emergency nurse assesses every patient who presents and determines the priority of care based on physical, developmental, and psychosocial needs as well as factors influencing flow through the emergency care system. Then the nurse assigns an acuity level. In two -tiered triage, a triage nurse identifies each patient's chief complaint, performs a rapid visual assessment, and sees that higher acuity patients are taken to the emergency department. For patients with no life -threatening condition, a second nurse does a comprehensive assessment in the triage area. In provider triage, a physician or midlevel provider works with the triage nurse to initiate laboratory, radiologic, and other appropriate diagnostic and medical interventions before the patient is moved into the treatment area. In rapid medical examination, a physician or midlevel prov ider works alongside the triage nurse in the triage area to provide a medical screening examination. Patients requiring a bed or admission are placed in a treatment room. The remaining patients have diagnostic tests performed at triage, wait in a waiting a rea for the results of the tests, and then are treated and discharged without placement in the treatment area. Triage Acuity Rating Systems The triage nurse assigns an acuity rating based on an across -the-room assessment, a brief interview, or a focused ex amination. Most emergency departments use a three -level acuity rating system: o Emergent, meaning the patient requires immediate care. The condition threatens life, limb, or vision and is severe. o Urgent, meaning the patient requires care as soon as possible. The condition presents a danger if not treated and it is acute but not severe. o Nonurgent, meaning the patient requires routine care. The condition is minor, and care can be delayed. Some hospitals add a fourth level of acuity to reduce the number of patie nts assigned to the urgent level. The American College of Emergency Physicians and the Emergency Nurses Association support the adoption of a reliable, valid five -level triage scale, such as the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) or the Emergency Seve rity Index. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE Triage Process Begin with an across -the-room assessment using your senses to gather vital information and form a general impression of the patient's health status. o Use sight to assess sick or not sick status, obvious deformities or amputations, method of arrival, body habitus, dress, chronic illness, activity level, blood on clothing or skin, breathing, skin color, and level of consciousness. o Use hearing to assess the patient's breathing and speech. o Use smell to determine the pres ence of stool, urine, vomit, ketones, alcohol, cigarettes, poor hygiene, pus, and chemicals. In the triage interview, confirm the patient's identity, introduce yourself, explain the purpose of the triage process, document the chi ef complaint and relevant s igns and symptoms, and gather information about medications, past medical history, allergies, last menstrual period, immunizations, weight, and height. Perform a focused assessment based on the injury or illness to gather additional information to support the decision that this patient is safe to wait for care. This assessment is brief and should not require the patient to undress. Take the patient's vital signs. Assign a triage acuity rating . Provide initial triage care, such as ice application, elevation, and immobilization of an injured extremity. As needed, initiate protocols, such as laboratory tests (including urinalysis and urine pregnancy testing), radiographic examinations, electrocardiograms, and medication administration for fever or pain. Triage Documentation Document general information to support the assigned triage acuity rating , including the time and date of the triage interview, two patient identifiers (name and date of birth), chief complaint, brief subjective and objective assessment, vita l signs for lower acuity patients, triage acuity rating, interventions initiated, and pain assessment . Include your signature. For stable patients who do not need to go directly to a treatment area, gather detailed information, including weight, last menst rual period, allergies, medications, past medical history, immunizations, medications administered at triage based on protocols, diagnostic tests initiated, mode of arrival, and bedside glucose level or results of other point -of-care testing. If you obtain ed the history from someone other than the patient, document who provided the information. If the patient is a non- English -speak er, record who served as the interpreter.

LESSON OUTLINE Infection Control Adhere to hand hygiene guidelines during triage. Be fore and after every patient contact, perform hygiene with soap and wate r or an alcohol -based hand rub. Give any patient who presents with a cough in the emergency department a surgical or procedure mask to prevent the spread of droplets to others. Emphasi ze respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Make sure that tissues and a place to dispose of them are available in the waiting room. If the waiting room has toys for children, ensure that the toy -cleaning system is followed to prevent the spread of infecti on. Perform infectious disease screening during the triage assessment, identify a patient with a potentially infectious disease, institute infection control measures, document the situation, and work with the charge nurse to get the patient to an appropria te treatment area. Legal Issues The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) ensures access to emergency care regardless of the patient's ability to pay. EMTALA requires hospitals that participate in Medicare and every hospital with an eme rgency department to: o Provide a medical screening examination to every patient who presents for care to determine if an emergency medical condition exists. o Stabilize the patient within the facility's capabilities before transfer, if an emergency condition exists. o Arrange for transfer if the patient cannot be stabilized and needs care beyond the hospital's capabilities or if the patient requests a transfer. When a patient reports that he or she is leaving the emergency department without being seen, talk with the patient and family to encourage them to stay and determine the reason. If the patient has a significant injury or illness, notify the charge nurse and physician. For patients who insist on leaving, ask them to sign a statement saying they are leaving before receiving a medical screening examination. If the patient will not sign the statement, have a second healthcare provider witness that care was offered. If a patient walk outs without notifying ED staff of the intent to leave, follow standard practi ce, such as classifying the patient as \"left without being seen\" if his or her name has been called in the waiting room three times about 15 minutes apart.

LESSON OUTLINE Triage Nurse Qualifications The triage nurse must possess expert assessment skills, demonstrate competent interview and organizational skills, maintain extensive knowledge of diseases and injuries, think critically , and use past experiences to identify subtle clues to patient acuity. Also t he triage nurse must be able to multitask: commu nicate regularly and effectively with patients, visitors, staff, and the charge nurse; provide r eassurance; begin to address the patient's and family's concerns; and set expectations about the time to treatment. A nurse should have at least 6 months of emergency nursing experience before being oriented to the triage role and should have successfully completed Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, the Trauma Nurse Core Course, and the Emergency Nursing Pediatric Cour se. Also , it is recommended that the triage nurse obtain the certified emergency nurse credential. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

What type of triage system does our facility use? 2. Does our facility use this system 24 hours a day, or does it use different systems at different times of the day? Assigning Triage Acuity Score 1. What triage acuity system is used in our facility? 2. For each patient below, assign a triage acuity level based on the tri age acuity system that your facility currently uses. Discuss the appropriateness of your acuity level assignments with your preceptor. Patient Triage Acuity Level A father brings his daughter, age 3, to triage and states that he was \"pulling her along by the hand when she started to cry.\" He thinks her elbow is dislocated. The child holds her arm to her side, slightly flexed, and refuses to use it. She cries when the triage nurse tries to examine the arm. Color and sensitivity are unaffected, and the radi al pulse distal to the elbow is easily palpated. The child's vital signs are within normal limits. A college student, age 18, presents to triage, complaining of a sore throat. He states that he has had the pain for 2 days. He also reports a dry cough, fa tigue, achiness, and other symptoms commonly associated with a cold. His skin is warm and dry, and he can speak in full sentences. His blood pressure is 112/74 mm Hg, pulse is 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37\u00b0C). A man, age 70, is brought to triage by his wife, who tearfully relates to the triage nurse that something is wrong with her husband. She states that they were eating dinner when he started to mumble and \"didn't make any sense.\" At triage, he has obvious facial drooping on the right side, and his left hand grip is significantly weaker than his right. His only response to questions is unintelligible mumbling. His blood pressure is 176/114 mm Hg, pulse is 92 beats per minute, respirato ry rate is 18 breaths per minute, and temperature is 95.9\u00b0F (35.5\u00b0C).

LESSON OUTLINE Anatomy and Physiology Review The skin is the largest organ and receives about one -third of circulatin g blood volume. It is a fast-growing tissue , regenerating about every 4 to 6 weeks. It protects against bact erial invasion, ensures thermoregulation, regulates fluids a nd electrolytes, and registers sensory stimuli. The skin and fascia vary from 1 to 4 mm in thickness . The skin has three major layers: o The epidermis , the outermost layer, is several cell layers th ick and avascular. Its outermost layer is the stratum corneum, which gives the skin its cosmetic appearance. Its basal layer is the stratum germinativum, where new cells originate. This layer protects against chemical s and microorganisms. o The dermis lies b eneath \u2014and is thicker than \u2014the epidermis. Composed of connective tissue, the dermis provides strength, elasticity, and protecti on against external forces. It is key for wound healing. Removal of debris and devitalized tissue from the dermis results in opti mal healing and minimal scar formation. o The subcutaneous layer is directly beneath the dermis. It includes the superficial fascia, which encloses subcutaneous fat and provides insulation, and the deep fascia, which is a strong sheath that covers and prote cts underlying muscles. Wound Healing Wound healing occurs in three sequential and overlapping phases: o The inflammatory phase begins with tissue injury and is a protective mechanism that lasts 3 to 5 days. After an injury, platelets initiate the coagulation cascade by adhering to the injured vessels to form a clot. Then macrophages move to the site and phag ocytize bacteria and debris. They also produce growth hormone and cytokines to aid reconstruction. Vasodilation causes increased capillary permeability. This allows plasma to leak, forming inflammatory exudates. Scab formation begins within 2 hours of inju ry. o The proliferative phase starts 12 to 72 hours after injury and ends about 3 weeks after it. In this phase, natural tissue granulation begins. Granulation is when fibroblast activity peaks. Granulation (scar) tissue is fragile in this period. The scar i s still moist and friable and may open again or bleed easily if damaged. o In the remodeling (maturation) phase, collagen density increases, tensile strength increases, and nerve regeneration occurs. This phase typically begins 2 to 3 weeks after the injury and can last up to 2 years. Internal factors and external factors may complicate wound healing. o Internal factors may include the patient's age, circulatory problems, morbid obesity, diabetes and neuropathy, malnutrition, preexisting infection, and immunosu ppression. The patient's living conditions may result in inadequate access to clean dressings, inability to perform wound care, noncompliance with discharge instructions, or inability to perform self -care. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o External factors may include inju ries more than 6 hours old or in certain locations, such as the mouth, perineum, web spaces of the feet or hands, lower extremities, hands, and scalp; contamination with devitalized tissue, foreign matter, or saliva; crush injuries; high -velocity missile i njuries; and wounds that require subcutaneous sutures . Wound Assessment After stabilizing the airway, breathing, and circulation , assess for related injuries , such as fractures, dislocations, or neurovascular compromise. Consider tendon or ligament injurie s, a foreign body, and peripheral nerve damage. Perform a neurovascular examination, testing sensation, strength , and flexor and extensor tendon function. Assess the mechanism of injury, details of the injury, and the pertinent medical history . Specific W ounds Abrasions occur when skin is rubbed or scraped against a hard surface, resulting in trauma to the epidermi s and dermis . They pose a high risk of infection. Expect to use a topical anesthetic or intravenous sedation for pain control, meticulously clea n the wound, and then apply an antibiotic ointment and nonadhesive dressing. Instruct the patient to change these dressings daily until eschar forms, and to use sunscreen or wear protective clothing for at least 6 months to prevent permanent tissue discolo ration. Avulsions are characterized by full -thickness tissue loss that prevents wound edge approximation and commonly affect the fingertips and the tip of the nose. A degloving injury is a severe avulsion in which the skin is peeled away from the hand, foo t, or a larger portion of an extremity. Degloving of the scalp (scalping) can occur if the patient's hair or jewelry becomes caught in a piece of machinery, resulting in devascularization of the skin and underlying tissue damage. Hemostasis is the immediat e concern. Small avulsions heal by secondary intention. Management requires local anesthesia, intravenous sedation, or general anesthesia. Aggressively irrigate the tissue, debride the devitalized tissue, and cover the wound with a bulky dressing. Arrange for consultation with a plastic surgeon, if requested. Human bites pose an increased risk of infection because multiple bacteria exist in the human mouth. They usually result from fights or sexual activity or can be self -inflicted. Perform a neurovascular assessment; explore, irrigate , and debride the wound; and give prophylactic antibiotics, as ordered. Expect wound closure by secondary intention. For a fight bite (from a closed fist coming in contact with a person's mouth), expect to admit the patient for antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement, and irrigation. Aggressively clean the wound and splint the hand. Animal bites carry risks of infection, tetanus, and rabies. Dog bites commonly are associated with crush injuries. Cat bites are more likely to cause deep puncture wounds. Perform copious irrigation, debridement, and expect wound closure for a small wound. Assess the patient's need for tetanus immunization.

LESSON OUTLINE Contusions (bruises ) result from b lunt trauma that causes blood accumulation under the skin, but no break in the skin. In a contusion, injury produces a flattened area of pain and discoloration. If it causes discoloration and visible elevation of the skin, it is a hem atoma. Blood accumulation under the skin results in swelling, pain, and discoloration. Apply a cold pack to the area. If a large contusion involves an extremity, splint it, if needed. If the patient has extensive contusions in an extremity, reassess regula rly for signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome. Lacerations are open wounds caused by shearing forces through skin layers. Control the bleeding, evaluate neurovascular function, and clean the wound meticulously. If ordered, arrange for radiographs to i dentify any underlying injury or foreign body. After assessing neurovascular status, expect the wound to be anesthetized, irrigated, and closed. Surgical glue, tape, staples, or sutures may be used to close the wound. Puncture wounds result from sharp or b lunt objects penetrating the tissue. Because they are self-sealing, puncture wounds cause minimal bleeding and have a high risk of infection. The risk of infection is highest in wounds that are more than 6 hours old, are large and deep, are contaminated, o ccurred outdoors, penetrated through footwear, or occurred in a poor host environment. o Wounds that pierce the sole of a shoe a re at high risk of transmitting Pseudomonas , resulting in infection and osteomyelitis. o Puncture wounds near a joint may inoculate the joint space with bacteria, leading to sepsis. o Do not soak a puncture wound caused by vegetative matter, such as wood, because the wood will absorb the liquid and disintegrate. Remove this type of foreign body before soaking. o A radiograph can detect radiopaque material. To find wood or other nonradiopaque material, computed tomography, ultrasonography, fluoroscopy, or local wound exploration is required. o A patient who has a puncture wound into the fascia is at increased risk of compartment syndrome. o High -pressure injuries are associated with paintball guns and nail guns, and may be misleading. High -pressure injuries may appear to be minor, but can cause extensive damage to underlying tissue. Affected patients require debridement and extensive irrigat ion under anesthesia because serious problems result if injected material spreads. Abscesses are localized collections of pus under the skin. A skin a bscess may occur anywhere . If abscesses are numerous or recurrent, assess for an altered immune response . Expect an abscess to be infiltrated with local anesthetic and then drained. If ordered, obtain a wound specimen for culture and sensitivity testing. Plan to pack an a bscess with iodoform gauze or similar material and co ver it with a loose dressing . Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association.

LESSON OUTLINE Pressure ulcers are lesions caused by factors, such as unrelieved pressure, friction, humidity, shearing force, and incontinence. They may occur on any body part, especially over bony or cartilaginous areas, such as the sa crum, elbows, knees , and ankles and over pressure points in immobile patients. Although easily prevented and completely treatable if found early, pressure ulcers commonly are fatal. They are categorized by severity, from stage I (earliest signs) to stage IV (latest or worst) . o In Stage I, a reddened, nonblanchable area is present on the skin . o In Stage II , the skin blisters or forms an open sore. The area around the sore may be red and irritated. o In Stage III , skin breakdown looks like a crater with damag e to the tissue below t he skin. o In Stage IV, the pressure ulcer is so deep that damage extends to the muscle, bone, and sometimes the tendons and joints. Wound Management Local anesthesia involves local infiltration of an anesthetic after a careful neurovascular assessment. Woun d anesthetization precedes wound preparation techniques. o Local anesthesia blocks nerve impulses that convey pain to a local or regional area without affecting consciousness. Depending on the anesthetic, it may be injected (for local infiltration) or appli ed topically. In the emergency department, commonly used agents include lidocaine, bupivacaine, and sodium bicarbonate. Epinephrine may be added to lidocaine to prolong local anesthesia, provide hemostasis, slow anesthetic absorption, and increase the leve l of anesthetic blockade. Use lidocaine with epinephrine only for lacerations in highly vascular areas. Do not use it in the ears, nose, fingers, toes, or penis. o Topical anesthetics include TAC (tetracaine, adrenaline [epinephrine] and cocaine) and LET (li docain e, adrenaline, and tetracaine). o A digital block is used when wound repair requires edge approximation without the distortion that local infiltration may cause. It may be used on any digit of the hands or feet, but a regional block may be needed for a n entire extremity. Wound preparation involves cleaning wounds by high -pressure irrigation or by direct -contact cleaning. o The preferred method of wound cleansing is high -pressure irrigation , which removes debris and decreases the risk of infection. Wound cleansing with a soft brush effectively debrides the wound, but may destroy tissue. Wound irrigation relies more on pressure than any other factor. o Many emergency departments use sterile water or normal saline solution almost exclusive ly for wound irrigation. A ntiseptic agents include povidone -iodine solution, povidone -iodine detergents, hydrogen peroxide, hexachlorophene, alcohols, and phenols. Elsevier items and derived items \u00a92012 Emergency Nurses Association. Published by MC Strategies, Inc., a subsidiary of Elsevi er Inc. All rights reserved. LESSON OUTLINE o Clip rather than shave hair around a lace ration before wound closure. Never shave eyebrows because they may not grow back o r may not grow back in a way that matches the unshaven brow. Also, the eyebrows serve as landmarks f or wound alignment and closure. o Before the wound is closed, debride all no nviable tissue and remove any foreign bodies. Wound closure may require sutures (for wounds that require approximation, attachment of a wound edge, and closure of the wound base), staples (for linear lacerations on the scalp, trunk, or extremities), tape ( for superficial linear wounds with minimal tension), or glue (for skin edges that are easily approximated). Then a dressing may be applied. o Wound healing occurs by primary, secondary, or tertiary intention, depending on the age of the wound, presence of in fection, and amount of contamination. Primary intention healing occurs when wound edges can be approximated and underlying structures are aligned, eliminating dead space. Secondary intention healing occurs when extensive tissue loss has happened and preven ts the wound edges from being approximated. The wound is left open to heal by granulation. This usually leaves an obvious scar. Tertiary intention healing (delayed closure) requires leaving the wound open initially and closing it 5 to 10 days later. Skin g rafting may be used. o Dressings are designed to keep the wound moist and clean and protect it from physical trauma or bacterial invasion . They include gauze dressings, nonadhesive hydrogel -related care may include tetanus or rabies prophylaxis and antibiotic administration. o Tetanus is a systemic infection caused by Clostridium tetani. Findings include joint stiffness, trismus, back pain, tachycardia, hypertension, dysrhythmias, and seizures. Patients at high risk for tetanus are those with tetanus -prone wounds and those who are over age 50, unimmunized, or underimmunized. o Rabies is a life -threatening central nervous system infec tion. If untreated, it is almost always fatal. Findings may include lucidity alternating with confusion, intense anxiety, and hydrophobia; high fever; spontaneous inspiratory spasms; and autonomic dysfunction . For a patient with an animal bite, assess for exposure to rabies and administer prophylaxis as needed. o Because thorough wound cleansing and irrigation minimize the risk of infection, prophylactic antibiotics are contraindicated for most skin injuries. However, they are recommended in patients who have an open joint, open fracture, extensive contamination or m ajor soft -tissue injury, or comorbidity, and in those who experienced a delay in care or are immunocompromised.
