There's [a long list of benefits](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth), and we're sure you've heard some of them before. Meditating regularly can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. It can help lower blood pressure. And it can increase your overall health, wellbeing, and brain function. There's a meditation routine for everyone. If you're a beginner, you might be a little overwhelmed with all the information out there. You might also feel a little intimidated in being present for the entire length of your meditation. (We'll let you in on a little secret: it's okay if your mind wanders. As soon as you notice it, guide yourself back to the present). But, we're here to tell you about an even easier way to get your meditation ritual started - meditating with healing crystals. What Are Healing Crystals? There are many different types of healing crystals, each containing their own unique properties for the mind, body, and soul. Some promote the flow of good energy, while others promote all forms of love and relationships. Some help attract abundance, luck, and wealth, and still others that relieve stress, dispel anger, and protect you from absorbing someone else's negative energy. Whatever you want to increase, get rid of, or connect with - there's a healing crystal for that! Crystals have been incorporated into various cultures and religions. The first record of using crystals was by the ancient Sumerians who used them in their formulas. The ancient Egyptians used them in their jewelry. In China, practitioners used them in their medicine and to make musical instruments. The ancient Greeks assigned several metaphysical properties to crystals, and we still use many of the same crystal names that the ancient Greeks used. Why Incorporate Healing Crystals Into Your Meditation? Adding the crystal's energy can enhance your meditation practice. Crystals can be used to achieve a specific outcome - such as receiving guidance, promoting your spiritual growth, or opening yourself to love. (We'll go into this in more detail later in this post.) They can deepen your connection with your inner knowledge to find purpose. And they can even connect you with your higher self. There are some healing crystals that clear your chakras to keep them in alignment to maintain balance, as well as some that cleanse and energize your aura. What Are the Best Healing Crystals to Use When You're Meditating? There aren't any crystals that are better to meditate with than others. Look inward to see what connects with you intuitively, your natural energy, or if there are benefits or outcomes you're looking for. Here are some ways you can find the best crystals for you.1. Specific benefits and outcomes Here you are some questions you can ask yourself when choosing what crystals to meditate with: Do you want to awaken your intuition? Do you want to create more abundance in your life or manifest your desires? Do you want to open a specific chakra point? Do you want a soft and nurturing meditation or a deep, explorative, and insightful one? Do you want to attract love? Do you want to remove and clear negative energy blocks?2. Matching natural energy Another way to choose which crystals you meditate with is to pick ones that match [your natural energy](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/how-do-crystals-help-meditation-heres-how-to-take-your-zen-to-the-next-level-7765971). Is your energy bright, enthusiastic, and spontaneous? Fluid, connected, and calm? Active, fiery, and determined? Insightful, still, reflective? Once you recognize your own natural energy, you'll be able to look for crystals that match.3. Intuition Another way to choose what crystals are best for you is to listen to what your gut is telling you to meditate with. What crystals are you drawn to? Listening to your intuition will give you what you need - instead of what you think you should need.4. The standards: clear quartz and selenite If, after reading this, you're still unsure about what crystals you should use, don't worry! Your meditation ritual will reveal itself to you in no time. Clear quartz and selenite are great crystals when you're first starting as they have powerful energetic qualities. Clear quartz is known as the master healer because it balances and revitalizes the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies. It also amplifies whatever energy or intent is programmed into it. When placed near other crystals, it also amplifies their energetic qualities. Selenite is thought to clear your mind and relax your body. It's thought to clear your aura, environment, and chakras by removing negative energy blocks and bringing in positive energy to raise your vibration, and it also cleanses and charges your nearby crystals.5. Palm stones Palm stones are wonderful crystals to use when you're first starting. They're larger than tumbled stones and designed to fit in the palm of your hand. While meditating, you can hold a palm stone in each hand to create balance. Holding palm stones allows you to have something physical to focus on so that you can travel deeper into your meditation and invite in positive, high vibrational energy. A Few Ways You Can Meditate With Your Healing Crystals Now that you've chosen one or even a few crystals to meditate with, let's go over how to include crystals [in your meditation practice](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-meditate-with-crystals-fully-manifest-what-you-want-18759547). Like palm stones, when you hold onto crystals, they allow you to have a tangible focal point so that you can dive deeper into your meditation. By holding them while you meditate, you'll start to develop a connection with them. You and your crystals will naturally exchange energies and vibrations. You'll also be able to feel the effects of your crystals' energetic qualities. For this type of meditation, get into a comfortable, seated position and place your crystals in each hand.2. Chakra points There are seven energetic points located on your body, called chakra points. Some crystals have energetic qualities to cleanse and align your chakras. This is important because when you're in alignment, life flows naturally, you feel happier, and you attract positive energy. When you're out of alignment, you can feel stuck, often feel tired, and even carry negative energy. Other crystals help with opening a specific chakra point. If you want to open a specific chakra, you can choose healing crystals specific to those chakra points.

Crystal grids are an excellent way to use crystals. By combining different crystals, this amplifies their energy and allows them to work together. Their energy is fused using the power of sacred geometry from the grid. To create a grid, think of what your intention is. Choose crystals that support the energy behind your intention. And place them evenly apart in a circular pattern onto a mandala or any base (you could even freestyle it!). Crystal grids are also an easy way to break up stagnant energy, and could be what your meditation space needs for a refresh. Introduction to crystal guided meditation Now that you have the basics of meditating with crystals, let's practice! We'd recommend starting with this [crystal guided meditation](https://chopra.com/articles/enhance-your-meditation-practice-with-crystals) from Deepak Chopra. This eases you into using your crystals so you can start building your relationship with them. Adding crystals to your meditation practice is a beautiful way to enhance and deepen your meditations. You can choose the right crystals for you by looking for specific benefits or a certain outcome, by being drawn to certain ones, or by what connects with your natural energy. Clear quartz, selenite, or palm stones are excellent choices to begin your meditation ritual with crystals if nothing resonates with you. There are many ways you can meditate with crystals. You can hold them in your hands, place them on your chakra points, or place them on a crystal grid. Have you meditated with crystals before? Do you have any other ways to meditate with crystals?
