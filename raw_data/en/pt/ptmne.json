At Adventist Health, we are dedicated to providing the support you and your loved ones need to find your emotional and spiritual center as you journey through the physical healing process. We are committed to caring for the whole person and emphasize care for the spiritual needs of patients and families, not just physical needs. Our goal is to create a healing environment and live God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hope. Chaplain services are available 24 hours a day, along with a team of trained multidenominational volunteers who provide pastoral care visitation. We are happy to contact your church or clergyperson or locate someone to speak with you regarding any concerns you may have during your stay in our hospital. "}
