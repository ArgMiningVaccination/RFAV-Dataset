Traditional Chinese medicine defines Blood Stagnation as a syndrome where blood circulation is impaired. This can occur with physical traumatic injuries and poor dietary or lifestyle choices which impair blood flow (like high cholesterol diets and smoking). Blood stagnation can also occur when the bodies Qi isn't flowing well because energy (Qi) assists in blood flow. Blood stagnation is commonly described as \"painful\" and can become \"sharp\" when Blood stagnation develops into Blood Stasis. Syndromes associated with Blood Stagnation or Blood Stasis include uterine fibroids, bruises, bone fractures, joint pain, cardiac disease and migraines. The following is a suggested guideline of foods to limit or avoid because they may reduce blood circulation: - Raw fruits, vegetables and salads - Dairy (these can be high in cholesterol and lead to build up in blood vessels) - Cold foods (ice-cream, smoothies, ice drinks, tofu) - Fried or fatty food (pizza, fast food, chips, red meat) - Refined sugar (desserts and pre-packaged foods, that easily convert to sugars) - Smoking Add the following foods to your diet for their blood moving or anti-inflammatory qualities: - Cooked or roasted veggies (mushrooms, eggplant, spinach - Herbs that move Qi & Blood (onions, garlic, horseradish, shallots, leeks, chives, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, oregano, basil, rosemary, turmeric, cinnamon) - Roots (taro) - Hawthorn berries (for tea) - Small quantities of rice vinegar and wine Build your plate using the \"Holy Trinity\" as a guide: - A healthy fat (olive oil, coconut oil, avocado, nuts) - A veggie and/or fruit - A healthy protein (lean meat, fish, legumes, almonds, walnuts, unsalted pumpkin or sunflower seeds). 3-4 servings per week is best. Try to eat meals at consistent times of the day. If you know your day will be filled with activities, pack your meals the night before in easy to travel containers. Healthy meals contain 40-60% cooked vegetables, 30% complex carbohydrates and only around 10% protein.
