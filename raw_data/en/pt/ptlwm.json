All too often it's the doctor who gets all the information about the patient, and the patient gets little information about the doctor and his practice. I would like to change that. My full name is Jason Cullen Tripp and I was born in Ironton, Ohio. I grew up right outside of Louisville, Kentucky until I was 8 or 9. Then we moved to Georgia where I lived for over twenty-one years. I decided to become a Chiropractor at age 5 In 1990 I had a chiropractic table built and I started working on everyone I could! I did my undergraduate work at Dekalb College in Atlanta. Then, I went to Chiropractic College at Life University located in Marietta Georgia. I graduated in March 1996. Next I earned a degree in Theology from Christian Life School of Theology. Later I graduated as a Doctor of Naturopathic from Trinity School of Natural Medicine. I earned my Master Herbalist from Trinity. I am married to my wife Robin. She is an ordained minister and worship leader at our church. Our baby, Madison was born February 22 she is now 15 years old. She has absolutely changed our lives. She's great! She loves to climb up on the table for her adjustments. For Hobbies I enjoy studying health and healing methods and working out (all varieties especially weight lifting, roller blading, running, mountain biking, hiking, indoor mountain climbing, martial arts etc). My entire life has been devoted to becoming a healer. At the age of 5, I was led by God to become a Chiropractor when I out that I could help people achieve health without harmful drugs or surgery. While in Chiropractic College I was inspired to become a Naturopathic Doctor. I was saved in 1994 and gave my heart to Jesus Christ. I have never been the same. God opened my mind to the fact that we have to take a holistic approach to health in order to be completely well and full of life. I was taking Chiropractic courses, Naturopathic courses and earning my degree in theology all at the same time. This allowed me to grow and develop a very balanced view of health. His Word teaches us to look at the Mental, emotional and spiritual as well as the physical. We must address all 3 areas if we want to truly be well.
