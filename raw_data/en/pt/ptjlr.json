Experiences in the WHO global polio laboratory network (GPLN) suggest that the following factors contribute to delays between paralysis onset in pat ients and laboratory confirmation of poliovirus infection: Three groups are involved in the investigation: su rveillance personnel who detect AFP cases, collect and refer samples to laboratorie s; laboratory personnel who carry out virus isolation and characterization proc edures; commercial shipping companies contracted for the transport of samples a nd virus isolates to laboratories. Only fifty percent of all countries have at least one laboratory that belongs to the GPLN. All of the network laboratories have capacity for virus isolation and determination of virus serotype. Some of them have additional capacity for intratypic differentiation (ITD) within the same fa cility. The location of technologies at different levels of the GPLN and in different countries results in a requirement for occasional intra- and inter-country shipping of faecal samples or virus isolates for testing and this can be time con suming and costly. Highly sensitive and specific procedures for direc t and rapid (within hours) detection of poliovirus in faecal samples are curre ntly unavailable. Lack of standardized, validated reagents, and quality assur ance protocols currently limit introduction of new technologies for poliovirus det ection into the GPLN. Analysis of test performance data of the GPLN has b een used to identify areas where greater efficiency is possible to improve reporting timeliness. The alternative test algorithm (i.e. step-wise stages of testing) for po liovirus isolation and characterization described in this supplement has been evaluated und er field conditions in 3 different locations and has been found to provide more rapid results with greater than 95% poliovirus detection sensitivity, specificity and c omparability with reference to the traditional algorithm described in Chapters 7 and 8 of the WHO polio Laboratory manual, 4th edition (WHO/IVB/04.10). When compared to the trad itional algorithm, the alternative test algorithm: Retains inoculation of each faecal sample in dupli cate in two continuous cell lines (L20B and RD). Has a shortened observation time for inoculated ce ll cultures. Has a different approach for passage of cell cultu res. Requires testing of virus isolates that show cytop athogenic effects (CPE) in L20B cells by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for simult aneous identification of virus serotype and poliovirus intratypic differentiation (ITD), followed by immediate reporting of any poliovirus with non-Sabin-like (NS L) results. Uses RD cell culture passages of L20B positive cul tures for ITD tests. Restricts use of the micro neutralization test (NT ) for serotype identification to only cell cultures containing mixtures of viruses ( identified by PCR) in order to separate individual poliovirus strains for ELISA te sting. Tests monotypic polioviruses (those with monotypic Sabin-like (SL) viruses identified by PCR or isolates separated from mixtur es by NT) by ELISA to screen for potential vaccine derived polioviruses (VDPV) b ased on antigenic characteristics. S1.2 Isolation of viruses in continuous cell lines Have available the following items: tube cultures of L20B and RD cells; maintenance medium; 1 ml and 5 ml plastic disposable pipettes; Specimen extract/s (see Chapter 6, section 6.2 of WHO Polio laboratory Manual for protocol for specimen preparation) Do the following: Microscopically examine recently prepared monolaye r cultures to be sure that the cells are healthy and at least 75% confluent. A sui table monolayer would be one formed within 2-3 days of seeding. Remove the growth medium and replace with 1 ml mai ntenance medium. Label two tubes of RD and two of L20B for each spe cimen to be inoculated (specimen number, date, passage number). Label one tube of each cell type as a negative con trol. Note: Both cell lines must be inoculated at the sam e time. Inoculate each tube with 0.2 ml of specimen extrac t and incubate in the stationary sloped (5\u00b0) position at 36\u00b0C. L20B cells will not survive being rotated and it is unnecessary for either L20B or RD cell li nes for poliovirus isolation. Examine cultures daily, using a standard or invert ed microscope, for the appearance of CPE. Record all observations of inoculated and control cultures, recording CPE as 1+ to 4+ to indicate the percentage of cells affected (1+ represents up to 25% of cells; 2+ represent 25 to 50%; 3+ represents 50 to 75%; 4+ represents from 75 to 100%), toxicity 1, degeneration or contamination 2. If no CPE appears after at least 5 days of observa tion, perform a blind passage 3 in the same cell line and continue examination for a further 5 days. (NB. Contents of duplicate negative cell cultures from an individ ual case should not be pooled for passage, i.e. individual negative cell culture tubes should be passaged 1 Toxicity: If cell cultures show rapid degeneration within twe nty-four hours of inoculation this may be due to non-specific toxicity of the specimen . These tubes should be frozen at -20\u00b0C, thawed, and 0.2 ml volumes transferred (i.e. this i s procedurally similar to a passage but should not be counted as a passage) into cultures of the s ame cell type. If toxic appearances recur, return to the original specimen extract and dilute the extract in PBS at 1/10 and re-inoculate cultures as described above (this should be conside red as inoculation of the specimen and day 0 for observation). 2 Microbial contamination : Contamination of the medium and cell death resulting from bacteri al or fungal contamination makes detection of viral CP E uncertain or impossible. Return to the original specimen extract, re-treat with chloroform (see Chapter 6 section 6.2 of WHO Polio Laboratory Manual) and inoculate fresh cell culture s as described above. 3 Blind Passage: Freeze the tubes at -20\u00b0C, thaw, and passage 0.2 m l of culture fluid to tubes containing fresh monolayers of the same cell type and examine daily for at least 5 days. If cultures show no CPE by this stage, the result is r egarded as negative. separately). Cultures should be examined for a tota l of at least 10 days (i.e. minimum of 5 days post-inoculation and minimum of 5 days post-passage) before being judged as negative and discarded. If characteristic enterovirus CPE appears at any s tage after inoculation, i.e. rounded, refractile cells detaching from the surfac e of the tube, record observations and allow CPE to develop until at leas t 75% of the cells are affected (> 3+ CPE). At this stage, perform a second passage 4 in the opposite cell line (see Figure S1.1). Duplicate cultures of the same s ample in the same cell line that both show > 3+ CPE can be pooled 5 for passage into a single tube containing a monolayer of cells from the other cell line in 1 ml of maintenance medium: o CPE positive L20B cultures are passaged into RD cell cultures and incubated at 36 0C and observed. /square4 Characteristic enterovirus CPE will appear in the majority of RD cultures and should be allowed to develop until > 3+ CPE is observed. Tubes are then frozen at -20 0C until referred to an ITD laboratory for typing and ITD. /square4 A small number of samples contain viruses that sho w CPE in L20B cells that is not reproducible when the viruse s are passaged into RD cells 6. RD cultures should be examined for at least 5 day s before being reported as negative. o CPE positive RD cultures are passaged into L20B cells and incubated at 36\u00b0C and observed daily. This passage is aimed a t separating polioviruses that may be present in mixtures with o ther enteroviruses and amplifying the titre of any polioviruses that may b e present. /square4 If no CPE is obtained when L20B cultures are exami ned for at least 5 days, the culture is considered negative fo r polioviruses and is reported as NPEV (see Figure S1.1) /square4 Characteristic enterovirus CPE, however, will appe ar in some L20B cultures and should be allowed to develop unti l > 3+ CPE is observed. Another passage of the virus is performed , back into RD cells 4, with subsequent observation for CPE. This passage is aimed at amplifying virus titre. Any > 3+ CPE positive RD cultures are stored at -20\u00b0C until referred to an ITD labora tory. A small number of RD cultures may remain negative when exam ined for at least 5 more days 6 and should be reported as negative. 4 Passage of CPE+ cultures: Freeze the tubes at -20\u00b0C, thaw, and passage 0.2 ml of culture fluid to tubes containing fresh monolayers of a dif ferent cell type and examine daily for at least 5 days. 5 Pooling of CPE positive cell cultures: Pooling should only be done if > 3+ CPE is observed in duplicate cultures of the same cell line on the sam e day. In any other situation, each cell culture is passaged separately into a single new cell culture. 6 Non-reproducible CPE. Such viruses may be reoviruses, adenoviruses or ot her non- enteroviruses that can grow in mouse L-cells. Some of these viruses may cause CPE clearly distinctive from enterovirus-characteristic CPE a Record RD Negative c Inoculate in RD aPass into RD Record L20B Negative c Report Specimen Negative CPE +ve b,d Pass into RD Report Negative Report and refer for ITD CPE -ve a Report negative a Observed for a minimum of 5 days b Observe until > 3+ CPE obtained (usually 1-2 days, 5 days maximum; re-inoculate when toxicity or contamination observe d) c Total minimum observation time of 10 days (2 x 5 d ays) d Pool positive tubes (if both tubes show > 3+ CPE o n the same day) before final RD passage e Isolates can be serotyped by laboratories with an interest in NPEV diagnosis or to confirm proficienc y S1.3 Reporting of virus isolation results and follo w-up Laboratories without on-site ITD capacity must rep ort preliminary virus isolation results to national authorities and to WHO at this stage. The result for an individual specimen is obtained by combining results for duplicate cultures in both L20B and RD cell lines. The result for an individual case is obtained by c ombining the results for all specimens from that case. The possible outcomes of virus isolation procedure s and suggested wording of reports are provided in Table S1.1. Untyped isolates should be sent as soon as possible to an appropriate ITD laboratory (and ideally within 7 days of detection) where virus serotype and intratype will be determined. Accompanying document ation must include patient and isolate identification information (e.g. EPID a nd laboratory number) and isolates must be labeled with laboratory number and passage information (e.g. expressed as L+R+ or R+L+R+). Laboratories wishing to do so may continue to perf orm virus serotyping by microneutralization assay on an aliquot of the isol ate in their own location. It is emphasized, however, that laboratories should not a wait serotyping results or separate viruses before shipping isolates to ITD la boratories. Table S1.1: Possible outcomes and reporting of viru s isolation results for an individual specimen Outcome of virus isolation tests Comment Action required Negative No viral CPE was observed post-inoculation or post passage of L20B and RD cell cultures for any of the inoculated cultures or specimens of the case. Report \"Negative\" or \"No virus isolated\". No further action required. L20B positive Viral CPE was obtained in L20B cells either post- inoculation or post-passage for at least one of the cultures or specimens of the case. CPE was reproducible when the L20B isolate was passaged into RD cells. Report \"L20B positive isolate obtained. Likely to be poliovirus. Isolate will be characterized by ITD tests\". Refer the RD passage of the L20B isolate to an ITD laboratory within 7 days of detection. Non-polio Enterovirus detected. Viral CPE was obtained in RD cells either post-inoculation or post passage and no CPE was obtained when the RD isolate was passaged into L20B cells. Report \"NPEV positive\". No further action required. Both L20B positive and Non-polio Enterovirus detected. One or more cultures of the specimen was identified as having an \"L20B positive isolate\" and one or more other cultures of the same specimen was also identified as being \"NPEV positive\" Report \"L20B and NPEV positive and poliovirus intratype Within the GPLN, polioviruses have traditionally be en isolated using L20B and RD cells, identified and serotyped in NT using polyclonal ant isera, and monotypic viruses have been subsequently subjected to ITD using 2 methods, one based on antigenic and the other on a molecular principle. All isolates giving concordant SL results in 2 ITD tests have been reported. Polioviruses with any result di fferent from SL in either ITD test have been reported but also forwarded to a Global Specia lized Laboratory for genomic sequencing. This strategy has been effective in det ecting wild polioviruses and VDPVs with high sensitivity and specificity. Experience g ained over several years in the GPLN, however, shows that: There is close to 100% agreement in the determinat ion of serotype of isolates by NT and PCR. Serotype results are available within 3 to 5 days by NT and within hours by PCR. When PCR procedures are used as outlined in Chapte r 8 of the WHO Polio Laboratory Manual 4 th Edition, virus serotype and poliovirus intratype c an simultaneously be determined. There is close to 100% agreement in the designatio n of non-Sabin-like viruses PCR results and VP1 nucleotide sequences. Polioviruses present in isolates as monotypes, or, in mixtures with other enteroviruses can be accurately serotyped and intra -typed by PCR. RD-cultured isolates give better PCR results than L20B-cultured isolates. Poliovirus intratype can be accurately determined within twenty-four hours using ELISA tests, but the test requires use of monotypic polioviruses. Polioviruses present in mixtures must therefore be separated pri or to performance of the ELISA test. An alternative approach for determining virus serot ype and intratype was developed to improve efficiency and shorten reporting timelines, taking into consideration all of the above experiences (see Figure S1.2). In the alterna tive approach, the highest priority is given to rapid reporting of non-Sabin-like poliovir uses. Do the following: ITD laboratories will receive 2 categories of isol ates for testing, as follows: those that showed CPE in L20B cells at some stage of test ing and CPE was reproducible when isolates were passed in RD cells (categories are L20B+RD+ and RD+L20B+RD+ isolates). o ITD tests are performed on all L20B+RD+ isolates u sing the PCR method described in Chapter 8 (section 8.3 on pages 112 to 118) of the WHO Polio Laboratory Manual 4 th Edition. NB. Isolates are not passaged or serotyped prior to testing by PCR, and all primer s ets listed in Table 8.2 (page 118) must be used. o RD+L20B+RD+ isolates are tested using the PCR meth od in only limited situations: if this is the only category of isolate obtained from an individual specimen or if the PCR result obtained for the corresponding L 20B+RD+ isolate from the same specimen was interpreted as n egative or NPEV. Interpret PCR results, as described in Table 8.1 ( page 117) of the Polio Laboratory Manual. Based on the interpretation: o Report to national authorities and WHO the result o f any poliovirus isolate identified as \"wild poliovirus of indicated serotyp e(s)\". The report should specify the poliovirus serotype obtained and indica te the intratype as \"non-Sabin-like\". Reports should be provided within 24 hours of completion of the PCR, and the isolate should be re ferred to a specialized laboratory for sequencing within 7 days of detectio n. Non-Sabin-like (preliminary) results from any isolate should be re ported and isolates referred for sequencing as they become available. F inal results can be issued at a later time when all virus isolation and ITD results are available for all cultures and specimens of the case. o Perform the ELISA test on all monotypic Sabin-like polioviruses (see Section 8.1 of the WHO Polio Laboratory Manual). NB . The ELISA test is not performed on \"non-Sabin-like\" viruses. There is no need to perform serotyping by NT before performing ELISA on monotyp ic polioviruses identified through prior PCR testing. ELISA results are interpreted and ITD results are reported according to the protocols in Chapter 8, sections 8.1.4 and Table 8.3 of the WHO Polio Laboratory Man ual. o Perform NT (see Section 7.3 of WHO Polio Laborator y Manual) to separate viruses present in any isolate with a PCR result interpreted as having a mixture of polioviruses of different serot ypes. Perform ELISA test on separated monotypic viruses (see Section 8. 1 of the WHO Polio Laboratory Manual). o Provide final results to national authorities when virus isolation and ITD results are available for all specimens and isolate s of the case. Table S1.2 provides examples of results and their interpr etation.
