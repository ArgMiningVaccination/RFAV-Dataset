As tye began conducting interviews on the subject with friends of trans experience, they responded to questions including: What did your safe space look like during adolescence? Was the church advertised as a safe house during that time? What does \"realness\" mean to you? How do you respond to the national genocide of TGNC folks? As 2021 saw 57 reported violent deaths of trans/gender-non-conforming people, the highest reported number of TGNC folks killed in years, The Available Bodies provides opportunities for fellowship in shared experiences through movement, spoken word, and sound making. Throughout the performance, the artists use red tape to create a landscape of safe space for trans ancestors to enter the ritual. During this manifestation, z tye works through a sequence of practices learned in the Pentecostal denomination and attempts to use them to conjure ancestors taken from this community too soon. Audience members are invited to hold solidarity as the performers create an immersive congregation during the initiation of their salvation.

BLP emphasizes working with all aspects of the arts and giving Deaf people opportunities to own the stage. Her goal and passion is to spread awareness within the hearing community of ASL and Deaf culture. Director of Programming, Events Coordinator, Administrator, and ASL Performance Interpreter Jamie Rose Hays started her journey with the Deaf and hard of hearing community over a decade ago through her volunteer work with New York Deaf Theatre (NYDT). She later became a pro-bono staff member with NYDT and worked alongside Shelly Guy and Seth Gore developing work with Playwrights Horizons, Broken Box Mime, and The Public. In 2018 she led a collaboration with The Public Theater's Public Works production of Twelfth Night directed by Oskar Eustis. Hays met Brandon Kazen-Maddox at a wedding of a Deaf couple in NYC, and insisted they become a lead interpreter for Twelfth Night. Hays has been working as an ASL/English interpreter for eight years in the medical, business, education, and arts field. She joined the Body Language Production team at Little Island NYC in 2021 and appreciates the ongoing opportunity to create accessible moments for the Deaf and hard of hearing community. She is grateful to continue these close knit relationships with Kazen-Maddox, Guy, and Gore, and this common drive to showcase more Deaf artists. Technical Director and Director of Artistic Sign Language Seth Gore is a Deaf bilingual creative house. Specializing in interplay between English and ASL languages, arts, teaching, and technology, Gore allows his deafness to permeate and influence his work. His work is centered around signed language and effective and authentic human communications. As director of ASL and ASL coach for several Hollywood and Broadway productions, including Paramount's A Quiet Place 2, Freestyle Love Supreme, and To Kill a Mockingbird in MSG, Gore ensures the signed message gets through to the audience. He lives in New York City and currently is developing signed script collaboration solutions (Visual Script) and English grammar learning (Grammar Shapes) and teaching workshops (Unlearning Words) that aim to unlock people's signed thought and make their communications more whole. Gore has worked with Body Language Productions as the technical director since 2022 and provides his expertise in website design, social media, and coding knowledge to the infrastructure of Body Language Productions.
