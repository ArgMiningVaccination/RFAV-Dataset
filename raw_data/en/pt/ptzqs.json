As a Cancer Research UK Clinical Research Fellow he completed his Ph.D. work at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford. In 2007, he moved to Nottingham as a Clinical Associate Professor in Medical Oncology. In 2011, he was awarded the prestigious 'Goulstonian Lectureship' by the Royal College of Physicians, London, an award made to the most academically outstanding Young Fellow of the College. In 2016, he was promoted to Professor of Medical Oncology. He served as the Head of Oncology at Nottingham University Hospitals from 2017-2020. As an academic oncologist, he is very active in cancer clinical trials. He has lead the Cancer Clinical Trials Unit at Nottingham University Hospitals and was previously the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Divisional Lead for Cancer (East Midlands). Prof Madhusudan's Clinical Research expertise is in breast, upper GI and ovarian cancers. His pre-clinical laboratory research is focused on the evaluation of DNA damage signaling and repair in cancer. He is the Director of the Nottingham Ovarian Cancer Research Centre (NOVARC) based at the Biodiscovery Institute. He is an active member of the Nottingham Breast Cancer Research Centre (NBCRC). Research in his laboratory has received funding from the Medical Research Council, Breast Cancer Now, Target Ovarian Cancer and Naaz-Coker Ovarian Cancer Research Fellowship. Graduate Research students in his group are funded through various international scholarships. Prof Madhusudan's group has identified novel biomarkers, potential drug targets and newer approaches for personalized treatment strategies targeting DNA repair in cancer. Prof Madhusudan has published over 150 research articles, edited two books and contributed to several book chapters. In recognition of his outstanding translational cancer research, he was recently awarded the prestigious 'Lady Estelle Wolfson lectureship in Translational Medicine for 2019' by the Royal College of Physicians of London. Expertise Summary Clinical trials; DNA repair; translational oncology; biomarkers; drug discovery; breast cancers; upper GI cancers; ovarian cancers.
