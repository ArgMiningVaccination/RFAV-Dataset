COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death but are underused. Interventions to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are paramount to reducing the burden of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, usability, and acceptability of a chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination and examine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In November 2021, we conducted a pre-post pilot study to evaluate \"Vac Chat, Fact Check,\" a web-based chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination. We conducted a web-based survey (N=290) on COVID-19 vaccination at a university in Hong Kong. A subset of 46 participants who were either unvaccinated (n=22) or were vaccinated but hesitant to receive boosters (n=24) were selected and given access to the chatbot for a 7-day trial period. The chatbot provided information about COVID-19 vaccination (eg, efficacy and common side effects), debunked common myths about the vaccine, and included a decision aid for selecting vaccine platforms (inactivated and mRNA vaccines). The main efficacy outcome was changes in the COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) score (range 9-45) from preintervention (web-based survey) to postintervention (immediately posttrial). Other efficacy outcomes included changes in intention to vaccinate or receive boosters and willingness to encourage others to vaccinate on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). Usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale (range 0-100). Linear regression was used to examine the factors associated with COVID-19 VHS scores in all survey respondents. The mean (SD) age of all survey respondents was 21.4 (6.3) years, and 61% (177/290) of respondents were female. Higher eHealth literacy (B=-0.26; This pilot study provided initial evidence to support the efficacy, usability, and acceptability of a chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination in young adults who were unvaccinated or booster-hesitant. COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death but are underused. By mid-2022, the full vaccination rate has remained suboptimal in many places where COVID-19 vaccines are readily available (eg, 67% in the United States and 75% in the United Kingdom) [ Vaccine hesitancy is considered 1 of the 10 major threats of global health according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [ Chatbots or conversational agents are increasingly developed as a scalable and accessible platform for supporting health care delivery. The interface of a chatbot that is familiar to most people with experiences in mobile messaging could promote the usability and user engagement of the chatbot compared to other platforms. Several chatbots have been developed amid the COVID-19 pandemic [ Mass COVID-19 immunization has begun in February 2021 in Hong Kong. Despite ample supply of both an inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac; Sinovac) and mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty; Fosun-BioNTech), the uptake had been slowed, with only 62% of the population being fully vaccinated by the beginning of 2022 [ We conducted a pilot study using a pretest-posttest design to evaluate \"Vac Chat, Fact Check,\" a chatbot designed to provide updated information and debunk misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. The study was conducted in November 2021, between the end of the fourth wave (June 2021) and the start of the fifth wave (January 2022) of the outbreak in Hong Kong, which had about 12,000 cumulative cases and 200 deaths. The study targeted adults aged 18 years who can read and communicate in Chinese. A mass email with a link to a web-based survey of COVID-19 vaccination was sent to all students at a public university in Hong Kong on November 8, 2021. The survey link was open for 7 days and received 290 valid responses. Of these, 273 (94.1%) respondents indicated their interest in participating in the pre-post evaluation of the chatbot by leaving their contact information at the end of the survey. We identified and invited all 46 respondents who were either unvaccinated (n=22) or fully vaccinated but hesitant to receive boosters if eligible (n=24; response rate: 46/46, 100%). The planned sample size (20-25 each for unvaccinated or booster-hesitant participants) was based on a previous formative study of a chatbot for promoting human papillomavirus vaccination [ Study flow diagram. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 21-449). Participants who were invited to participate in the pre-post study received a WhatsApp message describing the study purpose and provided informed consent. The participants then received a URL link to access the web-based chatbot and start a 7-day trial period. The chatbot could be accessed repeatedly. WhatsApp reminders to use the chatbot were sent on day 3, day 5, and day 7. On day 8, we sent a URL link to the postintervention questionnaire. Participants who completed the pre-post study were given HK $300 (US $38.5) for their time and effort. On March 30, 2022, about 4 months after the completion of the pre-post study, we conducted a post hoc follow-up with a single question about COVID-19 vaccination or booster status via WhatsApp. Participation was voluntary, and consent was obtained from those who responded to the question. The additional follow-up served to examine the feasibility of measuring the long-term effect of the chatbot. The \"Vac Chat, Fact Check\" chatbot was developed by our team. To promote dissemination, the chatbot could be accessed by any internet browser on smartphones, tablets, and personal computers (ie, web-based). The chatbot was available in Chinese only since most Hong Kong residents (>90%) spoke Chinese. Upon entering the chatbot, the user received a message about how to use the chatbot and a menu of options showing the core functionality of the chatbot. The users could navigate the chatbot by typing the corresponding number of the options in the menus or keywords (eg, allergy) to obtain information directly ( The chatbot conversation generally unfolded by following predefined rules or decision trees. To better simulate human interactions, the chatbot also used natural language processing (NLP) powered by Google Dialogflow for handling small talk (eg, greetings and thank-yous). The chatbot provided responses mainly using texts with emojis, but some messages also included infographics ( The intervention content followed the Confidence, Complacency and Convenience (\"3C's\") model of vaccine hesitancy [ Screenshot of \"Vac Chat, Fact Check\" showing chatbot navigation by menu options.

COVID-19 vaccination status was assessed by asking \"have you been vaccinated against COVID-19?\" with responses options of \"yes, 2 doses,\" \"yes, 1 dose,\" and \"no.\" Intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (for those responded \"no\") or COVID-19 boosters (for those responded \"yes, 2 doses\") were assessed on a scale from 1 (not likely at all) to 5 (very likely) [ The main efficacy outcome was changes in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy from preintervention to postintervention. We adapted the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) developed by the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization for assessing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [ In our sample, the COVID-19 VHS had high internal consistency preintervention (Cronbach In the 4-month follow-up, we assessed the COVID-19 vaccination status in initially unvaccinated participants by their responses of \"no\" and \"yes, [number] dose(s).\" For booster-hesitant participants, we asked whether they had received a booster shot (\"yes\" or \"no\"). The postintervention questionnaire included the System Usability Scale (SUS), a widely used instrument in software engineering, to measure the participants' perceived usability of the chatbot. The 10-item SUS gives a composite score ranging from 0 to 100, with 68 or above indicating above-average usability [ The baseline questionnaire included the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) [ To evaluate the chatbot efficacy, we used 1-sample, 2-tailed All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata/MP software (version 15.1; StataCorp). We used complete case analyses because there were no missing data in the web-based survey and postintervention assessment except eHealth literacy (n=2) and the perceived susceptibility (n=4) and severity (n=4) of COVID-19.

On average, the participants used the chatbot for a total of 64 (SD 47) minutes during the 1-week trial period. Longer time spent on the chatbot was correlated with a larger reduction in vaccine hesitancy with marginal significance (Spearman Overall, 18 (82%) of the 22 initially unvaccinated participants and 19 (79%) of the 24 booster-hesitant participants responded to the post hoc 4-month follow-up. All 18 unvaccinated participants reported having received COVID-19 vaccination (2 doses: n=16, 89%; and 1 dose: n=2, 11%), whereas 7 (37%) of the 19 booster-hesitant participants reported having received boosters. This pilot study showed a significant decrease in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy after using the \"Vac Chat, Fact Check\" chatbot in young adults who were hesitant to vaccinate or receive boosters. According to the rule of thumb of Cohen [ Our PubMed search using the keywords of vaccine and chatbot and their synonyms only identified 1 peer-reviewed study that provided empirical evidence on the efficacy of a chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination. The study was a web-based experiment on a French sample population, which found that interacting with a chatbot could promote more positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and intention to vaccinate [ To our knowledge, our study was the first to include actual receipt of COVID-19 vaccines or boosters as outcome measures in chatbot evaluation. Assuming (conservatively) that all participants lost to follow-up did not receive any vaccine or booster, 82% (18/22) of the initially unvaccinated participants received at least 1 dose of vaccine, whereas 29% (7/24) of booster-hesitant participants received a booster. As a reference, the corresponding rates were 92% and 28% in Hong Kong residents aged 20 to 29 years on March 30, 2022 (same date as the follow-up) [ Corroborating our previous findings in the general population [ Similar to most chatbots built to support health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic [ The main limitation of the pre-post study is the lack of a control or comparison group, which limited the causal inference of any changes observed after using the chatbot. The possibility that the observed changes were attributable to contextual changes along the course of the outbreak could not be excluded. However, the study was conducted at a time when Hong Kong had been maintaining a low level of local transmission with nearly 0 daily local case (from June to December 2021). This setting, coupled with the short interval between preintervention and postintervention assessments, was unlikely to have had a substantial effect on the vaccination outcomes. Nevertheless, the findings must be considered preliminary and hypothesis-generating. Another limitation is the small sample size, which precludes the examination of the chatbot's efficacy in sociodemographic subgroups (eg, sex). Third, since all measures were self-reported, social desirability bias could not be excluded. Finally, our study targeted young adults given their greater vaccine hesitancy than older populations and their frequent use of social networking sites\u2014a major source of misinformation. The generalizability of the findings to other populations is unclear. Due to the convenience sampling method, our participants may not be representative of all young adults who are unvaccinated or booster-hesitant. Promoting the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial to mitigating the impact of COVID-19. This pilot study provided initial evidence to support the efficacy, usability, and acceptability of a chatbot for promoting COVID-19 vaccination in young adults who were unvaccinated or booster-hesitant. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to test the effectiveness of the chatbot in increasing COVID-19 vaccination. Although our study indicated the benefits of the chatbot in both unvaccinated and booster-hesitant young adults, the drivers for vaccine hesitancy between the 2 groups likely differ. Further research is also needed to understand their differences to provide more tailored information and optimize the chatbot's efficacy.
