Despite having the one name, the word 'autism' actually covers a range of learning difficulties that fit within a spectrum. Typically, the developmental disability becomes clear within the first three years of life and it's explained as a neurological disorder. With normal brain functioning impaired in some way, development is often much slower with problems communicating and interacting on a social level. For children and adults with the disorder, both non-verbal and verbal communication is a problem and this impacts social interactions directly. Since the spectrum has numerous points, everybody is affected in different ways and on different levels. For this reason, early diagnosis is critical so the right intervention program can be selected and started. Development of Autism - Unfortunately, there is still no known cause of autism but those who have researched extensively say the most likely cause is a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Despite the years of research, we still can't provide a definitive list of causes which is still an issue with this corner of the medical world. In recent years, many have drawn a link between vaccines and autism and believe this to be key. Firstly, the mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) is blamed for intestinal issues which, in turn, leads to autism. Secondly, others believe that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in some vaccines, could be the real problem. At this point, we should also explain the connection with the immune system because there is now some evidence. For those with autism, they commonly also have physical issues that come with it including some linked with immune deficiency. While some researchers believe they have effective sessions with the main aim of improving the health of the immune system, the NIH hasn't yet backed this research since the evidence isn't strong enough. Connection with Food Allergies - Finally, there is an important link between autism and food allergies. Often, people will say that casein and gluten allergies can contribute to autistic symptoms and this is essential for what we're going to be discussing today. Types of Autism As mentioned previously, autism is a spectrum disorder which means cases are rarely identical. However, there are five main types of autism of which we should all be aware. Asperger's Syndrome - If you've ever seen the film Rain Man, Dustin Hoffman actually won an Oscar for his portrayal of somebody suffering with Asperger's Syndrome. With an excellent memory and some communication skills, the character would always be thinking literally while also displaying some signs of obsessive behavior. Rhett Syndrome - As a degenerative disorder, Rhett Syndrome is actually far more common with girls. In addition to a loss of speech, people with the condition may rock slightly, wring their hands, and become socially reclusive; often, they'll struggle to go through life without help. Williams Syndrome - With Williams Syndrome, it offers a blend of autistic symptoms including the slower development in speech and social skills; attention span can also be an issue as can a sensitivity to sound. On the flip side, people with Williams Syndrome are more sociable than most at an older age. Unfortunately, heart problems are common with the condition. Fragile X Syndrome - Genetically speaking, Fragile X Syndrome is caused by a problem with the X chromosome; a constriction of the long arm. Although not everybody with the disorder will display autistic tendencies, the rate is thought to be at around 15%. Once again, heart difficulties can occur and people with this syndrome are often characterized as having elongated ears and faces. Landau-Kleffner Syndrome - Of the five, this is the one misdiagnosed the most because it gets dismissed early as regressive autism. After appearing perfectly fine up until around seven years, the child may regress in communication and social ability. Along with this, autistic behaviors may also start from nowhere including their will to be alone and a certain resistance to change. Autism Symptoms If you're currently worried about the signs your child is showing, here is a list of symptoms that are synonymous with autism. - Lack of response to their own name - Lack of ability to follow simple directions - Sudden intense tantrums (could also be violent) - Loss of words or reduced babble - Struggles to explain their wants and needs - Seems to show an inability to hear - Language or speech development is delayed - Strange movement patterns - More independent than all other children - Only gets things for themselves as opposed to everyone (including siblings) - Doesn't interact with toys - Struggles to move on after getting stuck with something - Lack of cooperation (signs of resistance) - Prefers to play alone than with friends or siblings - Avoids eye contact at all costs - More advanced than all other children - Tunes the world out regularly - Walks on their toes - Doesn't show an interest in other children - Likes to put things in order (color, size, numerical) - Becomes overly attached to objects, toys, or even their schedule N.A.E.T with Autism Standing for [Nambudripad's Allergy Technique, N.A.E.T](https://chiropractor-plantation.com/conditions/autism.html) was developed and subsequently named after Dr Devi Nambudripad around twenty years ago. With an MD degree, a PhD in acupuncture, and extensive experience in chiropractic techniques, Dr Nambudripad now runs a Californian clinic in Buena Park and we've actually visited the facility multiple times. Having worked with them closely and after using the N.A.E.T technique in our own office, we've grown accustomed to helping people with various issues and autism has been one of them after a correlation between the two was spotted. In addition to many people with autism also having food allergies, they tend to have reactions to heavy metals and vaccinations. Therefore, N.A.E.T aims to reduce these sensitivities in the hopes of adjusting and resolving autistic symptoms. At this point, you're probably considering the likelihood of this technique working with your own child. With our own experience and the knowledge we've gained from Dr Nambudripad personally, we would say 'yes' as the answer to this question. If this is your first interaction with our brilliant service, I'm Dr David Popkin and I'd love the opportunity to help both you and your child. If you or your child have an allergy, N.A.E.T really can help so we urge you to give us a call today; we have experts waiting to give advice on the other end. N.A.E.T History - 'If you're so confident in N.A.E.T, why haven't I heard of the technique previously?' - This is a good question and it's one we get often. Ultimately, the answer comes down to the age of the technique as well as the limited resources of the industry as a whole. Despite twenty years of experience, this is still considered 'new' within the medical world. What's more, the individual practitioners who now use the technique have small budgets and very little reach in terms of marketing. So far, word-of-mouth has been essential and Dr Nambudripad has now trained over 4,500 different practitioners personally. Compared to the pharmaceutical industry, marketing budgets just aren't in place but the technique is now starting to see some progress. As well as the growth in trained practitioners, it's also gaining attention in allergy reference materials and research journals so we could be in for an exciting few years. N.A.E.T Procedure - When it comes to the theory itself, it centers around EME (electromagnetic energy). With this, electrical currents can be found in our bodies and these are called energy channels or meridians. Whenever an allergic reaction occurs, the meridians have been blocked in some way; different symptoms occur as a result of the channels/meridians affected. With N.A.E.T, our professional service will focus on alarm points within the back (each side of the spine) while you or your child holds an allergen vial. Ultimately, the aim will be to neutralize the allergic response by directly altering the electromagnetic energy in the body. During the process, the antigen-antibody reaction is interrupted by a physiologic change in addition to enzymatic (a chemical) production as these combine to neutralize the immune mediators. At the end of it all, the energy blockages should disappear and the brain is alerted to the desensitization. Typical N.A.E.T Appointment - In our experience, patients want to know what's included in a typical appointment so we're going to explain today. After arriving and discussing the procedure with the doctor, you'll be asked to wash your hands; this allows them to be free from foreign energies and substances. If you're wearing a watch or any other electronic devices, these will be removed along with socks and shoes. Before the actual session, you'll go through a muscle response testing (MRT) procedure as this informs us of the allergies and sensitivities you have. If it's your child that'll receive the assistance, the parent will go through the testing as a surrogate. After this has finished, the doctor can report their findings and start the first session. With this technique, you will hold the allergen vial before the doctor stimulates key acupressure points across the back with a small instrument; this will be painless. At this stage, the doctor will use a previously agreed technique whether this is acupressure, needle acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, or laser acupuncture. Throughout the procedure, you should feel comfortable but you can talk with the doctor if you have any concerns or want to take a few seconds to just relax. Once the doctor is happy the procedure has been carried out correctly, you'll go through a relaxation period which normally lasts around twenty minutes. When at this stage, your body needs to desensitize to the allergen so this twenty minutes is an important step in the process. For children, we often recommend strapping the vial to their body because it makes the process easier for all involved; using hypoallergenic tape, this is actually quite simple. As the relaxation period comes to a close, the doctor will run a second MRT procedure to see your reaction. From here, you'll then be asked to wash your hands for a second time but this time soap won't be used; the lack of soap is a strategic move to reduce the bioenergetics of the substance. If you're both happy, you'll be given some written instructions in addition to the details of where you go from here. For best results, you should read the instructions carefully because they explain the products you should avoid and for how long. Avoiding the Allergen - Although the written instructions will tell you everything you need to know, we recommend a minimum of 25 hours for the avoidance of the substance. After the session, your body will be extremely sensitive to the allergen so you need to steer clear otherwise there's a risk of failure. If your situation requires, we may recommend longer than 25 hours but this completely depends on the circumstances. Age Restrictions and Side Effects - Firstly, let's deal with the misconception regarding age restrictions because, in the past, we've helped people of all ages; this includes children, adults, newborns, pregnant women, and infants. If you have any concerns about your own circumstances, feel free to get in touch and we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. In terms of side effects, you may have noticed that there are no needles, shots, or medication involved in this technique. With this in mind, there are no known side effects and there hasn't ever been any listed for twenty years. When the guidelines for the procedure are followed correctly, it's completely safe and this is what we can offer at our high-quality facility. If the doctor isn't trained or doesn't follow the right procedure, there's a danger of an allergic reaction. Also, a reaction can occur when the patient doesn't follow the instructions they're given. Today, it has a high success rate and this is thanks to the thorough nature of the technique with everything from the consultation to the help plan. For ourselves, we also rely on a good relationship with the patient because this allows for clear lines of communication from the start to the finish. When these protocols are adhered to, we can complete the procedure successfully with no side effects. Of course, you want to know about the results so this is further good news because you can expect improved health, reduced allergies and related symptoms, an improved immune system, and an overall sense of well-being. Helping with Allergies in Order - Within Dr Nambudripad's research through the years, a certain order has been developed for addressing allergens. Typically, all food allergens will be cleared first and these are often referred to as the 'basics'. Since we absolutely need food to survive, this is our first area of the help plan. For the most part, we can avoid chemicals, inhalants, and environmental allergens but we need food. By removing the food allergens, the likes of digestion, the immune system, and absorption can all be improved. From here, we can help with other allergens confident in the knowledge that you're getting all the essential nutrients. In terms of the order, it's as follows; egg mix, calcium, vitamin C, B-complex, sugar, vitamin A, iron, salt, chlorides, mineral mix, corn, yeast, and wheat. Over the years, this order has been optimized and needs to be followed correctly because each group has a knock-on effect on the next. By clearing them in this order, they could resolve other food groups without having to address it directly. Number of Sessions- As we've said many times before when approaching this topic, and many others, we can't possibly give you an exact answer here because chiropractic help plan is a personal experience. With everyone offering a different body type, genetic makeup, and personality, several factors affect the number of sessions required. Normally, we advise one visit per allergen and this allows us to work through them in a methodical way. While some people ask why we can't target them all at once, there are two reasons why this isn't a good idea. Firstly, it's better for our bodies to concentrate on desensitizing against one allergen at a time. Secondly, when dealing with food allergens, we don't want to restrict your diet by taking away access to several food groups at once. Instead, we deal with one at a time and allow for definite progress before moving on. Difference with Allergy Shots - Finally, for those who have researched this niche a little, you might be wondering whether you'll be better off with this solution or allergy shots. At first, this seems like a good question because allergy shots promise a great future. However, we have several problems with this notion because it isn't a long-term solution. When you start with allergy shots, the doctor will inject an amount of the allergen into your skin as a method of desensitizing against it. Issued around twice each week, the help plan can last for between five and seven years all things considered. In addition to this, most patients experience pain during the injection and in the days in between so it leads to a life filled with discomfort. On the other hand, N.A.E.T uses no needles, shots, or medication which is one of its biggest advantages. On this note, we would love to hear from you if you have any questions or just need some more information! Customer Testimonials Bob - 'At the age of sixteen, we had tried several sessions for our son who was born micro cephalic and then later diagnosed with autism, hyperactivity, and attention deficit disorder. Unfortunately, these health issues have led to severe compulsive behavioral problems. After hearing about N.A.E.T, we weren't entirely sure but were willing to give it a go. So far, we've had six sessions and we're amazed at the difference. Even ourselves, we realize this sounds like an unlikely story but we're just as amazed. As well as experiencing a reduction in tantrums, he is also speaking more clearly and can offer tasks more attention than ever before.' Sarah - 'Around four weeks ago, we started N.A.E.T help plan with our daughter who was diagnosed with autism three years ago (she is now five). During this time, we've tried several techniques but she never saw the results we were expecting...until N.A.E.T. In just four sessions, we've already seen levels of improvement we never thought possible. As well as showing more focus, she is talking clearer and we can't wait to see what happens as the sessions continue. If you're a parent/carer/guardian of a child with autism, we urge you to try N.A.E.T because it has given us all hope for the future!' James - 'At the age of five years, our daughter began N.A.E.T after being diagnosed with ADD/PDD and mild autism. Unfortunately, her behavior saw her get expelled from numerous preschools and this had us worried for her future. Since starting the sessions, everything has improved including behavior, attention, and her ability to make friends; she has now been attending the same preschool for nearly a year.' *Results may vary from person to person "}
