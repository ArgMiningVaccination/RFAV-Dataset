Pick one up and you'll see what I mean! Crystals emit energetic vibrations that impact how you feel, sense, and interact with your environment - and you can work with them to strengthen your intentions. Whether it's prosperity, wellness, love, creativity, or spiritual connection that you seek, working with gemstones is a wonderful way to manifest your desires and call healing into every facet of your life. When starting out, I recommend working with a book like \"The Book of Stones\" by Robert Simmons and Naisha Ahsian - you can use it to find a gem for any and every intention. And, to learn more about gems and minerals, check out the [Gemstone Guides](https://www.sagegoddess.com/library/gemstones/) library, click here to join my free Facebook group, [Gems & Crystal Magic](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gemhaven/). Or, if you're ready to understand where your crystals come from and learn how to apply their magic in your daily routines, sign up for my new program [Living Magic Crystalpedia](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product/living-magic-online-program/). Picking your stones and setting an intention When deciding what gems to work with, take a second and meditate on what you wish to manifest, or what areas of your life are in need of healing. The most important concept behind choosing your stones is your intention, your purpose. Honestly ask yourself what you seek from this work. Here are some of the most common intentions that lead people to work with crystals and gemstones: healing, love, manifestation, grounding, spiritual growth, releasing/letting go, fertility. If there's a particular stone you're drawn to visually, I recommend trusting your intuition - the pull you feel may be a subconscious realization of an unexpressed need. Don't ignore your instincts! Some people are highly sensitive to gemstone vibrations, while others are not. As you raise your own vibration, you'll become more in touch with, and more readily able to use, your own intuition as a guide. Try not to assume that just because you aren't sensitive to gemstone vibrations today, you aren't able to work with them at all. Give yourself time, and recognize that energy work is a process and indeed a skill that you develop and hone over time. Intention set? Now, arm yourself with these tools! If you're brand new to crystal work, I suggest these three gemstones to begin: - A piece of [clear quartz](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/clear-quartz/)or [selenite](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/selenite/)- these stones carry high and pure vibrations and can uplift, absorb, and clear negative energies that may be blocking or holding you back. [Obsidian](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/obsidian/), [hematite](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/hematite/), or [black tourmaline](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/tourmaline-black/)- powerful grounding and protection stones. It's important to remain grounded in magical work or to get grounded if you're someone prone to living in your higher chakras. These stones are great for grounding you by activating your Root [Chakra](https://www.sagegoddess.com/what-is-a-chakra/). [Blue kyanite](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/kyanite/)- the powerful healing and chakra alignment stone. It's ideal for beginners because it attunes all chakras, opening them and bringing a healing vibration. This is also a stone that never needs to be programmed or cleared! Some fun crystal facts you may not know Every crystal has a unique mineral structure that aligns with sacred geometry. This affects how that crystal works with your specific energy. Gemstones which align with the Platonic Solids, the basic building blocks of life. These structures are echoed throughout nature - even within your body! - and affect the way the crystal works on metaphysical levels. For example, hexagonal stones such as [quartz](https://www.sagegoddess.com/?s=clear+quartz&post_type=product&type=in_stock) tend to be the most powerful crystal healers, while isometric or cubic minerals like [ pyrite](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/pyrite/) are good conductors of energy. Quartz crystals can be programmed to work with you on a specific intention. This makes them more powerful and effective energetic allies for crystal healing. Quartz is a crystal that can \"act\" as if it's another mineral, taking on the properties of other minerals in metaphysical work. Quartz develops a relationship with its owner and creates a stronger energetic connection with you as the years go by. You can also meditate and program your quartz to magnify energies for health, happiness, prosperity, or whatever you seek. Program quartz by holding it in meditation and imagining the feeling or intention you wish to expand; then visualize the feeling or intention growing inside a sphere of white light emanating from your quartz crystal. When your work with the crystal is complete, deprogram the quartz by visualizing the release of a sphere of white light. Lemurian seed crystals and rutilated quartz contain unique messages and information. These crystals' wisdom is stored within their lines and striation, and the messages can be translated during meditation and crystal healing sessions. [Lemurian quartz ](https://www.sagegoddess.com/product-category/gems-minerals/healing-crystals/quartz-lemurian-lemurian-seed/)has raised lines on every other side that can be rubbed to discern the \"seed\" of Lemurian wisdom contained within. And each line of rutile within quartz can be read in meditation to learn about your own personal transformation. Both of these types of quartz are said to choose their owner in order to transfer necessary wisdom and information. Crystals have magical correspondences and vibrate to specific numbers and [astrological](https://www.sagegoddess.com/what-is-astrology/) signs. There are stones you can work with based on your birthday and zodiac sign! For example, each sign has a \"totem stone\" that's aligned with the energies of the astrological sign. And each month of the year also has a correspondence.
