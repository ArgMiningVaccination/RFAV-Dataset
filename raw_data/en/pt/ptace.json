He knew that the F.D.A. had approved the vaccines, he said. \"I'm not contesting that in any way. I don't want to be misunderstood. I'm sure I will be misunderstood.\" Alito uttered those lines in a sour, singsong tone, as if he were speaking to a recalcitrant child and not, as he was, to Elizabeth Prelogar, the United States Solicitor General, who was defending OSHA in the case, which was brought by the N.F.I.B., an industry group, and twenty-seven states, all with Republican governors or attorneys general. What was hard to miss, if not to misunderstand, was Alito's hostility to the mandate. The tenor of the questions asked by other Justices\u2014notably Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014similarly suggested that the mandate, which would apply to about eighty million people, has little chance of going into effect in its present form. The prospects look better for a second mandate, which applies only to workers in health-care facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds, and would affect about ten million people. The oral arguments in that case, Biden v. Missouri, which combines cases initiated by the attorneys general of multiple states, immediately followed the first. But that outcome is hardly a sure thing, and that is remarkable on a couple of levels. First, while the supposed problem with the OSHA mandate is that it is federal overreach, the federal interest in the context of Medicare and Medicaid is fairly clear. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it, speaking from the government's perspective, \"If you want my money, your facility has to do this.\" Justice Elena Kagan summed up the message to providers, in the context of controlling [COVID-19](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus), even more bluntly: \"The one thing you can't do is kill your patients.\" Second, even though, like Alito, the lawyers challenging the mandates protested that they had nothing against COVID-19 vaccines, the thrust of their arguments was that getting vaccinated is a terrible imposition that reasonable people might be compelled to quit their jobs rather than endure. These are not fringe-group lawyers but the representatives of multiple states. Elizabeth Murrill, the Louisiana Solicitor General, described what was being asked of workers at Medicare and Medicaid providers as \"an invasive, irrevocable, forced medical procedure\" being imposed in an unprecedented \"bureaucratic power move.\" That is a lot to lay on a simple shot that protects against a disease that has taken more than eight hundred thousand American lives. Alito, after his self-pitying prelude, asked Prelogar to confirm that the [vaccines](https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/why-the-covid-vaccines-arent-dangerous) have some risks, unlike, he said, \"wearing a hard hat,\" which has no \"adverse health consequences.\" When she noted that what risks there might be were smaller than those associated with COVID-19 \"by an order of magnitude,\" and that, in any event, the OSHA mandate offers a testing-and-masking alternative, Alito hardly seemed to listen\u2014not even when Kagan jumped in to help Prelogar by noting that \"regulators think of risk/risk trade-offs constantly.\" When Prelogar mentioned unvaccinated workers who might be older or have comorbidities, Alito interrupted to say, \"All of whom have balanced the risk differently, maybe very foolishly, but they want to balance the risks presented to their health in a different way. And OSHA says, no, you can't do that.\" \"Well, one small factual correction, if I could, and then a broader legal point,\" Prelogar replied. \"I think it's wrong to say that everyone who's unvaccinated is just assuming the risk. Some people can't get vaccinations for medical reasons. Some people have deeply held religious beliefs and are entitled to religious exemptions\"\u2014circumstances for which the mandate offers accommodations. \"And OSHA is entitled to try to protect those unvaccinated workers, no matter the reason they're unvaccinated.\" That line was the broader legal point, and got at why the going has been so tough for a fairly simple, sensible set of mandates: vaccine skepticism has been joined not only with COVID-19 denialism and [Trumpism](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/is-a-civil-war-ahead) but with regulatory skepticism, and indeed with hostility to the idea that the federal government has any place regulating businesses at all. OSHA has, in fact, issued vaccine regulations in certain settings in the past; employers must offer hepatitis-B vaccines to people working in facilities that handle blood and blood products, although there is a process for workers to opt out. But the politicized antagonism that has been entangled with the fight against COVID-19 is not confined to commercial matters. A [brief filed by Ohio](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21A244/207138/20220103082552049_SCOTUS%20Reply%20ISO%20Stay%20Application.pdf) and other states argued that, in attempting to protect workers against COVID-19 infection, OSHA was dealing not with a workplace threat but with a \"common risk of life,\" and asked what the \"limiting principle\" might be: \"Could it issue 'workplace' regulations preempting state laws (and overriding company policies) that forbid or permit carrying a gun at work?\" (First they came for Omicron; then they came for your AR-15.) In oral arguments, Benjamin Flowers, Ohio's solicitor general, who called the mandate a \"blunderbuss rule,\" argued that because COVID-19 was common outside the workplace\u2014he compared it to the way \"there's some risk of terrorism when we wake up in the morning\"\u2014OSHA couldn't regulate it within the workplace. \"Well, why not?\" Kagan asked. Workplace risk could be a person's \"greatest, least controllable risk with respect to COVID,\" she said. \"You can go to the baseball game or not go to the baseball game. You can decide who to go to the baseball game with. But you can't do any of that in workplaces. . . . You have to be there in the exact environment that the workplace is set up with.\" The arguments in the two cases lasted more than three and a half hours\u2014almost twice as long as scheduled. All the Justices, except Neil Gorsuch, wore masks, though some took them off when they were speaking. Sotomayor participated remotely; as [Amy Howe of SCOTUSblog](https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/court-seems-poised-to-block-vaccine-or-test-policy-for-workplaces-but-may-allow-vaccine-mandate-for-health-care-workers/) and others noted, she has diabetes, a COVID comorbidity. (Flowers, of the blunderbuss, was also remote, having tested positive; Murrill was remote, too.) Kagan, Sotomayor, and Alito weren't the only Justices who spoke with passion or even anger. This was notably true of Justice [Stephen Breyer](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-politics-of-supreme-court-retirements). As he pointed out, for now, the question before the Court is whether to allow the mandates to go into effect while they work their way through the lower courts, though in making that call the Justices may choose to speak more broadly on the constitutionality of the mandates, and probably will. The legal mechanics in the two cases are slightly different. In N.F.I.B. v. OSHA, the challengers are asking the Court to stay the mandate's implementation, which is set to begin on Monday, when companies are supposed to have plans for how they will comply. (OSHA has said that it will wait longer to actually assess penalties.) In Biden v. Missouri, the challengers have already obtained injunctions blocking the mandate, which had been scheduled to go into effect last week, issued by federal district-court judges in Missouri and Louisiana\u2014the Fifth Circuit also upheld the Louisiana injunction for certain states. The [Biden Administration](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden) is asking for a stay of those injunctions so that it can proceed. The considerations regarding a stay include the likelihood of success, public interest, and the \"balance of harms.\" Addressing Keller, the lawyer for the N.F.I.B., Breyer asked if he was saying that \"it's in the public interest in this situation to stop this vaccination rule,\" with \"nearly three-quarters of a million people, new cases every day? I mean, to me, I would find that unbelievable.\" Breyer pushed the question, in similar terms\u2014he used the word \"unbelievable\" several times\u2014with the other lawyers opposing both mandates. Their basic answer was that, the minute a mandate appeared imminent, workers would quit, resulting in a labor shortage. For the most part, that prediction hasn't been borne out in places where there are mandates, such as in the meatpacking and airline industries. And, of course, as the current [Omicron wave](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-soon-will-covid-be-normal) is demonstrating, having people home sick with COVID-19 can cause quite acute labor shortages. Much of the questioning from the conservative Justices, in particular Brett Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, was tied to what's called the \"major questions\" doctrine\u2014which basically says that, if a federal agency plays fast and loose with the authority that Congress has delegated to it, for example by relying on ambiguous statutory language, in ways that have a vast effect, its authority can be challenged. This should not mean that agencies can't do big things that are clearly within their authority\u2014after all, big things happen, such as pandemics. When Scott Keller said that Congress would have had to \"clearly state\" that OSHA could \"require employees to get certain medical treatment\"\u2014he meant a vaccine shot. Justice Sotomayor reminded him that Congress itself had created OSHA and directed it to protect workers, including in innovative ways, and in emergencies. \"I don't know how much clearer you can be, if you're Congress,\" she said. In the Medicare-and-Medicaid case, Brian Fletcher, the deputy solicitor general, told the Justices that the Secretary of Health, Xavier Becerra, who issued the mandate, was relying not only on his general powers under the Social Security Act but on \"specific authorities as to each category of covered providers\"\u2014for example, statutes referring to hospitals or outpatient facilities, which the government listed in a table in its filings in the lower courts. That wasn't specific enough for Justice [Amy Coney Barrett](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/amy-coney-barrett). She was perhaps willing to concede that language in one of the statutes, requiring skilled-nursing facilities to maintain \"an infection control program,\" was specific enough, but she didn't seem to think that references to patient health and safety did the trick. And, Barrett asked, if she didn't agree with the government regarding every type of facility, \"Why shouldn't then we just leave the Fifth Circuit's injunction in place?\" In his rebuttal, Fletcher all but pleaded with Barrett to do the work of looking for what she did agree with. That might mean at least letting the mandate go into place in nursing homes, where too many people have already died of COVID-19. For some time, the strength of the arguments has mattered only so much with this Court. There are three liberal Justices, five hard conservatives, and Roberts, who seems like a swing vote on some days because of how strangely stretched the spectrum is. Friday was not one of those days. He strongly signalled that he is opposed to the OSHA mandate. He told Prelogar that it was \"a little hard to accept the idea\" that the mandate is \"particularized\" to OSHA and its responsibilities, given that the Biden Administration is also seeking the Medicare-and-Medicaid-providers mandate and another one, pending in the lower courts, involving federal contractors. \"It seems to me that it's that the government is trying to work across the waterfront and it's just going agency by agency. I mean, this has been referred to, the approach, as a work-around, and I'm wondering what it is you're trying to work around.\" The \"work-around\" reference was to a tweet describing the mandate in that way, with regard to the state's role in public health, that was retweeted by [Ron Klain](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/after-years-of-chaos-the-white-house-is-definitely-in-different-hands), Joe Biden's chief of staff\u2014a social-media click that has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the right. (Klain tweets incessantly and not always prudently.) Prelogar replied by speaking about OSHA's \"express statutory authority\" to protect workers\u2014she referred both to the law that created OSHA and to the American Rescue Plan, the stimulus package passed last year, which is charged with carrying out \"COVID-19 related worker protection activities\" and provided a hundred million dollars for that purpose\u2014but that didn't satisfy Roberts. He was bothered that mandates seemed to \"pop up in different agencies,\" as though their promulgation were itself the troubling pandemic, and not a response to one. \"It sounds like the sort of thing that states will be responding to or should be or\u2014and that Congress should be responding to or should be, rather than agency by agency, the federal government, the executive branch, acting alone,\" he said. No one is alone in this, but, once Roberts showed his hand, the game appeared over, and the other Justices seemed to feel it. Sotomayor broke in to try to remind Roberts that the Court had historically looked at whether an agency had the authority to do what it was doing, not whether too many agencies were trying \"to protect America.\" And yet Roberts did seem to be suggesting that there was something illegitimate about trying to rally a government, let alone a society, to address a problem together. He seemed more receptive to the Medicare-and-Medicaid mandate, but mostly expressed that by trying to ask Fletcher if his case was better than the one \"that your boss\"\u2014Prelogar\u2014\"just finished arguing.\" (Fletcher said that he thought they were both good.) Roberts's position was, in effect, a sibling to the scornful individualism that leads people to believe that it's no one's problem but their own if they carry and spread the virus, which Alito seemed to favor. (It is interesting, as always, that the conservative emphasis on individual rights can be so selective; the Court will soon issue a ruling that is expected to [limit reproductive rights](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/the-mississippi-abortion-case-and-the-fragile-legitimacy-of-the-supreme-court).) Similarly, in the Medicare-and-Medicaid case, Murrill, the Louisiana solicitor general, said that the government was attempting to mandate the vaccination of health-care-facility employees, the people who work with some of the most vulnerable Americans, as \"a pretext\" and \"as the Chief Justice alluded to . . . a work-around,\" all to hide the Biden Administration's true intent: \"to tether all of these restrictions together, all of these\u2014these mandates together to vaccinate as many\u2014as much of the American public as they could touch.\" She said it as if it were an accusation, as though she were revealing a malign plot against the country, and not a plan to beat back COVID-19. Note: An earlier version of this article imprecisely described OSHA's hepatitis-B vaccine requirements. "}
