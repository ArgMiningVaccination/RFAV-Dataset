DTx emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention, management, or treatment of chronic, behavior-changeable diseases in recent years. Due to the public health emergency posed by coronavirus disease 2019, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has relaxed its regulations to expand access to digital health devices for remote monitoring and management of illness [ [2](#b2-enm-2021-107)]. Currently, DTx products target behavior-modifiable problems such as type 2 diabetes and weight management. For example, Welldoc Communications, a system to provide a mobile phone-based diabetes management software connected to web-based data analytics, serves as an interactive platform for patients and healthcare providers that provides real-time information and analysis [ [3](#b3-enm-2021-107)]. There are also other digital healthcare companies for diabetes and weight control; Noom, Omada, Livongo, Lark, Voluntis, and so on. In this review, we discuss evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs. Only telephone calls, short message services, or online web-based servers are excluded from the definition of DTx. [2](#b2-enm-2021-107)]. CBT uses evidence-based techniques to change problematic behaviors and unhelpful cognitive distortions, and to improve emotional regulation and coping skills to solve the current problems [ [4](#b4-enm-2021-107)]. Frequent clinical assessments in the context of diverse psychological conditions using digital modalities are highly beneficial to enhance the efficacy of CBT interventions [ [5](#b5-enm-2021-107)]. In fact, collecting assessment data in face-to-face conditions is a burdensome task involving retrospective reports. These reports have high risks of being systematically biased by recall and neglecting important contextual components or acute changes in certain periods [ [5](#b5-enm-2021-107)]. In contrast, collecting assessment data using smartphones and wearables is convenient and time-sensitive, allowing the real-time evaluation of context-rich information. Thus, the integration of digital technologies and CBT techniques has become the cutting-edge approach in DTx components, allowing individualized and stepped-care interventions [ [6](#b6-enm-2021-107)]. DTx FOR OBESITY AND EATING-RELATED PROBLEMS: AN EMPHASIS ON A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH [7](#b7-enm-2021-107)]. As shown in [Fig. 1](#f1-enm-2021-107), both physical and mental health conditions are the major components of lifestyle modification. To achieve a healthy lifestyle through a lifestyle modification intervention, high motivation is mandatory as a prerequisite for high adherence. A patient can also attain stimulus control capability by manipulating eating-related cues in the environment, using cognitive techniques to investigate maladaptive thinking, and building coping skills related to emotional regulation and stress management [ [8](#b8-enm-2021-107)]. These psychological mechanisms contributing to mental health are closely associated with physical health and contribute to clinical outcomes. [9](#b9-enm-2021-107), [10](#b10-enm-2021-107)]. The majority of mobile health interventions only showed effective improvements in primary outcomes for physical health measures, such as hemoglobin A1c or body weight [ [11](#b11-enm-2021-107)- [14](#b14-enm-2021-107)]. These interventions were ineffective at improving mental health conditions such as self-efficacy, quality of life, depression, and other measures. We recently showed that motivation, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem were predictive markers of successful weight control [ [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)]. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach including psychological components is needed to develop practical DTx for obesity and other eating behavioral problems. RECENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS RELATED TO DTx [Table 1](#t1-enm-2021-107)). [16](#b16-enm-2021-107)]. In fact, the intervention was not directly delivered to the children, but supported their caregivers to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage intake. In terms of the target diseases, four RCTs investigated DTx for obesity treatment, while only one study focused on eating disorders [ [17](#b17-enm-2021-107)]. [15](#b15-enm-2021-107), [17](#b17-enm-2021-107)]. Other studies utilized only behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring or restricting time [ [16](#b16-enm-2021-107), [18](#b18-enm-2021-107)- [21](#b21-enm-2021-107)]. To test the efficacy of the interventions, two studies used a three-arm parallel-group design [ [18](#b18-enm-2021-107), [19](#b19-enm-2021-107)], while other intervention devices [ [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)- [21](#b21-enm-2021-107)]. [16](#b16-enm-2021-107)- [19](#b19-enm-2021-107)]. A few studies applied several assessments to validate their intervention efficacy, but they did not show significant outcomes in general [ [20](#b20-enm-2021-107), [21](#b21-enm-2021-107)]. Our study is the only RCT that assessed all five relevant dimensions: body weight, body composition, physiological tests, behavioral tests, and psychological assessments [ [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)]. All clinical outcomes significantly improved after the digital intervention period. [16](#b16-enm-2021-107), [19](#b19-enm-2021-107), [21](#b21-enm-2021-107)]. However, the only study that adapted self-help strategies in the digital intervention presented an adherence rate of 31% [ [17](#b17-enm-2021-107)]. MAIN ISSUES RELATED TO DTx FOR OBESITY AND EATING BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS [Fig. 2](#f2-enm-2021-107)). Comprehensiveness of an individual's multifactorial health condition [8](#b8-enm-2021-107)]. Therefore, multifactorial domains\u2014behavioral (e.g., late-night meals, snacks), cognitive (e.g., arbitrary inference, selective abstraction), emotional (e.g., irritation, loneliness), motivational (i.e., willingness to change, self-confidence), and anthropometric\u2014are suggested to be addressed to comprehensively understand and monitor the progress of weight control and eating behavioral patterns [ [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)]. Since cognitive structuring and emotional regulation significantly affect behavior styles and engagement with DTx, an integrated approach concerned with all of these components will ultimately solve problems related to obesity. Efficacy of DTx in RCTs [22](#b22-enm-2021-107)]. To reliably prove the efficacy of novel DTx, RCTs are a prerequisite. [23](#b23-enm-2021-107)]. Thus, it is challenging to select the main active ingredient of DTx and devise a specific active sham control group (identical DTx platform without the main active ingredient). It is also difficult to establish a completely blinded condition, as in placebo-controlled trials of medications. Therefore, new RCT frameworks tailored to DTx have been developed; such as the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART), micro-randomized trials, clustered randomized control trials, unequal-allocation RCTs, and control optimization trials [ [24](#b24-enm-2021-107)- [27](#b27-enm-2021-107)]. Each design aims to answer different research questions and thereby to provide the gold standard for proof in clinical medicine. In addition, due to the nature of digital technologies, RCTs of DTx could adopt fully digital online innovative designs, including digital enrollment, digital intervention, and digital outcome phenotyping, potentially avoiding the requirement for on-site visits. Tailoring the individual feedback in DTx [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)]. However, most app-based interventions use non-tailored behavioral strategies (e.g., prompts for monitoring, appointment reminders, and health education), uniformly produced common content, or limitedly customized algorithms based on a few domains such as diet, physical activity, and body weight [ [17](#b17-enm-2021-107), [20](#b20-enm-2021-107)]. These strategies have shown limitations regarding engagement in the intervention and the maintenance of treatment efficacy. Thus, based on baseline and/or real-time multifactorial measures (e.g., behavior, emotion, cognition, and motivation), tailored feedback and adaptive intervention can increase the engagement and the effectiveness of DTx. Furthermore, other characteristics such as, genetic, social, and economic factors, as well as comorbidities, could be utilized for the development of tailored DTx. The role of a health coach [15](#b15-enm-2021-107), [17](#b17-enm-2021-107), [18](#b18-enm-2021-107)]. The major role of a health coach is to provide practical solutions to problems, emotional support, motivational interviews, and informative knowledge to support effective behavioral changes. The function of human coaching can be automated by virtual conversational agents, such as chatbots. Natural language processing studies could help develop augmented text coaching platforms for both human coaches and chatbots. Temporal strategies for intervention frequency [28](#b28-enm-2021-107)]. In contrast, we recently showed that more intensive daily coaching could produce a high adherence rate, with 80% of participants remaining active users until the last session of the treatment. A reason for this high adherence rate is that we delivered more intensive daily personalized feedback by facilitating real-time access to a human coach. Since the engagement rate in DTx influences the clinical outcomes, considering the intensity of interaction between providers and users is necessary. More intensive daily interventions could stimulate higher engagement. However, an extremely frequent intervention could be fatiguing or burdensome to both users and coaches. This can be alleviated by implementing advanced digital technologies such as artificial intelligence or machine-learning approaches to replace repetitive tasks by automated services [ [29](#b29-enm-2021-107)]. Evidence-based psychological theory for intervention strategies Target populations LIMITATIONS OF DTx BEING APPLIED IN THE CLINICS [28](#b28-enm-2021-107)]. Next, similar to traditional pharmaceuticals, DTx must undergo RCTs for the approval procedure to verify safety and efficacy in the premarket [ [2](#b2-enm-2021-107)]. However, DTx software is capable of being frequently updated and adjusted to FDA guidance at any moment, unlike other pharmaceuticals. Lastly, cybersecurity and data rights are other bottlenecks of the mass adoption of DTx. One of the solutions can be the partnerships between the industries and academics, which the companies behind successful DTx collaborate with academic groups to address scientific rigor as expected of traditional pharmaceutical drugs. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS [Fig. 3](#f3-enm-2021-107)). Different phenotyping methods with multi-dimensional phenotypes [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)]. Phenotypes can be classified as digital or conventional. The digital phenotype refers to both passively and actively gathered data using digital modalities, such as smartphones and wearables [ [30](#b30-enm-2021-107)]. It can be acquired by wearable sensors, smartphones, and other digital devices. The conventional phenotype refers to measures that are assessed by traditional methods (i.e., blood samples, self-reported questionnaires, electronic medical records, and buffet test-meals). These collected phenotypes are then classified into multi-dimensional phenotypes (physical health, behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and motivational). In other words, each of these dimensions can be assessed by either (or both) of these two phenotyping methods. A comprehensive integration of conventional and digital phenotypes is a key component for developing and delivering personalized interventions within DTx [ [15](#b15-enm-2021-107)]. Devising analytical methods and developing dashboards for administrators [31](#b31-enm-2021-107)]. Here, the term \"administrators\" refers to the people who monitor individuals' performance and instruct them about relevant skills to promote lifestyle modifications. Developing different versions of dashboards for each administrator may generate a better user environment since administrators could then support users in diverse aspects. This will improve individuals' performance, leading to better clinical outcomes. Integrating DTx with online-to-offline services [32](#b32-enm-2021-107), [33](#b33-enm-2021-107)]. All administrators will be able to prescribe home-care, work-care, school-care, and medical-care-related products through DTx. As boundaries between different sectors are fading away, new policies are required for stakeholders including health professions, patients, and guardians. This will enable sustainable ecosystems and business models that serve the public's interest. CONCLUSIONS [34](#b34-enm-2021-107), [35](#b35-enm-2021-107)]. To develop efficient DTx for obesity and eating problems, it is required to monitor and manage both physical and mental health conditions. Thus, to facilitate the response to lifestyle modification, obesity-related phenotypes including the clusters of behavioral, emotional, cognitive, motivational, and physiological features are required. Since adherence is the strongest predictors for successful weight management, we recommend adjusting a health coach system, providing tailored feedback. Moreover, adequate RCT with active placebo, evidence-based psychological theory (i.e., CBT), and intervention temporal strategies are other important issues to be considered in developing DTx. We are living in the digital era where digital transformation is inevitable. To adapt to this forthcoming flow, new policy actions are necessary in the community, city, government, and industry. "}
