Jack Canfield's book Chicken Soup for the Shoppers Soul and Jack Canfield's Chicken Soup for the Recovering Soul Contributing author for Whispers of Inspiration I love how this kindle book has a nice clickable Table of Contents to find specific ailments as well as herbal remedies! Nearly 800 pages of well written, concise, useful information! One of the other things that I highly appreciated was how the author tells you.. how prescription medications may or may not work with various herbal remedies! For example.. if you're taking a blood thinner medication that was prescribed by your physician.. you probably do not want to also take licorice root in tandem.. as it could cause your blood to not clot at all. The book lists many common ailments.. and gives very specific information on herbal remedies to try. Encourages the reader to keep their personal physicians apprised of EVERYTHING that one is putting into their body. I've recommended this book to quite a few people today! And, many are just as astounded as I am!! A superb book... that I will be using for quite some time "}
