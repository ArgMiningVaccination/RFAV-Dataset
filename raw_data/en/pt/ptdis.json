Wounds may result from trauma or from a surgical incision. In addition, pressure ulcers (also known as decubitus ulcers or bed sores), a type of [ skin ulcer ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-3568007#hn-3568007-need-to-know), might also be considered wounds. The capacity of a wound to heal depends in part on its depth, as well as on the overall health and nutritional status of the individual. Following injury, an inflammatory response occurs and the cells below the dermis (the deepest skin layer) begin to increase collagen (connective tissue) production. Later, the epithelial tissue (the outer skin layer) is regenerated. Dietary modifications and nutritional and herbal supplements may improve the quality of wound healing by influencing these reparative processes or by limiting the damaging effects of inflammation. Symptoms Symptoms include swelling, stiffness, tenderness, discoloration, skin tightness, scabbing, itching, and scar formation. [] Eating Right The right diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life. For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips. |Recommendation||Why| |Go for the protein|| | Help the body build and repair tissue by eating a diet high in protein and adequate in calories. Good protein sources include fish, chicken, and soy products. Building and repairing tissue requires adequate amounts of calories and protein to fuel the repair mechanisms, as the skin and underlying tissues are made of protein. While major wounds from extensive injuries or major surgery significantly raise protein and calorie requirements, optimal healing of minor wounds should not require changes from a typical, healthful diet. In a study of malnourished people with [] Supplements [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. |Supplement||Why| | | 3 Stars Bromelain 3,000 MCU (2,000 GDU) three times per day for several days, followed by 2,000 MCU three times per day | | Taking bromelain may help reduce swelling and speed the healing time for surgical wounds and soft tissue injuries. Supplementation with | | 3 Stars Vitamin B-Complex Follow label directions | | Thiamine (vitamin B1), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and other B vitamins have all been shown to play a role in wound healing. For this reason, some healthcare practitioners recommend a high-potency B vitamin supplement to promote wound healing. | | 3 Stars Vitamin C 1 to 3 grams daily | | Taking vitamin C may promote connective tissue repair. | | 3 Stars Zinc 30 mg daily (with 2 mg copper daily to prevent depletion), or apply topical zinc preparations regularly | | Zinc is a component of enzymes needed to repair wounds, and even a mild deficiency can interfere with optimal recovery from everyday tissue damage. Whether oral zinc helps tissue healing when no actual zinc deficiency exists is unclear, but doctors often recommend 30 mg of zinc per day for four to six weeks to aid in the healing of wounds. Topical zinc-containing treatments, on the other hand, have improved healing of skin wounds even when there is no deficiency. Long-term oral zinc supplementation must be accompanied by copper supplementation to prevent a zinc-induced copper deficiency. Typically, if 30 mg of zinc are taken each day, it should be accompanied by 2 mg of copper. If 60 mg of zinc are used, it should be accompanied by 3 mg of copper each day. | | 2 Stars Aloe Apply stabilized gel three to five times daily | | Aloe has been shown to decrease inflammation, promote cellular repair, and facilitate wound healing.

One preliminary trial found that a | | 2 Stars Honey Take under medical supervision: apply 10 to 20 ml twice per day | | Topical application of honey has been used since antiquity to accelerate skin wound healing. Honey has been shown to inhibit the growth of several organisms responsible for wound infections. Topical application of honey has been used since antiquity to accelerate skin wound healing. Honey has been shown to inhibit the growth of several organisms responsible for wound infections. In one preliminary study, nine infants with large, open infected wounds that failed to heal with conventional treatment were treated successfully with topical application of honey. Fresh unprocessed honey was applied to wounds in amounts of 5-10 ml twice daily for a period of 21 days. All infants showed marked clinical improvement after 5 days, and the wounds were closed and free of infection by 21 days. The use of honey to treat wounds should be supervised by a doctor. | | 2 Stars Horse Chestnut Apply topically | | Horse chestnut contains a compound called aescin that acts as an anti-inflammatory and reduces swelling after trauma, particularly sports injuries, surgery, and head injury. | | 2 Stars Hyaluronic Acid 1% solution for ears | | Topically applied hyaluronic acid is sometimes used in skin wound dressings to improve healing. Topical application of | | 2 Stars Ornithine Alpha-Ketoglutarate 10 to 30 grams daily | | Supplementing with OKG has been shown to significantly improve wound healing and decrease the length of hospital stays. Preliminary and controlled studies of people with severe burns and other types of injuries showed that supplementation with 10-30 grams of | | 2 Stars Vitamin A Take under medical supervision: 25,000 IU daily | | Vitamin A plays a central role in wound healing and may be useful as a supplement or in a topical ointment. | | 2 Stars Vitamin E 400 IU daily | | Supplementing with vitamin E may enhance healing and prevent adhesion formation after surgery, applied topically, the vitamin may help prevent scarring. Animal studies have shown that supplementing with Topical application of vitamin E is sometimes recommended for preventing or treating post-injury scars, although only three controlled studies have been reported. Two of these trials found no effect on scar prevention after surgery, and one trial found vitamin E improved the effect of silicon bandages on large scars called keloids. | | 1 Star Arginine Refer to label instructions | | Arginine appears to improve wound healing by increasing protein synthesis. | | 1 Star Arnica Topical Refer to label instructions | | Some practitioners consider topically applied arnica to be among the best wound-healing herb available. Used topically, some practitioners consider arnica to be among the best vulnerary (wound-healing) herbs available. Topical use of arnica is approved by the German government for improving wound healing. Arnica is poisonous if taken internally. | | 1 Star Bladderwrack Refer to label instructions | | Alginic acid is one of the main constituents in bladderwrack.
