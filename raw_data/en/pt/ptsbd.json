Failure to provide requested information, including information about other coverage may result in a d enial of claims. 2.1 Non-duplication BCN Coverage provides you with the Benefits for health care Service s as described in this Certificate. BCN Coverage does not duplicate Benefits or pay more for Covered Service s than the BCN Approved Amount. BCN does not allow \"double -dipping\" meaning that the Member and provider are not eligible to be paid by both BCN and another health plan or another insurance policy. This is a coordinated Certificate, meaning Coverage described in this Certificate will be reduced to the extent that the Service s are available or payable by other health plans or policies under which you may be covered, whether or not you make a claim for payment under such health plan or policy. 2.2 Auto Policy and Workers' Compe nsation Claims This Certificate is a coordinated Certificate of Coverage . This means that for medical care needed as the result of an automobile accident, if the Member has a coordinated no - fault insurance policy, then BCN will assume primary liability for Covered Service s. The no-fault automobile insurance would be secondary. If the Member has coverage through a non -coordinated (sometimes called a \"full medical\") no -fault automobile insurance policy, then the automobile insurance will be considered the pr imary plan. BCN would pay Coverage under this Certificate as the secondary plan. If a Member is injured while riding a motorcycle due to an accident with an automobile, then the automobile insurance for the involved automobile is primary for the Member's medical Service s.

Clinical Trials of experimental drugs or treatments proceed through four phases: Phase I: Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people (20 -80) for the first time to evaluate its safety, to determine a safe dosage range and to identify side effects. Phase I trials do not determine efficacy and may involve significant risks as these trials represent the initial use in human patients. Phase II: The study drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100 -300) to see if it is effective and further evaluate its safety. Phase III: If a treatment has shown to be effective in Phase II, it is subjected to additional scrutiny in Phase III. In this phase, the sample size of the study population is increased to between 1,000 and 3,000 people. The goals in Phase III are to confirm the effectiveness noted in Phase II, monitor for side effects, compare the study treatment against current treatment protocols, and collect data that will facilitate safe use of the therapy or treatment under review.
