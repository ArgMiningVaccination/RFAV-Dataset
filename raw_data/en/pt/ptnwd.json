Chiropractic care focuses on the treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, most often through spinal adjustment or manual manipulation. Although these two healing modalities rely on different techniques, they work toward the same outcome \u2014 to treat pain and illness naturally. If you are suffering from chronic pain, illness or general aches, a combination of acupuncture treatments and chiropractic care can be highly beneficial. Acupuncture A key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture has been used to treat medical conditions such as headaches, asthma and back pain for many years. By stimulating specific sites throughout the body, acupuncture helps restore balance throughout areas of the body that are suffering from physiological imbalances, thereby allowing the body to heal itself. Chiropractic Care When vertebrae are moved out of proper alignment due to stress, muscle tension or injury, the body cannot function optimally. This spinal misalignment also often causes pain. Chiropractors specialize in adjusting any misalignments in the spine that may be causing improper transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body, restoring proper spinal alignment and physiological function. Given that chiropractors seek to restore sound spinal alignment to help the body function properly overall, it can be said that chiropractic care and acupuncture are similar in that they both work to restore harmony throughout the body. Winning Combination Acupuncture has been proven to be effective in treating some of the common problems treated by chiropractors, including chronic back pain and other musculoskeletal conditions. Combining acupuncture with chiropractic treatment provides a comprehensive approach to pain management. For example, if you injure your back playing tennis, chiropractic adjustments address the mechanics of the injury while acupuncture stimulates healing and reduces the pain. Together, the two forms of treatment can decrease the amount of time it takes for your body to heal and encourage optimal functionality. Want to Know More?
