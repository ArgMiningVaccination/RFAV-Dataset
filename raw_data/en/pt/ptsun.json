Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is about five thousand years old, it incorporates the use of acupuncture, herbs, nutrition and lifestyle counseling to use the body's own healing abilities and bring it into balance. It is therefore free from side effects. In TCM, theories like [yinyang](yinyang), Qi, ZangFu (the organ system), and the [five elements](five-elements) are used to describe health and the body. Qi life force, flows through our bodies via channels or meridians that are connected to our major internal organs. When Qi energy flows freely through the meridians, the body is balanced and healthy. Imbalance and dis-ease result when this flow of energy is deficient, stagnant or excessive. To restore balance, hair-thin needles are inserted in the specific acupuncture points along these channels that balance the flow of energy and bring the body back into balance. The treatment centers on supplementing the primary deficiency pattern and balancing the distribution and circulation of Qi energy within the meridian system. Therefore, if you have stagnant energy, specific points are chosen to release it. If it is too weak, then it is strengthened. The chosen points may not necessarily be at the site of the symptoms. An imbalance in a person's body can result from inappropriate emotional responses such as excess anger, over-excitement, self-pity, deep grief and fear. Environmental factors such as cold, dampness/humidity, wind, dryness, and heat can also cause imbalance, as well as factors such as wrong diet, and excessive work, exercise or sexual activity. Method of diagnosis Pulse, tongue and abdominal diagnosis as the method to observe the functioning of the patients Qi is used. The pulse is like a monitor reflecting the changes taking place in the patient during the progression of the treatment. I palpate on acupuncture points and describe them in \"energetic\" terms to the client. Our joint focusing on the particular area enables channeling of the client's \"true healing intention\" to the area, which effects \"body mind integration.\" Acupuncture Central to the Traditional Chinese view of life is the concept of \"qi,\" or vital energy, which flows through our bodies via channels or meridians that are connected to our major internal organs. Imbalance and disease result when this flow of energy is deficient, stagnant or excessive. Acupuncture works by inserting hair-thin needles into specific points along these channels that balance the flow of energy and bring the body back into balance. Scientific measurements of acupuncture show an increased circulation of blood to the area being treated and an increase in the hormones called endorphins, which block pain and promote healing. In short, Acupuncture can strengthen the physical body, prevent disease, control pain, health enhancement, assist in sports performance, addiction withdrawal, and achieve longevity. Acupuncture is a complex system combining other complimentary techniques including \u00b7 Moxibustion \u00b7 Cupping \u00b7 Massage \u00b7 Herbs needling technique The needle techniques are gentle, yet effective on a deep level. Contact or touch needling, which is a noninvasive method is used for children, elderly and needle sensitive people for whom a silver needle is touched to the acupuncture points. In some treatments, an herb is burnt on the acupuncture point to deepen the treatment. This is known as Moxibustion auricular therapy Auriculotherapy (auricular therapy, ear acupuncture): Form of homuncular acupuncture developed by Dr. P.F.M. Nogier of France. Its theory depicts the auricle (the outer portion of the ear) as an upside-down fetus with points that correspond to bodily parts. Such points number more than two hundred. Ostensible diagnosis involves examining the ear for tenderness or for variations in electrical conductivity. Treatment consists in the acupuncturing of the auricular acupoint that corresponds to the anatomical site of the malady. Practitioners may base their choice of points on clinical experience, \"modern medicine,\" the site of the disease, or the TCM theories of \"Organs\" and meridians. This method is often used along the regular acupuncture treatments. it allows patients to give themselves treatments by stimulation of acupoints on the auricle (the outer portion of the ear)pressing on the ear tacks placed on the specific ear points. Some of the most common dis-eases treatable by Ear acupuncture are Addictions, stop smoking, weight control, pain relief, lower blood pressure, childbirth facilitation, calming and relaxing the nervous system, insomnia and more. Auricular magnetic therapy: involves taping magnetic balls or pellets to auricular acupoints. Auricular massage: involves pinching, pressing, or rotating all or part of the ear. Auricular moxibustion: thread incense moxibustion, a variation of direct acupoints on of the ear. SOWA RIGPA (TRADITIONAL TIBETAN MEDICINE) During our initial consultation will discuss your current state of physical and mental health, history and goals. After asking questions, checking your tongue and urine, I will explain the findings and offer a treatment plan. This includes suggestions for dietary and lifestyle adjustments, herbal and external therapeutic recommendations when appropriate. Mongolian Horm\u00e9 THERAPY Horm\u00e9, otherwise known as 'Mongolian Moxibustion', is one of the fundamental external therapies highlighted in the root text of Tibetan Medicine. It is primarily used to address imbalances in the wind humor (Tib. \"loong\") by deeply relaxing, warming, and nourishing the body and mind. This safe and simple method involves dipping small compresses filled with aromatic wind-pacifying herbs into warm oil and applying them to specific points on the body. Effective therapy to treat psychological & neurological conditions. It can be used as a standalone therapy or combined with other healing modalities such as acupuncture, cupping. Tibetan \"LA\" MASSAGE \"La\" or \"bLa\" (Tibetan ) energy is a vital protective energy that pervades and constitutes our human body. Closely connected with our consciousness, it gives strength, vigor, stability, a bright complexion, clarity, bliss, sensitivity, and satisfaction. This energy circulates in our body according to the lunar cycle. Due to chronic disease, emotional or physical trauma, and aggressive medical treatments, we can lose this energy resulting in various symptoms such as sadness, sleep disorders, decreased immunity, fatigue, or anxiety. \"La\" therapy is one of the subtle energetic treatments from the Tibetan Medical tradition used to restore lost \"La\" through the gentle touch of specific points, along with the visualization and chanting of potent seed syllables. Tibetan NEJANG YOGA Nejang is a gentle healing yoga practice consisting of twenty four simple physical exercises that open the channels, balance the internal energies, relax the mind, and nourish the inner organs. With roots in the Kalachakra tradition, such exercises have been prescribed by Tibetan physicians for centuries to improve health and vitality and to support spiritual practice. In these sessions we will practice breathing and a selection of physical exercises most suited to your condition and health goals. Shonishin(Japanese Pediatric Acupuncture) More commonly known as Japanese pediatric acupuncture (though typically no needles are used and nothing actually penetrates the skin) Shonishin literally translates as sho \"little\", ni \"children\", and shin \"needle\" Specifically used for infants and children up to the age of seven. Shonishin offers a viable alternative to pharmaceuticals in the treatment of childhood health problems-everything from behavioral and emotional to many physical conditions. It has been used in treating infants and children afflicted with a wide variety of conditions, including colic, indigestion, GERD, constipation, and diarrhea, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), allergies, asthma, eczema, hives, bedwetting, and stuttering. Shoshinin's gentle, mostly non-invasive treatment techniques involve non-inserted needles- the enshin, the teishin and the zanshin. Specific acupuncture points and meridians are rhythmically stroked, rubbed, tapped and pressed with these tools to produce a variety of gentle stimulation. Rounded tools, and rods of silver are typically used. Sometimes a press sphere-a tiny round ball-is taped in place and left for a few hours to stimulate an acupuncture point. These techniques serve to harmonize and boost a child's vital energy. The technique is most effective when given several times per week until the symptoms are alleviated. Once the primary health concern is addressed, treatments may continue on a limited protracted basis to prevent recurrence. I will administer the initial treatments then teach some of the procedures to the child's parents to perform at home (a silver teaspoon makes an ideal home-based Shonishin tool). The techniques are quickly and easily learned, allowing parents to perform daily treatments between visits. "}
