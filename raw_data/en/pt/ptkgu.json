We hope it answers your questions and helps you deal with some of the feelings you may have. There is another type of cancer that can affect the kidneys. This is called cancer of the ureter and renal pelvis or transitional cell cancer. Doctors treat it in a different way to renal cell cancer. We have separate information about this. Rarely, very young children and adults develop a type of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumour (or nephroblastoma). The children's cancer and leukaemia group (CCLG) have an information sheet about Wilms' tumour. We also have a booklet called A parent's guide to children's cancer that we can send you. How to use this booklet We've divided the booklet into parts to help you find the information you need. You can go to any section or chapter in the booklet and start reading from there. For example, if the only treatment you need is surgery it's fine to skip the other treatment sections that aren't relevant to you. Finding out you have cancer can be a very emotional time. You can find information on taking care of yourself and getting the support you need on pages 68-71.2 Understanding kidney cancer We've included some comments from people who have had kidney cancer, which you might find helpful. Quotes are from the Macmillan online community ( macmillan.org.uk/community ). Some names may have been changed. Some quotes are from Eileen, who is on the cover of this booklet. She has chosen to share her story with us. There are useful addresses and websites at the end of this booklet (see pages 95-99). There's also a page to write any notes or questions you have for your doctor or nurse (see page 100). We can't advise you about the best treatment for you. This information can only come from your own doctor, who knows your full medical history.

Cancer starts in cells in our body. Cells are tiny building blocks that make up the organs and tissues of our bodies. They divide to make new cells in a controlled way. This is how our bodies grow, heal and repair. Cells receive signals from the body telling them when to divide and grow and when to stop growing. When a cell is no longer needed or can't be repaired, it gets a signal to stop working and die. Cancer develops when the normal workings of a cell go wrong and the cell becomes abnormal. The abnormal cell keeps dividing making more and more abnormal cells. These eventually form a lump ( tumour ). Not all lumps are cancerous. Doctors can tell if a lump is cancerous by removing a small sample of tissue or cells from it. This is called a biopsy . The doctors examine the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Normal cells Cells forming a tumourKidney cancer 7 A lump that is not cancerous ( benign ) may grow but cannot spread to anywhere else in the body. It usually only causes problems if it puts pressure on nearby organs. A lump that is cancer ( malignant ) can grow into nearby tissue. Sometimes, cancer cells spread from where the cancer first started (the primary site) to other parts of the body. They can travel through the blood or lymphatic system (see page 8). When the cells reach another part of the body, they may begin to grow and form another tumour. This is called a secondary cancer or a metastasis .8 Understanding kidney cancer The lymphatic system The lymphatic system helps to protect us from infection and disease. It also drains lymph fluid from the tissues of the body before returning it to the blood. The lymphatic system is made up of fine tubes called lymphatic vessels that connect to groups of lymph nodes throughout the body. Lymph nodes (sometimes called lymph glands) are small and bean-shaped. They filter bacteria (germs) and disease from the lymph fluid. When you have an infection lymph nodes often swell as they fight the infection. Sometimes kidney cancer can spread to lymph nodes close to the kidney (see page 11).10 Understanding kidney cancer The kidneys Most people have two kidneys. They sit at the back of the body, one on each side, just underneath the ribcage. The kidneys filter the blood and remove waste products, which they convert into urine. Urine drains from each kidney, through a tube called a ureter, to the bladder. The kidneys in the body Right kidney Right ureter BladderLeft kidney Left ureterAdrenal gland Blood goes to the kidney through a blood vessel called the renal artery. Renal means 'to do with the kidney'. Thousands of tiny filters, called nephrons, filter the blood. It then goes back to the rest of the body through the renal vein. Kidney cancer 11 The kidneys also help to control the balance of fluid, salt and minerals in the body. And, they maintain blood pressure. The part of the kidney that makes urine is called the cortex. The part that collects urine is called the medulla. On top of each kidney there is a small gland called the adrenal gland, which produces hormones. The kidneys and adrenal glands are surrounded by a layer of fat, contained in a capsule of fibrous tissue. The structure of the kidneys Adrenal gland Renal arteryCapsule MedullaFat layer Kidney Cortex UreterLymph nodes Renal vein (to vena cava)12 Understanding kidney cancer About kidney cancer Each year, over 10,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with kidney cancer. It's more common in men than in women. Usually cancer only affects one kidney. It's rare for cancer to be in both kidneys. Types of kidney cancer There are different types of kidney cancer. About 90% of kidney cancers (9 out of 10) are renal cell cancers (RCC). They start in the cortex of the kidney (see diagram on page 11). There are different types of RCC. The most common type is clear cell renal cancer. Less common types are papillary renal cell cancer, chromophobe renal cell cancer and collecting duct renal cell cancer. Kidney cancer 13 Risk factors and causes The causes of kidney cancer are unknown, but research is going on to try to find out more. There are certain things that can affect the chances of developing kidney cancer. These are called risk factors. Having a risk factor doesn't necessarily mean you'll get kidney cancer. Age The risk of kidney cancer increases with age. Most people who get kidney cancer are over 60. Smoking The longer a person smokes for and the more they smoke, the greater their risk of getting kidney cancer. Risk goes down when a person stops smoking. Being overweight Studies show that being overweight increases the risk of getting kidney cancer. Medical conditions Having high blood pressure may slightly increase the risk of kidney cancer. But most people with high blood pressure don't develop kidney cancer. 14 Understanding kidney cancer People with advanced kidney disease have a higher risk of developing kidney cancer. The risk is greatest for people who need treatment to do the work of the kidneys (dialysis). Family history Most kidney cancers aren't inherited. But, your risk may be higher than average if a parent, brother, sister or child of yours has had kidney cancer. Genetic risk Some rare genetic conditions can increase the risk of developing kidney cancer. These include von Hippel-Lindau disease, hereditary papillary RCC (HPRCC) and Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome. Kidney cancers caused by an inherited gene change are more likely to happen at a younger age. They may cause several tumours, and affect both kidneys. Exposure to certain materials at work An increased risk of kidney cancer has been linked to working with blast furnaces or coke ovens in the steel and coal industries. Exposure to certain materials may also increase risk. These include cadmium, lead, asbestos and trichloroethylene (Tric), which are used in heavy engineering. Kidney cancer is not infectious and you can't pass it on to other people. Kidney cancer 15 Signs and symptoms Small kidney cancers don't usually cause symptoms. They are often diagnosed by chance. For example, when people are having tests or scans for some other reason. When kidney cancer does cause symptoms these may include: blood in the urine (this is the most common symptom) a dull pain in your side between your upper abdomen and back a high temperature, night sweats and feeling very tired losing weight for no obvious reason a lump in the tummy area, side or back. Most people with these symptoms won't have kidney cancer. They can be caused by more common conditions. But, if you have any symptoms, it's important to get them checked by your doctor. 'I had lost a lot of weight - I was fitting in clothes that were my 12-year-old's. I was actually eating just as much as before. I was very tired as well, but I was working full-time, so it was easy to put it down to that. My back had also been sore, but I thought nothing of it.' EileenDiagnosing kidney cancer How kidney cancer is diagnosed 18 Staging and grading 2318 Understanding kidney cancer How kidney cancer is diagnosed Often people are diagnosed by chance after having a scan for another reason. Some people go to see their family doctor (GP) with symptoms, such as blood in their urine. If you have blood in your urine (haematuria), your GP may refer you to a 'one-stop' haematuria clinic. At this clinic, all the tests needed to make a diagnosis can often be done at the same time. If tests or symptoms suggest you could have a kidney cancer, you should be seen by a specialist within 14 days. At the hospital You'll see a urologist or a specialist nurse who will ask you about your symptoms and general health. They'll also examine you and arrange some of the following tests. Blood tests You will have blood samples taken. These help your doctors to check how well your kidneys and liver are working. They also show the number of blood cells in your blood. This is called a blood count. Ultrasound scan This test can help to diagnose kidney cancer. It uses sound waves to build up a picture of the kidneys, ureters and bladder. It's a painless test and only takes a few minutes. Diagnosing kidney cancer 19 If your bladder is to be looked at as well, you will need to have a full bladder for the scan. The hospital will give you instructions about this. You lie on your back and the person doing the ultrasound spreads gel over your tummy (abdomen) area. They then move a small device, which produces sound waves, over your tummy. A computer turns the sound waves into a picture. Ultrasound can look for changes in the shape of the kidneys. It can help to show if a lump is a cyst (a fluid-filled lump) or a tumour. It can also show the position of a cancer and measure its size. CT (computerised tomography) scan This test is used to check the kidneys and organs in the tummy area (abdomen) and chest. A CT scan takes a series of x-rays, which build up a three-dimensional picture of the inside of the body. The scan takes 10-30 minutes and is painless. It uses a small amount of radiation, which is very unlikely to harm you and will not harm anyone you come into contact with. You will be asked not to eat or drink for at least four hours before the scan. You may be given a drink or injection of a dye, which allows particular areas to be seen more clearly. This may make you feel hot all over for a few minutes. It's important to let your doctor know if you are allergic to iodine or have asthma, because you could have a more serious reaction to the injection. You'll probably be able to go home as soon as the scan is over.20 Understanding kidney cancer MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan Some people have an MRI scan instead of, or as well as, a CT scan. This test uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body. The scanner is a powerful magnet so you may be asked to complete and sign a checklist to make sure it's safe for you. The checklist asks about any metal implants you may have, such as a pacemaker, surgical clips or bone pins. You should also tell your doctor if you've ever worked with metal or in the metal industry as very tiny fragments of metal can sometimes lodge in the body. If you do have any metal in your body, it's likely that you won't be able to have an MRI scan. In this situation, another type of scan can be used. Before the scan, you'll be asked to remove any metal belongings including jewellery. Some people are given an injection of dye into a vein in the arm, which doesn't usually cause discomfort. This is called a contrast medium and can help the images from the scan to show up more clearly. During the test, you'll lie very still on a couch inside a long cylinder (tube) for about 30 minutes. It's painless but can be slightly uncomfortable, and some people feel a bit claustrophobic. It's also noisy, but you'll be given earplugs or headphones. You can hear, and speak to, the person operating the scanner. Chest x-ray If you don't have a CT scan of the chest, you will have a chest x-ray to check the health of your lungs.Diagnosing kidney cancer 21 Guided biopsy This is done if you need to have a sample of tissue taken from the kidney (a biopsy). The doctor uses an ultrasound scanner or CT scanner to guide them to the exact area of kidney where the biopsy will be taken. The doctor injects some local anaesthetic into the skin to numb the area over the kidney. They then guide the needle through your skin into the kidney. And, they draw a small sample of tissue into the needle. The sample is then sent to the laboratory to be checked. You may need to stay in hospital for a few hours, or overnight, after this procedure. Waiting for test results Waiting for test results can be a difficult time. It may take from a few days to a couple of weeks for the results of your tests to be ready. You may find it helpful to talk with your partner, your family or a close friend. Your specialist nurse or one of the organisations listed on pages 95-97 can also provide support. You can also talk things over with one of our cancer support specialists on 0808 808 00 00 .Diagnosing kidney cancer 23 Staging and grading Staging The stage of a cancer describes its size and whether it has spread. Once your doctors know the stage of the cancer, they can plan your treatment. The most commonly used staging system for kidney cancer is the TNM system: T refers to the tumour size. N refers to whether lymph nodes are affected. M refers to whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body ( metastases ). Tumour size (T) T1 - The cancer is only in the kidney and is no larger than 7cm. T1a - The cancer is no larger than 4cm. T1b - The cancer is larger than 4cm but not larger than 7cm. T2 - The cancer is larger than 7cm and is inside the kidney. T3 - The cancer is growing into the fat around the kidney or into a major vein (the vena cava and renal vein) close to the kidney. But it is not growing beyond the outer covering of the kidney (capsule). See page 11 for an illustration of the kidney. T4 - The cancer has spread outside the capsule that surrounds the kidney. It may have grown into the adrenal gland.24 Understanding kidney cancer Lymph nodes (N) N0 - There are no cancer cells in any lymph nodes. N1 - There are cancer cells in one or more lymph nodes. If the cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes, the nodes are said to be positive. Metastases (M) M0 - The cancer has not spread to other distant parts of the body. M1 - The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the bones, lungs, liver or brain. If the cancer has spread, it's called secondary or metastatic kidney cancer. Number staging The T, N and M stages may be grouped together to give a number stage for the cancer. These range from stages 1-4. Stage 1 The cancer is 7cm or less and is inside the kidney. There is no spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. This is the same as T1 N0 M0 in the TNM system. Stage 2 The cancer is larger than 7cm and is inside the kidney. There is no spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. This is the same as T2 N0 M0 in the TNM system. Diagnosing kidney cancer 25 Stage 3 The cancer is growing into the fat around the kidney or into one of the major veins close to the kidney (the renal vein or the vena cava) but has not grown outside the capsule that surrounds the kidney. It has not spread to the lymph nodes. This is the same as T3 N0 M0 in the TNM system. Or the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes but has not grown outside the capsule around the kidney. This is the same as T1-T3 N1 M0 in the TNM system. Stage 4 The cancer has grown through the capsule that surrounds the kidney and may have grown into the adrenal gland. It may have spread to the lymph nodes. It has not spread to parts of the body far from the kidney. This is the same as T4 Any N M0 in the TNM system. Or the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body. It can be any size and may have grown through the capsule surrounding the kidney and may have grown into the adrenal gland. It may have spread to the lymph nodes. This is the same as T1-T4 Any N M1 in the TNM system. Grading Grading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope. The grade gives an idea of how the cancer may behave. The Fuhrman system is the most common grading system for kidney cancer. It ranges from 1-4; the higher the number, the more abnormal the cells look. A grade 1 cancer is usually slow-growing. It is less likely to spread than a higher grade, such as a grade 4 cancer.Treating kidney cancer Treatment overview 28 Surgery 34 Tumour ablation 46 Tumour embolisation 49 Monitoring 51 Targeted therapy 53 Immunotherapy 58 Radiotherapy 60 Research - clinical trials 6128 Understanding kidney cancer Treatment overview Your doctors will plan your treatment taking into account the size of the cancer and whether it has spread, as well as your preferences and general health. Early kidney cancer Early kidney cancer that hasn't spread outside the kidney (T1 N0 M0 or T2 N0 M0) is usually treated with surgery . If the cancer is small, the surgeon will usually only remove the part of the kidney containing the cancer. But if the cancer is larger, the whole kidney may need to be removed. This is sometimes done using keyhole surgery (see pages 36-37). In some situations, treatments that destroy the cancer cells with very high or low temperatures are used to treat small kidney cancers. This is called tumour ablation (see pages 46-48). It may be used instead of an operation. Some kidney cancers are slow growing and very unlikely to spread outside the kidney. In certain situations, people who have small kidney cancers (less than 3cm across), may not need treatment. Instead they have regular scans of their kidneys to monitor the cancer. If the cancer shows signs of growing, they can have treatment. This approach is called monitoring, watch and wait or active surveillance (see pages 51-52). Treating kidney cancer 29 Locally advanced cancer If the cancer is larger, or has spread to lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body, surgery is often the main treatment. Clinical trials are trying to find out if targeted therapy drugs (see pages 53-56) or immunotherapy (see pages 58-59) can reduce the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery. Advanced cancer (metastatic or secondary cancer) If the cancer has spread outside the kidney to other parts of the body, your surgeon may still advise you to have an operation to remove the kidney. But, surgery will usually be combined with other treatments, such as targeted therapy. Sometimes surgery is used to remove a secondary cancer, for example in the lung. This isn't common. But, it may be done if there is only one area of secondary cancer and no sign of cancer elsewhere. Targeted therapy drugs (see pages 53-56) are the main treatment for advanced kidney cancer. They are used to try to shrink the cancer and control symptoms. Some advanced kidney cancers that are low-grade may grow very slowly. In this situation and if the cancer isn't causing symptoms, your specialist may suggest monitoring with scans for a time before starting treatment. Occasionally radiotherapy (see page 60) is used to relieve symptoms caused by advanced kidney cancer. Our booklet Coping with advanced cancer has more information about symptom control and who can help.30 Understanding kidney cancer How treatment is planned In most hospitals, a team of specialists will meet to discuss and agree on the plan of treatment they feel is best for your situation. This multidisciplinary team (MDT) normally includes: a urologist - a surgeon who specialises in treating kidney cancers an oncologist - a specialist in cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy drugs and radiotherapy. a urology nurse specialist - gives information and support a radiologist - helps to analyse scans and x-rays a pathologist - advises on the type and extent of the cancer. It may also include other healthcare professionals, such as a palliative care doctor or nurse who specialises in symptom control, dietitian, physiotherapist, occupational therapist (OT), psychologist or counsellor. Treatment decisions Your doctor or nurse specialist will talk with you about the best treatment for your particular situation. Or they may offer you a choice of treatments. If you have to decide between treatments, make sure that you have enough information to help you decide. You may want to ask what each treatment involves and about possible side effects. If you have questions about your treatment, don't be afraid to ask your doctor or the nurse looking after you.Treating kidney cancer 31 You can make a list of your questions. There is space on page 100 where you can do this. You may want to take a relative or close friend with you to help you remember what is discussed. You can always ask for more time if you feel that you can't make a decision when your treatment is first explained to you. The benefits and disadvantages of treatment Many people are frightened at the idea of having cancer treatments, particularly because of the side effects that can occur. However, these can usually be controlled with medicines. Treatment can be given for different reasons and the potential benefits will vary depending upon your individual situation. If you have been offered treatment that aims to cure the cancer, it may be easy to decide whether to accept the treatment. However, if a cure is not possible or less likely it may be more difficult to decide whether to go ahead. Making decisions about treatment in these circumstances is always difficult. You may need to talk in detail with your doctor about whether you wish to have treatment. If you choose not to, you can still be given supportive (palliative) care , with medicines to control any symptoms.32 Understanding kidney cancer Giving your consent Before you have any treatment, your doctor will explain its aims. They will usually ask you to sign a form saying that you give permission (consent) for the hospital staff to give you the treatment. No medical treatment can be given without your consent, and before you are asked to sign the form you should be given full information about: the type and extent of the treatment its advantages and disadvantages any significant risks or side effects any other treatments that may be available. If you don't understand what you've been told, let the staff know straight away, so they can explain again. Some cancer treatments are complex, so it's not unusual to need repeated explanations. People sometimes feel that hospital staff are too busy to answer their questions, but it's important for you to know how the treatment is likely to affect you. The staff should be willing to make time for your questions. Second opinion Your MDT uses national treatment guidelines to decide the most suitable treatment for you. Even so, you may want another medical opinion. If you feel it will be helpful, you can ask your specialist or GP to refer you to another specialist for a second opinion. Getting a second opinion may delay the start of your treatment, so you and your doctor need to be confident that it will give you useful information. 34 Understanding kidney cancer Surgery Surgery may be the only treatment you need. The type of operation you have will depend on the stage of the cancer and on your general health. It's important to talk over the operation with your surgeon and specialist nurse before you have it. Removing part of the kidney (kidney -sparing surgery) This is the most common operation for cancers that are smaller than 4cm. But it may sometimes be done with larger cancers. The surgeon removes only the part of the kidney containing the cancer. This is called a partial nephrectomy or kidney-sparing surgery. The aim is to remove the cancer. And to leave you with as much normal kidney tissue as possible so the kidney can still work. Kidney-sparing surgery may also be done if it's important to try to keep the affected kidney. For example, if you have only one working kidney or have kidney disease. If you have an inherited type of kidney cancer, you may be offered this operation. This is because there is a risk you could develop a cancer in your other kidney.Treating kidney cancer 35 Removing the whole kidney (nephrectomy) This is when the surgeon removes the whole kidney and some surrounding tissue. Your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes close to the kidney to check them for cancer cells. You can live a normal life with just one kidney. It will do the work usually shared by both kidneys. Removing a kidney is a big operation. You will need to be reasonably fit. This type of surgery isn't suitable for everyone. If there is cancer in one of the large blood vessels leaving the kidney, it may be possible to have an operation to remove it. But this is a more complex operation. You will need to go to a specialist unit to have it done. Removing the kidney when the cancer has spread If the cancer has already spread to other places in the body, removing the kidney won't usually cure the cancer. But it may help other treatments work better and reduce cancer symptoms. You need to consider the possible advantages of having the kidney removed as well as the effects of having a big operation. Your doctors can talk over the possible benefits and disadvantages with you.36 Understanding kidney cancer Open, laparoscopic and robotic surgery There are different ways a surgeon can operate on the kidney. For open surgery , the surgeon makes one large cut (incision), up to 30cm long, just under the bottom rib or between the two bottom ribs. After the operation, the surgeon stitches or staples the wound closed. Side view of the abdomen showing scar after open surgery Scar after open surgery Laparoscopic surgery is also sometimes called keyhole surgery. The surgeon makes 2-3 small cuts and one larger cut. They use a laparoscope to see and work inside the tummy (abdomen).Treating kidney cancer 37 The laparoscope is a thin tube with a light and a camera that sends video images to a TV monitor. The surgeon puts the laparoscope into the abdomen through a small cut in the skin. A larger cut is usually made close to the belly button and is used to remove the kidney. The position of the cuts may vary from person to person. Your surgeon can advise you on this. The surgeon may use a specialised machine to help with keyhole surgery. Instruments attached to the machine are controlled by the surgeon. This is called robotic surgery . It makes it possible for the surgeon to carry out very precise surgery. Laparoscopic surgery leaves a small wound so recovery is quicker than with open surgery. Example of scars after laparoscopic surgery 'They told me I needed surgery. I knew it would be a hard surgery as the lump was near major blood vessels.' EileenTreating kidney cancer 39 Surgery to remove a secondary cancer Rarely, an operation may be done to remove a secondary cancer in another part of the body. This is very specialised surgery. It's generally only possible if the cancer has spread to a limited area - usually just to one place in the body. It's also important that you're fit enough to cope with the operation. Removing a secondary cancer may help to control the cancer for longer. Occasionally, it may be used to try to cure the cancer. Before your operation If you smoke, try to give up or cut down before your operation. This will help reduce your risk of chest problems, such as a chest infection. It will also help your wound to heal after the operation. Your GP can give you advice and support to give up smoking. You may find it helpful to read our booklet Giving up smoking . You will go to a pre-assessment clinic for tests to check you're fit for the operation. These may include blood tests, a blood pressure check and a recording of your heart (ECG). You'll meet a member of the surgical team to discuss the operation. This is a good time to ask questions or to talk over any concerns you may have about the operation. If you think you may need help when you go home after your surgery, for example because you live alone or care for someone else, bring this up as soon as possible. It will help the staff make arrangements in plenty of time. 40 Understanding kidney cancer Some hospitals follow an enhanced recovery programme. This aims to reduce the time you spend in hospital and speed up your recovery. It involves you more in your own care. For example, you'll be given information about diet and exercise before surgery. You may also be given supplement drinks to take. The hospital will make sure any arrangements needed for you to go home are organised for you. You usually go into hospital on the morning of the operation. You will wear elastic stockings (TED stockings) during and after the operation. These help prevent blood clots in your legs. After your operation Back in the ward After your operation, you'll be given fluids into a vein in your hand or arm. This is called a drip or an intravenous infusion. Once you're eating and drinking normally again, it's taken out. You'll usually have a tube (catheter) put in during the operation to drain urine from your bladder. This can be taken out a few hours after surgery. But in some people it may need to stay in for longer. You may have a fine tube in the wound draining fluid and blood into a small bottle. A nurse will take it out after a few days. Feeling sick (nausea) Some people feel a bit sick for the first 24 hours after the operation. The nurse will give you anti-sickness injections or drugs to help control any sickness. If you still feel sick, tell the nurse looking after you.Treating kidney cancer 41 Pain You'll have some pain and discomfort after your operation, but this can be controlled with painkillers. For the first day or two after your operation you will usually have either: A pump attached to a needle in your arm. It gives painkillers into your bloodstream. You control the amount by pressing a button. This is called patient controlled analgesia (PCA). or An epidural. It gives painkillers directly into the spinal nerve system through a fine plastic tube in your back. Before you go home, your pain will be controlled by tablets. You'll be given a prescription for painkillers you can take at home as needed. You may still have some aches and twinges close to the scar for several weeks after surgery. Moving around Moving around helps you recover more quickly. And it reduces the risk of complications. The nurses will encourage you to get up fairly soon after your operation. The ward staff will help you with this. And, you may need some help to wash and go to the toilet. Once you are moving about more freely, you'll be able to do more for yourself. Doing leg and breathing exercises can also help reduce the risk of chest infections and blood clots. Your nurse or physiotherapist will teach you these exercises. 42 Understanding kidney cancer You may be given a drug that helps prevent blood clots. This is called an anti -coagulant. A nurse will inject it under your skin, usually in your tummy (abdomen). Wound care The wound is closed using clips or stitches. These are removed 10 days after the operation. This can be done by a practice nurse at your GP surgery. After laparoscopic surgery, you may have dissolving stitches that don't need to be removed. They dissolve when the area is healed. It's important to let your nurse or doctor know straight away if your wound becomes hot, painful or begins to bleed or leak any fluids. 'After surgery you will have to take things slowly and easily to build up your strength. This is doable and you will do it and get through it. I was 61 when I had my operation and I know of others who are older, as well as younger, who have come through this.' ChristineTreating kidney cancer 43 Possible complications of surgery The most common complications after surgery are a wound infection, bleeding, a chest infection or a blood clot. The nurses will monitor you for these. Let them know straight away if you feel unwell, have any bleeding, or notice swelling and redness in a limb. You should also tell them if you have symptoms of an infection, such as a cough or discharge from your wound. After open surgery to the kidney, some people develop a bulge along their scar. Doctors call this an incisional hernia. It can happen because of weakness in the muscles around the scar. Going home How long you stay in hospital depends on the type of operation you have and how quickly you recover. After laparoscopic surgery, most people are home within 2-5 days. After an open operation, most people are home within 5-7 days. It's common to feel more tired than usual for about six weeks after the operation. Most people feel fully recovered after about 12 weeks. Your surgeon or nurse can tell you when you'll be able to get back to doing everyday activities, like shopping, gardening, driving, having sex, playing sport or going to work. 44 Understanding kidney cancer Before you leave hospital, you'll be given an appointment to attend an outpatient clinic for a check-up. This will usually be about six weeks after your operation. The appointment is a good time to talk over any problems you may have after your operation. If surgery is the only treatment you need, go to pages 66-71 to read about follow-up and looking after yourself after kidney cancer. 'It's always good to get things checked to put your mind at rest. I had open surgery and had some strange aches and discomfort. I was told this was due to nerve damage, as with open surgery they do cut through nerves as well as everything else. I still get the odd strange sensation.' Christine'The doctors, nurses and surgeon were all brilliant. But the recovery was harder than I thought it would be.' Eileen46 Understanding kidney cancer Tumour ablation Tumour ablation means destroying the tumour (cancer). It is sometimes used to treat cancers smaller than 4cm (T1a N0 M0), instead of an operation. This treatment may be used if you have a small tumour, but aren't fit enough to have surgery or choose not to have it. Tumour ablation preserves more of the kidney than kidney -sparing surgery. So it may be used for people who have only one kidney. It can also be an option for people who have an inherited form of kidney cancer that causes multiple tumours or if cancer is affecting both kidneys. Tumour ablation generally causes fewer side effects and has a quicker recovery time than standard operations for kidney cancer. But, there is a slightly higher risk of some cancer remaining in the kidney. The benefits of avoiding surgery and sparing more of the kidney need to be balanced against this risk. Your kidney cancer specialist will talk this through with you if you are offered this treatment. There are different methods for destroying the tumour. The two most commonly used treatments are: radiofrequency ablation (RFA) - uses high temperatures to destroy the tumour cryotherapy - uses freezing temperatures to destroy the tumour.Treating kidney cancer 47 Other methods of tumour ablation may be used in clinical trials. These include: microwave ablation, laser ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). How tumour ablation is done The doctor or nurse will give you a sedative drug before the treatment. This will make you feel drowsy. They will also use a local anaesthetic to numb the area over the kidney. Some people may have the treatment under a general anaesthetic. The doctor places one or more fine probes through the skin into the centre of the tumour. They use live images from an ultrasound scanner or CT scanner to guide them to the area of the kidney that needs treatment. The probes then heat or freeze the tumour. The extreme temperature destroys the cancer cells. The doctor will also aim to destroy a small area of healthy tissue (about 1cm) around the tumour. This is to try to make sure no cancer cells are left behind to grow back again. Possible complications of tumour ablation include infection and bleeding. Rarely, it may cause a small hole in the bowel or a blockage in the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder (ureter). You will have a scan after treatment to check for any complications. These can be treated straight away if needed. 48 Understanding kidney cancer You usually stay in bed for 4-6 hours after the treatment. You may need to take painkillers for a few days. Sometimes people feel sick immediately after tumour ablation. If this happens, tell your nurse or doctor. They can give you anti -sickness drugs. Most people go home the day after treatment and feel well enough to go back to their usual activities within a few days. You will have regular follow-up scans to check the kidney for any signs of the cancer growing back. 'I went through cryoablation surgery for kidney cancer two years ago and I am doing great. No sign of tumour growing.' MaryTreating kidney cancer 49 Tumour embolisation Tumour embolisation blocks the blood supply to the tumour. It can shrink the tumour and help control symptoms, such as bleeding. You may be offered tumour embolisation if an operation isn't possible because of your general health. A doctor puts a thin, plastic tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in your groin. Then, using x-ray pictures as a guide, they thread the catheter upwards until the tip is in the artery that carries blood to the kidney. The doctor injects a substance through the catheter into the kidney. This blocks the blood supply to the kidney and cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tumour. This treatment can sometimes cause pain in the back and a high temperature, so you may need to stay in hospital for a few days.Treating kidney cancer 51 Monitoring Kidney cancers vary a great deal in how fast- or slow-growing they are. Some low-grade kidney cancers grow very slowly. Monitoring is an option for some people with very small (less than 3cm) low-grade kidney cancers. It is a way of delaying treatment until it is definitely needed. It's most likely to be offered to people who already have health problems which would increase the risks of surgery. Because the cancer is slow-growing it may not cause them any problems in their lifetime. Some people who have kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body but who don't have symptoms may be offered monitoring before starting targeted therapy. The main advantage of monitoring is that you won't experience the risks or side effects of treatment unless it is absolutely necessary. If the size of the tumour or your symptoms change during monitoring, your specialist will tell you when it is time to think about active treatment. You will need to have a biopsy (see page 21) taken from the tumour in your kidney before the doctors can decide if monitoring is appropriate for you. This is to check that the tumour is low-grade and so is likely to grow very slowly. During monitoring you will have regular ultrasound, CT or MRI scans to check the tumour in your kidney. The scans will look for signs that the tumour is growing. 52 Understanding kidney cancer Before deciding whether monitoring is right for you, make sure you understand why it is recommended. If you have any concerns, talk to your doctor. Although monitoring can be difficult to adjust to at first, many people find it gets easier as time goes on. Sharing your feelings can help. As well as talking with family and friends, you may want to keep a journal, or to join a support group or the kidney cancer group of our online community (see page 93). 'I have joined an online group of fellow patients and it great to chat to them. We all met for lunch on Wednesday for the first time and it was brilliant. It really helps to be able to talk to others who understand just how you feel. It helped me tremendously.' MaryTreating kidney cancer 53 Targeted therapy Targeted therapy drugs are the main treatment for kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (advanced kidney cancer). The aim of treatment is to control the cancer for as long as possible. Targeted therapies for kidney cancer interfere with signals that tell cancer cells to grow. They also stop the cancer from making the new blood vessels, which it needs to grow. Most targeted therapies for kidney cancer are taken as tablets but some are given into a vein (intravenously). You usually have the treatment as an outpatient. Most people are given either sunitinib (Sutent \u00ae) or pazopanib (Votrient\u00ae) as their first treatment. Both drugs are taken as tablets. You usually take sunitinib daily for four weeks. This is followed by a two week rest period off the drug. This makes up a six-week period called a treatment cycle. At the end of six weeks, the next cycle of treatment begins. You usually take tablets for four weeks and then have two weeks off. Pazopanib is usually taken once a day and is also given in treatment cycles.54 Understanding kidney cancer Other targeted therapy drugs that may be used to treat advanced kidney cancer include: axitinib (Inlyta\u00ae) - given as a tablet everolimus (Afinitor\u00ae) - given as a tablet sorafenib (Nexavar\u00ae) - given as a tablet temsirolimus (Torisel\u00ae) - given into a vein (intravenously) as an infusion bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae) - given into a vein as an infusion. You have it in combination with a drug called interferon alpha (see page 58) which helps your immune system to fight the cancer. You will usually continue with a targeted therapy drug for as long as it is keeping the tumour under control. You will have CT scans from time to time to check this. Some people may need to stop treatment with a targeted therapy if they have very troublesome side effects. 'I have had side effects with the pazopanib. These included nausea, diarrhoea, tiredness, blood pressure went sky high for a little while, now being treated with BP meds, and also hair is now snow white. All in all side effects have been bearable.' AngelaTreating kidney cancer 55 Side effects of targeted therapies Each type of targeted therapy drug has its own side effects. The most common side effects include: tiredness diarrhoea skin rashes sore hands and feet sore mouth high blood pressure changes in how the thyroid gland works. Your cancer doctor or cancer nurse specialist will give you information about the likely side effects of your treatment. They will also tell you what can be done to control and manage side effects. Targeted therapies can interact with some prescribed medicines. You should always get your GP or hospital doctor to check before you start treatment. Let your doctor and specialist nurse know if you are having problems so that they can give you help and advice. We have information about individual targeted therapy drugs, how they are given and their side effects. 56 Understanding kidney cancer All the targeted therapy drugs we've listed are licensed to treat kidney cancer and can be used in the UK. But, not all of them are widely available through the NHS. Some people have targeted therapy as part of a clinical trial (see pages 61-63). Sunitinib and pazopanib are approved for use in the NHS as possible first drug treatments for kidney cancer. Axitinib is approved as a treatment that can be taken if the first targeted therapy drug isn't working. This is called second-line treatment. In Scotland, everolimus has also been approved as a second-line treatment or can be used as a third-line treatment after axitinib. If a drug isn't routinely available through the NHS, your specialist may apply to the health board for individual funding for a drug. If you live in England, some new drugs are available through the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF). For example, everolimus is available through the CDF for people who have had one previous targeted therapy drug. We have more information on what you can do if a treatment isn't available. Your specialist will tell you if they think any of these drugs are suitable for you. There are several clinical trials looking into the most effective ways of using targeted therapies to treat kidney cancer. You can read about clinical trials on pages 61-63.58 Understanding kidney cancer Immunotherapy Immunotherapy drugs encourage the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. These treatments are occasionally used to treat advanced kidney cancer. There are many clinical trials looking at new immunotherapy drugs that may be useful in future in treating kidney cancer. Interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A\u00ae) Interferon can be used to treat advanced kidney cancer and is sometimes given along with bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae). Interferon is naturally produced by the body in small amounts and can also be made as a drug. It has effects on the body's immune system that can help fight some cancers. Interferon is usually given three times a week by injection under the skin (subcutaneously). You, a relative or carer can be taught how to do this at home. In the first couple of weeks, interferon often causes flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, headaches, and aching in the back, joints and muscles. Your doctor can prescribe medicine, such as paracetamol, to reduce these symptoms. Another common side effect of interferon is feeling very tired (fatigue).Treating kidney cancer 59 Aldesleukin (interleukin-2, Proleukin\u00ae) Aldesleukin is an artificial version of a protein that occurs naturally in the body. You have it as a drip into a vein (intravenously). This treatment is very specialised and only given in a few units in the UK. You'll need to stay in hospital to have it. Common side effects of aldesleukin are flu-like symptoms, feeling sick or losing your appetite. It may also cause some serious side effects on the heart and lungs, so people having aldesleukin are closely monitored. We can send you more detailed information about these drugs.60 Understanding kidney cancer Radiotherapy Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy x-rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It's mostly used to relieve symptoms of kidney cancer that has spread to the brain or the bones. We have more information about secondary bone cancer and secondary brain cancer that we can send you. The treatment is given in the hospital radiotherapy department. You usually have it as an outpatient. Radiotherapy is often given as sessions called fractions . When used to relieve symptoms, it's usually given for a few minutes every day for a few days. Your doctor will explain the treatment plan with you. After the radiographer has positioned you for radiotherapy, they will leave you for a few minutes while you have your treatment. They will be able to see you while this is happening and you can talk to them through an intercom. Side effects of radiotherapy Radiotherapy can cause tiredness. Other side effects depend on the part of the body being treated. But these are usually mild when radiotherapy is given to relieve symptoms. The doctor who plans your radiotherapy (clinical oncologist) or a specialist nurse will tell you what to expect. Usually side effects go away gradually once your course of treatment is over. You should let your doctor know if they continue. Treating kidney cancer 61 Research - clinical trials Cancer research trials are carried out to try to find new and better treatments for cancer. Trials that are carried out on patients are known as clinical trials. These may be carried out to: test new treatments, such as new chemotherapy drugs or targeted therapies look at new combinations of existing treatments, or change the way they are given to make them more effective or reduce side effects compare the effectiveness of drugs used to control symptoms find out how cancer treatments work find out which treatments are the most cost-effective. Trials are the only reliable way to find out if a different type of surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiotherapy, or other treatment is better than what is already available.62 Understanding kidney cancer Taking part in a trial You may be asked to take part in a treatment research trial. There can be many benefits in doing this. Trials help to improve knowledge about cancer and develop new treatments. You will be carefully monitored during and after the study. Usually, several hospitals around the country take part in these trials. It's important to bear in mind that some treatments that look promising at first are often later found not to be as good as existing treatments or to have side effects that outweigh the benefits. If you decide not to take part in a trial, your decision will be respected and you don't have to give a reason. However, it can help to let the staff know your concerns so that they can give you the best advice. There will be no change in the way that you're treated by the hospital staff, and you'll be offered the standard treatment for your situation. Clinical trials are described in more detail in our booklet Understanding cancer research trials (clinical trials) . We can send you a free copy.Treating kidney cancer 63 Blood and tumour samples Blood and tumour samples may be taken to help make the right diagnosis. You may be asked for your permission to use some of your samples for research into cancer. If you take part in a trial you may also give other samples, which may be frozen and stored for future use when new research techniques become available. Your name will be removed from the samples so you can't be identified. The research may be carried out at the hospital where you are treated, or at another one. This type of research takes a long time, and results may not be available for many years. The samples will be used to increase knowledge about the causes of cancer and its treatment, which will hopefully improve the outlook for future patients. af ter your treatmen T After treatment 66 Taking care of yourself 6866 Understanding kidney cancer After treatment After treatment you'll probably be keen to get back to doing the things you did before your cancer diagnosis. But you may still be coping with the side effects of treatment and with some difficult emotions (see pages 74-77). Recovery takes time, so be kind to yourself. Follow-up You'll have regular check-ups at the hospital. Your doctor or specialist nurse will tell you how often and for how long you'll need to have these. It will depend on the type of treatment you had and the risk of the cancer coming back. Some people will have regular tests to check for any signs of the cancer coming back. If cancer comes back in the kidney, it may be possible to have further surgery to remove it. If you have any problems, or notice any new symptoms between follow-up appointments, let your doctor know as soon as possible. After surgery to remove kidney cancer, many people find they worry about the cancer coming back. This is natural and it may help to get support from family, friends or one of the organisations listed on pages 95-99. Most people find the anxiety gets less as time passes. Our booklet Worrying about cancer coming back has helpful information.Our booklet Life after cancer treatment discusses how to adjust to life after treatment.68 Understanding kidney cancer Taking care of yourself Making healthy choices After cancer treatment some people choose to make some positive lifestyle changes. It's not to say you didn't follow a healthy lifestyle before cancer, but you may be more focused on making the most of your health. We've included information here that may help you. This is general advice. If you have health problems, such as kidney disease, it's important to check with your doctor before making any changes to your lifestyle or diet. If you've had part or all of a kidney removed, it's a good idea to look after your remaining kidney(s). Reducing your risk of high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes will help to protect your kidney. Stop smoking If you're a smoker, giving up smoking is the healthiest decision you can make. Smoking is a major risk factor for smoking-related cancers, including kidney cancer, and for high blood pressure and heart disease. Our leaflet Giving up smoking has more information and tips to help you quit.After your treatment 69 Keep to a healthy weight If you feel you need to lose weight, ask your GP for advice. They can also tell you what the ideal weight for your height is. Keeping to a healthy weight reduces the risk of cancer, heart and kidney problems and illnesses, such as diabetes. If you feel you need to lose weight, here are some tips to help you: only eat as much food as you need eat a balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables eat less fat and sugar be more physically active. If you are following a weight loss diet, avoid high protein diets, such as the Atkins' diet, as they can stress the kidney. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids. Get physically active Being physically active helps to keep your weight healthy and can reduce stress and tiredness. It also reduces the risk of other health conditions. It's important to avoid injury to your kidney. Taking part in contact sports, such as rugby and football and sports such as skydiving, is usually best avoided. Our booklet Weight management after cancer treatment has some helpful tips. We have a booklet called Physical activity and cancer treatment , which has more information.70 Understanding kidney cancer Reducing stress Think about ways to reduce the stress in your life. You could make time to do things that you enjoy or that make you laugh. Some people find it relaxing to meditate or to start a new pastime or an evening class. You may find it helpful to write a journal or online blog. Eat healthily Eating healthily will give you more energy and help you to recover. Try to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (five portions a day), and less red meat. Cut down on salt as it can raise blood pressure and make the kidney have to work harder. Follow any advice you have been given by a dietitian. Drink plenty of water Drink at least 2 litres (3 pints) of fluid a day. This will help protect your kidney. Plain water is best. Avoid bottled waters that are high in salts, such as sodium or potassium, as they make the kidney work harder. Stick to sensible drinking guidelines These recommend that men drink no more than three units of alcohol a day (or 21 a week) and women no more than two units a day (or 14 a week). It's a good idea to have a few alcohol-free days each week. Medicines and supplements Some painkillers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can damage the kidney. Ask your doctor for advice before taking over-the-counter medicines or buying vitamin or mineral supplements. We have a booklet Healthy eating and cancer that we can send you.After your treatment 71 Get your blood pressure checked regularly High blood pressure doesn't always cause any symptoms but it can be bad for the kidneys. It's important to have your blood pressure checked regularly. If it is raised, your doctor can prescribe tablets to control it. Urine infections Urine infections can usually be easily treated, but if they are ignored they can cause kidney problems. If you have symptoms of a urine infection, it's important to see your GP. Possible symptoms can include smelly or cloudy urine, pain or burning when passing urine or feeling you have to go urgently as soon as you notice you need to pass urine.your feelings and relationships Your feelings 74 If you are a relative or friend 79 Talking to children 8174 Understanding kidney cancer Your feelings It's common to feel overwhelmed by different feelings when you're told that you have cancer. We talk about some of these here. Partners, family and friends may also have some of the same feelings. You might have different reactions to the ones we describe here. There is no right or wrong way to feel. You'll cope with things in your own way. Talking to people close to you or other people affected by cancer can often help. Shock and disbelief You may find it hard to believe it when your doctor tells you that you have cancer. It's common to feel shocked and numb. You may not be able to take in much information and find that you keep asking the same questions again and again. At first, you might find it hard to talk to family and friends about the cancer. This usually gets easier as the shock wears off and it becomes more real to you. You may find you can't think or talk about anything but the cancer. This is because your mind is trying to process what you're going through. 'It may help to have a talk with your GP about seeking some counselling support. It doesn't change what's happened, but can help with the anxious feelings.' ChristineYour feelings and relationships 75 Fear and anxiety People can be very anxious or frightened about whether treatment will work and what will happen in the future. This uncertainty can be one of the hardest things to cope with. It can help to try to focus on what you can control. You may want to find out more about the cancer, its treatment and how to manage side effects. It can also help to talk about your feelings and to take time to do things that are important to you and that you enjoy. Doctors often know roughly how many people can benefit from a type of treatment. But they can't be sure what will happen to an individual person. Although they may not be able to answer your questions fully, they can usually talk through any problems with you and give you some guidance. Avoidance Some people cope by not wanting to know very much about the cancer and by not talking about it. If you feel like this, let your family and friends know that you don't want to talk about it right now. You can also tell your doctor if there are things you don't want to know or talk about yet. Occasionally, this avoidance can be extreme. Some people may not believe that they have cancer. This is sometimes called being in denial. It may stop them making decisions about treatment. If this happens, it's very important for them to get help from their doctor.76 Understanding kidney cancer Sometimes, avoidance is the other way around. Family and friends may seem to avoid you and the fact that you have cancer. They may not want to talk about it or they might change the subject. This is usually because they are also finding the cancer difficult to cope with, and they may need support too. Try to let them know how this makes you feel and that talking openly with them about your illness will help you. Anger You may feel angry about your illness and sometimes resent other people for being well. These are normal reactions, especially when you feel frightened, stressed, out of control or unwell. You may get angry with the people close to you. Let them know that you are angry at your illness and not at them. Finding ways to help you relax and reduce stress can help with anger. This can include talking about or writing down how you feel, gentle exercise, breathing or relaxation therapy, yoga or meditation. Guilt and blame Some people feel guilty or blame themselves or others for the cancer. You may try to find reasons for why it has happened to you. Most of the time, it's impossible to know exactly what has caused a person's cancer. Over time, several different factors may act together to cause a cancer. Doctors don't fully understand all of these factors yet. Instead, try to focus on looking after yourself and getting the help and support you need.Your feelings and relationships 77 Feeling alone Some people feel alone because they don't have enough support. Family and friends may live far away, have other commitments or feel uncomfortable because of their own fears about cancer. Try to let your family and friends know how you feel and how they could support you more. If you need more support, you can call the Macmillan Support Line free on 0808 808 00 00 and talk to one of our cancer support specialists. Our website can help you find out about local support groups - visit macmillan.org.uk/supportgroups You can also talk to other people going through the same thing on our online community at macmillan.org.uk/community It's normal to have times when you want to be left alone to sort out your feelings. But if you find you're avoiding people a lot of the time, then try to talk to your doctor or nurse. If you need more help These feelings can be very difficult to cope with and sometimes people need more help. This happens to lots of people and doesn't mean you're not coping. If you feel anxious, panicky or sad a lot of the time, or think you may be depressed, talk to your doctor or nurse. They can refer you to a doctor or counsellor who can help. They may also prescribe medicine to help with anxiety or an antidepressant drug. Our booklet How are you feeling? The emotional effects of cancer discusses the feelings you may have in more detail, and has suggestions for coping with them.Your feelings and relationships 79 If you are a relative or friend Some people find it hard to talk about cancer or share their feelings. You might think it's best to pretend everything is fine, and carry on as normal. You might not want to worry the person with cancer, or you might feel you're letting them down if you admit to being afraid. Unfortunately, denying strong emotions can make it even harder to talk, and may lead to the person with cancer feeling very isolated. Partners, relatives and friends can help by listening carefully to what the person with cancer wants to say. It may be best not to rush into talking about the illness. Often it's enough just to listen and let the person with cancer talk when they are ready. You may find some of the courses on our Learn Zone website helpful. There are courses to help with listening and talking, to help friends and family support their loved ones affected by cancer. Visit macmillan.org.uk/learnzone to find out more. If you're looking after a family member or friend with cancer, you may find our booklet Looking after someone with cancer helpful. It's based on carers' experiences and has lots of practical tips and information. We have more information about supporting someone with cancer at macmillan.org.uk/carersOur booklet Lost for words - how to talk to someone with cancer has more suggestions if you have a friend or relative with cancer.Your feelings and relationships 81 Talking to children Deciding what to tell your children or grandchildren about your cancer is difficult. An open, honest approach is usually best. Even very young children can sense when something is wrong, and their fears can sometimes be worse than the reality. How much you tell your children will depend on their age and how mature they are. It may be best to start by giving only small amounts of information and gradually tell them more to build up a picture of your illness. Teenagers Teenagers can have an especially hard time. At a stage when they want more freedom, they may be asked to take on new responsibilities and they may feel over-burdened. It's important that they can go on with their normal lives as much as possible and still get the support they need. If they find it hard to talk to you, you could encourage them to talk to someone close who can support and listen to them, such as a grandparent, family friend, teacher or counsellor. They may also find it useful to look at the website riprap.org.uk which has been developed especially for teenagers who have a parent with cancer. There's also a video on our website that may help. Visit macmillan.org.uk/talkingtochildren Our booklet Talking to children when an adult has cancer includes discussion about sensitive topics.Wor K and financial suppor T Work 84 Financial help and benefits 8584 Understanding kidney cancer Work You may need to take time off work during your treatment and for a while afterwards. It can be hard to judge the best time to go back to work, and this will depend mainly on the type of work you do and how much your income is affected. It's important to do what's right for you. Getting back into your normal routine can be very helpful, and you may want to go back to work as soon as possible. It can be helpful to talk to your employer about the situation - it may be possible for you to work part-time or job share. On the other hand, it can take a long time to recover fully from cancer treatment, and it may be many months before you feel ready to return to work. It's important not to take on too much, too soon. Your consultant, GP or specialist nurse can help you decide when and if you should go back to work. Employment rights The Equality Act 2010 protects anyone who has, or has had, cancer. Even if a person who had cancer in the past has been successfully treated and is now cured, they are still covered by the act. This means their employer must not discriminate against them for any reason, including their past cancer. The Disability Discrimination Act protects people in Northern Ireland. Our booklets Work and cancer , Working while caring for someone with cancer and Self-employment and cancer have more information that may be helpful. There's also lots more information at macmillan.org.uk/workWork and financial support 85 Financial help and benefits If you are struggling to cope with the financial effects of cancer, help is available. If you cannot work because you are ill, you may be able to get Statutory Sick Pay . Your employer will pay this for up to 28 weeks of sickness. If you qualify for it, they cannot pay you less. Before your Statutory Sick Pay ends, or if you do not qualify for it, check whether you can get Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) . This benefit is for people who cannot work because they are ill or disabled. There are two different types of ESA: contributory - you can get this if you have made enough national insurance contributions income-related - you can get this if your income and savings are below a certain level. Since October 2013, a new benefit called Universal Credit has started replacing income-related ESA in England, Scotland and Wales. This benefit is for people who are looking for work or on a low income. Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a new benefit for people under 65 who find it difficult to walk or look after themselves (or both). You must have had these difficulties for at least three months, and they should be expected to last for the next nine months. Since April 2013, PIP has started to replace a similar older benefit called Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in England, Scotland and Wales.86 Understanding kidney cancer Attendance Allowance (AA) is for people aged 65 or over who find it difficult to look after themselves. You may qualify if you need help with things like getting out of bed, having a bath or dressing yourself. You don't need to have a carer, but you must have needed care for at least six months. If you are terminally ill, you can apply for PIP, DLA or AA under the 'special rules'. This means your claim will be dealt with quickly and you will get the benefit you applied for at the highest rate. Help for carers Carers Allowance is a weekly benefit that helps people who look after someone with a lot of care needs. If you don't qualify for it, you can apply for Carer's Credit . This helps you to build up qualifying years for a State Pension. More information The benefits system can be hard to understand, so it's a good idea to talk to an experienced welfare rights adviser. You can speak to one by calling the Macmillan Support Line on 0808 808 00 00 . We've just listed some benefits here, but there may be others you can get. You can find out about state benefits and apply for them online at gov.uk (England, Wales and Scotland) and nidirect.gov.uk (Northern Ireland). These websites have information about financial support, your rights, employment and independent living. You can also get information about these issues from the relevant Department for Work and Pensions helplines (see page 99) or Citizens Advice (see page 98). In Northern Ireland, you can call the Benefit Enquiry Line Northern Ireland on 0800 220 674 .Our booklet Help with the cost of cancer has more detailed information. Work and financial support 87 Insurance People who have, or have had, cancer may find it hard to get certain types of insurance, including life and travel insurance. A financial adviser can help you look at your needs and find the best deal for you. You can find a financial adviser by contacting one of the organisations on page 99. Our booklets Insurance and Getting travel insurance may also be helpful.Attendance Allowance (AA) is for people aged 65 or over who find it difficult to look after themselves.
