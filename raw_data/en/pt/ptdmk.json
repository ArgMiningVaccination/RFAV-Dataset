I think about your learning just as I think about my own: it has to be a relevant growth experience. That is why it's important to me that I become personally invested in you. We work together to reach your goal and we will get there. I value your time. When class starts, we hit the ground running and make the most of our time together with hands-on blending, informative lectures, awesome discussions, multimedia presentations, individual exercises and virtual group activities. I value your learning style. I believe adult learning should be engaging always, fun sometimes, and sprinkled with a great deal of reflection. I believe we all need to feel safe and be able to make learning mistakes. I believe we all have individual styles and modes in which we learn better. As your instructor, it is my job to create an environment in which you feel most empowered to learn. Most importantly, I value you. You have many choices of where to go for your aromatherapy education and I thank you for choosing me. I strive to surprise you and offer you much more thanother online programs. When you come to learn with me, you will, of course, leave with a strong understanding of chemistry and therapeutics. In addition, you will leave with a love for the magic and power of essential oils along with a foundational understanding of vibrational healing. When you leave, you will have arrived at the first crossroad of aromatherapy, where your intuition and passion meet to open you to new possibilities. Virginia Joy aka V.
