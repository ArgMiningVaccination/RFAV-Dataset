Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process using the least invasive methods possible to help remove the cause of an illness. The Naturopathic Doctor teaches people how to care for themselves as a whole person which translates into helping to prevent illness in the future. Naturopathic medicine is founded upon six philosophical principles intended to provide a solid foundation for the practice of medicine. At Emerge Natural Health we strive to implement these principles with every patient. The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians describes the six principles in the following manner: THE HEALING POWER OF NATURE (VIS MEDICATRIX NATURAE): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in people that is ordered and intelligent. Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. IDENTIFY AND TREAT THE CAUSES (TOILE CAUSAM): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. FIRST DO NO HARM (PRIMUM NON NOCERE): Naturopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming the patient. First, to utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat. Second, to avoid when possible the harmful suppression of symptoms. Finally, to acknowledge, respect, and work with individuals' self-healing process. DOCTOR AS TEACHER (DOCERE): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON (TOLLE TOTUM): Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. PREVENTION: Naturopathic physicians emphasize the prevention of disease by assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to disease, and by making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. In Washington, naturopathic doctors (NDs) are considered primary care physicians who can order and interpret laboratory tests, diagnose conditions and treat patients with not only pharmaceutical medications but with herbal treatments, hydrotherapy, nutritional medicine, lifestyle education and counseling, physical medicine and homeopathy or other energetic modalities within a clinical setting. Only naturopaths who graduated from an accredited four-year naturopathic medical school and pass a national board certification examination are allowed to be licensed and practice medicine as naturopathic doctors. Patients are our top priority and we offer practical and achievable steps to health.
