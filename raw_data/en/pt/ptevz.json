We've enhanced our health and cleaning protocols to help ensure that our hotels, restaurants and bars continue to be safe welcoming spaces for everyone. We're continually fine-tuning industry best practices and training our teams to follow current safety guidelines. You can expect our properties to tailor these practices in alignment with local ordinances. How these adjustments come to life may vary by property.
