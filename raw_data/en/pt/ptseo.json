A diverse range of species is distributed throughout Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, and Central Asia. The Vitex tree, including its leaves and fruits, has been used for herbal remedies in the form of pastes, decoctions, and dried fruits since ancient times. This article aimed to prepare a comprehensive review of traditional uses and secondary metabolites derived from Vitex sp., including the chemical compounds, biological activities, application of Vitex in human clinical trials, toxicology and safety, marketed products, and patents. The scientific findings were obtained using a number of search engines and databases, including Google Scholar, PMC, and ScienceDirect. Vitex species are well known in pharmacology to have medicinal values, such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Previous studies reported that some species are proven to be effective in treating diseases, such as diabetes, and improving female health. A total of 161 compounds from different Vitex species are reported, covering the literature from 1982 to 2022. A chemical analysis report of various studies identified that Vitex exhibited a wide range of phytoconstituents, such as iridoid, diterpenoid, ecdysteroid, and flavonoid and phenolic compounds. Apart from that, the review will also discuss the application of Vitex in human clinical trials, toxicology and safety, marketed products, and patents of the genus. While the extracts of the genus have been made into many commercial products, including supplements and essential oils, most of them are made to be used by women to improve menstrual conditions and relieve premenstrual syndrome. Among the species, Vitex agnus-castus L. is the only one that has been reported to undergo clinical trials, mainly related to the use of the genus for the treatment of mastalgia, menstrual bleeding problems, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, luteal insufficiency, and premenstrual syndrome.

[https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11151944](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11151944) [Bioprospecting of Natural Products from Medicinal Plants]( /journal/plants/special_issues/Bioprospecting_Natural_Products_Medicinal_Plants )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-plants-11-01944)]. Some of the most well recognized and researched species of Vitex are Vitex Ex Schauer. They are scattered all over the world and can be primarily found in tropical regions, except for a few instances in subtropical regions, such as Japan, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands [ [2](#B2-plants-11-01944), [3](#B3-plants-11-01944)]. Most plants in the genus Vitex are shrubs or arbors. [ [4](#B4-plants-11-01944)]. Often used as a remedy to women's health problems and other reproductive ailments, Vitex is also universally known as chaste tree. The plant got its name from the notion that it may help treat infertility and reduce libido. With respect to different sorts of Vitex species and depending on the country, they are also known by a variety of names, such as Nirgundi, Sambhalu, Despite the different names, Vitex has been historically known and utilized by prehistoric civilization for various purposes, including treatment for reproductive disorders, gastrointestinal conditions, inflammatory diseases, and the ability to subdue several symptoms of psychiatric illnesses [ [9](#B9-plants-11-01944), [10](#B10-plants-11-01944), [11](#B11-plants-11-01944), [12](#B12-plants-11-01944)]. Nowadays, many studies are being conducted to investigate the biological properties of Vitex genus, as they are believed to contain a pool of metabolites with potential complementary therapeutic actions. [3](#B3-plants-11-01944)]. For example, it was found that ethanolic extract from the fruit of V. agnus-castus L. indicated inhibition activity against D2 and opioid receptors [ [13](#B13-plants-11-01944)]. The dopaminergic compounds are also beneficial for the treatment of premenstrual mastodynia and some other symptoms linked with premenstrual syndrome [ [14](#B14-plants-11-01944)]. Apart from being known for its anti-inflammatory activities, V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer is also being investigated for its antimicrobial properties. [ [15](#B15-plants-11-01944)] reported that the methanolic extract from the stem and leaf of V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer exhibited both antibacterial and antifungal activities against Enterobacter aeurogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida, and Rhizopus species, respectively. In addition, among five distinct species of Vitex, namely V. trifolia L., V. negundo L., Vitex altissima f., V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer, and Vitex diversifolia, it was discovered that methanolic extract from the leaf of V. peduncularis Wall. Ex. Schauer contained the highest growth inhibition activity against all tested human pathogenic bacteria in the study [ [16](#B16-plants-11-01944)]. Another Vitex genus known for its biological significance is V. trifolia L. When tested against carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats, it was observed that the hydroalcoholic extract of V. trifolia exhibited anti-inflammatory properties [ [17](#B17-plants-11-01944)]. A study group treated with the plant extract showed lower levels of mast cells, inflammatory mediators, and macrophages as compared to animals treated with control group indomethacin. V. trifolia L. extract is reported to express cytotoxic activity against several cell lines, including colon carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and cervix carcinoma cells, and they also found that the hexanic extract of the leaf managed to completely inhibit the growth of fungal pathogen Fusarium species [ [18](#B18-plants-11-01944)]. Vitex, such as V. negundo L., is also studied for its analgesic effect. [ [19](#B19-plants-11-01944)] discovered that after 1 h of therapy, a study group of rats treated with an aqueous extract of V. negundo L. leaf demonstrated considerable dose-dependent analgesic efficacy. [20](#B20-plants-11-01944)]. Some of the bioactive compounds of Vitex noted to be responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity are iridoid and pedunculariside, where they were found to demonstrate preferential inhibition of COX-2 and little inhibitory effect on COX-1 [ [21](#B21-plants-11-01944), [22](#B22-plants-11-01944)]. Flavonoids extracted from Vitex also contributed to several pharmacological benefits of the plant, such as the antifungal activity, trypanocidal activity, and anti-filarial properties [ [23](#B23-plants-11-01944), [24](#B24-plants-11-01944), [25](#B25-plants-11-01944)]. In addition, diterpenoid and triterpenoid are also some of the constituents found in the Vitex genus to exhibit anti-proliferative properties, cytotoxic activity, and demonstrated a dopaminergic effect [ [26](#B26-plants-11-01944), [27](#B27-plants-11-01944), [28](#B28-plants-11-01944), [29](#B29-plants-11-01944)]. Despite the various discoveries of Vitex metabolites and their biological effects, the preponderance of Vitex's commercial product is used to treat menstrual problems, including inconsistent menstruation, mastodynia, and relieved symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome [ [30](#B30-plants-11-01944)]. For instance, Blackmores, Kordels, Thompson, Nature, and Solaray are some of the well-known supplement companies that have successfully commercialized Vitex-based products. [Figure 1](#plants-11-01944-f001)provides a summary of Vitex species and highlights the main compounds and their biological activities that have been recorded. Previously, several review papers on the genus Vitex have been published, between 2005 and 2021, which cover specific species, such as V. agnus-castus L. [ [5](#B5-plants-11-01944), [31](#B31-plants-11-01944), [32](#B32-plants-11-01944)], V. [ [35](#B35-plants-11-01944)], and V. rotundifolia [ [36](#B36-plants-11-01944)], and mostly discussed the ethnobotany and pharmacological activities. In terms of secondary metabolites, one review paper published in 2016 [ [5](#B5-plants-11-01944)] only focused on terpene derivatives, while a review paper in 2021 [ [37](#B37-plants-11-01944)] extensively discussed sesquiterpene. However, the information is lacking on the application of Vitex in human clinical trials, toxicology and safety, marketed products, and patents. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to offer an overview of the traditional medicinal uses, secondary metabolites, and pharmacological effects of secondary metabolites isolated from Vitex species that may be utilized as a reference for future research and use of the species. In addition, the application of Vitex in human clinical trials, toxicology and safety, marketed products, and patents will be included. 2. Methods of Literature Search [Figure 2](#plants-11-01944-f002)below. 3. Traditional Medicinal Use of Vitex Species [6](#B6-plants-11-01944), [10](#B10-plants-11-01944), [12](#B12-plants-11-01944)]. They mentioned the use of Vitex for a wide range of conditions, such as to treat women with reproductive disorders, improve body health after childbirth, suppress libido, treat skin problems, cure symptoms of gastrointestinal afflictions, reduce fever, heal rheumatism, and [12](#B12-plants-11-01944), [38](#B38-plants-11-01944), [41](#B41-plants-11-01944)]. negundo L., V. peduncularis Wall, and V. trifolia L. Ex Schauer are some of the Vitex species commonly used in the preparation of traditional remedies [ [3](#B3-plants-11-01944), [12](#B12-plants-11-01944), [42](#B42-plants-11-01944)]. Many reports noted that the medicinal properties of Vitex came from different parts of the plant, mainly the leaves, fruits, and barks. They were made into paste, consumed as decoctions, smoked, and preserved as dried fruits. 3.1. Traditional Medicinal Uses of Vitex negundo L. [39](#B39-plants-11-01944), [40](#B40-plants-11-01944)]. Different plant sections of V. negundo L., such as the root, bark, and flower, have also been used extensively in India and Pakistan as decoctions to treat gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea, dysentery, flatulence, indigestion, and cholera [ [38](#B38-plants-11-01944), [41](#B41-plants-11-01944)]. Other than that, the leaves are exploited to relieve headache in Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia [ [43](#B43-plants-11-01944), [44](#B44-plants-11-01944), [45](#B45-plants-11-01944)]. They are used to ease headache in a variety of ways, where, in Bangladesh, leaves are crushed and put into poultice, the Indians smoked the leaves, and in Malaysia, they stuffed pillows with the leaves. Apart from headache, the Nirgundi leaves are also popular in India, China, and Nepal to heal cough and sore throat where they are made into juice [ [42](#B42-plants-11-01944), [46](#B46-plants-11-01944), [47](#B47-plants-11-01944)]. Meanwhile, the Singhalese used the plant to treat rheumatism by powdering the root to use it as tincture, as well as extracting juice from the leaves [ [48](#B48-plants-11-01944)]. In a review study, it was noted that V. negundo L. is also used to cure several skin-related ailments among the Assamese [ [49](#B49-plants-11-01944)]. For instance, the paste and juice are made from the leaves for topical application to skin and used orally to treat cellulitis and hives. The juice can also be utilized to cure carbuncle by mixing it with oil extracted from Sesamum indicum. In Ayurveda medicine, a decoction from the V. negundo L. leaf with Piper nigrum is effective to cure catarrhal fever and muffled hearing, while Unani medicine cited a mixture of V. negundo L. and sugarcane, which is taken orally to reduce swelling [ [12](#B12-plants-11-01944), [50](#B50-plants-11-01944)]. 3.2. Traditional Medicinal Use of Vitex agnus-castus L. [5](#B5-plants-11-01944)]. The plant is popular due to its health benefits in the reproductive system where locals resort to the plant to help reduce sexual desire and it is used to treat female disorders linked with the reproductive system. It was reported that in ancient times, Roman wives made use of the aromatic leaves to reduce the libido of their husbands. In Latin, the locals produced beverages from V. agnus-castus L. seeds for the same reason as the Romans [ [51](#B51-plants-11-01944)]. V. agnus-castus L. is also interchangeably called the pepper or berry of Monk because monks used to chew the berries, include the berries in their food, and placed them in their pockets to suppress their sexual desire in prehistoric days [ [52](#B52-plants-11-01944), [53](#B53-plants-11-01944), [54](#B54-plants-11-01944)]. Athenian women also used the plant during the Thesmophoria festival to keep their chastity by covering their bed linen with the foul-smelling leaves [ [55](#B55-plants-11-01944)]. Some other reports noted that the chaste tree has not only received support from European and North American traditional herbalists and practitioners to treat gynecological disorders, such as menstrual irregularities, infertility, and premenstrual syndrome, but also used to manage acne problems, digestive complaints, and act as a sedative [ [56](#B56-plants-11-01944), [57](#B57-plants-11-01944)]. European herbalists utilized chaste plant to stimulate the uterus and encourage menstruation among local women [ [55](#B55-plants-11-01944)]. Iranian and Albanian traditional medicine also utilized the leaves and fruits of chaste plant to increase milk production for women after childbirth [ [58](#B58-plants-11-01944), [59](#B59-plants-11-01944)]. Other than that, it was reported that before the Common Era, Hippocrates recommended chaste tree for inflammation and injuries, and after four centuries, the Greek botanist Pedanius Dioscorides also suggested the same plant to increase lactation and reduce womb inflammation [ [10](#B10-plants-11-01944)]. Due to its hot nature, the Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans took the seeds of chaste plant to dispel wind or relieve bowel flatulence, promote urine, and treat dropsy and splenic disease [ [10](#B10-plants-11-01944)]. They also prepared antidotes for spiders and snakes bites from the same plant. In several regions of India and Pakistan, such as Loralai, Bori, and Barkhan, the locals used the plant to treat pains due to chills by taking baths in water boiled with the leaves [ [12](#B12-plants-11-01944)]. During the middle age, Arabians, Salerno natives, and Anglo-Saxons recognized the V. agnus-castus L. plant as a remedy to treat symptoms of psychological illnesses. It was revealed that the fruit of chaste plant was sold at Arabian bazaars as a calming agent for hysteria [ [10](#B10-plants-11-01944)]. The author also added that the locals mixed V. agnus-castus L. with other herbs to create a remedy to treat epilepsy and mental illness. The utilization of chaste plant in Chinese, Indian, or Ayurveda traditional medicine is not commonly employed for disease therapy. 3.3. Traditional Medicinal Uses of Vitex trifolia L. [6](#B6-plants-11-01944), [7](#B7-plants-11-01944)]. In a review report, it was noted that V. trifolia L. was utilized traditionally to treat several different ailments, including joint pains, ringworm infection, leprosy, and skin rashes [ [60](#B60-plants-11-01944)]. The author found that decoctions from the leaves of V. trifolia L. are given orally to ease joint and sciatica pains in Asian countries, while for the treatment of leprosy and skin rashes, the leaves can be ingested together with honey or applied topically. They also added that a mixture of crushed leaves and ghee (semifluid butter made from animal's milk, usually cow or buffalo's milk) is traditionally applied on the area infected with fungus. The mixture of V. trifolia L. leaves and honey has also been given in cases of intermittent fever with severe thirst and vomiting [ [12](#B12-plants-11-01944)]. According to Ayurveda, the combination of Jalanirgundi leaves and other herbs is believed to help regulate the accumulation of pitta (In Ayurverda, they believe pitta represents heat, fire, and energy) in the blood and the root can be used to make tonic, act as expectorant and febrifuge [ [12](#B12-plants-11-01944), [60](#B60-plants-11-01944)]. In Chinese traditional medicine, the fruit of this plant is used to ease headache, migraine, common cold, eye pain, and in certain regions of China, it is applied as traditional medicine to treat specific cancers [ [61](#B61-plants-11-01944), [62](#B62-plants-11-01944)]. It was noted that pillows stuffed with the leaves of V. trifolia L. are effective to cure catarrh and headache [ [12](#B12-plants-11-01944)]. Sambhalu is another name for the plant in Unani medicine and was described to be utilized with the purpose of decreasing libido [ [7](#B7-plants-11-01944)]. In Papua New Guinea, the natives make use of the stem of V. trifolia L. to treat dysentery. The plant leaves are also used to manage dysentery in New Caledonia and the Samoans applied them topically to relieve sprained joint and rheumatic pain [ [11](#B11-plants-11-01944)]. It was also reported that the leaves are utilized into medication in New Caledonia, Rotuma, and the Solomon Islands to alleviate headache by heating them and rubbing on the forehead or taken as an infusion [ [63](#B63-plants-11-01944)]. In Tonga, they employed the plant to cure oral infections and inflammations [ [63](#B63-plants-11-01944)]. 3.4. Traditional Medicinal Uses of Vitex peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer [64](#B64-plants-11-01944)]. The traditional medicine system used various portions of V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer, including the bark, roots, and leaves, to cure various illnesses. In Bangladesh, different ethnic communities have employed Korobaong plant for different purposes. For example, the natives around the hill area of Khagrachari utilized the leaves and barks of the plant as a remedy for diabetes [ [64](#B64-plants-11-01944)]. Meanwhile, the Chakma people made paste from the bark of the plant and topically used it for the treatment of jaundice and numbness of the face and eyes [ [64](#B64-plants-11-01944), [65](#B65-plants-11-01944)]. They also used the same paste and took it with water to treat urethritis [ [9](#B9-plants-11-01944)]. It was reported that the barks, roots, and leaves of V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer have been used as a folk remedy to heal blackwater fever and malaria [ [66](#B66-plants-11-01944), [67](#B67-plants-11-01944)]. Girach, Aminuddin, Siddiqui, and Khan (1994) noted the prescription of using V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer to treat malaria fever where a few strands of leaves are heated in 1 L water up until the final volume is lowered to 250 mL, then filtrated, and it is consumed as two teaspoons twice a day. They also added that the stem bark of the plant is made into juice and served hot to treat malaria fever. The bark of the plant is also boiled and drunk to ease chest pain and treat joint ache [ [9](#B9-plants-11-01944)]. Kirtikar and Basu (1935) noted that in Chota Nagpur, the locals exploited the V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer plant's bark for external application to treat pain in the chest. [Table 1](#plants-11-01944-t001)displays the summary of traditional uses of different Vitex species for medicine. 4. Secondary Metabolites Isolated from Vitex and Their Biological Activities 4.1. Iridoids [69](#B69-plants-11-01944)]. Previous studies described the diverse bioactivities of these compounds, for cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, antisplasmodic, mussaenosidic acid (2), were the first iridiods, which were isolated from the genus Vitex [ [71](#B71-plants-11-01944), [72](#B72-plants-11-01944)]. Compound 1 showed protective effects against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced toxicity in hepatocyte-derived carcinoma (HuH-7) cells and oxidative stress [ [40](#B40-plants-11-01944)]. Another iridoid nishindaside (3) was isolated from V. negundo L. for the first time [ [73](#B73-plants-11-01944)], lagundinin (4) [ [74](#B74-plants-11-01944)] and 1,4a,5,7a-tetrahydro-1-D-glucosyl-7-(30,40-dihydroxybenzoyloxymethyl)-5-ketocy-clopenta[c]pyran-4-carboxylic acid (5) [ [75](#B75-plants-11-01944)] were also discovered from the same species. Tarumal (6) was isolated from Brazilian V. cymosa Bertero ex Spreng [ [21](#B21-plants-11-01944)]. V. peduncularis Wall. Ex Schauer yielded pedunculariside (7), which was shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with an IC50 value of 0.15 it showed low cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition and no cytotoxicity against African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines was reported [ [22](#B22-plants-11-01944)]. [76](#B76-plants-11-01944)]. Another six iridoids, namely 6-O-trans-feruloylnegundoside 2-O-p-hydroxybenzoyl-6-O-trans-caffeoyl-8-epiloganic acid (14), 2-O-p-hydroxybenzoyl gardoside (15), and 2-O-p-hydroxybenzoyl-8-epiloganic acid (16), were isolated from an ethyl acetate extract of V. altissima L.f. Compounds 12-14 exhibited was derived from Vitex pinnata L. as one of its minor compounds [ [78](#B78-plants-11-01944)]. [79](#B79-plants-11-01944)]. Two new iridoid glycosides were found in V. negundo var. heterophylla, such as vitexnegheteroins K and L (19 and 20) [ [80](#B80-plants-11-01944)] and 10-p-hydroxybenzoyl-6-hydroxyiridoid 1-O--D-(6-O-p-hydroxybenzoyl)glucopyranoside (21) [ [81](#B81-plants-11-01944)]. The iridoid glycosides 19 and exhibited weak antioxidant effects with IC50 value >20 \u00b5M and moderate inhibitory effects on -glucosidase. Meanwhile, compound 21 did not inhibit NO production activity up to a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. [82](#B82-plants-11-01944)]. The isolated compound 22 was assessed for NO inhibitory activity tested on LPS-induced murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells to exhibit moderate inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 90.05 M. [83](#B83-plants-11-01944)]. Both compounds 23 and 24 showed a weak radical scavenging effect on stable free radicals, with percentage scavenging activities of 27.14% and 25.80%, respectively. 4.2. Diterpenoids [Figure 4](#plants-11-01944-f004)). The group of Masateru Ono from Japan dedicated their research to finding new labdane diterpenes from the fruits of V. rotundifolia and V. agnus-castus L. Five journal papers have been published by this group, reporting the discovery of 27 labdane-type diterpenes, in which eight labdane-type diterpenes 25-32 were isolated from V. rotundifolia. Compound 32 was subjected to an antioxidant assay but did not exhibit any activities [ [84](#B84-plants-11-01944)]. [85](#B85-plants-11-01944)]. The isolation of eight more labdane diterpenes was achieved from the fruit of V. agnus-castus L., including viteagnusin C-H and J (43-49), and (51) [ [27](#B27-plants-11-01944)]. From the of a novel nitrogen-containing labdane diterpene called vitexlactam two labdane diterpene alkaloids, named vitexlactam B and C (54 and 55) have been isolated from V. agnus-castus L. along with compound 52. Their cancer chemoprevention effect was tested and only compound 55 showed moderate results on NADP(H); was found from the fruits of V. agnus-castus L.; however, no activity was reported on opioid receptor assays DOR and MOR [ [91](#B91-plants-11-01944)]. [92](#B92-plants-11-01944)]. Two new labdane diterpenoids, such as 6,7-diacetoxy-13-hydroxy-8(9),14-labdadien (60), and 9-hydroxy-13(14)-labden-15,16-olide (61), were found in the leaf extract of V. trifolia L. Compound 60 was found to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with an MIC value of 100 g/mL [94](#B94-plants-11-01944)]. Seven labdane diterpenes, including vitextrifolin from the fruits of V. trifolia L.; however, they were found to be inactive against four human cancer cell lines (A549, HCT116, HL60, and ZR-75-30) [ [95](#B95-plants-11-01944)]. of Vitex vestita Wall. Ex Walp., which was collected from Machang, Kelantan, Malaysia, was screened for its antimicrobial activity, leading to the isolation of six labdane-type diterpenoids. The compounds are, namely 12-epivitexolide A (71), vitexolide B-C and E (72-74), vitexolin A and B (75 and 76) [ [26](#B26-plants-11-01944)]. Compounds 71-73 exhibited similar infrared spectra due to the presence of an exomethylene group of ,-unsaturated -lactone and free hydroxyl groups. Compounds 71, 74, and 76 exhibited moderate antibacterial and cytotoxic activities against human colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116) cells and human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC15) cells, while compounds 72-73 and 75 exhibited cytotoxic activities only against HCT-116 cancer cell lines. Two new diterpenoid compounds, known as chastol (77) and epichastol (78), were discovered from the dried fruits of V. agnus-castus L., also known as Viticis fructus [ [97](#B97-plants-11-01944)]. compounds three halimanes (89-91), and two clerodanes (92 and 93) [ [99](#B99-plants-11-01944)]. Compounds 90 and 91 showed moderate cytotoxicity in the micromolar range. Compound 90 also showed equipotent Topoisomerase-1 (Top1) inhibition to camptothecin (CPT), but this compound was the most cytotoxic against HCT 116 cells with the highest Top1 inhibition. compound 93 showed equipotent Top1 inhibition to CPT. [100](#B100-plants-11-01944)]. Both compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) pathway in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. These compounds inhibited tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) -induced NF-B activation. The compounds also significantly inhibited NF-B activation (p < 0.05, p < 0.01), with inhibition rates of 66.09 \u00b1 11.49 and 57.30 \u00b1 15.70, respectively. There was also a new diterpenoid found in V. trifolia L., named (3S,5S,6S,8R,9R,10S)-3,6,9-trihydroxy-13(14)-labdean-16,15-olide-3-O--D-gluco-pyranoside (96) [ [82](#B82-plants-11-01944)]. The isolated compound 96 was evaluated for its inhibitory effect on NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages; however, no inhibitory activity was reported up to a concentration value of 100 M. [101](#B101-plants-11-01944)], while 9-epivitexnegundin (99) was also isolated from the same species [ [102](#B102-plants-11-01944)]. Compunds 97 and 98 were reported to exhibit strong inhibitory activity against NO production, in which compound 98 was the strongest inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 15.8 \u00b1 1.38 M, while compound 97 had an IC50 value of 40.10 \u00b1 1.30 M. Compound 98 also showed significant inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-beta and 6 (IL-1 and COX-2, and NF-B signal pathways [101](#B101-plants-11-01944)]. Meanwhile, compound 99 was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity but the activity was not mentioned [ [102](#B102-plants-11-01944)]. Another study on the V. negundo L. leaves from Vietnam reported that compound 99 was inactive against severe myelogenous leukemia tumor (K562) cells with IC50 value > 100 \u00b5M [ [103](#B103-plants-11-01944)]. [104](#B104-plants-11-01944)]. All compunds were tested for antimalarial activity on Plasmodium falciparum, in which compound 101 had the most activity with an IC50 value of 1.2 \u00b5M \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5M among others. It is likely that compound 101 was 54-times more active than compound 100 due to the existence of aperoxy bridge. 4.3. Ecdysteroids [105](#B105-plants-11-01944)]. Plants also contain ecdysteroids (phytoecdysteroids) in large amounts as defense chemicals against phytophagous insects [ [106](#B106-plants-11-01944)]. Compound ecdysteroids are described as in [Figure 5](#plants-11-01944-f005). [107](#B107-plants-11-01944)]. Various ecdysteroids have been discovered from Vitex,, such as pinnatasterone (103) isolated from V. pinnata L. possessing weak activity against Musca domestica larvae [ [108](#B108-plants-11-01944)]. Several ecdysteroids were canescens Kurz, including canescensterone (104), 24-epiabutasterone Wall. Ex Schauer, exhibiting very weak Musca [113](#B113-plants-11-01944)]. yielded (112), and 2,3-acetonide-24-hydroxyecdysone (113), which showed anti-inflammatory activity in a rat paw oedema development assay at 100 mg/kg dose [ [114](#B114-plants-11-01944)]. [115](#B115-plants-11-01944)]. Since ecdysteroids play an important role in chemical defence against non-adapted herbivores, this could explain the high abundance of this compound. It could be used as a new and additional characteristic compound parameter in the identification of compounds to reduce dereplication and false positives. 4.4. Flavonoids [116](#B116-plants-11-01944)]. These compounds are responsible for normal growth, development, and defense in plants. Flavonoid biosynthesis is formed via the shikimic acid and acylpolymalonate pathways [ [117](#B117-plants-11-01944)]. Flavonoids in [Figure 6](#plants-11-01944-f006). [118](#B118-plants-11-01944)]. Vitegnoside (119) was found in V. negundo exhibited antifungal activity on Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Cryptococcus neoformans, with an MIC value of 6.25 g/mL [ [25](#B25-plants-11-01944)]. [119](#B119-plants-11-01944)]. The in vitro antileishmanial activities of 120 on both Leishmania donovani promastigote and amastigote forms were assessed. The compound had potent antileishmanial activity, which is higher than sodium antimonygluconate (SAG), with IC50 values of 2.4 mM and 58.5 mM for promastigote and 0.93 mM and 36.2 mM for amastigotes, respectively. The compound was less toxic than SAG towards human leukemia monocytic (THP-1) cells, with 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values of 123.7 mM and 364.3 mM, respectively. [23](#B23-plants-11-01944)]. All flavonoids obtained from this species were tested for biological activities and exhibited moderate trypanocidal activity due to the increase in methylation of the hydroxyl group. Meanwhile, a flavonoid, which was isolated from the leaves of large evergreen tree V. penduncularis was 4-acetoxy-5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavone (126) [ [120](#B120-plants-11-01944)]. [24](#B24-plants-11-01944)]. Compound 127 demonstrated significant in vitro antifilarial activity in a dose-dependent manner against adult Setaria cervi worms, as measured by worm motility and MTT reduction assays. 4.5. Miscellaneous [121](#B121-plants-11-01944)]. Lignans have been known as minor constituents of plant varieties, where they are the building blocks for lignin formation in the plant cell walls [ [122](#B122-plants-11-01944)]. There have been many studies reporting the association of lignans with human health benefits and disease acting as antioxidants, in an anti-inflammatory manner, and so on. A phenyldihydronaphthalene-type lignan named vitexdoin F (128) was found in the seeds of V. negundo L. [ [123](#B123-plants-11-01944)]. The antioxidant activity on lignan was evaluated through DPPH radical-scavenging assays and exhibited obvious radical-scavenging effect on stable free radicals of DPPH. The compound also exhibited stronger activity than ascorbic acid. [124](#B124-plants-11-01944)]. Compound 129 exhibited antioxidant and inhibitory activities on LPS-induced NO, while compound 130 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. Meanwhile, compound 131 exhibited only antioxidant activity on the 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) radical cation-scavenging activity. Two new phenylnaphthalene-type lignans, (3R,4S)-6-hydroxy4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydro-2-naphthaldehyde-3a-O--D-glucopyranoside (133) and 6,7,4-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-2,3-cycloligna-1,4-dien-2a,3a-olide (134), were isolated from the aerial parts of V. negundo var. Heterophylla, originating from Chaoyang city, China [ [125](#B125-plants-11-01944)]. Then, two new lignans, namely 6-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-acetoxymethyl-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2-naphthaldehyde (135) and 3-O-acetylvitedoin A (136), were isolated from the methanolic extract of V. negundo var. cannabifolia fruits using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, reverse-phase ODS gel, and silica gel [ [126](#B126-plants-11-01944)]. The compounds were determined as artefacts as they had resulted from treatment with ethyl acetate during the fractionation and purification processes. In V. Kwangsiensis C. Pei, two new lignans were isolated from this plant and named as 6-hydroxy-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2-naphthaldehyde or known as vitekwangin A (137) and 6-hydroxy-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-5-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2-napthaldehyde (also known as vitekwangin B) (138) [ [127](#B127-plants-11-01944)]. Compounds 137 and 138 were evaluated for their inhibitory activities on LPS-induced NO production using IC50 for RAW 264.7 is higher than 80 \u00b5M and both compounds had minor inhibitory effects on NO generation at lower doses. [128](#B128-plants-11-01944)]. Two new monoterpenoids were discovered from V. negundo var. heterophylla and named as (9R)-O--D-glucopyranosyloxy-2,5-megastigmen-4-one (139) and (3S,4R)-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydro--ionone4-O--D-glucopyranoside (140 and 140a). Both compounds demonstrated pronounced anti-inflammatory activity with IC50 > 100 M, respectively [ [101](#B101-plants-11-01944)]. [129](#B129-plants-11-01944)]. In fact, some of these compunds are implicated in the resolution of immune diseases. Six new polyoxygenated triterpenoids, namely cannabifolins AF (141-146), were found in V. negundo var. cannabifolia [ [130](#B130-plants-11-01944)]. Compound 143 moderately inhibited NO production, with an IC50 value of 34.0 M, while compounds 141, 142, 144 and 146 were inactive (<50% inhibition at 80 M, the highest concentration tested). Moreover, compound 145 exhibited cytotoxicity on RAW 264.7 macrophages with cell viability less than 70% at 40 M, and 3-hydroxy-30-al-urs-12-en-28-oic acid (147) was isolated from the methanolic extract of V. trifolia var. simplifocia fruits, originating from the beach of Lang-Qi Island in Fuzhou, China [ [28](#B28-plants-11-01944)]. Compound 147 was known to exhibit cytotoxic activity against leukemia (HL-60), gastric cancer (SGC-7901), pancreatic cancer (PANC-01), and esophageal carcinoma (Eca-109) in human cell lines. Compounds 129-131 and one triterpene compound vitexnegheteroin H (148) from V. negundo var. heterophylla inhibition of LPS-induced NO production microglia cells [ [124](#B124-plants-11-01944)]. Two new triterpenoids, such as 1,3-dihydroxybauer-7-en-28-oic acid (149) and 2,3,19, 24-tetrahydroxy-23-norus-12-en-28-oic acid (150), were isolated from the leaves of V. doniana Sweet originated from farm land in Basawa village, Kaduna state [ [131](#B131-plants-11-01944)]. [132](#B132-plants-11-01944)]. These compounds activity ABTS radical scavenging assay and inhibitory activity on LPS-stimulated NO production. The in vitro bioactivities of these compounds were not comparable to actual in vivo beneficial effects, indicating that further studies on the in vivo bioactivities of the compounds should be conducted to provide real biological significance in future. Furthermore, a new phenolic glycoside, named 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid (6-O-caffeoyl)glucoside or known as vitexnegheteroin M (159), was isolated from the leaves of V. negundo var. heterophylla. The inhibitory effects on LPS-induced NO production in murine microglial cell BV-2 cells of 159 exhibited poor inhibitory effects on LPS-stimulated NO production (IC50 > 100 \u00b5M) and no cytotoxic effect on BV-2 cells [ [133](#B133-plants-11-01944)]. [134](#B134-plants-11-01944)]. Two new chromone derivatives were found in V. negundo L., identified as methyl 3-(2-(5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl)ethylbenzoate (160) and 3-(1-hydroxy-2-(5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-4-oxo-4H-chromen-2-yl)ethylbenzoic acid (161) [ [135](#B135-plants-11-01944)]. In mice, these isolated compounds were examined for antinociceptive action in an abdomen constriction assay with acetic acid and paw oedema assay with carrageenan showing anti-inflammatory activity. They were successful in reducing nociception and inflammation, and V. negundo L. could be utilised as a source of antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory compounds. All compounds were described as in [Figure 7](#plants-11-01944-f007). [Table 2](#plants-11-01944-t002)provides a summary of compounds isolated from various species of Vitex and their biological activities. 5. Health-Promoting Activities of Vitex in Humans, with Particular Regard to Clinical Trials [136](#B136-plants-11-01944)]. From the 28 studies, there were 20 clinical trials to observe V. agnus-castus L.'s effect on premenstrual syndrome. One of the studies investigated the effect of V. agnus-castus L. on 50 women suffering from PMS [ [137](#B137-plants-11-01944)]. Over the course of three menstrual cycles, the women received treatment with one tablet (20 mg native extract) each day and were given the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) to rate 47 symptoms for self-assessment. A total of seven participants withdrew from the trials; six of them withdrew due to circumstances unrelated to the treatment and one person experienced headache and tiredness for the first 4 days of treatment. The remaining 43 participants completed eight menstrual cycle protocols (two baseline, three treatment, and three post-treatment) and 20 individuals reported 37 adverse effects throughout 344 menstrual cycles in total observed in the study. Acne (n = 7) was the most common occurrence, followed by six cases of headache (n = 6), five cases of spotting (n = 5), and five cases of gastrointestinal problems (n = 5). These occurrences are mostly common in PMS patients. For women with premenstrual syndrome, the effectiveness and tolerance of the agnus castus fruit (V. agnus castus L. extract Ze 440) were also evaluated in comparison to the placebo [ [138](#B138-plants-11-01944)]. This three-menstrual cycle, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial included 170 women having premenstrual syndrome (active 86; placebo 84), with the same mean number for age, cycle length, and duration of menses. The VAC group (n = 86) consumed one V. agnus-castus L. fruit extract (Ze 440 20 mg) capsule once a day (made by Zeller AG; Romanshorn, Switzerland; 60 percent ethanol (m/m) extract ratio 6-12/1, standardized for casticin). The active group experienced fewer premenstrual symptoms in comparison to the placebo group. Another study on the therapeutic effect of V. agnus-castus L. on 128 women (mean age of 31 \u00b1 4 years old) with premenstrual syndrome was conducted as a randomized and placebo-controlled trial [ [139](#B139-plants-11-01944)]. The subjects were split into two groups: 62 were randomly assigned to receive 40 drops of V. agnus-castus L. extract daily and 66 were assigned to receive a similar placebo, commencing 6 days before menses. The patients were then assigned to complete self-assessment questionnaires prior to the trial and again, after six cycles of menstruation. A visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 (asymptomatic) to 10 (intolerable) was used to grade each item. Before and after the study, the active and placebo groups' rank of variables differed significantly (p < 0.0001) and similar differences were shown when V. agnus-castus L. was used compared to the placebo (p < 0.0001). [140](#B140-plants-11-01944)]. The participants were administered 40 mg of the fruit of V. agnus-castus L. (group 1) and flurbiprofen (group 2). The authors concluded that both treatments show a significant reduction in the symptoms of mastalgia with no harmful effects. A randomized and controlled trial was then conducted to observe the effect of two treatment types, V. agnus-castus L. and flaxseed, on patients with cyclic mastalgia [ [141](#B141-plants-11-01944)]. Block randomization was used to divide a total of 159 women into three groups, each with a size of 53 women. The group includes group 1 treated with 25 g flaxseed powder daily and V. agnus-castus L. placebo, group 2 treated with 3.2-4.8 mg V. agnus-castus L. capsules and flaxseed placebo, and a control group, which received both placebo treatments. In the first and second months, the breast pain intensity scores decreased significantly for both V. agnus-castus L. and flaxseed groups in comparison to the placebo group and the flaxseed group alone showed some adverse effects, such as dysentery symptoms and nausea. [142](#B142-plants-11-01944)]. Blood samples were taken at 5-8 and 20 days of menstruation cycle pre-treatment and after 3 months post-treatment. Then, by observing the release of prolactin, hyperprolactinemia was examined 15 min and 30 min after the intravenous injection of 200 \u00b5g Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). After 3 months, 37 full case reports (n = 20 for the placebo, n = 17 for the verum) show that the prolactin release reduced, luteal phase length normalized, and the luteal progesterone production deficit was eliminated in the verum group. The 17-estradiol was shown to increase significantly in the luteal phase of treated patients. [143](#B143-plants-11-01944)]. The researchers divided the patients into two placebo groups and a group treated with 30 mg Vitex and placebo medications for 8 weeks and then the Greene Questionnaire was used to assess the symptoms of menopause, before and after an eight-week intervention [ [144](#B144-plants-11-01944)]. The results show that the group that consumed V. agnus-castus L. had less vasomotor dysfunction, anxiety, and overall menopausal disorder after the intervention. Recently, a randomized clinical trial was conducted on 89 postmenopausal women (mean age of 55.83 \u00b1 3.63 years old) using random permuted blocks with a block size of three in the three groups [ [145](#B145-plants-11-01944)]. The groups include V. agnus-castus L. group (3.2-4.8 mg/q8h), Salvia officinalis group (100 mg/q8h), and placebo group for three months. The author compared the postmenopausal women according to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), before and after the intervention. The V. agnus-castus L. extracts were able to lower the cholesterol (TG and LDL) and increased HDL compared with the placebo group. 6. Toxicology and Safety [31](#B31-plants-11-01944)]. Nausea, minor gastrointestinal issues, exhaustion, menstruation difficulties, acne, dry mouth, erythematous rash, and pruritus are the most commonly reported side effects [ [31](#B31-plants-11-01944), [146](#B146-plants-11-01944)]. Concerning the consumption of V. agnus-castus L. while pregnant and nursing, there is still a lack of evidence based on theory, expert opinion, and in vitro research. There are studies to see the effects of V. agnus-castus L. but no evidence has shown that V. agnus-castus L. may have effects on estrogenic and progesterone activity [ [147](#B147-plants-11-01944), [148](#B148-plants-11-01944)]. As for lactation, there are different opinions on whether V. agnus-castus L. stimulates or lowers breastfeeding in lactation. Mixed findings were found to investigate V. agnus-castus L.'s effects on lactation. The compendia on herbal medicine and a plant monograph reported that V. agnus-castus L. elevates lactation [ [149](#B149-plants-11-01944), [150](#B150-plants-11-01944)] but there was also a report showing that V. agnus-castus L. decreases lactation due to the suppression in producing prolactin [ [151](#B151-plants-11-01944)]. 7. Marketed Products [136](#B136-plants-11-01944)]. This leads to Vitex being used in a variety of commercially available products, as shown in [Table 3](#plants-11-01944-t003). One of the products available in the pharmaceutical market is Thompson's-One-A-Day Vitex, manufactured by Thompsons Nutrition. It consists of 1500 mg 60 capsules that are suggested to be consumed as one capsule daily, which may help to relieve PMS and regulate the menstrual cycle. The V. agnus-castus L. extract formulation also helps to reduce PMS symptoms, including crankiness, breast pain, bloating, and the retention of fluid. Another product that used V. agnus-castus L. as an active ingredient is from nature, namely Nature's Answer V. agnus-castus L. It is suggested to be used as a supplement taken for diet and recommended to take one capsule per day (40 mg/capsule) with food or water. This product helps to support a woman's hormonal balance. Solaray Vitex (Chaste tree) consists of 400 mg 100 Vegetable Capsules, which are suggested to be taken in one capsule twice daily with food or water. Blackmores V. agnus-castus L. is a traditional Western herbal medicine that helps managed premenstrual symptoms and gives support to a healthy hormonal balance. The capsule is suggested to be taken one tablet three times a day before consuming any meals. Kordel's Vitex is also traditionally used to manage premenstrual pain and regulate menstruation by taking 1-2 capsules daily, preferably before breakfast. 8. Patents [152](#B152-plants-11-01944)]. Four patents for the Vitex genus were recorded, most of which employ the V. agnus-castus L. species. The Vitex extract was used as a medicament to cure movement disorders, while other patents utilized the genus as a supplemental product to treat health issues that primarily affected women. [Table 4](#plants-11-01944-t004)lists the patents available for Vitex genus and its health application. 9. Conclusions and Future Research Prospective [26](#B26-plants-11-01944), [29](#B29-plants-11-01944), [98](#B98-plants-11-01944), [99](#B99-plants-11-01944), [124](#B124-plants-11-01944), [127](#B127-plants-11-01944)]. However, additional research is required to demonstrate the molecule linked to its conventional utilization in the past.
