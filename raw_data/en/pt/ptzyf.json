WHO Department Internship Descriptions Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) http://www.who.int/fctc/text_download/en/ The WHO FCTC is the first international treaty addressing a public health matter. It is also the first treaty developed under the auspices of WHO, and it is the first time of the WHO's history that the organization used its mandate to develop international treaties. Since its inception in 2005, it has succeeded in keeping tobacco control high on the global agenda, and saving lives and improving global health during the process. Article 21 of WHO FCTC requires Parties to submit, on a regular basis, reports on the implementation of the Convention. The Convention Secretariat is responsible for the management of the reporting process, providing assistance to Parties so that they fulfill their reporting obligations, as well as analysis and dissemination. The team also conducts so -called \"needs assessment\" missions i n the countries that request such assistance, through which, the Secretariat evaluates the implementation of the 3 Convention, and identifies gaps and needs in implementation. Further, it works with th e countries to address those needs and fill those gaps. Potential internship duties may include: d ata management; review of national tobacco control laws; data analysis and reporting on the global progress in implementation of tobacco control laws; development within existing reporting instrument and collection processes; preparation of fact sheets; editing quarterly newsletter; management of Party reports and communication with Parties ; research and compile information for the database of available resources; preparation of needs assessment missions and informa tion collection pertaining to tobacco control in multiple countries; matching gaps with available resources . Global Surveillance and Risk Assessment The Global Surveillance and Risk Assessment team (RAS) is part of the Global Preparedness, Surveillance and Response Operations department (PSR). PSR is covering the whole cycle of event detections, risk assessment, verification and response as well as preparedness and capacity building under the International Health Regulations (IHR). Out team RAS has as the following main functions: Identification of potential public health threats Verification of potential public health threats under the IHR Risk Assessment of public health threats in coordination with the WHO Regional and Country Offices and subject mat ter experts. Management of the identified events (e.g. outbreaks) Communication on events through different channels (public, networks and with all National Focal Points of the WHO member states) In order to enhance the event based surveillance WHO has de veloped an electronic platform, called the Hazard Detection and Risk Assessment System (HDRAS), allowing to combine and monitor a wide range of information sources (news media, social media/blogs, specialized news aggregators) relevant for the detection an d monitoring of public health events in one platform. The first version of HDRAS is currently pilot tested at WHO Headquarters. Interns who serve as part of the RAS team will support the identification, monitoring and follow up of potential health threat s by: using the platform HDRAS; carrying out an initial short risk assessment of the identified potential health threat; discussing with the team any necessary follow up actions; following up on new or ongoing health threats in coordination with the WHO Re gional Offices and technical experts units at WHO . Interns are needed year round and applications can be accepted as late as the semester before the student plans to begin the internship. 4 HIV/AIDS http://www.who.int/hiv/en/ Globally only 51% of people living with HIV know of their status.

Interns are accepted year round and summe r opportunities may be more difficult to obtain due to WHO staff travel schedules. Applications can be submitted as late as the semester before the student anticipates beginning their internship. **Students who are interested in HIV/AIDS prevention educa tion (as opposed to healthcare and treatment) should send an email to the practicum coordinator including a resume and statement of interest. This information can be shared with our WHO contact for possible opportu nities with partner agencies (examples: U NICEF, UNAIDS) . Please note that internships with these other entities are not eligible for the WHO -specific funding and would need to apply for the general practicum/capstone funding.
