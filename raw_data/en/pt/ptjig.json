This is something we will further explore in my webinar in which I speak about the wisdom of Julian of Norwich and how her beautiful revelations allow us to flourish during the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. I recently came across a very interesting paper exploring how stress and depression impair the immune system. Furthermore, the study found that emotional stress can weaken the body's ability to develop an effective immune response to vaccines. The study found that emotional stresses and certain health behaviours can alter the body's ability to develop effective immunity from a vaccine. The authors of the study indicated that vigorous exercise and getting a good night sleep can help improve the effectiveness of a vaccine. Now this got me thinking. We know how aromatherapy can play an important role in allowing us to flourish by improving our mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. We also know how effective essential oils are at reducing stress and anxiety and improving the quality of our sleep - factors that contribute to a weaker immune response to the vaccine. Therefore, I believe that essential oils can also assist in maximising the effectiveness of vaccines by reducing stressors that are known to weaken our immune response to vaccines. I have chosen four very important essential oils that allow us to flourish and help reduce those factors that can impede vaccine effectiveness. These four oils are: There are many others that I could have chosen, but these four are easily accessible and not too expensive. Choose How You Want To Feel | | Relaxed Lavender is the ideal oil to improve the quality of your sleep, to help reduce anxiety and to revive our spirits when we feel emotionally depleted and depressed. The floral herbaceous scent of lavender is comforting and it is often recommended whenever we need to integrate our spirituality into everyday life. Something that I believe is so important to help us deal with the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. | | Balanced The divine floral and fresh herbaceous aroma of geranium is uplifting and relaxing. Geranium is ideal when we feel exhausted due to mental and emotional stress associated with overwork or worry. The energy of geranium is comforting and nurturing and it helps us to reconnect whenever we feel lost, alienated and disconnected from the world. | | Uplifted The vibrant fresh aroma of sweet oranges reminds us that all will be well. A phrase that is attributed to Julian of Norwich. It nourishes the soul and reconnects us with our compassion. It helps us to embrace gratitude another important aspect of flourishing. The constant barrage of negative news regarding the pandemic is weighing down heavily on us. It is not surprising that we feel overwhelmed, burdened and exasperated. Sweet orange reminds us to not take life to seriously and to lighten up now and then. | | | | Invigorated The revitalizing intense aroma of peppermint is so invigorating and stimulating. Peppermint is the oil of choice if we fall into a slumber of apathy and resignation that makes us feel lethargic and we feel that all is lost. It helps us to see a new perspective of life, and provides the strength and clarity we need to promote inspiration and new insights. It also strengthens our self-esteem and confidence - another important aspect of flourishing. I would like to share with you some simple blends using these four essential oils. By simply changing the ratio of essential oils in the blend you can change to main focus of the blend. These blends are for a diffuser; however, you can use them in a bath or add them to a base oil for massage. I hope that you are flourishing during these challenging times.
