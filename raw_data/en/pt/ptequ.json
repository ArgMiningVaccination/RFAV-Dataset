Methods: A convenience sample of men aged 18 to 45 years read a one-page information sheet about HPV and the HPV vaccine, then completed a 29-item questionnaire. 2 tests were used to determine whether differences in demographic, sexual, and vaccine-related variables existed between levels of wanting the HPV vaccine. Results: Positive correlates of HPV vaccine acceptance included higher education ( P < .0001); hispanic ethnicity ( P = .0003); wearing a seat belt most of the time ( P = .02); regular tobacco use ( P = <.001); not being sexually active ( P = .0008); history of more than 10 female sexual partners ( P = .0004); not having oral sex ( P = .045); extreme worry about vaccine side effects ( P < .0001); extreme concern about vaccine safety ( P < .0001); the importance of getting vaccines ( P < .0001); familiarity with HPV ( P < .0001); and extreme importance of receiving the HPV vaccine ( P < .0001). Conclusions: Men with greater general education, high-risk behaviors, and knowledge about HPV are more likely to want the HPV vaccine. Focused educational efforts should facilitate even wider acceptance of the HPV vaccine by men.", "sitename": "American Board of Family Medicine", "date": "2009-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Advanced Search Comparison of Demographics With Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Preferences * Value from 2 tests.
