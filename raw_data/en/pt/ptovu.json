The granddaughter of Auschwitz survivors, I grew up with a pervasive sense of fear and anxiety, and I never felt safe to be in my body. Although I had always been an artistic and creative child, I moved more and more to locating myself in the cognitive realm, at the great expense of having a felt sense of myself, of my ancestors, and of spirit. After struggling for some time to force myself into an academic mold, I experienced a \"rock bottom\" in my mid-twenties that propelled me on a different path. I found my way back to Judaism through the doors of a Renewal synagogue in San Francisco, and later through the rich community of Kohenet. I entered Jungian analysis and began to listen to my dreams, and to my grief. I started to reclaim my connection to intuition, heart-knowing, art, poetry, and movement. I decided to leave my PhD program in Comparative Literature and go to graduate school for Counseling Psychology. Since then, my passion for psychology (the study of Psyche\u2014or soul) has continued to deepen. My interests (and insatiable curiosity!) encompass polyvagal theory, the science/art of love and attachment, somatic psychology, bodywork, intergenerational trauma, a wide range of holistic healing modalities, the world of dreams and imagery, and the exploration of many forms of spiritual practices. As a spiritual counselor and somatic practitioner, my kavanah, or heart's direction, is to offer support in the deeper sensing of \"God in the body.\" To walk with you as you cultivate a felt sense of connection to your self, your loved ones and community, ancestors, spirit, and the more-than-human world. To be a companion and a guide through some of the more shadowy realms\u2014those of shame, wounding, rage, or grief. To help you become curious about your inner experience and the vast wisdom that your body holds. To best be of service in my work (and because I'm obsessed with mind-body healing!), I'm committed to ongoing education, mentorship, and professional development.
