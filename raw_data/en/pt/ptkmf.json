During the past year, it has consolidated the restructuring initiated in 2011 and is now organised around seven thematic centres and a division for surveillance and outbreak response (see Figure 1).The NICD is also aggressively pursuing the recruitment of epidemiologists to complement the laboratory-based expertise in communicable diseases for which it has become renowned. The expansion of activities aims to entrench NICD in comprehensively servicing the communicable diseases agenda in South Africa's public health arena. Although increasingly focused on its public health orientation, NICD nevertheless continues its pursuit of research excellence and its quest to be a resource for training not only South Africans but also scientists from other African countries.National Institute for Communicable Diseases Professor Shabir Madhi Executive Director Director Section Deputy DirectorSection Deputy Director Centre for Enteric DiseasesCentre for Respiratory Diseases and MeningitisCentre for Emerging and Zoonotic DiseasesCentre for Opportunistic, Tropical and Hospital InfectionsCentre for Vaccines and ImmunologyCentre for TuberculosisCentre for HIV and STIs Administration Division: Business Manager- Procurement / Finance / HR / IT / QA / Receiving Office / Communications Division of Surveillance and Outbreak Responses: GERMS-SA/NMSU + Outbreak Response Unit + Travel medicine Global Diseases Detection Programme (including training - FELTP Programme)Section Deputy Director Figure 1: The NICD organogram5 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 1 As part of the restructuring, it is expected that each centre will develop a portfolio of activities spanning basic science research, laboratory-based surveillance, molecular characterisation of infectious pathogens, and field epidemiology. Although increasingly focused on its public health orientation, NICD nevertheless continues its pursuit of research excellence and its quest to be a resource for training not only South Africans but also scientists from other African countries. The groundbreaking science at NICD was illustrated by research published in Nature Medicine during 2012. The study led by Dr Penny Moore and Professor Lynn Morris provided insights into new potential targets for the development of an HIV vaccine, which has remained elusive to scientists globally. Centres at NICD have also been involved in measuring the impact on improving child health through the introduction of life-saving vaccines, such as those for rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate, since they were launched in South Africa's public immunisation programme. These studies will inform not only assessments of the health gains but also the future planning of interventions aimed at reducing mortality among children under five years of age. In addition, NICD has initiated a national survey of drug-resistant (including multidrug-resistant) tuberculosis (TB). Samples from approximately 160,000 individuals are to be screened to determine the prevalence of TB associated with drug resistance. This will help in tailoring empirical treatment regimens, and will also provide a benchmark against which newer interventions may be evaluated, such as improvement in TB diagnosis using the GeneXpert platform - a cartridge-based, automated diagnostic test. The training offered at NICD includes the two-year Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (FELTP), which attracts postgraduate students from across Africa and is expected to produce epidemiologists with specialised skills and a focus on communicable diseases. Such new expertise will further strengthen public health surveillance of communicable diseases in South Africa. As a World Health Organization (WHO) regional reference centre, NICD continues to service other African countries by providing information on or assistance with diagnostics, training and quality assurance. Furthermore, NICD is home to the only level 4 biosafety laboratory in Africa, placing it in a strategic position to deal with established and emerging highly communicable, infectious disease threats in South Africa and the region. The 2013/2014 period will witness further expansion of NICD at national level, which in part has been made possible through a grant from government, aimed at enabling the institute to take ownership of laboratory-based and active surveillance for communicable diseases in South Africa. This expansion will assist NICD in contributing to the agenda of establishing an efficient National Health Insurance (NHI) programme to help improve the lives of all South Africans. Together with the talent of our personnel, we relish the task ahead and look forward to raising our status further as an internationally acclaimed institute. Samples from approximately 160,000 individuals are to be screened 6 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 1 National Institute for Communicable Diseases The total number of publications generated by public health surveillance and research studies undertaken at the NICD has increased by 37% over the past three years. There were 155 publications in the current 12-month reporting period (2012-2013) compared with 113 publications in 2010. This is reflected by the year-on-year increase in the average number of publications per 12-month time period as shown in Figure 2. Note: The 2011-2012 reporting period was from 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2012 (15 months) and the 158 publications from this period were therefore adjusted to 126 in order to reflect a 12-month reporting period, compatible with the duration of the other two reporting periods.No. of publicationsFigure 2: The number of publications generated by NICD staff for three consecutive 12-month reporting periods 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Reporting period2010 2011-2012 2012-20137 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 2 Emerging and zoonotic diseases It has been estimated that up to 65% of emerging infectious diseases in the past 60 years have been attributed to zoonotic agents such as bacteria. This results in a direct cost of US$20 billion to the affected economies (World Bank, 2010). Zoonotic pathogens continue to emerge; the effects of climate change, urbanisation and farming practices, coupled with increasing travel and trade, are shared drivers globally for infectious diseases. Some have special relevance to Africa, including extensive human-wildlife interaction, increased land-usage and current socio-economic conditions. The public health burden of zoonotic agents in the South African context is still poorly understood. The Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases (CEZD) renders diagnostic expertise and investigatory capacity on highly dangerous bacterial and viral pathogens associated with zoonotic disease in South Africa and on the African continent. The CEZD aims to function as a resource for knowledge and expertise to the South African government, the countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and elsewhere on the African continent, in order to assist in planning relevant policies and programmes and to harness innovation in science and technology to support surveillance, detection and outbreak response systems. In observing this goal, the CEZD supports South Africa's commitment to International Health Regulations. Surveillance and diagnostic services The laboratories of CEZD test viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), arboviral disease, human rabies and rabies-related infections. The laboratory is accredited for a range of diagnostic tests with the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS). In addition, in 2012 the laboratory obtained approval from the Department Professor Janusz Paweska HeadCEZD supports South Africa's commitment to International Health Regulations. 65% of emerging infectious diseases in the past 60 years have been attributed to zoonotic agents Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases8 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases Sec 2 of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) for tests for Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever and rabies. To provide the diagnosis and perform research on class 3 and 4 viral pathogens, the laboratory manages high and maximum biocontainment facilities. The biosafety level 4 (BSL4) facility was commissioned and certified after extensive refurbishment and upgrading in May 2011. In June 2012, the facility was decommissioned for routine maintenance, constituting the first successful shut-down period for the laboratory. The facility was recommissioned in December 2012. This facility is the only positive-pressure-suit maximum biocontainment laboratory on the continent. In addition, CEZD is tasked with the laboratory confirmation and investigation of anthrax, plague, leptospirosis, cat scratch disease (Bartonella infection) and botulism. The laboratory operates a BSL3 facility and is accredited with DAFF and SANAS. CEZD drives a regional surveillance project for plague (previously the RATZOOMAN project) and is recognised as the anthrax and plague reference laboratory for human diagnostics in South Africa. The transmission electron microscope is an integral tool in the diagnostic arsenal of CEZD, not only in screening for viral pathogens undetected by molecular methods, but in revealing the presence of certain bacteria (particularly obligate intracellular bacteria) and in identifying larger pathogens such as microsporidia. The electron microscope laboratory is also SANAS-accredited. Current research and surveillance Genotyping and epidemiology of Bacillus anthracis in South Africa NICD researcher: Dr J Rossouw Collaborators: Dr W Beyer (University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany) and Dr H van Heerden (University of Pretoria) Subtyping of Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent of anthrax, is problematic owing to its being one of the most genetically homogeneous pathogens. Modern molecular Scientists working in the biosafety level 4 laboratory at CEZD, NICD9 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 2 strain typing techniques, such as multiple- locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), are making it possible to distinguish between outbreak strains, to trace the origin of an outbreak strain back, and to track the routes of transmission of an outbreak strain within and among animal populations. In this study, a 31 loci MLVA was used to study the genotypic diversity of southern African B. anthracis isolates (collected 1960 to 2013) in relation to the spatial and temporal dynamics behind the spread of the disease and possible relationships between genotype and host species. Sindbis fever in South Africa, 2006-2010 NICD researchers: N Storm, Dr J Weyer, V Dermaux-Msimang, Professor JT Paweska Collaborators: Professors W Markotter and LH (University of Pretoria, Viral Zoonosis Group) Sindbis virus (SINV) is an avian mosquito- borne virus. Sindbis cases are confirmed in South Africa annually. The study provided basic descriptive epidemiology for Sindbis fever cases that were laboratory confirmed during 2006-2010 based on retrospective data analysis. Although SINV infection is generally considered to cause mild and self-limiting disease, it is noteworthy that the patients in this study did seek medical consultation and testing. It may be suggested that SINV infection be considered a differential diagnosis for mild flu-like illness, especially during periods of increased mosquito activity. Human Wesselsbron disease cases, South Africa 2010-2011 NICD researchers: Dr J Weyer, Dr J Thomas, AA Grobbelaar, A Kemp, Prof JT Paweska Wesselsbron disease is a neglected, mosquito- borne zoonotic infection reported from Africa. The disease primarily affects sheep and other ruminants with incidental spillover to humans. This study reports on the clinical histories of two human cases of Wesselsbron disease that were laboratory confirmed during the 2010/2011 Rift Valley fever outbreak investigation in South Africa. This report describes the first confirmed human cases of Wesselsbron disease since 1996. Surveillance for zoonotic pathogens in South African batsNICD researchers: Professor JT Paweska, P Jansen van Vuren, Dr J Weyer, A Grobbelaar, A Kemp Collaborators: Professor W Markotter (University of Pretoria, Viral Zoonosis Group, Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology) The CEZD in collaboration with the Microbiology Department of the University of Pretoria is conducting research on bat-borne viral zoonotic pathogens in South African bat populations. Bats are increasingly being implicated as hosts of zoonotic pathogens of potential public health importance, including paramyxoviruses, rabies-related viruses, filoviruses and coronaviruses. Serological results of this study suggest the presence of rabies-related viruses and filoviruses in cave-dwelling fruit and insectivorous bats in 10 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases Sec 2 Limpopo province. Intensive monthly sampling of the affected bat roost is ongoing, to understand better the seasonality and ecology of these pathogens in bat populations. Teaching and training In addition to extensive in-house training of staff in specialist techniques and the requirements for working in BSL3 and BSL4 biocontainment facilities, the CEZD contributes to human resource capacity development by supporting postgraduate studies in the fields of medical microbiology, medical virology and public health through collaborative projects with South African universities as well as universities elsewhere in the world. In addition, the CEZD is involved in training microbiology and clinical pathology registrars, intern scientists and technologists on an ongoing basis. International scientists frequent the laboratories for specialist diagnostic training, for training related to working in biocontainment facilities and for collaborative research projects. The CEZD coordinates a number of formal training programmes and is often requested to coordinate specialist diagnostic workshops. This includes training environmental health officers from the City of Johannesburg (Gauteng) on the dissection and storage of rodent organs for plague surveillance purposes. A regional workshop on the laboratory diagnosis of emerging and dangerous pathogens was held on 10-14 September 2012. The workshop was sponsored by the World Health Organization as part of the activities of the Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN). The delegates represented 11 countries from all over Africa and focused on the establishment of diagnostic capacity for the haemorrhagic fever viruses in the countries where these diseases occur. Professional development Eight MSc students and one PhD student who were supervised or co-supervised by CEZD staff graduated during the review period.

One CEZD staff member registered for a BSc (Microbiology with Business Management) at UNISA. Research output Updated publications and conference contribution lists are available through the centre webpage located at www.nicd.ac.za. Publications The CEZD published a total of 15 papers in peer-reviewed journals and one book chapter during 2012/2013. The top five publications from this list are as follows. Bats' susceptibility to Marburg virus Paweska JT, Grobbelaar AA, Birkhead Clift S, Swanepoel R, Kemp A. Virological and Rousettus experimentally fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates in Africa. The Egyptian fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, is currently regarded as a potential reservoir host for Marburg virus (MARV). This work confirms the susceptibility of R. aegyptiacus to infection with MARV and contributes to establishing a bat-filovirus experimental model. Further studies are required to uncover the mode of MARV transmission, and to investigate the putative role of R. aegyptiacus as a reservoir host. Bartonella Trataris-Rebisz AN, Bartonella quintana seroprevalence in HIV Participants in the regional workshop on the Laboratory Diagnosis of Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens receive training in handling specimens in a Class III biosafety cabinet in a mock BSL3 laboratory setting12 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases Sec 2 positive, HIV-negative and clinically healthy volunteers in Gauteng province, South Africa. Annals of the Australasian College of Tropical Medicine 2012; 13: 10-12. Synopsis: Bartonella is a genus of opportunistic, Gram-negative bacilli transmitted from animals to humans. Bartonellae are emerging pathogens that can cause a variety of clinical manifestations in both immunocompromised and healthy persons. In this study, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in HIV-positive outpatients at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital HIV clinic, sera selected retrospectively from HIV-negative antenatal clinic patients, and clinically healthy volunteers. A high rate of IgM (antibodies) seropositivity in seemingly healthy subjects in this study could be attributed to asymptomatic infections or suggest a low specificity of the IFA in clinically non-infected persons as previously reported elsewhere. Nevertheless, the high seropositivity in the immunocompromised cohort is comparable to rates reported in other studies. Further study is needed to elucidate the role of Bartonella as an opportunistic infection that can potentially cause severe illness in immunocompromised patients. Wesselsbron disease Weyer J, Thomas J, Leman PA, Grobbelaar AA, Kemp A, Paweska JT. Human cases of Wesselsbron and Zoonotic Diseases 2013; 13(5): 330-336.Synopsis: The paper reports on the clinical histories of two human cases of Wesselsbron disease that were laboratory confirmed during the 2010/2011 Rift Valley fever outbreak investigation in South Africa. This report describes the first confirmed human cases of Wesselsbron disease since 1996. Molecular sequencing and analysis of the partial NS5 gene of the Wesselsbron genome were used to identify two circulating clades of the virus in southern Africa. Clade I included isolates collected from South Africa and Zimbabwe, whereas clade II included isolates only from the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. As for other arboviral diseases in Africa, little or no active surveillance is conducted, and the public and veterinary health burden of this disease remains unclear. Rift Valley fever M\u00e9tras R, Porphyre T, Pfeiffer DU, Kemp A, Thomson P , Collins LM, White RG. Exploratory space-time analyses of Rift Valley fever in South Africa in 2008-2011, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 6(8): e1808. Synopsis: The factors explaining the spread of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in domestic livestock during an epidemic are attributed to short- and long-distance mechanisms, including active and passive vector dispersal and movements of infectious animals. However, the scarcity of data makes it difficult to identify and quantify these mechanisms. 13 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 2 2.5% of the bat colony is actively infected We have generated hypotheses on the possible mechanisms involved in RVF spread in South Africa between 2008 and 2011. We used descriptive statistics and estimated the space-time interactions as an indicator of the underlying transmission process. Our results confirmed the presence of an intense, short, initial transmission process that could be attributed to active vector dispersal, plus a second transmission event of lower intensity and greater spread that may have resulted from the movements of infectious animals, vector dispersal by wind or artificial vehicle, or emergence of other viral foci. Further data collection and modelling tools are required to confirm these hypotheses Marburg virus Amman BR, Carroll SA, Reed ZD, Sealy TK, Balinandi S, Swanepoel R, Kemp A, Erickson BR, Comer JA, Campbell S, Cannon DL, Khristova ML, Atimnedi P , Paddock CD, R, Katongole- TG, Nichol ST, Towner JS. virus circulation in juvenile Rousettus aegyptiacus bats coincide with periods of increased risk infection. PLoS Pathogens 2012; 8(10): e1002877. Synopsis: Marburg virus, like its close relative Ebola virus, can cause large outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever with case fatalities nearing 90%. For decades the identity of the natural reservoir was unknown. However, in 2007, Marburg viruses were isolated directly from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) that inhabited a Ugandan gold mine where miners had previously been infected. Soon after, two tourists became ill with Marburg virus after visiting the Python Cave, a popular attraction in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park and less than 40 km from the mine. Python Cave is also home to a large colony of R. aegyptiacus bats. These events prompted a long-term investigation of Python Cave to determine whether R. aegyptiacus in the cave carried infectious Marburg virus genetically similar to that found in the tourists, and what ecological factors might lead to transmission of the virus to humans. In the study, we found that approximately 2.5% of the bat colony is actively infected at any one time and that virus isolates from bats are genetically similar to those from the infected tourists. We also found that specific age groups of bats, juveniles of around six months of age, are particularly likely to be infected at specific times of the year. These times coincide approximately with historical dates of emergence of Marburg virus in humans. Other publications Journal articles Fafetine JM, Jansen van Vuren P , Paweska JT.

A total of seven full-length conference papers were presented during 2012.16 National Health Laboratory ServiceEnteric diseases Data from the South African Health Review 2012/2013 have revealed that the mortality rate of childen under the age of five years has declined rapidly since 2009 and 2011, which is in part attributed to the successful implementation of the HIV-Prevention of Mother to Child Treatment (PMTCT) programme and the introduction of the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines into the national immunisation programme. While these successes should be celebrated, child mortality rates in the poorest quintile are still four times higher than in the wealthiest quintile of the population. The majority of the deaths among the poorest quintile (82.6%) are due to five conditions in children between the ages of one month and one year of age, with half of these children exposed to or infected with HIV. Diarrhoeal diseases are responsible for 20.7% of these deaths, of which 60% are associated with malnutrition.The Centre for Enteric Diseases (CED) was established in 2012 through the amalgamation of the Enteric Diseases Reference Unit and the Viral Gastroenteritis Unit of NICD. The centre is responsible for developing strategies to combat diarrhoeal diseases in South Africa. It monitors trends in diarrhoeal pathogen incidence, the impact of rotavirus vaccine on the clinical and molecular epidemiology of rotavirus-associated diarrhoea and also identifies areas for the introduction of additional interventions and evaluation of future diarrhoeal pathogen vaccines. Surveillance activities The centre focused much of the 2012/2013 period on continuing to provide high quality surveillance data for bacteria and viruses associated with diarrhoeal diseases and on amalgamating the two laboratory units into one functional centre. Centre for Enteric Diseases Dr Karen Keddy Dr Nicola Page Centre HeadsSec 317 National Health Laboratory Service 3,000 specimens, collected as part of the rotavirus sentinel surveillance programme The centre provides regular reports to the Department of Health (DoH), including weekly reports on outbreak-prone enteric pathogens, and monthly reports to the National Outbreak Response Team (NORT). In addition the centre engaged the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (DAFF) on precautionary measures required for humans when administering a new live Salmonella vaccine to chickens and in reviewing current updated research protocols for the Water Research Commission. The centre expanded the surveillance offerings by including detection assays for bocavirus and Campylobacter surveillance and incorporated the Red Cross Children's Hospital into the rotavirus sentinel surveillance programme. Almost 3,000 specimens, collected as part of the rotavirus sentinel surveillance programme between 2009 and 2012, have been screened for human bocavirus infections, with 6.4% testing positive. Members of the centre were trained in methods of Campylobacter detection at the Health Protection Agency, London, UK, and the assays are currently being reviewed and validated. The centre has been actively monitoring the impact of the rotavirus vaccine in the South African expanded programme of immunization (EPI), and current estimates show that rotavirus disease was reduced by 50% in children under five years between 2009 and 2011, with the greatest reductions (up to 64%) seen in children under one year of age. The centre participated in the investigation of outbreaks in Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Western Cape, Free State and Limpopo. The diarrhoeal pathogens implicated in these sapovirus and astrovirus. Current research and surveillance projects The development of real-time detection techniques and increased surveillance of diarrhoeal disease viruses in the South African population (2009-2014) NICD researchers: Dr N Page, Ms S Funding: Poliomyelitis Research Foundation (PRF). Elucidating the diarrhoeal disease burden in South Africa can be achieved only if researchers understand the cause of diarrhoeal episodes. The aim of the project was to develop and use real-time detection techniques to identify enteric viruses, other than rotavirus, and to determine the contribution to the overall diarrhoea burden. Stool samples collected through the sentinel rotavirus surveillance programme between 2009 and 2012 were screened for norovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and bocavirus and other enteric virus strains and to develop detection assays for enteroviruses.Sec 318 National Health Laboratory ServiceTyphoid fever surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa: burden of disease study Principal Investigator: (NICD) Karen H Keddy (Centre for Enteric Diseases) Site coordinators, Edendale: S Haffejee (microbiology), H Dawood medicine), F (NICD) A Sooka (Centre for Enteric Diseases)Investigators: (IVI) F Marks (epidemiologist), J Im (scientist) The lack of credible data on typhoid fever in many African countries has also limited awareness of the disease among clinical and public health providers. Fever-related diseases are mostly diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms. As a result, typhoid fever may be indistinguishable from other serious infections common to Africa such as malaria, tuberculosis and infection due to invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella. This is an international bacteraemia study, to identify which pathogens cause illness in 10 sentinel sites in Africa in patients presenting with fever. Group for Enteric Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Surveillance in South Africa pathogens manager: Ms A Sooka (Centre for Enteric Diseases) The centre does laboratory-based surveillance and characterisation of bacterial enteric disease in South Africa; specifically, on all human isolates from diagnostic microbiology laboratories. The case definition for the laboratory-based surveillance includes all Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae (01 and non-01) and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli isolates from all body sites, and diarrhoeagenic E. coli isolates from stool only. The case definition for enhanced surveillance isolates includes only those Shigella and Salmonella enterica isolates that are from normally sterile body sites in \"in-patients\" only - that is, the patient should have been admitted to the hospital or enhanced surveillance site. In addition the unit undertakes to serotype Salmonella, Shigella and diarrhoeagenic E. coli (DEC) isolates for commercial purposes. Regular reports on the isolates received are extracted from the database for the purpose of information sharing. Molecular methods may be used to establish strain relatedness in outbreaks. PulseNet Africa NICD researchers: KH Keddy, AM H Ismail, Tau, MA Mthanti Collaborators: P Gerner-Smidt (CDC, USA), PulseNet Africa member countries. PulseNet is an international molecular sub-typing network for food-borne and waterborne disease surveillance. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of bacteria is the primary sub-typing technique used by PulseNet. The network consists of national and regional laboratory networks dedicated to tracking food-borne and waterborne infections worldwide. The Centre for Enteric Diseases, Centre for Enteric Diseases Sec 319 National Health Laboratory ServiceNational Institute for Communicable Diseases is the coordinating laboratory for PulseNet Africa, with member countries including South Africa, Kenya, The Gambia, Senegal, Cameroon, Malawi, Tanzania, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Uganda and Mozambique. The resulting surveillance provides global early warning, detection and investigation of foodborne/waterborne disease outbreaks, emerging pathogens and acts of bioterrorism. Surveillance data help us to understand the molecular epidemiology of enteric diseases in Africa, including diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever. The data are important for preventative strategies planning, such as vaccine development and implementation. Our current PulseNet Africa database has a collection of PFGE patterns for ~2,500 enteric pathogen isolates. Probable common source for Salmonella enteritidis strains isolated from humans with gastroenteritis and from captive wild animals in South Africa NICD researchers: AM Smith, H Ismail, KH Keddy Collaborators: MM Henton (Idexx Laboratories, Johannesburg). as an aetiological agent of gastrointestinal and diarrhoeal disease. Salmonella enteritidis is one of the commonest serotypes associated with food-borne illness. In South Africa, we compared Salmonella enteritidis strains isolated from humans with gastroenteritis and strains isolated from captive wild animals, from June 2011 to July 2012. Animal isolates from five different sources were investigated. With the exception of an isolate from a ground hornbill, all animal isolates (jaguar, crocodile, lion and poultry) showed PFGE pattern matches to a human isolate. Animal isolates showed susceptibility to all antimicrobials tested, with the exception of nalidixic acid resistance in isolates from the lion and poultry source. Our data showed similarities between Salmonella enteritidis strains isolated from humans and captive wild animals. We suggest that the consumption of contaminated poultry products is the common link and source of related human and animal strains. Teaching and training The centre assisted in the training supervision of Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (FELTP) students. The centre offers both short and long courses to microbiology registrars from South African universities in specialised techniques that are relevant for the identification of enteric pathogens. The centre assisted in the training of experiential biomedical technology students from the University of Johannesburg.

It also aims to assist with planning policies and programmes related to the control and effective management of HIV/STIs, and to be a place of academic excellence in terms of research and teaching/training. It has a strong track record in the research disciplines of HIV virology, HIV immunology, HIV/STI epidemiology, HIV/STI diagnostics and HIV-STI interactions, as well as in successful supervision of PhD and MSc students. The centre's leadership team consists of Professor David Lewis (Administrative Centre head, STI Section head), Professor Lynn Morris (HIV Research Section head), Professor Adrian Puren (HIV Sero-Molecular Diagnostics Section head), Professor Caroline Tiemessen (Cell Biology Section head) and Professor Anna-Lise Williamson (HPV Section head). Surveillance and diagnostic services HIV prevalence and incidence surveillance During 2012/2013, the centre supported the 32nd Annual Antenatal HIV-1 Prevalence and HIV Incidence survey of the Department of Health (DoH) and the 3rd South African Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) effectiveness study at 4-8 weeks post-partum. The latter survey has provided supportive evidence of the reduction of HIV transmission from HIV-infected mothers to their offspring as a result of the national PMTCT programme. To improve surveillance of HIV incidence, methods are being applied to various surveys and, since this methodology is new to the field in South Africa, optimal methods for analysis are being assessed. A major activity to strengthen the role of HIV surveillance in the centre was undertaken Professor David Lewis Centre HeadSec 4 To improve surveillance of HIV incidence, methods are being applied to various surveys and, since this methodology is new to the field in South Africa, optimal methods for analysis are being assessed. Centre for HIv and StIs23 National Health Laboratory Servicein collaboration with the United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency (HPA). A senior HIV epidemiologist from the HPA, Dr Alison Brown, and staff from our centre explored the existing national HIV surveillance systems and interviewed personnel from key organisations that play a role in HIV surveillance in South Africa. The results were summarised in a report that outlines the key national HIV surveillance activities, the relationships and interactions among the various key organisations, the nature of the surveillance, the key strengths and challenges and proposals for consideration. The centre and HPA are working towards implementing activities, in phases, to support surveillance at different levels ranging from coordination to development of reports that can be used by the DoH. In addition, the centre provides reference laboratory expert support to other SADC countries undertaking HIV prevalence and incidence surveillance. HIV drug resistance surveillance The centre's HIV drug resistance laboratory is the designated centre for national surveillance activities and also serves as a World Health Organization (WHO) regional HIV drug resistance laboratory. The laboratory has recently extended the scope of testing to include genotyping of dried blood spot specimens in addition to plasma, allowing for surveillance of resistance in paediatric patients. Ongoing surveys of transmitted resistance make use of specimens collected from those young women in their first pregnancy who participate in the annual antenatal clinic survey. Surveys completed in three provinces during the reporting period showed that KwaZulu-Natal and Free State have moderate (5-15%) levels of transmitted resistance for the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug class and low (<5%) levels of transmitted resistance for the protease inhibitor (PI) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug classes. Gauteng had low (<5%) levels of transmitted resistance for all drug classes. This is the fourth consecutive year in which transmitted NNRTI resistance has been seen in KwaZulu-Natal. The data indicate that, while transmitted HIV drug resistance remains fairly low within South Africa, vigilance is required and ongoing genotypic surveillance is essential to inform the national HIV treatment programme on the likely effectiveness of antiretroviral drug regimens. STI clinical syndrome, aetiological and gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance The Gauteng STI surveillance project, run by the centre in collaboration with the Gauteng Department of Health, continued to collect STI syndrome data from public clinics throughout the review period. In 2012/2013, in collaboration with the national and provincial DoHs, Alexandra Health Centre and NHLS laboratories, the centre undertook aetiological surveillance of three major STI syndromes (male urethritis syndrome, MUS; vaginal discharge syndrome, VDS; and genital ulceration syndrome, GUS), as well as surveillance of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance, in Gauteng (Johannesburg), Sec 424 National Health Laboratory Service 99% of cervical cancers have detectable HPV DNA Mpumalanga (Nelspruit) and the Northern Cape (Kimberley). Molecular, serological and bacteriological methods were employed to test for a variety of STI pathogens. In 2012, the centre reported the first confirmed gonorrhoea treatment failure with an oral cephalosporin (cefixime) in Africa. Within South Africa, the DoH's 32nd Annual Antenatal HIV-1 Prevalence and HIV Incidence survey was also modified to include HSV-2 testing in the place of syphilis; the HSV-2 testing was applied to at least four of the provinces surveyed as part of an initial pilot to assess the value of including HSV-2. Within the southern African region, the centre also provided technical assistance to the Namibian Ministry of Health and Social Services with their planned 2013 national STI survey. HPV surveillance Specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are causally associated with cervical cancer and at least 99% of cervical cancers have detectable HPV DNA. In South Africa the annual number of new cervical cancer cases in the year under review was 5,543 and the number of deaths was 3,027, but these figures are likely to underestimate the burden of disease because the cancer registry in South Africa has not been fully functional for some time. South Africa also has some of the world's highest reported prevalence of HPV in women with normal cytology. Women with persistent HPV infection are at a great risk of progressing to cervical cancer. In 2014, South Africa plans to introduce vaccination against human papillomavirus in quintile one, two, three, and four schools, covering around 520,000 girls. A necessary part of the introduction of the vaccine should be a surveillance programme. The centre obtained funding from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Global Disease Detection from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support HPV surveillance at community level (family planning clinic attendees) and among women with abnormal Pap smear results attending colposcopy clinics. Centre staff provided technical support to DoH on the relative merits of HPV vaccination through an Expert Working Group that reported to the National Advisory Group on Immunization. HIV-1 rapid testing quality assurance and post-marketing surveillance of HIV rapid test devices The DoH has expanded HIV testing in South Africa in the past three years with well over 15 million individuals tested. A critical component is the quality assurance of testing. PEPFAR-funded quality assurance coordinators conducted 235 on-site monitoring and evaluation visits to assess progress with HIV rapid testing and specifically the introduction of the use of internal quality assurance specimens as part of quality assurance monitoring. Three HIV rapid test kits were awarded the government tender in 2011. A key follow-on activity undertaken by the centre was the post-marketing surveillance of the lots/batches of devices prior to release in testing sites. Sec 4 Centre for HIv and StIs25 National Health Laboratory ServiceHIV external quality assurance (EQA) schemes Centre staff coordinated the HIV EQA programme for NHLS-participating laboratories. Three NHLS serology surveys were assigned to 181 laboratories and four HIV RNA survey panels, composed of two NHLS-specific regulatory and two international panels, were assigned to 18 participating laboratories. Participation in the schemes is mandatory, and in 2012 a review by the NHLS Quality Assurance department included reporting of both the serology and molecular scheme results as part of the quality improvement processes. In addition, the centre provided HIV EQA support to other SADC countries. Support for HIV vaccine trials The centre continued to provide results from validated end-point humoral antibody and molecular HIV assays for the HIV Vaccine Trial Network (HVTN). This includes the HVTN 073e trial, which incorporated a protein boost designed to elicit better antibody responses. While this resulted in higher binding and neutralising antibody titres, these were not broadly neutralising for primary viruses. However, our 2012 publication in Nature Medicine detailing the evolution of broadly neutralising antibodies in infected subjects provides encouraging confirmation that the human immune system has the capacity to develop such antibodies, and suggests new pathways to immunogen design. Selected current research projects Correlates of protective immunity to HIV-1: a focus on CCR5 (2002-2018) NICD researchers: Professor C Tiemessen, Dr M Paximadis, Schramm, Dr S Shalekoff Collaborators: Dr N Martinson (PHRU), Dr D Spencer (Right to Care), Dr P Ive (CHRU) Funding: Poliomyelitis Research Foundation (PRF), SHARP There is little doubt of the importance of CCR5, an important molecule that serves as a co- receptor for HIV-1 and that has many functions in immune response regulation. Striking ethnic or population differences exist in single nucleotide polymorphism frequencies of CCR5. This study particularly focuses on host genetic variances and on how differently CCR5 is expressed on various immune cells in South African black and Caucasian individuals. These populations have divergent evolutionary histories and so provide interesting models for study to elucidate further the factors contributing to differential CCR5 expression and HIV-1 infection/disease outcome. Comparison of allele-specific PCR and ultra-deep sequencing for NNRTI resistance mutations (2011-2012) NICD researchers: GM Hunt, L Morris Collaborators: Dr A Moorthy (John Hopkins University, USA), Professor A Coovadia (Rahima Moosa Mother & Child Hospital), Professor EJ Abrams (Columbia University, USA), Dr R Strehlau (Rahima Moosa Mother & Child Hospital), Dr L Kuhn (Columbia University, Sec 426 National Health Laboratory ServiceUSA) and D Persaud (John Hopkins University, USA) Funding: NICHD, Secure the Future Foundation The levels of HIV drug resistance mutations Y181C and K103N in the blood of 105 subtype C HIV-infected infants who failed single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis for HIV transmission were compared using two ultra-sensitive methods. Significant correlations were seen between allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and ultra-deep pyrosequencing the detection the five (1%) Y181C and 11 (2%) samples, the majority (3/5 Y181C and 8/11 K103N) were at very low levels (5%), most likely due to stochastic variations in the appearance of each mutant in each specimen tested. AS-PCR thus provides a robust, rapid, and cost-effective method for targeted detection of low-frequency HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants and would be suitable for surveillance purposes. Sensitivity of drug-resistant HIV-1 isolates to second generation NNRTIs (2011-2013) NICD researchers: Dr AE Basson, Professor L Morris Collaborators: Dr C Hoffman (Johns Hopkins University, USA), Dr D Katzenstein (Stanford University, USA) Funding: PRF Etravirine (ETR) and rilpivirine (RPV) are second generation NNRTIs with a high genetic barrier to the development of resistance and a mutation profile that only partially overlaps that of efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). Samples from patients failing a standard first-line regimen were tested using an in-house single-cycle HIV-1 phenotypic assay to assess their susceptibility to first- and second- generation NNRTIs. Our data suggest that HIV strains from patients failing EFV or NVP would show sensitivity to ETR/RPV and as such these second-generation NNRTIs would be suitable for use in South Africa. Neutralising antibody response in the HVTN 073E vaccine trial (2012-2013) NICD researchers: Dr N Mkhize, Ms T Hermanus, Professor L Morris Collaborators: Dr G Gray (PHRU), Dr A-L Williamson (UCT), Dr C Williamson (UCT), Dr D Montefiori (Duke University, USA), Dr G Tomaras (Duke University, USA) Funding: HVTN HVTN 073E is a phase 1 placebo-controlled study extension to HVTN 073/SAAVI 102, to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Novartis Sub C gp140 vaccine with MF59 adjuvant, as a boost following SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine and SAAVI MVA-C vaccine, in HIV uninfected healthy adult participants in South Africa and the USA. Participants received DNA/ MVA with a protein boost (T1/T2), DNA/MVA with a placebo boost (T1/C2), placebo with a protein boost (C1/T2), or double placebo (C1/C2). Neutralising antibody responses against Tier 1 viruses and Tier 2 viruses were consistently stronger in T1/T2. Similarly, binding antibody titres were highest in the protein-boosted group that had been primed with DNA/MVA. These data emphasise the importance of including protein in vaccine regimens to stimulate humoral immunity. Sec 4 Centre for HIv and StIs27 National Health Laboratory ServiceEvolution of an HIV glycan-dependent broadly neutralising antibody epitope through immune escape (2011-2012) M BE Lambson, Ms N Ranchobe Professor L Morris Collaborators: Dr ES Gray (Edith Cowan University, Australia), Mr D Sheward (UCT), Mr S Bajimaya (Harvard Medical School, USA), Dr M Abrahams (UCT), Dr L Ping (University of North Carolina, USA), Dr N Ngandu (UCT), Professor Q Abdool Karim (CAPRISA), Professor SS Abdool Karim (CAPRISA), Dr RI Swanstrom (University of North Carolina, USA), Dr MS Seaman (Harvard Medical School, USA), Professor C Williamson (UCT) Funding: CAPRISA, DST, NIH This study showed, in two HIV-1-infected individuals who developed broadly cross- neutralising (BCN) antibodies targeting the glycan at Asn332 on the gp120 envelope, that this glycan was absent on the initial infecting virus. This BCN epitope evolved within six months through immune escape from earlier strain-specific antibodies and manifested as a shift of a glycan to position 332. Both viruses that lacked the glycan at amino acid 332 were resistant to the Asn332-dependent BCN monoclonal antibody PGT128, whereas escaped variants that acquired this glycan were sensitive. Analysis of large sequence and neutralization data sets showed the 332 glycan to be significantly under-represented in transmitted subtype C viruses compared to chronic viruses, with the absence of this glycan corresponding with resistance to PGT128. The Orange Farm study part 2: a community study of male circumcision (2007-2014) NICD researchers: Professor A Puren, Professor D Lewis, Ms E Cutler, Ms B Singh, Ms V Maseko Collaborators: Professor B Auvert (INSERM, University of Versailles), Dr D Taljaard (Progressus/CHAPS) Funding: ANRS This project, which commenced in the latter part of 2007, aims to assess the impact of voluntary, safe, medical male circumcision on STI infections in sub-Saharan Africa. The centre continues to provide laboratory testing as part of this research activity. The male circumcision study has also provided an opportunity to assess the use of HIV incidence assays, such as the limiting antigen avidity index (Lag AI) assays, as an alternative or improved assay compared to the BED capture ELISA. A study of the distribution of HPV infections in penile tissues and foreskin surfaces, as well as the effect of soap-washing on HPV detection, formed the basis of an MSc dissertation. Molecular detection of polymorphism and mutations in the HSV-2 gene encoding UL23 thymidine kinase associated with acyclovir resistance Johannesburg, South Africa (2010-2013) NICD researchers: Dr E M\u00fcller, Magooa Funding: PRF Acyclovir (ACV) was added in late 2008 as part of the first-line syndromic management treatment algorithm for genital ulceration Sec 428 National Health Laboratory Servicein South Africa. To assess the prevalence of mutations in the viral UL23 gene that codes for thymidine kinase, the main mechanism of ACV resistance, among HSV-2 virions detected in genital ulcer specimens, pre- and post-introduction of ACV, the UL23 gene was amplified and fully sequenced using 254 HSV-2 positive specimens obtained from genital ulcer patients recruited in Johannesburg (2007- 2011). Although we identified a number of nucleotide UL23 gene mutations, no evidence was found of known ACV resistance mutations in HSV-2 virions following the addition of ACV as Radebe, V Maseko Collaborators: Dr K Rebe (Ivan Toms Centre for Men's Health and ANOVA Health Institute), Professor J McIntyre (ANOVA Health Institute), Dr Oscar Radebe (ANOVA Health Institute) Funding: USAID The centre, in collaboration with the ANOVA Health Institute, determined the prevalence of gonococcal and chlamydial infections at urethral, rectal and pharyngeal sites in symptomatic and asymptomatic MSM attending the Ivan Toms Centre for Men's Health in Cape Town. Overall, approximately a quarter of the MSM had at least one of these infections at one of the three anatomical sites. MSM with urethral discharges, attending clinics supported by the ANOVA Health Institute in Cape Town and Johannesburg, were tested for the presence of cefixime resistant Nesseria gonorrhoeae in an attempt to ensure correct management of patients and to inform on the spread of cefixime-resistant gonorrhoea within these high-risk populations. Oral HPV infection in South African men and women recruited for a study on HIV discordant couples (2012-2013) NICD researchers: Professor A-L Williamson, Dr ZZA MbulawaCollaborators: Professor M Hoffman (UCT), Professor D Coetzee (UCT), Professor J Moodley (UCT), Dr D Marais (UCT), Dr L Johnson (UCT) Funding: PRF, SIDA, CANSA, NRF and MRC Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and factors associated with oral HPV infection were investigated in 221 heterosexually active couples. Oral HPV prevalence was found to be 6.8% in the women and 13.5% in the men. In the women, the risk of oral infection with a specific type was significantly increased if the same type was present in the mouth or genital tract of their partner, or in their own genital tract. In men, the risk of oral infection with a specific type was increased only if the same type was present in the mouth or genital tract of their partner. Typing of HPV from a cohort of young women from KwaZulu-Natal (2012-2013) NHLS Research Trust There is limited information on the prevalence of HPV and the HPV types infecting young Sec 4 Centre for HIv and StIs29 National Health Laboratory Service Centre staff trained 1,747 healthcare workers and professionals on quality management systems for HIV rapid testing South African women. This study aimed to determine the HPV type-specific prevalence in 223 young women in a longitudinal study. Cervico-vaginal lavage (CVL) specimens were collected at baseline and quarterly visits from sexually active HIV-negative women from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, who were 30 years of age. The Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping assay was used to determine HPV types from 434 CVL specimens. HPV prevalence was found to be: 67.3% (150/223) baseline, 65.1% (69/106) at the second visit, 60.9% (42/69) at the third visit. HPV prevalence was high in this population compared to other studies performed on HIV-negative populations of similar age. Grant funding Funding to support the centre's work was obtained from the following organisations: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, PEPFAR and Global Disease Detection funds) Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative's CANSSA HIV/AIDS network pilot grant Medical Research Council National Health Laboratory Service Research Trust National Research Foundation Incentive Funding for Rated Researchers National Research Foundation Professional Development Programme Poliomyelitis Research Foundation Technology Innovation Agency (SHARP funding: South African HIV/AIDS Research and Innovation Platform) World Health Organization.

Surveillance of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in Gauteng and KwaZulu- Natal provinces, South 4): S334-S338. Synopsis: Surveillance of transmitted HIV- 1 drug resistance was performed using specimens collected as part of the annual antenatal survey and using primagravid women aged under 21 years as a marker for recent infection. Specimens collected between 2005 and 2009 from Gauteng and KwaZulu- Natal provinces were analysed according to WHO-recommended protocols. The data showed low levels of transmitted resistance in Gauteng but increasing levels of resistance to the NNRTI drug class in KZN in recent years.

Evolution of an HIV glycan-dependent broadly neutralising antibody epitope through immune escape. Nature Medicine 2012; 18, 1688-1692. Synopsis: This study showed how broadly neutralising antibodies, the kind of antibodies that are needed for an HIV vaccine, developed in two unusual HIV-infected women. In both cases, in order to escape from less effective strain-specific antibodies, the viruses in these women added a sugar molecule (glycan) that later became the target of new antibodies. These latter antibodies were broadly neutralising and recognised 88% of global HIV strains. These findings were confirmed Sec 432 National Health Laboratory Servicein large sequence data sets, showing that this is a common pattern of evolution, with implications for HIV vaccine design. Picton ACP , CCR5 expression on natural killer and T cell subsets in ethnically divergent HIV-1 uninfected South African populations. Immunogenetics 2012; 64: 795-806. Synopsis: CCR5 plays a critical and central role in HV-1 infection. This study evaluated the influence of CCR5 haplotypes on CCR5 expression on various immune cell subsets, and revealed some interesting findings that may help explain why, in earlier studies, possession of the same CCR5 haplotype associates with different disease outcomes in divergent populations. Furthermore, the importance of evaluating cell types other than CD4+ T cells in protection from HIV-1 acquisition and disease progression was highlighted.

A satellite molecular epidemiology unit based at Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH) in Cape Town, headed by Professor Mark Nicol, focuses on nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance. Surveillance, diagnostic and reference services The centre provides a service for the identification of medically important arthropods for entomologists, medical practitioners and environmental health officers. Malaria vector mosquitoes were routinely identified by the Vector Control Reference Laboratory for the Mpumalanga Province Malaria Control Programme. Laboratory tests were carried out on Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes from various African countries, including South Africa, for species identification and to detect the presence of sporozoites of Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly agent of malaria. Advice and expertise was provided to the Department of Health (DoH) at both the national and provincial levels, with participation on the South African Malaria Elimination Committee. Insecticide resistance studies were carried out in collaboration with the Mpumalanga Malaria Control Programme (MMCP), on behalf of the World Health Organization (WHO) Pesticide Evaluation Scheme. Other specialised diagnostic services were offered by the parasitology and mycology reference laboratories in the fields of opportunistic or unusual parasitic and fungal infections. Molecular tests, particularly PCR and pathogen genomic sequencing, are increasingly being offered. Surveillance functions encompassed national and regional monitoring of cryptococcal meningitis, candidaemia, pneumocystosis, protozoal diarrhoea, and antibiotic-resistant hospital infections. Centre for Opportunistic, t ropical and Hospital Infections Sec 5 Professor John Frean Dr Nelesh Govender Professor Lizette KoekemoerDr Olga Perovic National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 5 In the Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Laboratory (AMRRL), the phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of mechanisms of resistance was especially focused on Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but a reference service was offered for all multidrug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Enhanced surveillance for S. aureus infections is a new addition to the centre's activities. Quality assessment (QA) services provided by the centre contributed to assessing diagnostic laboratory proficiency in South Africa and other African countries. The external QA programmes provided schemes for malaria microscopy, bacteriology, mycology, tuberculosis microscopy and culture, and syphilis serology, and are South African National Accreditation Service (SANAS) accredited for inter-laboratory comparison. The centre has played an active role in reporting on laboratory capacity in the WHO AFRO region for the past 11 years, and has supported QA for laboratories for international malaria vaccine trials (GSK Biologicals) and Global Vaccine-Preventable Invasive Bacterial Diseases sentinel sites. The Centre also houses the National Stock Culture Collection, as well as one of the world's largest collections of medically important arthropods.Outbreak investigations in 2012 Two clusters of malaria cases, including one fatality, were investigated in Gauteng residents without recent travel history. Entomological investigations revealed no evidence of local breeding of vector anophelines and it is likely that the infections were acquired via infected mosquitoes imported from endemic areas in vehicles, containers or by other means (Odyssean malaria). Malaria transmission outside the endemic provinces is of obvious concern, especially if unusual vector breeding patterns are involved. These investigations provide additional support to the DoH in its malaria elimination activities. An outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at private health care facilities in Gauteng was investigated in AMRRL. The Cape Town molecular epidemiology section identified the first patient with carbapenem-resistant OXA- 181-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a local hospital and investigated the spread of this organism among hospitalised patients, including AIDS patients. An outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a paediatric oncology ward was also investigated and managed.38 National Health Laboratory Service In 1999/2000 South Africa suffered the worst malaria epidemic in living memory with hundreds of people dying from the disease Centre for Opportunistic, t ropical and Hospital Infections Sec 5 A cluster of acute respiratory disease cases following a group visit to the 'Bat Cave' at the Sterkfontein cave complex was investigated. Histoplasma capsulatum infection was strongly suspected but laboratory confirmation could not be obtained. The centre contributed to characterising an outbreak of microsporidial infection in renal transplant cases in Cape Town in collaboration with the local clinicians and with Dr M Birkhead, Electron Microscope Unit (CEZD) at NICD. Molecular studies showed that the three patients were all infected with Encephalito zooncuniculi, a parasitic organism. This is primarily an animal pathogen, but is known to be a cause of infections in immunocompromised patients. Current research and surveillance Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors Researchers: L Nardini, Dr RN Christian, Professor M Coetzee, Professor LL KoekemoerCollaborators: N Coetzer (University of Pretoria), Professor H Ranson (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK) In 1999/2000 South Africa suffered the worst malaria epidemic in living memory, with hundreds of people dying from the disease and over 60,000 cases reported. One of the main reasons for the epidemic was the return to South Africa of the Anopheles funestus mosquito after an absence of at least 20 years. We showed that this mosquito was resistant to the insecticides that were being used and this resulted in a policy decision to switch insecticides. Subsequently, research into the insecticide resistance mechanisms and behaviour of this important malaria vector, as well as resistance in the other major malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, has been prioritised. We investigated the detoxification enzymes that are involved in An. arabiensis resistance to DDT and pyrethroids in colonies originating from different geographic origins. These data emphasise the complexity associated with resistance phenotypes and suggest that specific insecticide resistance mechanisms cannot be extrapolated to different vector populations of the same species. Malaria vector control and transmission dynamics Researchers: Dr RN Christian, Ms L Nardini, Dr KS Choi, Mr M Osea, Professor LL Koekemoer, Professor M Coetzee Collaborators: Dr S Blanford, Ms NE Jenkins, Mr BHK Chan, and Professor AF Read (Penn State University, USA); Professor MB Thomas (University of the Witwatersrand); Ms CL Lyons, Dr JS Terblanche, and Dr SL Chown (Stellenbosch University) Our research on entomopathogenic fungi has continued with respect to optimising longevity of the spores. Spore shelf-life under refrigeration surpassed the standard two- year shelf-life expected of a mosquito control product. We expect optimised formulations could improve spore persistence still further.39 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 5 As climates change, concerns have arisen as to how vector-borne diseases will be impacted by changing rainfall patterns and warming temperatures. Despite the importance and controversy surrounding the impact of climate change on the potential spread of malaria, little information exists on the climatic tolerances of the vector mosquitoes. The effects of age, sex and strain (laboratory vs wild adults) were investigated for critical thermal limit determinations for An. arabiensis and An. funestus at all life stages. The findings that female mosquitoes have greater tolerance to thermal extremes may have significant implications for future malaria transmission, especially in areas of seasonal transmission and at the extremes of the vector distribution. The global distribution of malaria vectors was mapped in collaboration with colleagues at Oxford University. This is a follow-on publication to the work published in 2010 by the same authors on the distribution and bionomics of the African malaria vectors. Population genetic studies on the An. funestus group in southern Africa using mtDNA and RFLP markers have been carried out to elucidate further the genetic complexity of this group. Clades I and II (as previously described) have been identified, but additional genetic structuring has been found within An. funestus, An. funestus-like and An. parensis, indicating further subdivisions.Laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance for nosocomial bacteria Perovic, Dr A Moodley Collaborators: GERMS-SA, LARS subgroup Laboratory surveillance for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) provides a platform for future coordination with the generation of reliable data on the occurrence of AMR in different geographical regions. A limited number of nosocomial bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were identified to monitor trends in resistance at sentinel sites at NHLS. Enhanced surveillance for hospital- versus community-associated infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus O Perovic, Dr A Singh- Moodley Collaborators: Dr V Quan, Dr R Kularatne, Dr T Nana, K Baba, N Govender Enhanced surveillance at three sentinel sites that participate in the LARS programme describes the prevalence of methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus, trends in frequency of resistance, and characterises mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Genotypic methods are used to determine the prevalence and pattern of specific antimicrobial resistance genes. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis aid in distinguishing hospital-acquired infections from community- associated infections. Most important, MIC50 and MIC90 on all antimicrobials tested, and 40 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Opportunistic, t ropical and Hospital Infections Sec 5 epidemiological analysis, will estimate the burden of community- vs hospital-associated MRSA. Additionally, clinical data risk factors associated with S. aureus infections will be analysed. Information will feed into a network of national and global data on the antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) using an existing surveillance network in South Africa NICD researchers: B Poonsamy, Associate Professor J Frean, Dr S Walaza, Dr C Cohen Collaborators: SARI Study Group Early in the HIV epidemic in Africa, PCP was rarely diagnosed. More recent studies show that PCP is an increasingly important contributor to pneumonia in Africa. This is in contrast with industrialised nations, where the number of PCP cases has fallen since the early days of AIDS. Surveillance is being done for PCP in adults and children at sentinel sites in North West and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The relative contribution of PCP to the burden of severe acute respiratory infections is being determined in collaboration with the Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, NICD. Analysis of the strain types of Toxoplasma gondii prevalent in humans and animals in South Africa NICD researchers: D du Plessis, parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a significant cause of congenital disease and an increasingly important AIDS-defining opportunistic pathogen. This project is investigating the genotypes and virulence markers of Toxoplasma prevalent in food animals, primary hosts (cats) and high- risk humans, and how they compare with strain types in the rest of Africa and the world. Human cystic echinococcosis in South Africa NICD researchers: KB Mogoye, Professor J Frean Collaborators: Dr P Kern, Dr K Wahlers (University Hospitals, Ulm, Germany), Dr T Romig (Hohenheim University, Germany), Professor M Grobusch (Amsterdam University Medical Centre and University of the Witwatersrand), Dr C Menezes, Professor M Wong (University of the Witwatersrand) Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) is a zoonosis tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It affects various herbivore intermediate hosts (including sheep, cattle, goats and camels) as well as humans, which serve as accidental intermediate hosts. The disease is especially prevalent in pastoral communities, where there is close contact among humans, dogs and livestock. This study used molecular methods to investigate the genotypes and species affecting humans in South Africa. This is the first time that the genetic structure of the genus has been thus characterised in the country.41 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 5 Public health programme: cryptococcal screening Programme partners: of CDC, PEPFAR partners Laboratory-based screening for cryptococcal disease was implemented at the NHLS CD4 laboratory at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital on 3 September 2012. Twenty-six healthcare facilities (including three regional hospitals) that refer specimens to this laboratory participated in the programme. Blood samples submitted for a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count from these facilities were tested for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) using a cryptococcal lateral flow assay (LFA) if the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was less than 100 cells/\u00b5l. Results for patients who test CrAg-positive were communicated by the laboratory to a pre-selected point of contact at each health facility, as well as added to the CD4 laboratory report to alert the healthcare worker of the CrAg test result. Patients with cryptococcal antigenaemia who provided informed consent were followed up prospectively to collect clinical data indicators. Monthly programme updates were included in the NICD's Surveillance Report. By the end of March 2013, 3,142 patients with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 100 cells/\u00b5l had been screened; 144 (4.6%) tested positive for CrAg. Fifty-nine per cent (85/144) of patients were diagnosed at Helen Joseph Hospital and 65% were aged between 30-44 years. Cryptococcal meningitis: survey of clinical practice for amphotericin B toxicity prevention, monitoring and management at GERMS-SA enhanced surveillance sites Researchers: Dr ST Miring, Dr NP Govender, L Sabina, Dr M Fortuin-de Smidt and the GERMS-SA team Amphotericin B is the cornerstone of treatment for cryptococcal meningitis but is associated with several adverse events including serious nephrotoxicity. This may be a barrier to optimal treatment of this severe opportunistic infection. The World Health Organization issued guidance for amphotericin B toxicity prevention, monitoring and management in 2011. From October 2012 through February 2013, clinician questionnaires and additional case report forms were completed to determine the current clinical practice at GERMS-SA enhanced surveillance sites. Detection of cryptococcal antigenaemia from whole blood specimens for rapid diagnosis of cryptococcal disease among HIV-infected adults in South Africa Researchers: Dr NP Govender, TG Zulu, D Lawrie, Govender, S Lindani, Dr VC Quan, Dr L Coetzee and Professor W Stevens Accurate detection of cryptococcal antigenaemia (CrAg) from whole blood would facilitate both point-of-care diagnosis of HIV-associated cryptococcal disease and high-volume, 42 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Opportunistic, t ropical and Hospital Infections Sec 5 laboratory-based screening to detect cryptococcal disease earlier. Whole blood specimens were tested for CrAg using the lateral flow assay (LFA) in three study groups, namely, Group I: patients with laboratory- confirmed cryptococcal meningitis (CM); Group II: patients who had undergone lumbar puncture but had no laboratory evidence of CM; and Group III: patients with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 100 cells/\u00b5l who were being screened for cryptococcal disease. Participants in Groups I and II were prospectively-enrolled in-patients at CMJAH, admitted between March 2011 and September 2012, who provided informed consent for a point-of-care LFA performed by a trained study nurse on fingerprick whole blood. Remnant EDTA-blood samples from participants in Group III were tested with the LFA by the CMJAH CD4 laboratory. Plasma obtained by centrifugation of EDTA- blood was re-tested at a reference laboratory with the LFA and the latex agglutination test (LA), and whole blood was tested with the LFA. Clinical epidemiology of candidaemia at sentinel hospitals Researchers: Dr NP Govender and GERMS-SA team During the reporting period, cases of candidaemia detected at 11 sentinel hospitals in Gauteng and Western Cape provinces were reported to NICD. Bloodstream isolates and clinical data were collected through the GERMS-SA surveillance programme. The aim of the study is to determine clinical factors associated with disease, antifungal drug resistance and death. Molecular typing of Candida isolates causing hospital-associated bloodstream infections Researchers: RE Magobo, S Naicker and Dr NP Govender Selected isolates of Candida spp. submitted through laboratory-based surveillance for candidaemia have been selected for molecular typing. Selected C. parapsilosis isolates have been typed to determine the prevalence of cryptic species, C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis, and to determine the antifungal susceptibility profiles for these cryptic species compared to C. parapsilosis. In addition, the reference laboratory has set up PCR assays for amplification of HS1 Greek glucan synthase, to identify the mutations associated with echinocandin resistance in Candida species. Last, the reference laboratory has set up assays for microsatellite typing of C. parapsilosis to establish strain relatedness and to uncover previously undetected nosocomial outbreaks.

In the past year, the centre has integrated activities of the different sections and expanded existing syndromic surveillance programmes to include multiple pathogens of public health relevance to South Africa. The National Influenza Centre (NIC), the World Health Organization (WHO) reference laboratory for influenza surveillance, and the CRDM via its research facility continue to provide data and circulating influenza types to WHO collaborating centres. The information is used to update records annually of the southern hemisphere vaccines as well as any unsubtypeable influenza strains or emerging respiratory viruses. Through the NIC collaborations CRDM has also been able to respond to new pathogens such as the novel corona virus and avian influenza H7N9. The centre has developed a number of new laboratory diagnostic technologies, one of which has enabled it to introduce syndromic meningitis surveillance. The CRDM conducts ongoing surveillance and research to monitor the impact and effectiveness of the expanded programme on immunisation vaccination for Streptococcus pneumoniae and invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b. The centre continues to work with other national surveillance programmes within NICD (GERMS-SA) and supports the Department of Health (DoH) and WHO in monitoring the impact of vaccines, antimicrobial resistance and outbreak response. A strong research agenda allowed for the development of new laboratory techniques and analysis of epidemiology data that are used to influence policy. The centre is also a source of capacity building and formal training within South Africa and the African region.

Surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatients has been implemented at two primary health clinics adjacent to SARI sites. This programme aims to describe the viruses and bacteria associated with ILI and assess risk factors for SARI in these populations. The Viral Watch programme, operational for the past 26 years, continues to provide national data on circulating influenza strains. An Enhanced Viral Watch programme is operational in urban and rural hospitals in all nine provinces; it aims to monitor influenza admissions to intensive care units, and the samples collected are also tested for additional viruses. Surveillance sites have been introduced at the human-animal interface in areas where avian influenza outbreaks occurred in ostriches.Genetic diversity of human rhinovirus (RV) in patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), South Africa, 2009-2010 NICD investigators: M Pretorius, Dr F Treurnicht, Dr C Cohen, Professor SA Madhi, Professor M VenterCollaborators: SARI surveillance group, Dr S Tempia, CDC (USA) attach\u00e9 to NICD-NHLS Human rhinovirus (RV) is a well established cause of upper respiratory illness but is also detected in cases of SARI as a single or co- infection. The disease association and role of different subtypes is not well described. RV subtype C (RV-C) has been postulated to be associated with more severe illness. The purpose of this study was to characterise the RV species circulating among patients enrolled as part of surveillance for SARI and to describe the clinical presentation. The VP4/VP2 (420 bp) region was sequenced from a selection of the RV single positive samples with available HIV-status data, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RV subtype A (RV-A) and RV-C were more commonly identified than RV subtype B (171/381(45%), 161/381(42%) and 49/381(12%), respectively, with no seasonality identified. On multivariable analysis, RV-C was associated, with having a history of asthma [adjusted relative risk ratio 3.4 (95% CI 1.1-11.1)]. Comparison to mild cases and healthy controls may clarify the disease association. Sec 650 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis Sec 6 Excess mortality due to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children and adults in South Africa, 2000-2012 NICD investigators: Dr S Tempia (USA, CDC attach\u00e9 to Dr S Walaza, Professor SA Madhi, Professor M Venter, Sr J McAnerney, Dr C Cohen Collaborators: SARI surveillance group, Dr A Cohen Influenza Division, National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), CDC and Influenza Programme, CDC South Africa We estimated the influenza- and RSV-associated mortality by applying Poisson regression models to national vital statistics data. In children with respiratory illness <5 years of age, the mean annual number of deaths associated with influenza was 452 (8/100,000 person-years) and that associated with RSV was 546 (10/100 000 person-years). The mortality rate was higher among infants <1 year of age for both influenza (22/100,000 person-years) and RSV (35/100,000 person years). In children <5 years of age, the influenza- associated mortality rate among all respiratory deaths was greater in HIV-infected (83/100,000 person-years) than 9.6-12.6). In persons aged 5 years with respiratory illness, the mean annual number of deaths associated with influenza was 3,613 (8.5/100,000 person-years) and that associated with RSV was 429 (1.0/100,000 person- years). Among individuals 5 years of age, the influenza-associated mortality rate for all-cause deaths was greater in in HIV-uninfected individuals (aRR: 7.9; 95% CI: 7.1-8.9). Estimating the of influenza in South Africa, 2009-2012 NICD investigators: Dr A Cohen (CDC), Dr S Walaza, Professor SA Madhi, Dr J Moyes, Dr S Tempia, A Tshangela, Professor M Venter, Dr C Cohen Collaborators: SARI surveillance group Based on data from the published literature and the SARI surveillance programme, we used a multiplier model to estimate the influenza- associated burden of respiratory disease by extrapolating from one hospital with population denominators the annual national number of ILI cases, respiratory hospitalizations, and in-hospital deaths associated with influenza in South Africa from 2009 to2011. We estimated the burden by age and HIV infection status. On average over the 3 years, there were approximately 6.6 million cases of mild influenza-like illness, 31,000 hospitalisations for influenza-associated pneumonia, and 1,200 in-hospital deaths from influenza-associated pneumonia annually in South Africa. The mean incidence rate per 100,000 population was 13,149 cases of influenza-like illness, 63 hospitalisations, and 3 deaths. The highest number of annual hospitalisations and deaths was among children <5 years of age (a mean of 11,992 hospitalisations and 87 deaths annually) and HIV-infected adults 25-64 years of age (a mean of 10,975 hospitalisations and 951 deaths annually). Annual estimates of burden and mortality assist with planning allocation of resources. In addition these data assist with supporting and expanding prevention programmes such as influenza vaccine programmes.51 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 6 Investigation of avian influenza H5N2 and H7N1 sero-prevalence in humans with an increased risk of exposure during outbreaks in ostriches NICD investigators: Professor M Venter, Dr F Treurnicht, A Buys, R Samudzi, Professor L Blumberg, Ms C Jacobs, Dr J Thomas, Sr J McAnerney Following the previous avian influenza H5N2 and H7N1 outbreaks in ostriches, the centre conducted sero-surveys in high-risk humans involved in these outbreaks. Screening of sera from 207 humans who had had exposure to avian influenza H5N2 and 66 veterinarians, ostrich farmers, farm workers and abattoir workers who were involved in the avian influenza H7N1 outbreak during 2011 and 2012 in ostriches identified 4 people with significant HAI antibody titres to avian influenza H5N2 or H7N1. These included a veterinarian who was actively involved in post-mortem investigations of culled ostriches, a farm worker and 2 abattoir workers. This suggested a low risk of infection for humans involved in controlling these outbreaks, with a sero-conversion rate of 1.4% for avian influenza H5N2 and 1.6% for avian influenza H7N1 viruses. Reported symptoms based on a retrospective questionnaire completed at the time of specimen collection included conjunctivitis and ILI. Replacement and positive evolution of subtypes A and B respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) G-protein genotypes 1997-2012 in M Pretorius, Dr F Treurnicht, Dr J Moyes, Dr C Cohen, Professor SA. Madhi, Professor M VenterCollaborators: SARI surveillance group, Ms Stephanie van Niekerk (Zoonosis Research Unit, Department of Medical Virology, University of Pretoria), Stefano Tempia (United States CDC attach\u00e9 to NICD-NHLS) Of the RSV genotypes previously described in South Africa from 1997 to 2002, only GA2 and GA5 persisted until 2006, but genotype BA had replaced all previous RSV-B genotypes. This suggests that RSV-A may be more established than RSV-B and that positive selection drives evolution. Randomly selected RSV positive specimens (2009-2012) were subtyped, new genotypes: SAA2 (unique to South Africa), NA1, NA2 (Japan) and ON1 (Canada) with a 72-base pair (bp) insertion. The BA8-10. RSV-A's evolutionary rate was slower than RSV-B and seven new positively selected sites were identified in South African strains; two for RSV-A and five for RSV-B. This demonstrates that positive selection drove both genotypes to evolve, resulting in replacement of all previously identified genotypes in South Africa. Validation of new assays to detect atypical pneumonia-causing pathogens and pertussis within the surveillance SARI NICD investigators: F Moosa, M Carrim, Dr N Wolter, Dr M du Plessis, L de Gouveia, Dr A von Gottberg52 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis Sec 6 Collaborators: Dr Jonas Winchell (United States CDC, Atypical Pneumonia Laboratory) Two projects aimed to describe the atypical bacterial pathogens associated with SRI: \"Detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Bordetella pertussis in individuals presenting with severe respiratory and influenza-like illness in South Africa, 2012\" and \"Identification and prevalence of bacteria causing atypical pneumonia in patients with severe respiratory illness and influenza-like illness in South Africa, 2012\" . For the identification of B. pertussis a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) followed by a singleplex RTPCR is used to detect and differentiate B. pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetellaholmesii and Bordetella bronchiseptica. A multiplex real-time PCR identify the atypical pneumonia- causing bacteria. Speciation of Legionella is real-time PCR to detect Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Preliminary results of 810 induced sputum specimens indicated that five (0.6%) were positive for B. pertussis, six (0.7%) for B. parapertussis, eight (1%) for M. pneumoniae, two for and 12 (1.5%) for Legionella spp. Of 3,382 nasopharyngeal specimens tested for Bordetella spp, nine (0.3%) were positive for B. pertussis and seven (0.2%) for B. parapertussis. Preliminary results of the 1,679 nasopharyngeal specimens tested for atypical pneumonia-causing bacteria are as follows: eight (0.5%) were positive for M. pneumoniae and four (0.2%) for pneumoniae.Establishing O Hellferscee, Professor M VenterCollaborators: SARI investigators No epidemiological studies have been conducted to determine the importance and disease association of human bocavirus and human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43) in patients with severe acute respiratory infections, ILI and healthy controls in South Africa over all the age groups. To assess this, RTPCR tests for human bocavirus and human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43) have optimized and incorporated into the existing multiplex real-time PCR that is being used for routine surveillance. Using this assay will provide the opportunity to investigate patients with SARI, ILI and healthy controls from the same community to explore disease severity and virulence mechanisms of the viral pathogens as single or mixed infections. Novel corona virus (EMC-2012) assay development NICD investigators: O Hellferscee, Dr F Treurnicht, Professor M Venter Collaborators: Viral Watch Programme The WHO alerted countries to several reports of a new coronavirus (EMC-2012) associated with severe respiratory disease in patients with an epidemiological link to the Arabian Peninsula in June 2012. The novel coronavirus has thus far been identified only in a small number of cases of acute, serious respiratory illness that 53 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 6 presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The assay for the E protein gene target (UpE) is considered highly sensitive, and has been implemented at the CRDM, since the laboratory is the WHO reference laboratory for testing novel coronavirus in Africa. A second confirmatory PCR on the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) and a pan-coronavirus PCR will be run on all UpE-positive specimens. Serological and RTPCRs R Samudzi, M haemagglutination inhibition assays have been established for serological surveillance for human exposure to the following avian influenza virus strains: inactivated A(H5N2), A(H6N2), A(H6N8), A(H7N1), A(H7N7), and additional antigens can be included as required. Seasonal human influenza virus strains are included as controls. The virology laboratory was accredited by SANAS in May 2011 as well as by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to support diagnostic testing of avian influenza A/H5 in ostriches during the H5N2 avian influenza outbreak, using CDC real-time RT-PCR assay. addition A/H5, A/H7 and A/H9 have been established, which enhance our capacity to provide reference laboratory support for avian influenza virus diagnosis. We have also established the H7N9 typing RTPCR for detecting cases of the emerging strain from China.CRDM contribution to the national GERMS-SA programme The Group for Enteric, Respiratory and Meningeal Disease Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS-SA) is a national laboratory- based population-based active surveillance programme for invasive bacterial and fungal causes of pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoeal diseases. CRDM continues to contribute to the evaluation of the impact of both the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) and the Haemophilus influenzae serotype vaccine (Hib CV) through surveillance for invasive pneumococcal and Hib disease and case-control and other epidemiologic studies. CDRM also contributes data on numbers and serotypes of Neisseria meningitidis and supports diagnostic testing and outbreak response for suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis. Trends and factors associated with invasive non-typeable and serotype b Haemophilus influenzae disease in persons of all ages in South Africa, 2003-2009 NICD investigators: Dr A von Gottberg, Dr C Cohen, Dr A Cohen, L de Gouveia, Dr M du Plessis, Professor S A Madhi Collaborators: GERMS-SA The aim of this study was to describe the trends and factors associated with invasive Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) disease in South Africa, 2003-2009, among persons of all ages. Multivariable analysis, restricted to cases presenting to enhanced 54 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis Sec 6 surveillance sites, was done to compare characteristics of NTHi cases to Hib cases. A total of 2,563 H. influenzae cases in all ages were identified from 2003 through 2009. NTHi accounted for the greatest proportion at 49% (1246/2563), followed by Hib at 33% (860/2563) at 18% (457/2563). Hib among persons <5 years old increased from 10/1,000,000 in 2005 to 21/1,000,000 in 2008 (p < 0.001). Hib incidence among persons 5 years old increased from 0.5/1,000,000 in 2003 to 1.1/1,000,000 in 2009 (p = 0.002). NTHi incidence remained stable among individuals of all ages. Factors associated with NTHi disease compared to Hib disease, after adjusting for other factors, were clinical syndrome (lower respiratory tract infection odds ratio (OR) 8.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.12-16.78; bacteremia: OR 9.24, 95% CI 1.68- 5.35, compared to no predisposing condition), nosocomial infection (OR 5.67, 95 %CI 1.71- 18.82, compared to no nosocomial infection). NTHi cases were less likely to be <5 years old (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.76, compared to 25-44-year age group). A booster dose of Hib vaccine at 18 months of age was introduced in 2010 in South Africa, and ongoing surveillance is essential to monitor trends in Hib disease. Risk factors for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children enrolled in an IPD case-control study in South Africa 2010-2012 NICD investigators: Dr C von Mollendorf, Dr C Cohen, Dr V Quan, S Lindani, N Govender, Dr S Meiring, L De Gouveia, N Naidoo, Dr M Fortuin de Smidt, Dr A Von GottbergCollaborators: GERMS-SA, Dr C Whitney, Dr K O'Brien (CDC) Risk factors for IPD among children eligible to receive PCV-7 were evaluated by a case- control study nested within the GERMS- SA surveillance programme. Controls were matched to cases by age, HIV status and hospital. Among HIV-uninfected children, risk factors for IPD were previous upper respiratory tract infection, daycare attendance, increased numbers of children in household and HIV exposure. Children who had received two or more doses of vaccine were protected. Among HIV-infected children, factors associated with IPD included malnutrition and currently receiving TB treatment. These data provide insight into the groups of children who should be targeted for pneumococcal prevention in the era following vaccine introduction. Meningitis surveillance and new assays Macroarray assay for differential diagnosis of meningoencephalitis in southern Africa NICD investigators: Professor M Venter, Weyer, Dr JT Paweska (CRDM, Special Viral Pathogens Reference Laboratory, Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases) Collaborators: D Zaayman, V Stivaktas, S Goolab, S van Niekerk and Professor R Swanepoel (Zoonosis Research Unit, University of Pretoria) Many cases of acute febrile illness with central nervous system manifestations go undiagnosed, partly because the potential 55 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 6 pathogens are not routinely investigated. We developed a multiplex PCR-based macroarray procedure for the detection of genomic targets of 29 pathogens associated with febrile disease and meningoencephalitis, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Pathogens were identified by hybridization of PCR amplicons with capture probes on a macroarray chip, with colorimetric detection of positive reactions. Positive control specimens for all 29 targets were detected with high sensitivity. In addition, 25 clinical samples previously found positive for a variety of aetiologies of febrile disease and meningoencephalitis plus 2 quality control samples were all identified. Testing of a blinded panel of 16 specimens in triplicate produced results with high repeatability, sensitivity and specificity. Screening of 138 specimens from patients with febrile and/ or neurological signs that tested negative in routine investigations yielded five diagnoses. TaqMan Array Card NICD investigators: Dr N Wolter, Dr M du Plessis, Ms M Moleleki, Ms A McIvor, Dr A von Gottberg, Professor M Venter, Ms O Hellferscee, Professor SA Madhi, Dr A Cohen (CDC), Dr C CohenCollaborators: Professor S Velaphi (Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital), Dr J Winchell, Dr S Dr A Dimirjian, Dr Danielle Iuliano, Dr Marc-Alain Widdowson (CDC, Atlanta, USA) The bacteriology and virology laboratories have set up the technology to test clinical samples using the TaqMan Array Card (TAC). This technology will allow for simultaneous diagnosis of multiple viral and bacterial pathogens from neonates presenting with early-onset and community-acquired sepsis and children <5 years with SARI. The technology will be validated in the South African setting in a project called Sepsis Aetiology in Young Infants in South Africa (SAYISA) using specimens collected from infants at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital and utilized in a case control study evaluating aetiologies of pneumonia (SARI) among children less than five years of age. Inactivated West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine, Duvaxyn WNV, protects against highly neuroinvasive lineage 2 strains in mice NICD investigators: Professor M Venter (CRDM), Mr P Janse van Vuuren, Professor J Paweska (Centre for Emerging diseases and Zoonoses) Collaborators: Ms J Mentoor; Dr J. Williams (Zoonoses Research Unit, University of Pretoria), M Pearce, (Pfizer international) Lineage 2 WNV is endemic to southern Africa and Madagascar, and has recently been associated with encephalitis outbreaks in humans and horses in South Africa, central Europe, Italy and Greece. Commercial vaccines have mostly been evaluated against WNV lineage 1 strains. To evaluate protection of Duvaxyn WNV vaccine against lineage 2 strains associated with encephalitis in South Africa, mice were vaccinated twice intramuscularly three weeks apart, and challenged four weeks later with highly neuroinvasive lineage 1 strain NY385/99 or lineage 2 strain SPU93/01. Neutralising antibody titres were measured at the time of challenge and three weeks later. 56 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis Sec 6 Immunohistochemistry and RTPCR were conducted on the brains of mice that succumbed during the trial, on controls and on vaccinated mice that survived. Duvaxyn WNV vaccine provided complete protection against challenge with lineage 2 WNV and stimulated significant cross-protective neutralising antibodies in mice against lineage 2. Meningococcal serogroup Y lpxL1 variants from South Africa ST-23/ Cluster A3 clonal complex NICD investigators: Dr M Ms N Wolter, Ms P Crowther,Ms C Moodley, Dr C Cohen, Dr A von Gottberg Collaborators: Dr HJ Hamstraand Dr P van der Ley (Department of Vaccinology, National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands), Dr K Schipper, Dr D van de Beek and Dr A van der Ende (Academic Medical Center, Center for Infection and Immunity, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important initiator of host inflammatory responses. Between 5% and 10% of invasive meningococcal isolates harbour underacylated LPS caused by a mutation in lpxL1. These isolates induce a reduced cytokine response in vitro and patients have less severe disease. Patient data and serogroup Y isolates were collected from 2003 to 2007 through national surveillance for invasive meningococcal disease (n = 218). Isolates were characterised and screened for IL-6 induction. LpxL1 15% (32/218). Patients with lpxL1 variants were more likely to be 5-14 years old or 15-24 years old compared to patients <5 years of age, and were more likely to have meningitis than sepsis. On multivariable analysis, age remained significant. Among serogroup Y, lpxL1 variants were associated with cc23 and disease in older children and young adults compared to wild-type strains.

Teaching and training CRDM convened the Annual SARI and rotavirus surveillance investigators meeting on 11 December 2012. Its purpose was to present surveillance results and discuss new projects. CRDM convened the SARI and rotavirus surveillance officer meeting on 3 and 4 December. The purpose was to provide feedback on results, training and updating to all site surveillance officers.CRDM convened the 9th Influenza Symposium, \"Influenza Symposium 2013\" , on 18-19 March 2013 at the James Gear Auditorium, NICD. The first NICD Pneumococcal Surveillance Workshop was held at the NICD 17-19 October 2012. Delegates from 14 African countries met to discuss how to work together and overcome challenges facing surveillance activities in their respective countries. Regional Reference Laboratory activities: CRDM provides laboratory support to southern African countries conducting surveillance for invasive bacterial diseases (IBD) and contributes to overall strengthening of microbiology surveillance in support of new vaccines introduction. During 2012, 796 samples were received from sites in Africa for detection and confirmation of bacterial pathogens. PCR was performed on all cerebro-spinal fluid received and, where positive, molecular serotyping was done. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on viable isolates. Five site-visits of the sentinel surveillance site laboratories and hospitals were carried out in Swaziland (2 sites), Zimbabwe (1 site), Namibia (1 site) and Madagascar (1 site) during 2012. The NIC at CRDM was identified as one of three reference laboratories in Africa to assist with requests for testing severe pneumonia cases with travel history or history of exposure for the novel human coronavirus-2012. The CRDM supported response activities to the novel coronavirus identified in two persons with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia.58 National Health Laboratory ServiceCentre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis Sec 6 Professional development Graduated students: Two completed scientist internships, one BSc Honours, five MSc, one PhD.

Genome Biology 2012; 13: R103. 62 National Health Laboratory ServiceThe functions of the NICD Centre for Tuberculosis (CTB) are to provide public health surveillance for TB in South Africa, specialist diagnostic services, assistance with policy and guideline development as well as standardisation of diagnostic methods, and the development and evaluation of novel technologies to advise strategic planning and policy. One of the main activities this year was and continued to be the development and implementation of an integrated surveillance system providing epidemiological data across the country for the public, the government and the scientific community. The centre also utilises surveillance and microbiological data to design and implement epidemiological research to guide the national response to the TB epidemic. It also supports the national Department of Health (DoH) in the development of new TB guidelines and policy, participates in training programmes and is actively involved in monitoring trends in disease prevalence and TB drug resistance for ongoing evaluation of the impact of TB control measures instituted by the national DoH, as well as early detection of and integrated response to outbreaks. The CTB provides the DoH on an ongoing basis with data on the frequency of resistance to anti-TB drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in South Africa. Based on information stored at the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) of the NHLS, the CTB issues weekly notification of new multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases identified by laboratories of the NHLS to provincial coordinators of the National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTBCP). Surveillance data generated by the centre are available for ongoing assessment of the impact of TB control measures instituted by the national DOH. The centre also plans to assist the TB control activities of other Southern African Development Community countries.Centre for t uberculosis Dr Nazir Ismail Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu Centre HeadsSec 763 National Health Laboratory ServiceCurrent surveillance and research programmes Integrated public health surveillance and reference laboratory services In support of the NTBCP , the CTB conducts national surveillance of new cases of laboratory-confirmed TB and drug-resistant TB including MDR-TB and XDR-TB. This surveillance is essential for assessing the overall performance of the programme in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and guiding targeted action to areas of need to direct human and financial resources. The value of this surveillance is not only to advance policy changes but also to assess these and allow for regular updating to meet the huge challenges to reduce the burden of TB, including drug-resistant TB, in South Africa. TB surveillance based on routinely collected data from corporate data and the electronic TB registries Laboratory-generated data on TB diagnosis and treatment monitoring are available from the CDW for eight provinces from 2004, and, in addition, for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) since 2011. An automated system with electronic matching and allocation of unique patient identifiers was developed to transform specimen-based data to patient-based data. This automated process has been extended with 'probabilistic matching' , to improve data matching further. This has been especially important for TB surveillance as the diagnostic tools used are for both diagnosis and monitoring and therefore specimen-level information needs to be synthesized to a patient-level system. Furthermore, recurrent episodes of infection are not uncommon and being able to monitor these episodes is a special need. Utilisation of the CDW data for surveillance and feedback to district and municipal level over time has the potential to provide information on the rate, nature of TB, and laboratory requisition patterns (penetration rates). Benefits envisaged for such a CDW-based system are the provision of good, timely and accurate surveillance data to the national programme and provincial health departments on MDR-TB and XDR-TB identified throughout the country. The data from CDW are also being linked with clinical data collected via the Electronic TB Register, which includes patients' clinical profiles, treatment histories, and treatment outcomes. The initial linking of these two data sets will provide a rich historical resource of TB in South Africa. The data will subsequently be analysed on a quarterly basis. The data generated will be correlated with TB mortality data, HIV prevalence data and ARV uptake data to draw conclusions on the evolution of the TB epidemic in the context of other relevant public health trends. In addition, routine drug resistance monitoring is being enhanced by matching this data to the Electronic Drug-Resistant TB Register (EDR), which was introduced in 2009 to develop an interface that could, on a daily basis, transfer data relating to MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients into the EDRWeb of the national DoH. The impact of integrating these systems will provide a comprehensive Sec 764 National Health Laboratory Service With a sample size of 160,000 patients to be recruited in over 400 clinics across the country, it is the largest survey of its kind conducted anywhere in the world picture of the burden of disease and also monitor the linkages between diagnosis and treatment - an essential process that is required to reduce this burden. These data will provide the DoH with the information it needs to estimate the impact of its control measures for TB, which is number 8 of the Minister's 10-point plan in the National Strategic Plan 2010-2013. This will also support the assessment of South Africa's performance in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goal 7, which is \"to reduce TB prevalence rates by 50% relative to 1990 levels\" . Survey of drug resistance in TB in South Africa Following the first South African survey in 2001/2002, and as part of the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) Global Tuberculosis Surveillance Project, the second country-wide drug resistance survey (DRS) was started by the national DOH and CTB in June 2012. This major survey is designed to be nationally representative and is geared to determine the prevalence and trend of drug-resistant TB in the nine provinces, as well as describe on a population basis the types of MDR M. tuberculosis-complex strains circulating in the country and HIV prevalence in this group. A population-proportionate cluster sampling strategy was used to determine the sample size and the survey sites and to ensure that the survey population is representative of TB in each of the nine provinces of the country. With a sample size of 160,000 patients to be recruited in over 400 clinics across the country, it is the largest survey of its kind conducted anywhere in the world and will provide a comprehensive picture of the epidemiology of drug-resistant TB in South Africa as well as robust estimates for the nine provinces. Sputum samples from all survey participants are also being examined for HIV antibodies, as well as cultured for TB, and when TB organisms are found to be present, the isolates are tested for susceptibility to 11 anti-TB drugs. This information will be invaluable in guiding future policy decisions on the choice of treatment regimens containing drug combinations appropriate for both drug susceptible and resistant TB, including combinations with the new drugs in the pipeline. The survey has been initiated in all 400 survey clinics across the country and is due to be completed in the second quarter of 2014. Prospective sentinel surveillance of rifampicin-resistant TB in South Africa: GERMS-SA South Africa continued its phased implementation of the Xpert MTB/RIF rapid TB diagnostic test in TB suspects, started in 2012. With the realisation that rifampicin (RIF) resistance is not an absolute surrogate marker for MDR-TB and may vary among provinces, it was decided to study the clinical and epidemiological features of RIF monoresistance as an entity, as distinct from RIF resistance as part of MDR-TB in South Africa. Enhanced surveillance of RIF-resistant Centre for t uberculosis Sec 765 National Health Laboratory ServiceTB is being introduced at sentinel sites of the Group for Enteric Respiratory and Meningeal disease Surveillance in South Africa (GERMS- SA) in order to deliver accurate, timely and detailed information on previous and current antimicrobial use, HIV status and hospital admission data by patient interview or medical record review. Sputum conversion status and early outcome information on patients with RIF-resistant TB at six months after treatment initiation, using clinical data collected on the EDR, will provide evidence-based information for future planning and policy. Enhanced surveillance of RIF resistance was initiated at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in October 2012 as a pilot study and is being phased in at other sentinel sites in the country. TB as a cause of severe acute respiratory infections: SARI Project M. tuberculosis is an important aetiological agent and cause of death in patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Using the NICD enhanced surveillance network, TB as a cause of SARI was surveyed at sentinel sites in hospitalised patients in South Africa. Surveillance officers are operating the SARI programme and are tasked to identify cases that fit the current SARI and TB case definitions. During 2012, TB-incorporated SARI surveillance was initiated at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (Gauteng), Edendale Hospital (KwaZulu-Natal)), Mapulaneng and Matikwana Hospitals and the Klerksdorp/Tshepong Hospital complex (North West province). Oropharyngeal (throat) and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for microbiological investigations in 5-year-old patients or nasopharyngeal aspirates in cases of patients <5 years of age for detection of respiratory viruses. To determine M. tuberculosis as one of the SARI spectrum of aetiological agents, specimens were taken for conventional TB culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST), as well as for PCR-based molecular testing for rapid diagnosis. In addition, clinical and epidemiological information was collected regarding the onset and progression of symptoms, age group, HIV status and immunization history, as well as socio-demographic information through interview, hospital record review and the administration of a questionnaire. This surveillance system adds important information on late-presentation TB disease and profiles the severe cases of TB with increased mortality, constituting a target group of importance for policy decisions. Molecular surveillance of TB The CTB of NICD is in the process of establishing strain typing for drug-resistant TB and integrating this into its surveillance systems. Expertise in strain typing techniques including spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing has recently been developed by the centre. TB genotyping, when combined with epidemiological data, helps to confirm epidemiological links and detect outbreaks and unsuspected transmissions, and Sec 766 National Health Laboratory Serviceserves as a valuable tool to monitor progress toward the elimination of TB transmission. The objectives of this project include: to describe the genetic diversity and identify genotypic clusters of MDR-TB in South Africa; assess the occurrence of common patterns of virulence or/and resistance associated with genotypic clusters of MDR-TB in order to refine MDR-TB treatment strategies; assess the epidemiological and demographic factors associated with genotypic clusters of MDR-TB in order to refine MDR-TB control strategies; and, finally, to describe and monitor the molecular epidemiology of TB in South Africa in order to guide the potential implementation of vaccination programmes in future. The CTB has already introduced molecular- based typing methods for differentiation of M. tuberculosis strains circulating in South Africa. These typing techniques have different discriminatory ability and are regular tools in epidemiological studies involving surveillance and outbreak investigations. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) typing, a technique for DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains, together with spoligo- and MIRU-typing methods, were introduced by the CTB in 2012. RFLP typing is performed by enzymatic restriction of the M. tuberculosis genome into fragments at IS6110 insertion sequence sites, resulting in different numbers and lengths of gene fragments obtained for each strain. This technique has excellent discriminatory power, especially when there are sufficient IS6110 insertion sites in strains, and is regarded as the \"gold standard\" of TB strain typing. Spoligotyping targets polymorphism of various spacer sequences present in the direct repeat (DR) region of the TB genome by a reverse dot procedure. It is less discriminating than RFLP typing and is useful for the identification of M. tuberculosis strains endemic in regions and the study of lineages involved in the evolution of M. tuberculosis over time. PCR-based MIRU typing targets mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs) located in minisatellite-like regions (similar to those found in the human chromosomes), and these regions comprise a variable number of tandemly repeated sequences (VNTRs) in the M. tuberculosis genome. Primers specific for the flanking regions of these genetic elements are used for PCR amplification. MIRU typing has good discriminatory power and is often used in conjunction with spoligotyping. Introduction and evaluation of DNA sequencing platforms The CTB has access to three next-generation sequencing systems: the 454 GS Junior (Roche), the Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) and the MiSeq (Illumina) sequencers, and will evaluate their performance in sequencing resistance genes and phylogenetic markers relevant to the TB control programme. All sequencing platforms rely on sequencing-by- synthesis design but they differ in the details of sequencing chemistry and the approach used to read sequences. Sequencing-by- synthesis relies on template DNA (from Centre for t uberculosis Sec 767 National Health Laboratory Servicelibraries of clonally amplified templates) and genomic DNA, which go through four main processes, starting with DNA fragmentation to generate random overlapping DNA fragments, followed by tagging, amplification and sequence recognition. Early work published by the centre in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology on the Ion Torrent platform has shown that sequencing is a reliable tool for detecting resistance to multiple drugs rapidly and provides additional information on phylogeny. All these are important for patient management and programmatic response planning. Further work has been undertaken to evaluate the other two systems to determine optimal work flows and the most cost-effective approach to utilise these technologies for diagnostics as well as surveillance. This is an exciting and rapidly expanding area and CTB is ensuring that South Africa keeps abreast of the latest technologies and remains at the forefront globally. Performance of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of M. tuberculosis strains, a technique not generally available in TB laboratories, was introduced by the CTB early in 2013 in order to differentiate between strains with mutations-associated high and low levels of resistance to anti-TB drugs. This is an important new development as new data are emerging on the need to re- evaluate standard drug concentrations based on the PK/PD modelling. Thus the ability to determine MICs and also to have data on MICs of circulating strains will be important to determine if current treatment regimens are optimal for both HIV-positive and HIV- negative patients. MIC determinations will be available for specific projects but will also be performed on strains from the DRS to provide baseline data from which to monitor trends. As a special project the CTB started the evaluation and comparison of liquid medium- based MIC methods, including the VersaTREK Culture System (TREK Diagnostics), and the MGIT 960 system (Becton Dickinson)-based method with a solid medium-based MIC agar proportion method. National TB repository The CTB initiated the establishment of a national mycobacterial culture collection of isolates stored in our repository, which will provide an important source of material for TB surveillance, encourage research and development, and assist in providing a reference material for monitoring evolution of unusual cases of TB detected through the network of laboratories in South Africa. Isolates are stored at -70 oC and will be archived using specialised software systems and following quality assurance processes to ensure the integrity of this national asset. As part of the surveillance work on these isolates, research-related information generated on these cultures over time will be archived and increase the usefulness and value of this collection. Sec 768 National Health Laboratory Service More than 1,180,669 assays were performed New and emerging diagnostics The CTB continues to evaluate new technologies for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of TB as well as for surveillance studies. Some of these exciting molecular-based methods evaluated by the CTB produce rapid results and promise to revolutionize management of drug-susceptible and especially drug-resistant TB. Examples of this are the evaluation and roll-out of the GenoType MTBDR plus assay (Hain Lifescience) and more recently the GeneXpert (Cepheid) technologies in South Africa, in which the NTBRL and subsequently the NPP played a prominent role. Future evaluation and roll-out of other novel technologies will keep South Africa on the cutting edge of TB management. Evaluation of several other systems has been initiated and includes real-time PCR-based systems, comprising high throughput and point-of-care, as well as hybrid models. In addition, evaluation of alternative screening algorithms and diagnostic approaches are also being considered. The diagnostic gap for additional resistance testing using new PCR modalities is being investigated, as well as sequencing-based approaches. National implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF The NHLS' National Priority Programme (NPP) was tasked with the roll-out of the Xpert MTB/ RIF, and from the outset the CTB supported this implementation and Dr Linda Erasmus was seconded for this major task. The South African DoH and NHLS have been recognised internationally for their role as global leaders in the implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF as part of the NTBCP . In March 2011 they initiated the introduction of this test for the rapid diagnosis of pulmonary TB and RIF resistance for use throughout the country. The phased roll-out has progressed well with the Xpert MTB/RIF replacing smear microscopy as the primary diagnostic test while also screening for drug-resistant TB. By March 2013, 203 Xpert instruments of varying capacity had been placed in 142 testing centres nationally. The NHLS assisted the DoH with clinical training of healthcare workers on the new diagnostic algorithm. More than 1,180,669 assays were performed, and M. tuberculosis was detected in 16-18% of specimens during the first year and 14% in the second year. On average, 7.19% of M. tuberculosis-positive samples were rifampicin resistant with some geographical variation noted. Errors rates range from 2-3%. Current research projects Epidemiology of drug-resistant TB among children and adolescents in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng, South Africa NICD L Erasmus Collaborators: H Menzies, S Bamrah, M van der Walt, D Mametja, N Ndjeka The CTB collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA, the South African Medical Research Council and national DoH in a study to describe Centre for t uberculosis Sec 769 National Health Laboratory Servicethe epidemiology of and access to treatment for drug-resistant TB among children and adolescents in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo. In addition, the study evaluated current recording and reporting systems by comparing MDR-TB case data recorded at the facility, and provincial and national levels with data recorded on the NHLS CDW. This information was fed back to all levels of the health system, including the participating MDR testing facilities. The study has demonstrated major challenges with the recording and reporting systems and highlighted the need for integration of these systems. These findings support the integration project being conducted jointly by the NICD NHLS and national DoH and highlight the large numbers of patients who are not documented as being on treatment. This primary defaulter group has serious implications for control programmes utilising information from the integrated surveillance system and can have a significant impact on case finding. Evaluation of the TBDx automated computer- aided smear microscopy system for diagnosis and use as a cost-effective screening toolNICD researchers: N Ismail, S Omar Collaborators: N Beylis, H van der Meulen, D Clark, G Churchyard This study is a joint venture of the Aurum Institute for Health Research, Guardian Technologies International, USA, and the NTBRL/CTB to develop and evaluate the performance of an automated computer-aided smear microscopy system involving digital image scanning of M. tuberculosis cells in sputum smears stained with the fluorescent Auramine O stain. The system has an automated slide loader and image capturing hardware, which capture fields from stained slides. Images that have been captured are then interpreted using TBDx software. A fully functional system has been developed, and assessment of the performance of the system has reached the stage of clinical evaluation under routine laboratory testing conditions. Further cascade testing is being incorporated to determine the cost differences when the system is used as a pre-screening tool. Host and pathogen contributions in the emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis: cross-sectional and prospective observational studiesNICD researchers: N Ismail, H Koornhof Collaborators: G Kaplan, D Fallows, B Kreiswirth, C Gray, K Klipstein-Grobusch As part of a cross-sectional investigation on pathogen-related factors in the MDR/XDR- TB epidemic in Gauteng, more than 300 M. tuberculosis drug-resistant isolates from Gauteng province are undergoing molecular typing and drug resistance profiling. This study will provide information on drug-resistance- related mutations in M. tuberculosis isolates in Gauteng and changes in these mutations over a three-year period. The second cross- sectional study collecting TB isolates from Gauteng commenced in 2013. In a related longitudinal study, cultures from sputum specimens from 200 newly admitted Sec 770 National Health Laboratory ServiceMDR/XDR-TB patients at Sizwe Hospital (100 HIV-positive and 100 HIV-negative) were collected at monthly intervals for the investigation of the acquisition of drug- resistance-determining mutations over time. Genes encoding resistance to sequenced when relevant, including whole genome sequencing on a selective basis. By April 2013, 78 HIV-negative and 55 HIV-positive MDR/XDR-TB patients had been enrolled into the study. Additional components of this study include immunological profiling of cytokines and other biomarkers as well as measurements related to changing nutritional status before and during treatment. Xpert for people attending HIV/AIDS care: test or Hanifa, H van der Meulen, G Churchyard This study aims to evaluate strategies for prioritisation of cases with increased likelihood of mortality or transmission, and to assess the impact of this stratified algorithm on the NTBCP . Patients stratified as a high priority based on risk factor criteria are assigned for rapid Xpert MTB/RIF assay testing as opposed to those assigned a lower priority. All patients undergo follow-up and monitoring to determine the optimal pathway to diagnosis in the context of Xpert MTB/RIF G Mpalala, S Zwane The NTBRL/CTB continued to provide laboratory support for a project on TB management in Swaziland conducted by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). Part of this project is the evaluation of the performance of the GenoType MTBDR plusline probe assay (LPA) at in Swaziland compared with smear microscopy, culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). The LPA together with conventional smear microscopy, culture and DST are performed at the CTB on specimens as they arrive and results are issued within acceptable turnaround times. Additional drug resistance testing is performed on MDR cases. Transmission of HIV-associated XDR-TB in South Africa (TRAX NICD researchers: N BT Magazi, SV Omar Collaborators: S Shah, R Rustomjee, B Kreiswirth Following the disastrous Tugela Ferry outbreak of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal in 2006, the present study was designed to investigate prospectively the transmission of XDR-TB in that province. The study aimed to determine the proportion of new XDR-TB cases with primary drug resistance, identify risk factors associated with such transmission through epidemiological and social network Centre for t uberculosis Sec 771 National Health Laboratory Serviceanalysis and, using molecular genotyping, to demonstrate transmission patterns involving persons and locations associated with XDR-TB transmission. For this study, the CTB collaborates with Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital Laboratory, which is responsible for all DST testing in KwaZulu-Natal and refers all laboratory-based XDR-TB isolates from KwaZulu-Natal for confirmatory testing and molecular characterisation. Additional information on risk factors is collected and transmission to close contacts is investigated. Strong emphasis is placed on understanding the transmission dynamics among XDR cases in this high-burden TB and HIV province. Teaching and training Eligible microbiology technologists and medical scientists performing routine or research-based testing for M. tuberculosis by culture or molecular techniques were offered special training and structured courses by the CTB. The centre also assisted the African Centre for Integrated Laboratory Training (ACILT) with training courses for technicians, technologists and medical scientists in TB smear microscopy (two courses), DST of M. tuberculosis cultures (one course), and M. tuberculosis culture, molecular detection and identification (one course). Additional training is provided to rotating registrars and intern scientists covering both reference mycobacteriology testing and public health aspects.

The unit houses two World Health Organization (WHO) regional referral laboratories. Specialised molecular diagnostic services are offered to South African stakeholders for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, enteroviruses, JC and BK viruses. Surveillance and diagnostic programmes Polio surveillance In support of the Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Initiative (GPEI) initiated in 1988 by the World Health Assembly, any new onset of hypotonic weakness (acute flaccid paralysis) in a child aged younger than 15 years is investigated for poliovirus. Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance is a GPEI strategy to detect poliovirus circulation, re-importation of wild poliovirus into polio-free areas or regions and emerging vaccine-derived polio viruses (VDPVs). The Centre for Vaccines and Immunology conducts poliovirus isolation, identification and molecular analysis for South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The majority of the samples were received from South Africa (34.5%), Mozambique (29.45%) and Angola (27.7%). Polioviruses isolated include 20 type 1 Sabin-like, eight type 2 Sabin-like, 30 type 3 Sabin-like and six vaccine-derived polio virus type 2. A total of 319 non-polio enteroviruses was isolated with an isolation rate of 13.5% (target = 10%). Sequencing analysis identified 21 cases as circulating VDPV type 2 in three Centre for v accines and Immunology Professor Barry Schoub (1 April 2012-28 February 2013) HeadSec 8 The Centre for Vaccines and Immunology conducts poliovirus isolation, identification and molecular analysis for South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.75 National Health Laboratory Servicecountries; Somalia (1), Kenya (3) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (17). Only six wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV 1) cases were identified from Chad and Niger and no wild poliovirus type 3 cases were identified. The GPEI has been highly successful in reducing cases of polio. Globally, annual cases have been reduced from 350,000 in 1988 to fewer than 1,000 by the end of 2011, and Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria are the only remaining endemic countries. Only three African countries reported wild polioviruses (WPV) in 2012 (Nigeria, Niger and Chad) compared to 13 countries in 2011. In South Africa, the last wild poliovirus case reported was in 1989. Adequate surveillance remains the keystone of global polio eradication. Measles surveillance As one of the most contagious infectious diseases, measles causes significant morbidity and mortality in children, and especially those who are malnourished and/or immune- compromised. Since the aim of Millennium Development Goal 4 is to reduce the overall number of deaths among children under five years of age by two-thirds from 1990 to 2015, routine measles vaccination coverage was selected as an indicator of progress towards this goal. Aggressive efforts to improve such coverage resulted in an estimated 86% reduction in measles-related mortality globally between 1990 and 2008, representing a 23% reduction in all-cause mortality in the under-five age group in this period. The Centre for Vaccines and Immunology is the national and WHO regional referral laboratory for measles surveillance. Serology, specifically the detection of measles-specific IgM antibodies, is the most commonly used method of laboratory diagnosis of acute measles infection. Since rubella presents with similar clinical symptoms, laboratories often test for IgM against both viruses in suspected measles cases. Measles and rubella IgM testing was performed on 6,815 serum specimens. These comprised 6,273 South African specimens (92%), 26 proficiency specimens (20 WHO and six UKNEQAS) and 516 specimens (7.6%) from southern African countries. Of the South African specimens, 27 tested positive for measles IgM (0.4%), 20 tested indeterminate for measles IgM-indeterminate. Routine rubella IgM testing of rash surveillance samples was discontinued in March 2013. Hepatitis B testing Hepatitis B vaccination was introduced into the South African Expanded Programme of Immunisation in 1995. The HIV epidemic has increased the burden of disease in South Africa from hepatitis B. There is currently no national laboratory-based surveillance for hepatitis B, Sec 876 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 8 but multiple sites perform diagnostic testing. The Centre for Vaccines and Immunology has analysed the epidemiological data of the cases it receives for diagnostic testing and genotyped the strains. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of hepatitis B for the period was 1,152. The age group 26-48 years was most prevalent (52%) and males accounted for 55% of cases. Genotype A was the predominant genotype (39%) with genotype D (1.73%) and genotype E (1.21%) also detected. Specialised viral diagnostics The National Institute for Communicable Diseases and the National Health Laboratory Service Tygerberg were the only public laboratories performing accredited specialised molecular tests for enteroviruses, Epstein Barr virus, herpes zoster virus and polyoma viruses BK and JC. In addition, NICD offers diagnostic testing for hepatitis C. Hepatitis C isolates from 2012 were characterised further and genotyped. In the reporting period, there were 1,002 positive specimens for hepatitis C. A total of 16 HCV subtypes and mixed intergenotypic infections (6.7%) were identified. Genotype 5a is predominant in South Africa and accounted for 35% of the laboratory-confirmed cases, followed by 1b (22%), 3a (11%) and 4 (9%). Clinical studies in collaboration with gastrointestinal clinics demonstrate that patients with genotype 5a respond better on combination therapy than those with genotype 1 and 4, as noted globally. Hepatitis C epidemiological data will support decision-making regarding treatment programmes. Research projects Evolution of poliovirus type 3 using known immunodeficient vaccine-derived Immunodeficiency vaccine- polioviruses [iVDPVs] have more amino acid changes than cVDPV with the inclusion of mixed bases. Immune pressure varies and immune escape leads to different lineages. A plaque assay will be performed on previously identified iVDPVs and different colonies will be sequenced to characterise different populations. Epitope analysis of genotype 5a hepatitis C virus against South African HLA backgrounds NICD researchers: Dr N Prabdial-Sing, Professor A Foundation study investigates HCV variability within well studied epitopes identified in genotype 1 and uses algorithms to predict the immunogenicity of their variants from other less studied genotypes. This will inform the most promising vaccine candidates locally. Six class I- and seven class II-restricted epitope sequences within the HCV genome were Centre for v accines and Immunology 77 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 8 compared across the six HCV genotypes using local genotype 5a sequence data together with global data. Despite the homogeneity of genotype 1 and genotype 5 over the epitopes, there was limited promiscuity to local HLA-alleles. The prevalence of hepatitis C viral mutations and IL28B single nucleotide polymorphisms and response to pegylated and ribavirin therapy in a Johannesburg study group NICD researchers: Professor A Puren and Dr N Prabdial-Sing Collaborators: R Williams Funding: Poliomyelitis Research Foundation Synopsis: Preliminary data indicated four to six mutations in the core region and five mutations in the interferon sensitivity- determining region for genotype 5a samples. All genotype 5a samples analysed had a R70Q mutation, which has been associated with poor viral response. Preliminary data on the prevalence of SNP rs8099917 in various ethnic groups were obtained. Characterisation of non-polio enteroviruses which have the potential to cause flaccid Foundation Synopsis: As the global eradication of polioviruses approaches, there is consideration of the need to identify other viruses that cause the syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis. There are no vaccines currently available, and it is necessary to assess the prevalence and epidemiology so as to ascertain the burden and implement measures to reduce transmission. The goals of the project are to screen for non- polio enteroviruses and determine genotypes by molecular tests in order to understand the prevalence of enteroviruses and enterovirus genotypes in the country. Teaching and training Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) surveillance workshop The Department of Health (DoH) in partnership with WHO and NICD conducted a National EPI Disease Surveillance workshop to roll out the revised surveillance tools, manuals and standard operating procedures on 19-28 November 2012. The workshop cascaded information to clinicians in hospitals and healthcare facilities and shared revised EPI tools.

Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics 2012; 8 (1): 130-137.80 National Health Laboratory ServicePublic Health, Surveillance and Response The Public Health, Surveillance and Response Division incorporates the National Outbreak Response unit, surveillance under the platform of the GERMS-SA surveillance programme and travel medicine within the newly formed South African National Travel Health Network (SANTHNeT). The division facilitates communication and data sharing between the national and provincial health departments and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and provides epidemiological input to other NICD units through collaborative projects and support of surveillance and epidemiological activities and outbreak responses.GERMS-SA Section co-ordinator: Dr Vanessa Quan SurveillanceGERMS-SA is a laboratory-based surveillance programme for invasive bacterial and fungal causes of pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoeal diseases. It is coordinated by the National Microbiology Surveillance Unit (NMSU) and spans many of the centres at the NICD, including the centres for Enteric Diseases; Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis; Opportunistic, Tropical and Hospital Infections; and Tuberculosis. GERMS-SA is an active surveillance programme and relies not only on participating laboratories to submit isolates but also makes use of the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) to ensure that all cases meeting the case definition are included in the database. In this reporting period, an additional pathogen, rifampicin-resistant TB, was added to the organisms under surveillance from September 2012.Division of Public Health, Surveillance and Response Professor Lucille Blumberg HeadSec 9 In this reporting period, an additional pathogen, rifampicin-resistant TB, was added to the organisms under surveillance from September 2012.81 National Health Laboratory ServiceSurveillance for Klebsiella spp. was part of the GERMS-SA pathogen list only until 31 July TB. The aim of GERMS-SA is to use the data to inform and guide public health policy makers in their decisions. The objectives include estimating the burden of both community- and hospital-acquired infectious diseases under surveillance, monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility trends, monitoring the impact of the HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Care, Management and Treatment Programme in South Africa on HIV-associated opportunistic infections, evaluating the impact of vaccines included in the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) and monitoring rifampicin-resistant TB. Approximately 180 laboratories (public and private), from all nine provinces, reported 15,400 cases according to specific GERMS case definitions. One third of the cases (5,458 or 35%) came from 25 sentinel sites across the country where 30 surveillance officers collected clinical information on 3,570 (66%) of patients relating to these specific pathogens; this is an underestimation since not all forms have been captured. The work carried out by the GERMS-SA team has significantly contributed to the development of clinical guidelines for pneumonia, meningococcal disease, cholera, cryptococcosis and typhoid fever and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine booster dose into the EPI. Data emanating from the GERMS-SA activities have contributed to the rolling out by the Department of Health (DoH) of a cryptococcal antigen screen and treat programme, which will facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. In the reporting period, GERMS-SA data have contributed to the new Cryptococcus management guidelines (South African Medical Journal 2013); the burden of cryptococcosis, the degree of Sec 9 Initiating rifampicin- resistant TB surveillance in Kimberley, March 2013.

GERMS-SA data along with preliminary data from the PCV-7 invasive pneumococcal disease case-control study were used to support recommendations for including a third primary dose of PCV for HIV-infected children on the EPI. In addition, GERMS-SA has conducted numerous site visits to NHLS laboratories, providing training and development of laboratory staff. Such activities continue to contribute to the expansion of knowledge of public health and ensure quality contributions that assist GERMS- SA in determining the burden of disease. Teaching and training NMSU assists in the training of registrars and SA-FELTP residents on surveillance. The broader GERMS-SA team performed 31 site visits to laboratories and hospitals participating in the programme and provided feedback on surveillance data as well as and training in clinical and microbiological diagnostics. Professional development Postgraduate candidates graduated: one MSc. Outbreak Response Unit Section co-ordinator: Dr Juno Thomas The Outbreak Response Unit (ORU) provides technical support for all aspects of communicable disease outbreaks and control in South Africa. Through close collaboration with provincial and national health departments and other stakeholders, together with systems for early detection and improved reporting of epidemic-prone communicable diseases, the ORU functions as a source of intelligence for outbreak detection and facilitates comprehensive outbreak response activities. In addition, close partnerships with National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) diagnostic laboratories and NICD centres provide appropriate laboratory diagnostic services during outbreaks and specialised diagnostic tests as required. In April 2012, the national Department of Health Communicable Diseases Directorate and the ORU became functionally integrated as the National Outbreak Unit, a platform for synergistic outbreak detection and response activities throughout the country. Public health services The ORU's role in outbreaks may include, but is not limited to, the following: outbreak detection and reporting, field investigation, development of clinical and laboratory guidelines, management of laboratory data and interpretation of results, and recommendations for prevention and control. During 2012, the ORU assisted with a wide spectrum of outbreaks, including shigellosis in the Eastern Cape; cholera in outbreaks (shigellosis, and healthcare-associated infection outbreaks (non-typhoidal salmonellosis, varicella Division of Public Health, Surveillance and Response Sec 983 National Health Laboratory ServiceSec 9 The team from the Outbreak Response Unit, entomologists from the Centre for Opportunistic, Tropical and Hospital Infections and members of the Tshwane Communicable Diseases Directorate on site during the Odyssean malaria outbreak investigation in Tshwane in January 2013 Members of the Outbreak Response Unit and FELTP interact with local community members during the cholera outbreak investigation in Musina in March 201384 National Health Laboratory Servicezoster virus, and carbapenem-resistant Gram- negative bacteria (NDM-1, VIM)). During 2012, the ORU continued to strengthen networks for the reporting and investigation of foodborne illness, with 92 outbreaks followed up by the unit. The ORU supported communicable disease monitoring during the 2013 African Cup of Nations tournament by providing daily surveillance data and communicable disease intelligence updates. The CDW Alert system, managed by the ORU, facilitates timely notification to healthcare and public health workers of laboratory-confirmed cases of priority communicable diseases detected by NHLS laboratories throughout the country (Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bordetella pertussis). The OutNet programme is an NHLS laboratory- based outbreak network with nine provincial laboratory OutNet representatives who act as the key points of contact for provincial public health staff and facilitate laboratory functions in outbreak detection and response. As NOU, ORU assisted with the development of provincial and national guidelines for priority communicable diseases. The ORU publishes a monthly Communicable Diseases Communiqu\u00e9, which reports recent outbreak and communicable disease cases/ issues of relevance. This is distributed to a wide audience including general practitioners, specialists, infectious disease and travel medicine societies, and national and provincial public health personnel. In addition, the unit publishes special urgent advisories and communiqu\u00e9s in response to acute events requiring immediate dissemination of information.Teaching and training The unit assisted national and provincial health departments in training healthcare workers and public health personnel in epidemic preparedness and response, with an emphasis on case management and appropriate laboratory diagnostic tests for a number of epidemic-prone diseases. ORU supported the training of future epidemiologists and public health experts through the South African Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (SAFELTP). The unit provides supervision to residents during outbreak investigations, and also gives lectures during both short and long courses offered by the programme. The ORU supported the training of public health specialists from the University of the Witwatersrand, University of Pretoria and University of Limpopo by hosting six-month placements for registrars to gain experience in both outbreak response activities and communicable diseases-related public health. Public health registrars from the Health Protection Agency (UK) were hosted for three- month placements as part of the NICD-HPA exchange programme. Travel Health Section co-ordinator: Professor Lucille BlumbergThe South African National Travel Health Network (SANTHNet) was established in 2012 as a partnership between the NICD, the DoH (Communicable Disease Cluster) and the Division of Public Health, Surveillance and Response Sec 985 National Health Laboratory ServiceSouth African Society of Travel Medicine. The network focuses primarily on communicable diseases to ensure compliance with the International Health Regulations; and provides an authoritative platform for the development of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of travel-related diseases, guidance for health professionals advising the public travelling locally and abroad, a consultative serve for returning travellers with suspected infectious diseases, and a platform for surveillance for selected travel-related diseases and imported infections such as Dengue fever. The network functions as a point of contact and liaison internationally for infectious diseases acquired in southern Africa, and assists with training travel health practitioners and those studying tropical diseases. There is a focus on zoonotic diseases and emerging pathogens through the One Health approach brought about by interactions between animal and human health and the environment. A proposed WHO Collaborating Centre for Mass Gatherings Health will be accommodated and will work together with five other centres in Australia, the United Kingdom, Serbia, the United States of America and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Mass gatherings (MG) are highly visible events that present both challenges and opportunities to host countries and the wider international health community. The health implications of these events range from threats of acute communicable and non-communicable disease (and injury) to the potential for positive and sustainable health legacies. Drawing on previous experience and programmes established for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the MG centre was responsible for providing pre-travel advice for the 2013 Sec 9 Inaugural meeting of the WHO Collaborating Centres in Novo Sad, Serbia86 National Health Laboratory ServiceAfrican Cup of Nations (AFCON) football tournament, which was held from 19 January to 10 February 2013 in South Africa, with 16 countries competing for the coveted title. For the duration of the tournament, the centre assisted the provincial and national DoH with an enhanced surveillance programme focused on communicable diseases considered as potential threats for the tournament. This enhanced surveillance was facilitated using data gathered from public and private healthcare facilities, as well as laboratory data from NHLS and participating private pathology laboratories. Numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases of selected communicable diseases (including hepatitis A, influenza, malaria, measles, meningococcal disease, and typhoid fever) were collated and reported to the Public Health Cluster each day, and risk assessments for incidents reported during the event. Overall the AFCON was very successful, with a small number of food-borne illnesses reported. Teaching and training Undergraduate and postgraduate teaching on travel and tropical diseases was provided for undergraduates and postgraduates at the universities of Stellenbosch, the Witwatersrand and North-West as well as participants attending the travel medicine course and the Diploma in Tropical Diseases (University of the Witwatersrand). A specialist master class on tropical, travel- related and neglected diseases was held in 2012 at the NICD for infectious diseases sub-specialty fellows from all South African universities.Honours Professor Blumberg was appointed as a Bio- weapons Inspector on the United Nations Secretary General's roster. Professor Blumberg received the 2012 Epidemiology award from the South African Society for Veterinary Epidemiologists for contributions in the field of One Health and Zoonoses. Professor Blumberg was also elected chairperson of the SA Malaria Elimination Committee (SAMEC) for a five-year period.

Conference presentations International congresses: 9 National congresses: 16 Local congresses: 10Sec 988 National Health Laboratory ServiceThe South African Global Disease Detection Centre (SARGDDC) was established in July 2010 through a tripartite partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the South African Department of Health (DoH) and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). The programme was established as the eighth Global Disease Detection Regional Centre; its mission is aimed at strengthening health systems by building capacity to rapidly identify and contain emerging health threats in partnership with all stakeholders. The SARGDDC is integrated with and collaborates with the DoH, the centres at the NICD and other stakeholders in the core programmes of: International emerging infectious disease detection and response (IEIP) The South Africa Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (SAFELTP) Flu/pandemic preparedness and response Emergency preparedness and risk communication One Health - a concept for expanding interdisciplinary collaborations and communications in all aspects of health care for humans, animals and the environment Laboratory system strengthening. Many of the specific activities of SARGDDC are integrated in the reports of the centres of the NICD, and SARGDDC continues to collaborate and support 21 projects through a non-research co-operative agreement and 7 projects through a research co-operative agreement. This year has seen the appointment of Patrick Chong as the Deputy Director of SARGDDC. He is a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employee and has worked at the Division of Global HIV and AIDS in Vietnam and Thailand as the Country Deputy Director for Thailand and recently he has been assisting CDC programmes in Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kazakhstan and Papua New Guinea.the South African Global Disease Detection Centre Dr Natalie Mayet HeadSec 10 NICD and SARGDDC collaborate and support21 projects The programmes mission is aimed at strengthening health systems by building capacity to rapidly identify and contain emerging health threats in partnership with all stakeholders.89 National Health Laboratory ServiceKey highlights The centre hosted the International Health Regulations Risk Communications workshop on 4-6 September 2012 together with the Division Global HIV/AIDS, CDC-Atlanta and the NDOH. Some 75 participants from sectors including health promotion, communications, communicable diseases control, environmental health, NICD and the private sector attended the training. Dr Michael Washington from the Heath Economics Technical Support Corporation in CDC- Atlanta, presented a workshop on the Prevention Effectiveness of Heath Economics/Modelling on 20 September 2012 at NICD. This training will be followed with a Health Policy and Decision Analysis workshop planned for 18-21 June 2013. Hands-on expertise for specific projects will be conducted in the week of 24-28 June 2013. The centre facilitated Africa's first Joint Law Enforcement and Public Health Workshop on 23-24 October 2012. It was attended by 31 participants, 26 from public health and 5 from law enforcement. The CDC and Federal Bureau of Investigation teamed up to give an overview of biological agents and to share their experience of jointly addressing issues of biosafety and biosecurity. The SARGDDC facilitated the DoH Director General's visit to the CDC in Atlanta on 5 October; it is supporting follow-up activities with the aim of establishing the National Public Health Institute for South Africa and is assisting DoH with the development of a National Surveillance Strategy.A number of key consultations in the last year have strengthened collaborative efforts. Dr Steve Lindstrom and LaShondra Berman, CDC-Atlanta Influenza Division, visited NICD on 12-14 September 2012 to work with the virology laboratory at the National Influenza Centre on quality control and quality assessment of a new multi-pathogen diagnostic assay developed by CDC, the Taqman Array Card (TAC). This assay permits rapid testing of more than 20 pathogens on a single specimen at one time. Dr Tony Ao, Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer from Global Disease Detection at CDC-Atlanta, visited South Africa in January and February. Dr Ao visited the country to conduct a case-control study of risk factors for hospitalisation with pneumonia and influenza in rural South Africa and presented his work at the CDC-South Africa Journal Club on 20 February. Influenza programme staff also travelled to Madagascar from 4 to 8 March to conduct influenza surveillance and pandemic preparedness reviews. The staff took the opportunity to work with colleagues at the Institut Pasteur-Madagascar on analysing their influenza surveillance and vital statistics data. There were a number of visits by senior CDC staff including Dr Scott Dowell, the Director of the Global Disease Detection and Emergency Response Division; Dr Barry Fields, the Laboratory Director for the Global Disease Detection programme in Kenya; and other colleagues from the US Department of Defense and the Defence Threat Reduction Agency. Sec 1090 National Health Laboratory ServiceSouth Africa Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training (SAFELTP) South Africa launched its Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training programme in May 2006. The SAFELTP was developed in partnership with DoH, NICD, CDC and the University of Pretoria. It is modelled on the CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) programme in the USA and is unique in that it is the only one in South Africa designed to train field epidemiology residents for public health leadership positions in the national and provincial departments of health. The programme provides practical hands- on training with the objectives of providing a platform for building field epidemiology capacity to improve surveillance, detect and respond to public health events, use evidence- based approaches to improve programmes and policy and provide the framework to encourage epidemiological research aligned with national research priorities. Dr Carl Reddy was appointed as the Programme Director of SAFELTP on 1 March 2013. The 2013 cohort of nine SAFELTP residents hase been assigned to support national priority programmes and residents have been assigned to assist in Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Two residents have been allocated to work with the DoH Communicable Disease Cluster and the national TB programme. Another resident has been assigned to the Cancer Registry at the National Institute for Occupational Health, and the Sexually Transmitted Infections Reference Centre at the NICD also gained a resident. A resident is working with the Epidemiology and Strategic Information unit at the Human Sciences Research Council and will also support the Tshwane NHI District. Another resident is working at the University of South Africa's Institute for Social and Health Sciences and is involved in research in the field of injury and violence prevention. In December 2012, Dr Patience Kweza assisted in the investigation of the typhoid outbreak in Zimbabwe. The SAFELTP team provided outbreak response training to 95 DoH staff in Free State from 29 October-1 November, and the acting programme director served as the external examiner for the Ghana FELTP . Honours Riyadh Manesen, a resident on the 2011 cohort, won an award for the best poster at the PHASA Conference for \"The Outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases in Verkeerdevlei, Free State Province\" , and Nomathemba Dube, a resident from the 2010 cohort, achieved her Master of Public Health degree with distinction. Two oral and four poster presentations were made at the TEPHINET Conference in Jordan on 10-15 November 2012. Eight SAFELTP residents completed their training and were awarded Master of Public Health Degrees at the April 2013 graduation ceremony held at the University of Pretoria. The MPH attainment rate has risen from 51% in 2011 to 76% (35/46) for all residents who have completed the programme and it is anticipated that this rate will increase to more than 80% after the September 2013 graduation. the South African Global Disease Detection Centre Sec 1091 National Health Laboratory ServiceResearch output Journal articles Dube NM, Summers R, Khin-San T, Mayayise G.
