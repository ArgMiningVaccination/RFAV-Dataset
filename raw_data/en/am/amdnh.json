Moulton, AID, AIPH, Jannd Croll, BS, Robert Weatherholt, BS, Richard Ward, PhD, John Forte, PhD, Edward Zito, PhD, Michael Mack, PhD, George Brenneman, AID, and Bruce L. Davidson, AID, AIPH Objectives: We compared the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of 1) vaccine (RRV-S1), and placebo in healthy American Indian infants for two rotavirus seasons. Study design: Infants aged 6 to 24 weeks were enrolled in a randomized, double- blind efficacy study. Infants were orally administered RRV-TV (4 \u00d7 10 ~ plaque-forming units per dose), RRV-S1 (4 \u00d7 10 ~ plaque-forming units per dose), or placebo at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Stools collected during episodes of gastroenteritis were tested for detection of rotavirus antigen. A total of 1185 infants received at least one dose of a study vaccine or placebo, and 1051 received all three doses according to the protocol. Results: During the first year of surveillance, the estimates of vaccine efficacy (with 95% confidence interval) for preventing rotaviral gastroenteritis were 50% (26, 67) for RRV-TV and 29% (-1, 50) for RRV-S1. In this population only 6% of rotaviral gas- troenteritis episodes among placebo recipients were associated with type G1 disease. For severe disease the estimates of vaccine efficacy were higher: 69% (29, 88) for RRV- TV and 48% (-4, 75) for RRV-S1. Conclusions: These data indicate that RRV-TV is moderately efficacious in prevent- ing all episodes of gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus and is most efficacious against the severe disease characteristic of rotaviral illness.

METHODS The study was conducted from Jan. 1, 1992, to Jan. 31, 1994. The study popula- tion consisted of infants residing on the Gila River Indian Reservation (Arizona), the Navajo Indian Reservation (Arizona and New Mexico), the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation (Arizona), and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation (Ari- zona). The study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopldns University Com- mittee on Human Research, the Indian Health Service, and the Tribal Councils and Health Boards of the respective tribes. Infants aged 6 to 24 weeks with no un- derlying illness whose parents signed a written informed consent were included in the study. Infants were excluded if they had evidence of a clinically significant chronic disease, if there was an individual with immunosuppression in the house- hold, or if the subject was involved in any other vaccine trial. Infants were random- ly assigned in blocks of six to receive ei- ther RRV-TV (containing 1 x 105 PFU of each of serotypes G 1, GY, and G4 RRV reassortants and the G3 4 x 105 PFU of RRV-S1 (containing serotype 1 only), or placebo consisting of tissue culture medium. The vaccines and placebo were resuspended in 3 ml of sodi- um-citrate bicarbonate buffer, and 2.5 ml of the suspension was administered orally. The vaccine or placebo doses were sepa- rated by at least 3 weeks. Simultaneous administration of routine childhood im- munizations such as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination and oral polio vaccination was permitted but not re- quired. The vaccine or placebo doses were administered between Jan. 1, 1992, and Oct. 5, 1992. Blood samples (3 to 5 ml) were obtained just before administra- tion of the first dose of the vaccine or placebo, 1 month after the third dose, and in January 1993. Sera from 201 random- ly selected children were assayed for neu- tralizing antibodies RRV and human G2 (DS-1), and en- zyme-linkecl immunosorbent antigen re- duction assay as described previously. 18 In addition, sera from all subjects who had a sufficient volume of all three speci- mens were analyzed for anti-rotavirus IgA. 19 A fourfold or greater rise in anti- body titer, in comparison with the preim- munization titer, was considered to be a seroresponse. Surveillance for Vaccine Safety The parents/guardians of the study par- ticipants were asked to record the follow- ing information for 5 clays after vaccina- tion for each infant: (1) rectal temperature in the evening, (2) number and consisten- cy of stools, (3) vomiting, (4) level of ac- tivity (decreased, irritable, or normal), (5) occurrence of any skin rash, and (6) res- piratory symptoms. In addition, the par- ents/guardians were instructed to bring the infant to the hospital or clinic for eval- uation if seizures, high fever, or any other unusual symptoms developed. This infor- mation was recorded on a standard form by the parents/guardians. Study person- nel (field-workers) who were fluent both in English and in the native language vis- ited each of the homes and reviewed the data forms with the parents/guardians. In addition, field-workers conducted daily home visits in a sample of infants who lived in close proximity to the hospital (n = 160) for the first 5 clays after each dose of the vaccine to collect the same informa- tion. All hospitalizations and deaths of study subjects were recorded during the study. Surveillance for Gastroenteritis Field-workers made weekly home visits to study subjects to collect information re- garding gastroenteritis episodes. If the parent/guardian reported a GE (three or more looser-than-normal or watery stools or at least one occurrence of vomiting in a 24-hour period) during the previous week or since the last visit, the following infor- mation was collected: (1) number and consistency of stools, (2) presence of blood in the stools, and (3) vomiting fre- quency. Ira GE occurred, stool specimens were collected anytime from the onset of the GE up to 7 days after the GE re- solved. These specimens were stored at -20 \u00b0 C until collected by a field-worker. The field-worker transported the stool specimens to the clinic or hospital and stored them at -70 \u00b0 C. The specimens were then shipped monthly to the J. N. Gamble Institute of Medical Research (Cincinnati, Ohio) for processing. During GEs, the field-workers visited the home daily until the GE was resolved. The stool specimens were assayed for the presence of rotavirus antigen by ELISA as de- scribed previouslyJ 0 Rotavirus isolates were of serotype-specific monoclonal antibod- ies.21, 22 If r0tavirus antigen was detected in a stool collected during a GE or within 7 clays after the illness resolved, the GE was attributed to rotavirus. As previously described, a 20-point scoring system was used to grade the severity of the diarrhea. 9 The scoring was based on a point system that ranged from 0 to 3 for each of the following: duration of diarrhea, maximum number of diar- rheal stools in a 24-hour period, duration of vomiting, maximum number of vomit- ing episodes in a 24-hour period, presence of dehydration, presence of fever, and medical intervention by a physician. A di- arrheal episode was considered to be se- vere if the score was greater than 14. Initially, consent was obtained from parents/guardians of study participants to continue surveillance for a 1-year period. However, at the end of the first year, a de- cision was made to extend the surveil- lance for an additional year, and a second consent was obtained. Data Analysis and Statistical Methods Enrollment characteristics and adverse reaction data were analyzed with the Fisher Exact Test, t test, ancl linear re- gression methods, and ehi-square test where appropriate. Immunogenicity analy- ses were performed by means of exact methods. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as (1-R/Ru) x 100%, where R and R are the incidence rates of GEs in the vaccinated and unvaccinated (placebo) groups, respectively. RV-specific inci- dence rates were calculated with the use of the first episode of rotaviral gastroen- teritis for a child, whereas all-cause gas- troenteritis rates used all GEs. Person- time denominators for the primary efficacy period were calculated by time from 14 days after the third close until the earliest of (1) loss to follow-up, (2) death, or (3) end offirstyear of surveillance. The 633 SANTOSHAH ET AL. THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS OCTOBER 1997 intent-to-treat analysis performed for the first year of surveillance began its time line at receipt of first dose. Exact CIs for RV-specific efficacy were calculated by the binomial distribution23; an overdis- persed Poisson model was 2-year RV and all-cause gastroenteritis efficacy analysesJ 4 Adjustments for other covariates were carried out with Cox pro- portional hazards modeling of time-to- episode. Calculations were performed with SAS (Ca W, N.C.) and EGRET (Maple Valley, Wash.) software. All CIs were calculated at the 95% level. RESULTS A first dose of vaccine or placebo was given to 1185 infants (396 RRV-TV, 398 RRV-S1, and 391 placebo). Three doses of the vaccine or placebo were given to 1059 infants. Of these, eight infants re- ceived vaccine or placebo outside the pro- toeol-defmed time intervals and were ex- cluded from primary efficacy analyses. Among the 1185 infants who received at least one close of the vaccine, 1084 (91%) completed year 1 of surveillance, and the parents/guardians of 1027 (95%) of the infants who completed year 1 of surveil- lance consented to a second year of sur- veillance. Of those who had consent for a second year of surveillance, 913 (89%) completed the study. The proportions of infants who received three doses of the vaccine or placebo and the proportions that completed years 1 and 2 of surveil- lance, respectively, in each of the groups were similar. Sixty-eight percent (n = 805) of the in- fants were Navajo, 18% (n = 219) were Apache, 7.5% (n = 90) were Pima, and 6% (n = 71) belonged to one of the other American Indian tribes. At enrollment, there were no significant differences be- tween the treatment groups With respect to tribal affih'ation (p = 0.63), geographic site (p = 0.99), breast-feeding status (o = 0.82), age at enrollment (p = 0.14), or total body weight at enrollment (p = 0.25). The proportions of male subjects were 53%, 43%, and 53% in the RRV-TM, RRV-S1, and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.005). The age at enrollment was similar in the three groups (mean, 12 weeks; range, 3 to 24 weeks). The mean birth weight of the study participants was 3400 gm. The proportions of infants whose birth weight was above 2500 gm were 96%, 970/0, and 96% in the RRV-TV,, RRV- S 1, and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse Reactions The proportions of infants who had di- arrhea or vomiting during the 5-day peri- od after each of the doses of the vaccine or placebo ranged from 3% to 7% and did not differ significantly among the groups (Fig. 1). The proportions of infants who had temperatures greater than 38o C after the first, second, and third doses of the vaccine or placebo are shown in Fig. 1. The only statistically significant difference occurred after the second dose, at which time 18% of the RRV-TV recipients had a temperature greater than 38 \u00b0 C, in com- parison with 12% among the placebo re- cipients (p = 0.02). The overall proportion of infants with a temperature greater than 39 \u00b0 C after a dose was only 2%. There were 81, 87, and 98 hospitalizations in the RRV-TV, RRV-S1, and placebo groups, respectively. There were four deaths, all in the RRV-TV group. The causes of death were as follows: Haemopbilas influen- zae type b meningitis in one infant, sudden infant death syndrome in one, asphyxia in one, and unknown in one. None of the deaths occurred within 1 month after re- ceipt of vaccines. Immunogenicity of the Vaccines With the use of sera obtained 1 month after the third dose, 93%, 88%, and 19% of the infants had seroconversion (four- fold or greater antibody increase) for RV IgA by ELISA in the RRV-TV,, RRV-S1, and placebo groups, respectively (Table I). By neutralization assay, 24% of RRV- TV, 37% of RRV-S1, and 2% placebo group infants had seroconversion against the G1 serotype. The RRV-TV group had the highest seroconversion rates by neu- tralization assay for all other serotypes, achieving statistically significantly higher rates than the RRV-S1 vaccine group for serotypes G2 and G3. R V-specific Vaccine Efficacy Stool samples were available from 2582 (66%) of 3900 GEs that occurred from 14 days after the third dose. The proportions of GEs for which stool samples were available were similar among the groups (66%, 66%, and 67% for RRV-TV,, RRV- S1, and placebo groups, respectively). Of the samples positive for RV, 77% (209/270) were able to be typed. Twenty-three children had more than one episode of RV gastroenteritis, includ- ing one child who had three GEs. For 15 of these children, GEs were separated by more than 4 weeks. Of these, eight had more than one GE that could be typed; only two of the eight had a second GE as- sociated with the same serotype as their first GE. YEAR I EFFICACY During the primary efficacy period, the rates of RV gastroenteritis were 19, 28, and 39 per 100 child-years in the RRV- TM, RRV-S 1, and placebo groups, respec- tively (Table II). The predominant type was G3; there were only eight cases of serotype G1 disease (2 RRV-TM, 1 RRV- S1, and 5 placebo). For severe RV gas- troenteritis (score, >14), these rates were 4, 7, and 13 per 100 child-years, respec- tively. Vaccine efficacy (with 95% CI) for pre- venting RV gastroenteritis was 50% (26, 67) for RRV-TV and 29% (-1, 50) for RRV-S 1 (p = 0.10 for difference in percent- ages of efficacy). For severe disease the point estimates of vaccine efficacy were higher: 69% (29, 88) for RRV-TVand48% (4, 75) for RRV-S 1. All severe GEs were of type G3. For serotype G3 disease, vac- cine efficacy was 53% (25, 72) for RRV- TV and 20% (-20, 46) for RRV-S 1. The ficacy percentages 81% (-73, 99) for RRV-TV and RRV-S 1, respectively. Cox regression models were fit by ad- justing for gender and breast-feeding sta- tus and time-varying age specification, stratified on geographic area. In these analyses, male incidence rates were 50% higher than female rates (p < 0.05), but there was no evidence of differing efficacy by gender. Efficacy for RRV-TV was somewhat higher, 59% (39, 72), than the 50% of the unadjusted analysis, mainly because study sites were accounted for. The adjusted efficacy for RRV-1 re- mained unchanged at 29% (1, 50). 634 THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS Volume 13 I, Number 4 The intent.-to-treat (effectiveness) analysis was based on all enrolled infants regardless of number or timing of receipt of doses and included all first RV episodes after the first dose. Effectiveness esti- mates for the RRV-TV and RRV-S1 groups were 47% (26, 63) and 29% (3, 48), respectively, compared with the placebo group. YEAR 2 AND OVERALL EFFICACY The number of rotaviral GEs in year 2 of surveillance declined dramatically in all groups (Table II, Fig. 2). The point esti- mates (and 95% CIs) of vaccine efficacy for all RV diarrhea were -3% (-93, 45) for RRV-TV and 4% (-80, 49) for RRV- S1. For severe RV diarrhea, the point estimates were higher: 44% (-121, 88) for RRV-TV and 35% (-139, 84) for RRV-S1. Combining data on all rotaviral episodes from both surveillance years, including the repeated episodes, resulted in 2-year efficacy estimates of 39% (19, 54) for RRV-TV and 27% (5, 44) for RRV-S1. AGE-SPECIFIC EFFICACY We analyzed the age-specific incidence of rotaviral disease from 14 days after dose 5 through the second year of surveil- lance. Analyses by 6-month age groupings demonstrated significant efficacy of the vaccines during the first year of life (Table III): 57% (34, 73) and 55% (3, 54) for RRV-TV and RRV-S1, respectively. Although the point estimates for efficacy after 12 months of age indicated no vac- cine efficacy, the variability of the esti- mates was too high to nile out moderate efficacy at these higher ages. Vaccine Efficacy Against Gastroenteritis of All Causes During the primary efficacy period, the estimates of vaccine efficacy (95% CI) for gastroenteritis of all causes were 7% (-7, 14) for RRV-TV and 8% (-4, 19) for RRV-S1. For all severe episodes, the point estimates were slightly greater: 22% (-3, 42) for RRV-TV and 9% (-20, 31) for RRV-S1. Efficacy estimates for the second year of surveillance, when the number of episodes declined greatly, were slightly lower than during the first year (Table IV).

The rates of adverse reactions observed by us were similar to those seen in the two previous U.S. studies. 8'9 The point estimate of effi- cacy seen in this study for RRV-TV against all RV disease in year 1 was the same as in the multicenter study in a gen- eral U.S. population, with the use of the same close of the vaccine. 9 For RRV-S1, the point estimate of vaccine efficacy in the current study was only 29%, compared with 54% in the multicenter study. 9 This difference is most likely the result of a lack of protection against serotype G3 infec- tion, the predominant serotype in our study. In year 2 the small number of cases of RV gastroenteritis prevents the drawing of firm conclusions about the efficacy of either vaccine. However, there was little suggestion that either vaccine was effica- cious in the second year. Although the numbers of serotype G1 episodes were small, RRV-S1 vaccine appeared to be as efficacious as RRV-TV vaccine against serotype G1 disease during the first year of the study. RRV-TV was more effica- cious against serotype 3 disease, however, with point esmnates of vaccine efficacy 53% for RRV-TV, in comparison with 20% for RRV-S1. This finding, similar to the findings of the multieenter study, suggests that the monovalent RRV-S1 vaccine may be efficacious in preventing serotype 1 dis- ease but provides little heterotypie pro- tection. The efficacy of both vaccines was high- er when analysis for severe disease was based on the severity scoring system. The point estimate of vaccine efficacy for se- vere (score, >14) RV diarrhea was 69% for RRV-TV and 48% for RRV-S1 inyear 1 of surveillance. In year 2 the number of cases of severe RV disease were too few to permit meaningful assessment of efficacy. In the multieenter study, the vaccine effi- cacy for severe disease was 80% for RRV- TV and 69% for RRV-S1. In that study the efficacy for preventing dehydration- SANTOSHAM ET AL. associated rotavirus illness was 100%. 9 There were so few cases of dehydration in our populations, probably because of the aggressive use of oral rehydration thera- py, that we could not make this specific ef- ficacy assessment. This study confirms the findings of the previous U.S. study in which the RRV- TV was found to be efficacious and safe when it was used in a dosage of 4 \u00d7 105 PFU. In a previous U.S. multleenter trial, the efficacy of RRV-TV and RRV-S1, given at a dosage of 4 \u00d7 104 PFU 8 was found to be similar to the efficacy of the same vaccines given at a dosage of 4 x 105 PFU. 9 However, the efficacy of the vac- cine in Peru and Brazil given at a dosage of 4 x 104 PFU was only 50% and 35%, respectively. 25'26 Variations in age-specific attack rates may account for these differ- ing observations. A study is currently in progress in Venezuela to evaluate the effi- cacy of RRV-TV and RRV-S1 given at a dosage of 4 x 105 PFU. In the U.S. multlcenter trial conducted 1 year earlier than the current study using the same vaccines, 9 serotype 1 was detect- ed in 70% and serotype 3 in 22% of cases among placebo recipients. In our placebo group the results were 6% for serotype 1 and 86% for serotype with vari- ation in serotype distribution, suggest that RRV-TV would be a better choice than RRV-S 1 for use on a national level. On the basis of the available data in the U.S. studies, a substantial number of se- vere diarrheal illnesses can be prevented if RRV-TV is used routinely in infancy.
