To this end, we have formed our Health and Safety Committee, led by the esteemed Dr. Sebastian Crespi, who is the President & Scientific Director of Biolinea and a consultant for the World Health Organization on Covid-19 management in the hotel industry worldwide, and joined by a selection of our departamental leaders from within the company. The committee has collaborated to form a new list of additional protocols to complement the Infinite Excellence already found at our properties. \"These new protocols will be an extension of our brand's renowned bespoke service. We want our guests to travel with peace of mind while enjoying the same level of Infinite Excellence as always. Each point is focused on our standards of service, so the guests' full vacation experience is not disturbed.\" - Domingo Aznar, VP of Sales & Marketing for The Excellence Collection Our new protocols are based on knowledge and recommendations from sources such as the World Health Organization, the CDC and the EPA in the United States, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health England, local authorities in the brand's hotel destinations, tour operators, and The Excellence Collection's very own above-the-curve standards. Their fluid design will allow them to evolve along with the Covid-19 situation in the countries where The Excellence Collection properties are located and where its guests reside. Even since before Covid-19, the brand has been closely partnered with Biolinea. This expert agency provides consulting, auditing, and training in the most exacting health standards throughout all hotel departments. The Excellence Collection has always prided itself on its expert-led health and safety processes, and the new post-Covid protocols will be a simple extension of what the brand has always provided for its guests. Below is the list of important information on Health & Safety Protocols for Covid-19 that will take effect upon the reopening of every hotel and resort within The Excellence Collection. Our Cleaning Products - All cleaning and disinfecting products mentioned below are hospital-grade products that meet criteria from the WHO, the CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health England, and the EPA to eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Covid-19).
