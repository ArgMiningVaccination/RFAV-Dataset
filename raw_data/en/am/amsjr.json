Histor Y Mercy College of Ohio, located in Toledo, Ohio, is a private Catholic institution of higher learning with a focus in healthcare. T racing a heritage to the nursing school founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1918, Mercy College of Ohio was incorporated in 1992 and now offers associate of science degrees in Cardiovascular Technology, General Studies, Health Information Technology, Nursing, and Radiologic Technology, and Bachelor of Science degrees in Nursing, Human Biology*, Medical Imaging and Health Care Administration and credit certificates in Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Medical Coding, Paramedic, Ophthalmic Technology, and Polysomnography.

More than an educational institution, Mercy College is a true family, with each member embracing the spirit, mission, and heritage set forth by the founders of the College.

The College seeks to nurture the whole person and to inspire students to be of service and to mentor others through the twenty-first century and beyond. It is precisely these traits that equip each graduate with the resources - and the edge - they need to truly make a difference - the Mercy difference. *pending approval of the Higher Learning Commission5 merc Y colleGe institutional learninG outcomes The philosophy behind a Mercy College education is that an individual, regardless of his/her chosen profession, needs to possess both a broad knowledge-base and the core abilities which characterize an educated person. At Mercy College, this knowledge base and these core abilities are emphasized in all courses. 1. Exhibit proficiency and competency within one's discipline and in service to others. (2012/2013)* 2. Integrate critical thinking skills to reason logically using data from appropriate disciplines to solve problems and make decisions. (2011/2012)* 3. Communicate clearly in both written and oral forms of expression. (2011/2012)* 4. Demonstrate an understanding of Catholic beliefs and faith within one's ethical and professional decision-making. (2012/2013)* 5. Display an understanding of cultures and experiences that characterize the global community. (2013/2014)* * The College Assessment Committee has recommended this academic year for measurement of this learning outcome. tHe colleGe seal The Mercy College of Ohio seal combines symbols of the traditions of the Sisters of Mercy, healthcare and higher education, all of which reflect the mission of the College. The Mercy cross is the central symbol representing Christian values. The Mercy shield represents the Mercy tradition of excellence, grounding a search for the innovative in a history of demonstrated professional competence. The lamp and book, signs of service and the pursuit of knowledge, combine to affirm that truth is found and articulated in a context of respect and commitment to all persons. The College motto \"Misericordia et Cura,\" meaning compassion and care, focuses on the values which are vital to the healing ministry. PurPose of a ccreditation Accreditation is a formal recognition of the excellence of an educational institution. It provides assurances to the public that quality standards are being met, that credits and degrees will be recognized by other colleges and universities and access to federal grant and financial aid programs will be available to the institution and its students. And while many of Mercy College's programs are accredited by specialized accrediting agencies, such as the 6 National League for Nursing (NLNAC), the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management (CAHIIM)and the Joint Review Commission on Education in Radiologic Technologies (JRCERT), these programmatic accreditations would not be possible without regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Centrality of student learning is the core requirement of accrediting bodies, be they specialized or regional. Commitment to and validation of effective teaching and learning processes are what accreditation standards mandate and these external requirements are no different than what those at Mercy College, expect from themselves. accreditations and aPPro Vals Mercy College of Ohio is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and is authorized by the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR) to grant bachelor of science degrees in human biology*, nursing and healthcare administration, associate degrees in nursing, radiologic technology, health information technology and general studies and certificates in EMT, medical coding, paramedic, polysomnographic technology and ophthalmic technology. *HLC authorization is pending.

Notification to an individual instructor or failure to attend class does not constitute an official withdrawal. An official withdrawal occurs when a student notifies the Student Records Office through the completion of a Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Form, by email via their Mercy College email account or by phone. An effective date of withdrawal and clarification of withdrawal from a course(s) or from the College is required. An exit interview with the Financial Aid Office is required for students receiving financial aid.

A week is defined as seven calendar days.return of title iV funds Polic Y Policy Mercy College must determine the amount of Federal Financial Aid a student has earned if he/she withdraws, \"disappears,\" is dismissed, or takes a leave of absence prior to completing 60% of the term. Once a student completes 60% of the term, all financial aid is considered earned. This policy is based on 34 CFR, Section 668.22 of Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended.18 TOLEDO anD YOUnGSTOWn InFORMa TIOnThe Federal formula requires a return of Title IV aid if the student received funds in the form of a Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), and/or Federal Direct loans and withdraws on or before completing 60% of the term. The percentage of aid to be returned is equal to the number of calendar days remaining in the term divided by the number of calendar days in the term. Scheduled breaks of five days or more consecutive days are not included. A repayment may be required when funds have been disbursed to a student in excess of the amount of aid the student earned during the term. If less aid was disbursed than was earned, the student is eligible to receive a post-withdrawal disbursement. The responsibility for returning unearned aid is allocated between the College and the student. The College returns the lesser of: institutional charges X unearned percentage, or Title IV aid disbursed X unearned percentage The student returns: any remaining unearned aid not covered by the College any loan funds are repaid in accordance with the terms of the promissory note any grant amount is an overpayment. This can be paid to the College within 45 days. If it is not paid within 45 days, arrangements must be made with the Department of Education to repay the funds. A student risks losing eligibility for federal financial aid if arrangements are not made. Mercy College will return its portion of the unearned aid to the Title IV programs as specified by law. The student will be notified of the amount he/she owes to the Title IV programs and given instructions on payment options. Mercy College will bill the student for any charges still owed to the institution. Example: Susie Student enrolled for spring semester (1/9/2012 - 5/6/2012). She decided to move to Florida to see the sunshine and withdrew from the College on 3/6/2012. Susie had a zero balance on her account at the time. Susie received the following Federal Financial Aid: Federal Pell Grant $2775 FSEOG $100 Federal Direct Subsidized Loan $1742 Total aid disbursed = $461719 TOLEDO anD YOUnGSTOWn InFORMa TIOnSusie had completed 50% of the semester at the time of her withdraw. This means she only earned $2308.50 of her Federal Financial Aid, $2308.50 would have to be returned to the Title IV programs. Since Susie's withdrawal is after the fourth week of classes, there would be no institutional tuition refund. Therefore, Susie would owe Mercy College $2308.50 (the amount of aid not earned). This sample illustrates that withdrawing from all classes can have a huge financial impact. Please contact the Financial Aid Office at financialaid@mercycollege.edu or 419-251-1598 for further information. financial aid The staff members of the Financial Aid Office are available to assist students in need of financial assistance. The College makes every effort within its means to help students finance their education. Information is available to assist any student who needs financial aid to supplement the family effort. Eligibility Requirements To be eligible for financial assistance, a student must: be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident be enrolled in an eligible program and registered for the number of credit hours required by the type of financial aid being requested make satisfactory academic progress in the enrolled program complete a free application for federal student aid (FASFA) not be in default on any loan and/or owe a repayment on any grant be registered with Selective Service, if required Satisfactory Academic ProgressAny student receiving financial aid is required to make Satisfactory Academic Progress to continue to receive financial aid at Mercy College of Ohio. 1.

Credits earned for a degree already awarded by Mercy College are not included in the 150% of the new degree program. For example, if the published length of an academic program is 120 credit hours, the maximum time frame that the student will be eligible to receive financial aid must not exceed 180 credit hours (120 credit hours X 150% = 180 credit hours). Please note this will include any transfer hours. 2. The student must maintain a cumulative GPA as outlined in the Academic 20 TOLEDO anD YOUnGSTOWn InFORMa TIOnDismissal Policy in this catalog.

Certificate seeking students will be evaluated at the end of each semester. If a student is found not to meet the above requirements, he/she will be placed on Financial Aid Probation for the period of up to two terms. At the conclusion of the probationary time, if the student has not completed the required coursework and/or attained the required GPA, financial aid eligibility will be terminated. Any student may appeal the decision to revoke financial aid. A written appeal must be submitted to the Financial Aid Director, along with supporting documentation. The appeal will be reviewed by the Financial Aid Committee and the student will be notified in writing of the decision within seven working days.

All colleges are required to participate in the disclosure of completion rates. SRTK reports full-time, first-time degree seeking students for each fall semester. The SRTK reports outcomes: the Completion Rate (the total number of students in the cohort who earn either a degree, a certificate, or who successfully completed a two-year-equivalent transfer-preparatory program) and the T ransfer Rate (the total number of cohort non-completers who were identified as having enrolled in another institution). A student shall be counted as a completion or graduated if, within 150 percent of the normal time for completion of or graduation from the program, the student has completed or graduated from the program, or enrolled in any program of an eligible institution for which the prior program provides substantial preparation. In compliance with the Student Right to Know Act, Mercy College of Ohio reported to IPEDS a persistence rate (completion rate) of 51% based on the 2005 cohort. Please note that only 37% of the entering students were counted in calculating the graduation rate. student militar Y lea Ve Polic Y From time to time, students who are serving in the Guards or Reserves may be called to active status before a semester has started, or once a semester has started. The provisions outlined for students who are serving in the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard Reserves or a member of the National Guard who have been called to active duty or active service as outlined in the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 will be followed when this happens. Procedures 1. A student called to active duty or service once enrolled at the College must provide copies of his/her orders. Once this paper work is received an administrative withdrawal will be processed for those so impacted who are currently enrolled at the College. 2. Title IV Student Aid. a. Recipients of student financial assistance under Title IV of the Act who are affected individuals will not be placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance because of their status as affected individuals;25 TOLEDO anD YOUnGSTOWn InFORMa TIOnb. Administrative requirements placed on affected individuals who are recipients of student financial assistance are minimized, to the extent possible without impairing the integrity of the student financial assistance programs, to ease the burden on such students and avoid inadvertent, technical violations or defaults; c. The calculation of \"annual adjusted family income\" and \"available income\", as used in the determination of need for student financial assistance under Title IV of the Act for any such affected individual (and the determination of such need for his or her spouse and dependents, if applicable), may be modified to mean the sums received in the first calendar year of the award year for which such determination is made, in order to reflect more accurately the financial condition of such affected individual and his or her family; d. The calculation under section 484B(b)(2) of the Act (20 U.S.C. 1091b(b)(2)) of the amount a student is required to return in the case of an affected individual may be modified so that no overpayment will be required to be returned or repaid if the institution has documented the student's status as an affected individual in the student's file and the amount of any overpayment discharged. 3. T uition Refunds or Credits. a. Mercy College will provide a full refund to students who are affected individuals for that portion of a period of instruction each student was unable to complete, or for which such individual did not receive academic credit, because he/she was called up for active duty or active service; and b. If affected individuals withdraw from a course of study as a result of such active duty or active service, Mercy College will make every effort to minimize deferral of enrollment or reapplication requirements and will provide as much flexibility as possible with administrative deadlines related to the application process. NOTE: an affected individual will need to comply with revisions in the admission criteria which may have occurred while he/she was on active duty or service. 4. Repeating a Course. An affected individual enrolled in a nursing program of study who has been away from the College for more than one full academic year will be required to repeat any nursing courses he/she has taken. This may apply to courses in other professional programs as well.26 TOLEDO anD YOUnGSTOWn InFORMa TIOnmerc Y alumni association The Mercy Alumni Association, founded in 1923, currently serves more than 3,600 graduates from Mercy School of Nursing and Mercy College of Ohio.

Please see current Program Handbook for deadlines and requirements. The College expects each student to make satisfactory academic progress toward attaining an expressed educational objective. Satisfactory academic progress is measured in terms of both the number of courses completed and grades earned. The College considers the satisfactory grade for all courses to be a C or better. Class Standing Mercy College of Ohio is on a semester system. Fall and spring semesters each span 16 weeks (includes 5-week, 6-week, 8-week, 10-week and 12-week courses). Total weeks of the summer sessions vary in number (see academic calendar on page 9). Final examinations and clinical evaluations are scheduled during the last week of each semester. Clinical practicum and laboratory hours vary and are designated in the course descriptions found at the end of this catalog. Students are classified by the total number of credit hours earned at Mercy College of Ohio, any transfer credits that have been accepted by the college and/or completion of required courses for the appropriate year (i.e., level 1 nursing courses must be completed prior to obtaining level 2 status). YEAR HOURS First Year 0-29.9 hours Second Year 30-59.9 hours Third Year 60-89.9 hours (Bachelor program only) Fourth Year 90 hours (Bachelor program only) Grading System Mercy College of Ohio will use the following system to calculate a student's grade point average (GPA): GRAdE QUAlit Y POint S AcHiE vEmEnt A 4.0 points Excellent B 3.0 points Good C 2.0 points Satisfactory D 1.0 point Unsatisfactory F 0.0 points Failure I Incomplete K Credit by examination29 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureS P Pass (no effect on grade point average; equal to C or better) AU Audit (no credit) NG No Grade reported per instructor at the time grades are due. NG grade will not affect the student's grade point average (GPA). IW Instructor withdrawal given when a student fails to attend any sessions of a course for which registered as of the term's add/drop date. Once a student has been issued an IW, he/she is not permitted to reenroll in the course for that semester. R Repeated course - a student may be allowed to retake for credit a course in which a grade of less than 'C' has been received. Only the second grade is computed in the cumulative GPA. Both grades will appear on the transcript. W Withdrawn prior to mid-term WA Withdrawal from an audited class WF Withdrawn failing at or following mid-term WP Withdrawn passing at or following mid-term The clinical component of nursing courses is graded satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on attainment of course objectives. An unsatisfactory grade in the clinical component constitutes a failure in the course. A satisfactory grade in the clinical component results in the grade obtained in the theory component of the course. Incomplete If a student is unable to complete all requirements, due to extenuating circumstances approved by the instructor, an incomplete may be issued. The incomplete will not be calculated into the grade point average. Incomplete course work must be completed within 10 class days of the next term or the grade will be changed to an F . The student will receive the letter grade when all work has been successfully completed. This grade will be reflected on the current semester's grade report. Failure to complete specific courses may cause withdrawal from the program if it interferes with required sequencing of course work within the program of study. Exceptions may be granted by an instructor only in unusual circumstances and with the approval of the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Course Repeat Process If a student wishes to register a third time for a course he/she did not pass with a C or higher, he/she must obtain permission from the Associate Dean of the division in which the course is offered. The student must present documented reasons why he/she was unable to pass the course on the first two attempts and what measures the student will take to ensure success in the third attempt. If the request is granted, the student will not be permitted to take any 30 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSother course(s) while enrolled in the course being repeated. Note: This will impact financial aid. The student will also be required to sign and abide by the stipulations in a Learning Contract. If possible, the student must enroll in a section taught by a different instructor than in either of the previous attempts. Audit Policy Any student auditing a class must notify the Student Records Office during regular or late registration. Furthermore, a student wishing to audit a class must have the permission of the instructor. The student who is auditing a class is not required to take examinations. Students may not audit the clinical component of any nursing or allied health course. An audit designation will appear on the student's transcript; however, no credit is given as it is not included in the student's grade point average or total course load for purposes of enrollment certification. An audit withdrawal designation (WA) will be recorded on the student's transcript if the instructor certifies that the student has not regularly attended classes. A student may not change class registration status either from audit to credit or from credit to audit after the second week of the class. Credit by Examination may not be requested on the basis of auditing a class. The fee for audited courses is the same as the current credit hour fee. Course Waiver/Substitution A course waiver/substitution form must be completed and filed with the Student Records Office for each of the following situations: Waiver When the academic advisor judges that a student has a sufficient amount of coursework in a particular area to meet a course requirement. When a student's academic advisor has agreed to accept transfer credits for courses taken over seven years ago. When an academic advisor approves an overload of credits to be taken in one semester. Substitution A student may request a course substitution (if an appropriate substitution is available) when a required course in the student's program of study is no longer offered or is cancelled by the College and the inability to take this course will interfere with the student's academic progress and/or will prevent a timely graduation. It is assumed that the student is not responsible for this situation (i.e., the problem is not related to previous course failures or the student's decision not to follow the prescribed semester-by-semester curriculum plan). A student may request a course substitution if (after the student's initial semester of matriculation) changes were made to an academic program by the College resulting 31 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSin coursework completed by the student that is no longer required by the program of study. This is not intended to imply the existence of a \"grandfather\" clause, since the requirements of the relevant professional accreditation association must take precedence. A student must take the following into account when requesting a course substitution: > Proposed course substitutions must be consistent with the academic goals of the program. > Course substitutions apply only to courses taken at Mercy College. > Mercy College residency requirements must be followed. > No more than two course substitutions may be made to a student's academic program. For a Mercy College of Ohio student to petition for a course waiver or a course substitution: 1. The student must obtain a Waiver/Substitution Form from the Student Records Office. 2. The student must complete the course information and justification for waiver/substitution. 3. The student must meet with his/her academic advisor to review the request. If the petition is found to have merit, the advisor signs off on the request. Then the student must obtain a signature from the Associate Dean of the division in which the course to be waived/substituted resides. 4. When all required signatures have been obtained, the student then submits the form to the Student Records Office. 5. The Student Records Office distributes signed copies to the student and advisor and places a copy in the student's permanent file. 6. The Student Records Office then makes appropriate notations in the student database system. Credit by ExaminationStandardized or departmentally prepared examinations may be taken for academic credit (per instructor's and Associate Dean's approval). A student must obtain a grade of C or better or its predefined equivalent per the College Board Exam criteria (Advanced Placement and CLEP). These examinations may be attempted if: 1. A student has not already audited or attended and failed the course at any college or university. 2. The faculty involved assess that the student has sufficient knowledge either through prior work experiences or credits in closely related areas. Credit obtained by departmentally prepared examinations will be recorded on the student's transcript with a K and will not be calculated in the student's grade point average. For exams taken through the College Board (Advancement Placement and CLEP), the credits are 32 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureStransferred to the College and are recorded into the total earned hours.

The quality points per course are determined by multiplying the number of semester hours (1, 2, 3, etc.) by the number of quality points assigned to the grade received (A=4, B=3, etc.). The sum of the quality points received for all courses within a term is then divided by the number of semester hours attempted in that term. Courses withdrawn, transferred, or audited are not included in the hours except in the case of a 'WF' which counts the same as an 'F' and will be calculated in the grade point average. Cumulative Grade Point Average Cumulative grade point average is based only on work completed while enrolled at Mercy College of Ohio. The cumulative GPA equals the sum of the quality points for all courses divided by the number of semester hours attempted for credit. Courses from which a student has withdrawn prior to the last withdrawal date, as well as courses that were audited or taken at another institution, are not included in a student's Mercy College GPA. Grades of 'WF' earned at Mercy College are included in the calculation. Academic Honors President's ListA President's List is compiled each academic semester to honor students whose performance is judged to have been at the highest level. To qualify, students must have completed 14 or more credit hours of coursework during the semester and earned a semester grade point average of 4.0. Students with incomplete grades at the end of the semester will not be eligible for this honor. Dean's List for Full-time Students In recognition of academic excellence, full time students completing 12 or more credit hours during the semester with 3.3 or better semester grade point average will be named to the Dean's List. Students with incomplete grades at the end of the semester will not be eligible for this honor. Honors List for Part-time Students At the end of each semester, students who have completed 6-11 credit hours of coursework during the semester and earned a 3.3 or better semester grade point average will be named to an Honors List. Students with incomplete grades at the end of the semester will not be eligible for this honor.36 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSGrade Reports Grade reports are available online through the EMPOWERME! link. Students need to use their given username and password to enter the system. Grade reports are not released to students with outstanding financial account balances who have not made arrangements for payment, or to students who have outstanding paperwork due to Student Services, or to students who have outstanding library book/fees. Transcripts The Mercy College of Ohio transcript is the official record of student academic progress, documenting all course grades, grade point average and degrees awarded. T ranscripts are issued from the Student Records Office upon written request by the student. The Family Rights and Privacy Act serves as the basis for releasing information about students. T ranscripts will not be issued for former or current students who have outstanding financial obligations to the College. The College will not provide students with copies of transcripts from other institutions. \"Unofficial\" copies of transcripts issued directly to students will be stamped \"Unofficial.\" Official copies bear the signature of either the Registrar, President, or Vice President of Academic Affairs and the seal of the College. Official transcripts will not be sent or given directly to students. When requesting a transcript, students must include name, present address, social security number, birth date, maiden name, estimated date of last attendance, signature and the name and address to which the transcript should be sent. T ranscripts for Mercy College of Northwest Ohio, St. Vincent's School of Nursing, St. Vincent's School of Radiography and Mercy School of Nursing can also be obtained from the Student Records Office. Post Enrollment Transfer of Credit Once students enroll at Mercy College of Ohio they are encouraged to complete all their course work at the College. The rationale for this policy rests in the mission and philosophy of the College and in its concern for the essential unity and integrity of all aspects of the curriculum. However, recognizing that students may have compelling reasons for completing coursework at another institution, the College does allow for the transfer of up to six hours of coursework from another institution after matriculation at Mercy College. This policy applies to the transfer of coursework after a student has initially enrolled at Mercy College. Such transfer is subject to the following procedures and guidelines. 1. Students must be in good academic standing (maintaining an overall grade point average of 2.0 or better) to be eligible for taking courses at another institution of higher education. 2. A Post-Enrollment T ransfer Credit Form (can be obtained from the Student Records Office) with a copy of the catalog description of the institution from which 37 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSthe student proposes to take a course is to be attached to the form. Additional documentation, such as a course syllabus, may be required. The form must be signed by the students' academic advisors and Associate Deans and submitted to the Student Records Office of Mercy College prior to enrolling in the course. 3. Only courses which have the prior approval of the academic advisor and Associate Dean will be accepted for transfer credit. In addition, only courses with a grade of C or better will be accepted for transfer. 4. Once enrolled at Mercy College of Ohio, students upon written approval by the students' academic advisor may take up to six hours of course work at another higher education institution. 5. Students must meet the minimum residency requirements of Mercy College (see Residency Requirements on page 40). Attendance PolicyFaculty believes that regular classroom and clinical experience attendance are necessary for academic success. Students are expected to attend class and are required to attend clinical experiences. Clinical experience absence that results in potential failure to meet course objectives may interfere with course success. The complete attendance policies are located in the program handbooks distributed at the start of the program. Academic Advising Upon admission to a degree program, each student is assigned an academic advisor who will work with the student throughout the student's enrollment. Course student/faculty conferences will be held at scheduled times for all clinical experience courses. Academic advising must occur prior to each registration term. Leave of Absence A student in good academic standing may request a leave of absence for health or other personal reasons. A \"curriculum leave of absence\" may be requested by a student needing a course that is not offered until a later term. A leave of absence shall not exceed twelve months. After that, the student will be considered a readmission applicant, unless an extension of the leave of absence has been granted by the Vice President of Academic Affairs. The student must request the leave of absence in writing by submitting a completed Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Form available from the Student Records Office. The student on a leave of absence must satisfy any conditions of the leave before re-entering and must comply with the course sequence and/or any curricular changes at the time of re-entry. The student must inform the College one term before returning to enable orientation to be arranged. A student's return is subject to available space at the time of re-entry to the program.38 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSChange of Status/Address A student must complete a Change of Status form through the Student Records Office. A change of status/address through any other office will not result in an official change in the College's computer database system. Failure to complete a change of status with the Student Records Office is likely to result in important mail not reaching the student. Residency Requirements Associate of Science DegreesStudents must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours from Mercy College of Ohio that includes at least one religion course taught from the Catholic perspective. Once a student enrolls at Mercy College, only six hours of credit can be transferred in from another institution of higher education to satisfy the graduation requirements of each program of study in which a student enrolls. Because of changes in course requirements/course presentation at the Youngstown site, matriculated students enrolled in the Associate of Science Degree program in Nursing at that campus will be allowed to transfer in eight credit hours from another institution of higher education. Note, this increased number of hours applies only to Anatomy and Physiology. The six hour limit applies to all other courses in the program of study. Bachelor of Science Degrees Students must complete a minimum of 36 hours from Mercy College of Ohio and include at least one religious studies course taught from the Catholic perspective. Once a student enrolls at Mercy College, only six hours of credit can be transferred in from another institution of higher education to satisfy the graduation requirements of each program of study in which a student enrolls. General Education Graduation Requirements In conjunction with the integration of general education throughout the curriculum, degree and certificate programs will vary as to specific general education requirements supportive of that field of study. Associate of Science Degrees The College requires that all associate degree graduates complete credits in the following areas of study: Religious Studies 3 Credit Hours English Composition 6 Credit Hours Social Sciences 3 Credit Hours Natural Sciences 6 Credit Hours Student Success Strategies 2 Credit Hours - Required of first time college students only Humanities 3 Credit Hours39 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSBachelor of Science Degrees All baccalaureate graduates of Mercy College are required to complete the credit hours designated in the following areas of study: English Composition 6 credit hours Mathematics 3 credit hours Natural Science 8 credit hours Social Science 6 credit hours - One selection must be Cultural Diversity **Humanities 3 credit hours - IDS 399 or any 300/400 level Humanities or Social Science course Religious Studies 9 credit hours - One course must be Medical Ethics from the Catholic perspectiveStudent Success Strategies 2 credit hours - Required of first time college students total 35/37 c redit hours *Nine credit hours of general education coursework must be taken at the 300-400 level*Humanities = Art, Communications, English, Foreign Language, History, IDS, Music & Religious Studies*Social Sciences = Psychology & Sociology**Unless the 300/400 level General Education course is already specified within that student's program of study.

A signed diploma will be issued to each graduate after all grades are posted, providing all graduation requirements have been met. Graduation Honors Students who have demonstrated academic excellence will receive a degree with honors. For the commencement program and awarding of honor cords, the honors designation is based on the cumulative grade point earned in the term prior to commencement. For transcript and diploma purposes, the honors designation is based on the final cumulative grade point. High Honors 3.70 - 4.0 Gold Cords Honors 3.30 - 3.69 Blue Cords RegistrationThe schedule of classes is available on the Mercy College website each semester prior to registration week. Registration information and procedures are e-mailed to students and posted throughout the College.

Please note that the withdrawal process may take up to ten business days. Requests for transcripts will not be processed until the withdrawal has been processed and financial obligations have been met. Withdrawal Policy The withdrawal date will be determined by the College as: 1. The date the student begins the withdrawal process. 2. The midpoint of the semester if the student withdraws without notification to the College.Or3. The student's last date of attendance in a course. The student transcript will indicate a 'W' if the student completes the process prior to the last day to Withdraw according to the Add/Drop/Withdraw Table. After the last day to Withdraw, the student transcript will indicate a 'WP' or 'WF' depending on the student's standing in the course. Course work completed before withdrawal is forfeited. Any course withdrawal after the published deadline for the current term will receive a grade of 'WP' (withdrawal pass) or 'WF' (withdrawal fail). A grade of 'WP' will not affect grade point average; however, a grade of 'WF' counts the same as an 'F' and will be calculated in the grade point average. Students are not permitted to withdraw during finals week. Administrative Withdrawal Students interested in pursuing an administrative withdrawal must pick up the form located outside of the Student Records Office. Progression/Repeating a Course To progress successfully through Mercy College of Ohio, a student must obtain at least a 'C' grade in all courses taken. A grade of 'D' is considered unsatisfactory for progression in the College but is recorded on the transcript and calculated as 1.0 for GPA purposes. A student may retake for credit any course in which a grade of 'D' or 'F' has been earned. Only the second grade will be computed in the cumulative GPA. Both grades will appear on the transcript. Although a student may be allowed to repeat a course more than one time, this forgiveness policy does not apply beyond the first repeat attempt for any one course. Academic Probation A student will be placed on academic probation when: 1. The cumulative grade point average in all college work attempted at Mercy College falls below 2.0. 2. The student withdraws from all or a substantial portion of a program of study two successive semesters.44 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureS3. The student fails to comply, after due notice, with an academic requirement or regulation which is routine for all students or a defined group of students (e.g., failure to complete health requirements.) The student shall be removed from academic probation when the cumulative grade point average in all college work attempted at Mercy College is 2.0 or higher and/or when all other conditions for removal have been met. As long as a student remains on academic probation, the student's academic department may impose enrollment restrictions. A student who fails to meet the requirements for progression within a specific program of study may be academically dismissed from the program but may be eligible to continue as a Mercy College student. Probation Procedure 1. A representative from the Student Records Office will notify the student in writing of his/her probationary status after grades have been posted. This notification will include the conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances which would lead to academic dismissal, should probation not be removed. This notification will be sent after grades are received by the Student Records Office. The conditions for continuation/reinstatement as a degree-seeking student will be conveyed via an Academic Probation Contract. 2. Copies of all correspondence regarding academic probation will be sent to: The Student Records Office for inclusion in the student's file. The original copy of any signed academic contracts will also be housed in the student's academic file. Academic Advisors. The student. Associate Deans. Academic Dismissal 1.

Students academically dismissed from the College may request in writing to the APG Committee (directed through the Student Records Office) consideration for readmission. The decision to readmit an applicant will be based on academic records, availability of space and progress with any recommendations made at the time of withdrawal/dismissal including fulfillment of the requirements of the Academic Probation contract. Those students who have requested and been approved for readmission following academic dismissal will be readmitted on probation. A student who has been academically dismissed from Mercy College for the first time must sit out of College for at least one semester (16 weeks) following dismissal. Students academically dismissed for the second time must sit out for a minimum of two years prior to applying for readmission to the College. Applicants will not be considered for readmission if they have been academically dismissed from Mercy College more than twice.

Admission and/or readmission criteria to the program of study must be met (see individual degree program handbooks.) After one year, an application and fee will be required. Policies Academic Integrity The purpose of education is to advance one's intellectual skills and knowledge and to demonstrate the outcomes of these efforts. An essential and shared value in higher education is presenting one's own work and properly acknowledging that of others. Any violation of this principle constitutes academic dishonesty resulting in disciplinary action. Forms of academic dishonesty include but are not necessarily limited to the following: Plagiarism - submitting all or part of another's work as one's own in an academic exercise, such as an examination, computer file, or written assignment. This includes, but is not 46 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSlimited to, submitting papers written by someone else, such as a family member or friend, or downloading parts of or entire term papers from the internet and then submitting them as one's own work. It also includes use of another's words as one's own, be that paraphrasing or direct quotation, without proper citation. Cheating - using or attempting to use unauthorized materials on an examination or assignment, such as using unauthorized texts or notes or improperly obtaining, or attempting to obtain, copies of an examination or answers to an examination. This also includes sharing or receiving content from exams or quizzes by way of another student. Facilitating academic dishonesty - helping another to commit an act of academic dishonesty, such as substitution for an examination, completing an assignment for someone else, or sharing of computer files. Fabrication - altering or transmitting, without authorization, academic information or records.Multiple Submissions -- submitting the same paper/project for credit in multiple classes, without permission of the instructors involved. Reporting Cases of Academic Dishonesty Step OneEach case of academic dishonesty must be reported to the appropriate Associate Dean in a formal written charge by the faculty member with firsthand knowledge of the violation, as soon as possible after the incident is discovered. Step Two The faculty member must have a discussion with the student, within five class days after the incident is reported to the Associate Dean. Step Three The incident must then be documented on the Academic Counseling form, before notification of the student by certified mail. Step Four The faculty member must inform the student of the charge, via certified mail delivery. The written charge must contain the following: The particular allegation; The names of other participants or witness(es) when appropriate; The date and time, location and relevant circumstances of the incident; and A copy of the relevant sections of the College Catalog concerning academic dishonesty and the appeal process.47 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSPenalty for Academic Dishonesty During a student's academic career at Mercy College, each incident of academic dishonesty will be reported in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean. A disciplinary notation for academic dishonesty will be entered in the student's academic record. A student found to have committed an act of academic dishonesty will not have the option to withdraw from the class in which the first incident occurred. A second finding of academic dishonesty shall exclude a student from consideration for academic honors. The penalty for the first incident of academic dishonesty will be a score of zero on the particular item being submitted and a written warning. The second incident of academic dishonesty in the same course as the first incident occurred or any other course will result in a failing grade for the course in which the second infraction occurred. A third incident of academic dishonesty will result in disciplinary dismissal. The Associate Dean shall then notify the Student Records Office to enter the notation \"dismissed for academic dishonesty\" on the student's file in the database system. These actions may be appealed as outlined below. Also see the \"Student Academic Appeal Process\" in the College Catalog. *Note: A college class day is defined as any day that the College holds classes including final examination week.

If the intent to appeal is not initiated within this time frame, the student's right to appeal will have been waived. The \"Application for Formal Academic Appeal\" can be found on the College website. The completed form must be submitted to the Student Records Office. 48 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSAfter the above written notification is filed with the Student Records Office, the student proceeds to Step T wo of the appeal process as listed below. Step Two A good faith discussion must take place between the student and the specific faculty member. The student must initiate the good faith discussion within ten class days of the day the faculty member submitted grades on a unit exam, clinical evaluation, or laboratory evaluation to the class. In the case of an appeal of a final course grade, the good faith discussion must take place within the first ten class days of the following semester. (In the case of an appeal of a Charge and/or Penalty for violation of the Academic Integrity Policy, the good faith discussion must be initiated by the student within ten class days* of the certified mail delivery of the charge. - See catalog section \"Academic Integrity\"). If the good faith discussion is not initiated within these time frames, the student's right to appeal will have been waived. If the good faith discussion has not resolved the matter and the student wishes to pursue the appeal further, the faculty member will direct the student to the Program Chair under whose jurisdiction the course resides and the appeal will move to the third step. Step Three The student must submit the appeal in writing to the appropriate Program Chair within five class days from the date of the good faith discussion with the faculty member or the student's right to appeal will have been waived. For subject areas such as English, math and science where there is no Program Chair the appeal is to be sent to the respective Associate Dean. The written documentation contained in the appeal must include the following: Student name Course name, number, semester Faculty member name Date of good faith discussion with faculty member Date of submission of written appeal to the Program Chair or Associate Dean Reason for further appeal Desired outcome The student, faculty member, Associate Dean or the Program Chair may request a discussion of the appeal with the parties specifically involved, either individually or together, as deemed appropriate by the Program Chair. The Program Chair will issue a written decision (to be sent by certified mail - return receipt requested) to the student and the faculty member within ten class days of the date the appeal is submitted to her/him. If the student or the faculty member believes the Program Chair's decision has not adequately resolved the matter, either the student or the faculty member may move forward to step four of the appeal process, submission of the appeal to the Associate Dean. If the faculty member is the Associate Dean to whom the appeal would 49 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSnormally be submitted, the Vice President of Academic Affairs will appoint another Associate Dean to consider the appeal. Step Four (If the step three appeal was made directly to the Associate Dean and a student wishes to continue the appeal, step four should be disregarded.) The student must submit the appeal in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean within ten class days from the date of receipt of the decision of the Program Chair or the student's right to appeal will have been waived. The written documentation contained in the appeal must include the following: A copy of the written response of the Program Chair A written statement of why the student disagrees with the decisions of the faculty member and Program Chair The Associate Dean will issue a written decision to the student, the faculty member and the Program Chair within 15 class days of the date the appeal is submitted via registered mail to the Associate Dean. If the student, faculty member or Program Chair believes the Associate Dean's decision has not adequately resolved the matter, either the student, the faculty member or Chair may move forward to step five of the appeal process, submission of the appeal to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Step Five The student or faculty member must submit the appeal and its step three and four documentation, including the written decision of the Associate Dean, to the Vice President of Academic Affairs within five class days from the date the written decision was received or the right to appeal will have been waived. The Vice President of Academic Affairs will conduct such hearings with the parties specifically involved as deemed necessary and issue a final decision within 15 class days of receipt of the appeal. While the College will make every reasonable effort to adhere to the timelines listed in the appeals policy, circumstances such as access to information, availability of personnel and school breaks may justify an extension of time. Student Academic Appeal Process in Cases of Dismissal from the College or a Specific Program of StudyStudents disputing dismissal from the College or from a specific program of study within the College may appeal in compliance with the following procedure: Step One The student must notify the College in writing of the intent to begin the formal academic appeal process within 10 class days of receiving written notice of the dismissal. If the intent 50 AcAdemic St And Ard S, policieS And procedureSto appeal is not initiated within this time frame, the student's right to appeal will have been waived. The \"Application for Formal Academic Appeal\" can be found on the College website. The completed form must be submitted to the Student Records Office. After the above written notification is filed with the Student Records Office, the student proceeds to Step T wo of the appeal process as listed below. Step Two The student must submit the appeal in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean within 10 class days from the date of receipt of the decision to dismiss. The written documentation contained in the appeal must include a written statement of why the student disagrees with the decision for dismissal.

Through the assessment of student learning, the College can ascertain the extent to which it is meeting its mission and make improvements in program design, curricula and instruction. Assessment of student learning at the program level provides quantitative and qualitative data about what the program is designed to accomplish and what students should know, understand, and be able to achieve upon graduation. The assessment process produces information which supports data driven decisions for program improvement. Assessment of student learning at the institutional level determines the capabilities of students not only in their respective programs of study, but also in their attainment of Mercy College's Institutional Learning Outcomes: 1. Communication2. Critical Thinking 3. Mathematics4. Values and Catholic Identity 5. Computer Technology 6. Science7. Humanities8. Social and Global Consciousness 9. Lifelong Learning These Learning Outcomes are also integrated into and reinforced in all discipline-specific programs. Assessment activities are conducted from student entry to student exit and post graduation, and students will be asked to participate in these activities throughout their tenure at the College. Student participation is crucial to the assessment process to help guide the College in the advancement of its institutional effectiveness.

Before an application is sent, all applicants should make sure they meet all the requirements for admission to Mercy College. Meeting standards at the minimum level does not guarantee admission to the general college and/or program of study. Applicants to Mercy College tend to be highly qualified and the Admissions Committee screens candidates individually to determine that they meet high standards. Careful consideration is given to a number of factors in reviewing applications: academic records, performance in math and science courses, likelihood of success in program of study and standardized test scores (ACT or SAT). Applicants should have an interest in the mission and purposes of the College and accept the standards depicted by the values defined in the College's mission and vision. Practice in various health professions requires specific physical skills and abilities. Questions about the competencies required for students should be discussed with an admissions representative.71 Procedures for AdMIssIoNThe following are online programs* offered through the Toledo Campus: 1. Bachelor of Science in Health Care Administration (completion program for those with an Associate Degree or approved healthcare diploma) 2.

It is the responsibility of the applicant to request all the above-required documents be sent directly to Mercy College. T ranscripts issued to students or unofficial transcripts cannot be accepted by the College.72 Procedures for AdMIssIoNOnce all of the above items have been received, then the applicant file is considered \"complete.\" Each completed application is given individual attention by the College Admissions Committee, which makes all decisions on admissions to the College.

Reservation/Matriculation Card All accepted applicants must submit a reservation/matriculation card. Should an applicant decide not to enroll at Mercy College after submitting the card, the Admissions Office should be notified in writing. 2. COMPASS Placement Testing Students who have not earned a college degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education may be required to complete a number of COMPASS placement tests before starting classes at Mercy College. Such COMPASS placement tests are designed to provide information about student abilities in reading, writing and mathematics and to provide guidance for determining the course(s) students may need to enhance their success in college. If a student has been admitted to either the Nursing or Radiologic Technology program and shows a need for additional coursework in reading, writing and/or mathematics as identified by COMPASS placement testing, the student will not be able to start the clinical portion of the program until the courses are successfully completed. All other students must complete additional coursework within the first two semesters at Mercy College or risk dismissal. If a student does not successfully meet required reading and writing minimum scores after two attempts, the student will not be allowed to enroll at Mercy College. A student who has never attended an institution of higher education or has been admitted provisionally is required to successfully complete GEN 101: Student Success Strategies, a two credit hour course, within his/her first two semesters of enrollment at Mercy College. 3. Orientation Accepted students are required to attend an orientation program prior to the start of classes. Orientation allows new students to meet one another, as well as faculty and staff members. Information regarding College policies and procedures is also given during orientation.73 Procedures for AdMIssIoNtransfer students Mercy College welcomes transfer students who meet all admission criteria for degree or transient/special status admission and who supply official transcripts from all post- secondary institutions attended. A minimum of 30 (for Associate, Certificate and Bachelors Completion students and 36 (for Bachelors Pre-licensure students) credit hours including one religion course taught from the Catholic perspective must be taken from Mercy College to meet residency requirements. Transfer of Credit T ransfer of credit is considered on an individual basis and may be granted for comparable science, general education and specific program courses completed at another regionally accredited post-secondary institution. Note: T ransfer of credit of specific program courses is different for each program. Please refer to Program Handbooks for complete details. For transfer credit to be granted, a course must correspond to one offered through Mercy College or be evaluated as comparable by the appropriate faculty advisors. Students seeking transfer credit are responsible for supplying a catalog containing the course description for those courses considered for transfer. To determine course equivalency, students may also be requested to supply course syllabi and/or other materials related to a specific course. Any course with a grade of 'C' or better and taken within the past seven years will be considered for transfer. Written requests to waive the time limits will be considered on an individual basis. T ransfer credits are not calculated in the students' grade point averages. Students choosing to retake a course that has been transferred from another institution will forfeit the transferred course. The course taken at Mercy College will supersede the transfer course. transfer module requirements Institutional Transfer The Ohio Board of Regents, following the directive of the Ohio General Assembly, developed a statewide policy to facilitate students' ability to transfer credits from one Ohio public college or university to another in order to avoid duplication of course requirements. Since independent colleges and universities in Ohio may or may not be participating in the transfer policy, students interested in transferring to independent institutions are encouraged to check with the College or university of their choice regarding transfer agreements. Transfer Module The Ohio Board of Regents' T ransfer and Articulation Policy established the T ransfer Module, which is a subset or entire set of a college or university's general education program. 74 Procedures for AdMIssIoNThe T ransfer Module consists of 54 to 60 quarter hours (or 36 to 40 semester hours) of courses in the following areas: English, Mathematics, Arts and Humanities, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Natural and Physical Sciences and Interdisciplinary Study. A T ransfer Module completed at one college or university will automatically meet the requirements of the T ransfer Module at another college or university once the student is admitted. Students may be required, however, to meet additional general education requirements at the institution to which they transfer. For example, a student who completes the T ransfer Module at Institution S (sending institution) and then transfers to Institution R (receiving institution) is said to have completed the T ransfer Module portion of Institution R's general education program. Institution R, however, may require additional general education courses beyond the T ransfer Module. Since many degree programs require specific courses that may be taken as a part of the general education or T ransfer Module program at an institution, students are encouraged to meet with an academic advisor at the institution to which they plan to transfer early in their academic career. For example, students who will be majoring in any of the majors in the College of Business and Administration at the receiving institution should take Economics 201, 202 and 203 (or equivalent course at another institution) rather than the Economics 200 course listed as a part of the T ransfer Module. Because of specific major requirements such as these, early identification of a student's intended major is encouraged. Advisors at the institution to which a student wishes to transfer should be consulted regarding the T ransfer Module and general education courses and any specific program requirements that can be completed before transfer. Conditions for Transfer Admission 1. The policy encourages receiving institutions to give preferential consideration for admission to students who complete the Associate of Arts or the Associate of Science degree with a cumulative grade point of 2.3 or better for all previous college level courses. 2. The policy encourages receiving institutions to give preferential treatment to students who have not earned an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree but have earned 60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours with a cumulative grade point of 2.0 or better for all previous college level courses. 3. The policy further encourages that students who have not earned an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree or who have not earned 60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours with a cumulative grade point of 2.0 or better for all previous college level courses are eligible for admission as transfer students on a competitive basis.75 Procedures for AdMIssIoNAcceptance of Transfer Credit by Mercy College Students who have completed the Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree with a cumulative grade point of 2.0 or better will receive transfer credit for all college level courses in which a grade of 'C' or better has been earned. Admission to a given institution, however, does not guarantee that a transfer student will be automatically admitted to all majors, minors, or fields of concentration at the institution. Once admitted, transfer students shall be subject to the same regulations governing applicability of catalog requirements as all other students. Furthermore, transfer students shall be accorded the same class standing and other privileges as all other students on the basis of the number of credits earned. All residency requirements must be successfully completed at the receiving institution prior to the granting of a degree. Responsibilities of Students In order to facilitate transfer with maximum applicability of transfer credit, prospective transfer students should plan a course of study that will meet the requirements of a degree program at the receiving institution. Specifically, students should identify early in their collegiate studies an institution and major to which they desire to transfer. Furthermore, students should determine if there are language requirements or any special course requirements that can be met during the freshman or sophomore year. This will enable students to plan and pursue a course of study that will articulate with the receiving institution's major. Students are encouraged to seek further information regarding transfer from both a Mercy College counselor and the college or university to which they plan to transfer. Transfer Credit Appeals Process A student disagreeing with the application of transfer credit by the receiving institution shall be informed of the right to appeal the decision and of the process for filing the appeal. Each institution shall make available to students the appeal process for that specific college or university. If a newly admitted or currently enrolled student wishes to challenge his/her transfer credit evaluation, the student must appeal in writing to the Student Records Office within two weeks of receipt of the transfer evaluation. The appeal will then be forwarded to the appropriate Academic Associate Dean. Upon receipt of the appeal of a transfer credit evaluation, research will be conducted under the auspices of the Associate Dean. The Associate Dean will notify the student in writing of the decision within 14 business days of receipt of the appeal. Please note that while the College will make every reasonable effort to adhere to the timelines listed in the appeals policy, circumstances such as access to information, availability of personnel and school breaks may justify an extension of time. 76 Procedures for AdMIssIoNadVanced Placement Students who have completed advanced placement courses while in high school may be eligible to receive college credit. The decision to grant credit, or to waive prerequisite coursework, is based on several factors including a review of records, scores on College Board Examinations or similar tests and official score reports from the College Board Advanced Placement Program. Final determination will be made by the Associate Dean of the appropriate College division in consultation with program faculty.77 77Toledo Campus78 toledo campusThe main campus of Mercy College of Ohio is located in Toledo, Ohio.

Provisional admission status is only granted for two consecutive semesters, or a total of fifteen hours. T wo of those fifteen hours must be GEN 101 Student Success Strategies. At the end of fifteen semester hours, a provisional admit student may petition the College Admissions Committee for regular admission status. Regular, degree-seeking admission status will be granted to those provisional admit students who have demonstrated successful academic performance. Options will be discussed for those provisional admit students who are not ready for regular college admission after the completion of twelve hours. The College Admissions Committee may attach additional stipulations on a provisionally admitted student, such as, requiring regular meetings with the Director of Counseling. Additional stipulations will be added if it is deemed necessary for that individual's success as a student at this institution. reGulations Child Care There are childcare facilities available to Mercy College students, for a fee, located at Mercy St. Charles Hospital.

E-mail accounts should be checked daily. All e-mail is the property of Mercy College. The user name will always be the same, but passwords may be changed at any time. However, if you forget your password, you will need to contact the Mercy College IT department. Mercy College uses network security to help protect against outside sources of viral and spam infection. Accordingly, it is recommended that you do NOT forward your Mercy College email account to another outside email. These emails are seen as \"spam relayed messages\" and deleted. Neither the sender nor the receiver will ever know it was deleted. Misuse of Electronic Mail E-mail is covered under the Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 1986. This act provides for prosecution of individuals found surreptitiously capturing, reading, or altering another's e-mail without permission. Mail deemed obscene or otherwise abusive by the recipient is considered an abuse of network privileges. Any attempt to forge an e-mail message is considered an abuse of network privileges. If a user receives mail that could have been forged, it is in the best interests of all parties involved to confirm the e-mail with the sender via personal contact. Contact the E-Mail Administrator at 419.251.1780, or e-mail to email@mercycollege.edu if it is determined the e-mail is a forgery. Please save a complete copy of the original message for further investigation. An individual's account on the network may be temporarily restricted for many reasons, including: Maintenance or servicing of network resources Dissemination of information before continued use of an account Investigation of policy violations or suspected abuse of an account. Temporary access restrictions are intended to be short lived and usually require the account's owner to contact the email administrator for reactivation. Investigations of network policy 80 toledo campusviolations may require any number of potentially affected accounts to be temporarily restricted. The owner of the account may not be the object of the investigation if, for example, it is suspected that the user's password has been cracked by a third party. Permanent Restrictions If it is determined that a user's policy violations are so serious that continued use of the Network would infringe upon the rights or security of other users, the user's account will be permanently restricted. The Vice President of Administrative Services must approve all permanent access restrictions. All accounts assigned to a user may be restricted and future network privileges denied.

History The Mercy College of Ohio nursing program has a rich heritage of compassionate care and excellence in nursing education. More than 3,000 nurses were educated through Mercy School of Nursing, founded in 1918 by the Sisters of Mercy. That program, which led to the Diploma in Nursing, evolved into the current Associate of Science in Nursing Degree program. Philosophy IndividualBased on fundamental Christian principles, sacredness of life and human dignity, the individual is viewed as a creature of God, composed of body and soul, endowed with intellect and free will from which stems a person's dignity and integrity as a unique individual. Each individual has the right to be treated with respect and dignity. The individual is a complex being who has unique values, beliefs and life experiences that influence self-care behavior. Individuals have vast resources for self-directed behavior enabling them to make decisions, set goals and take action to promote, maintain and restore health. Society Society is a complex social system comprised of unique individuals, groups, families and communities existing within a changing environment. The environment includes spiritual, physical, psychological, cultural, social, technological, economic, geographic, ecological political forces. Changes in society influence the values and expectations placed upon healthcare professionals and institutions. The needs and influences of society impact the delivery of nursing care and the continued development of nursing roles that promote the well being of others. The nursing program fulfills its community responsibility by developing an awareness of health needs and resources within the community. The program prepares graduates to establish a milieu of trust and to promote the fundamental rights and responsibilities of members of society within the evolving healthcare delivery systems. Faculty and students practice in multiple settings with individuals across the lifespan. Health Health is a dynamic state of bio-psycho-social-spiritual functioning of a person, family, group, or community and is viewed on a continuum throughout the lifespan. All individuals have the right as well as a responsibility to maintain health based on their inherent capabilities, depth of knowledge, growth and development, environment, culture, perception of needs and the accessibility to resources. The deliberative actions that individuals, families, groups and communities take to maintain an optimal state of health are designated as self-care. When self-care actions are not sufficient to maintain health, a self-care deficit results, necessitating nursing interventions.140 nursinG - associate of science 140Nursing Nursing is a human service directed toward the achievement of self-care. As a human service, nursing involves acting with compassion and care to assist, guide, support, provide a developmental environment and teach individuals, families and communities. The nurse and patient form a healthcare relationship. The patient presents deficits in self-care and the nurse identifies self-care demands based on a holistic assessment of the patient. The nurse, working within established legal, ethical and professional standards, provides services designed to increase the self-care agency of individuals, families and communities. The nurse uses nursing process as the methodology to provide these services. Learning Education is a lifelong process through which learners develop knowledge, skills and attitudes resulting in cognitive, affective and psychomotor changes. Learning is a reciprocal process in which the learner and faculty are active and willing participants. Faculty members facilitate and promote learning in an environment which fosters mutual trust, accountability, responsibility, self-expression, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking and creativity. Faculty members recognize that learners enrich this environment by bringing to it a diversity of backgrounds, age, education and life experiences. The success of the learner is dependent upon self-motivation, active participation and goal directed behavior in the planned curriculum experiences. Associate Degree Nursing Education Program Associate degree nursing education which occurs in institutions of higher learning prepares the graduate with the values, knowledge and skills needed to practice nursing with integrity and professional competence. Associate degree nursing education, in conjunction with integration of knowledge from other disciplines, provides a broad theoretical base in nursing, related sciences and general studies; knowledge of the role of the associate degree nurse; the ability to practice in multiple settings; and a foundation for advanced nursing study. An essential component of nursing education is the concurrent integration of theory into the clinical practice setting. The graduate is prepared to function as a manager of care in acute and long-term settings where policies and procedures are specified and guidance is available. As a member of the health team, this graduate is also able to collaborate with other nursing and health team members and to provide guidance to less skilled workers in the delivery of nursing care.141 nursinG - associate of science 141Professional Development The faculty is committed to quality associate degree education through a curriculum that allows for flexibility, career mobility and professional development. Responding to the diverse backgrounds and needs of the learner population, the curriculum provides a strong academic base for nursing practice as well as future career mobility. Educational mobility encourages lifelong personal and professional development. The faculty is responsible for planning, implementing and evaluating the nursing education program. Faculty must be academically prepared, proficient in practice, knowledgeable about student needs and aware of changes in nursing practice, healthcare and nursing education. Faculty serve as role models, resource persons and teachers in classroom and practicum settings. Program Learning Outcomes The terminal learning outcomes of the program identify behaviors that are to be demonstrated by the graduate. Derived from the mission, philosophy and organizing framework, they are: 1. Apply the nursing process in assisting the patient to meet self-care requisites. 2. Integrate health-illness concepts in the provision of care. 3. Synthesize the concepts of the teaching/learning process in the delivery of care. 4. Demonstrate accountability and professional behavior in entry level associate degree nursing practice. 5. Using the concepts of the Self-Care Deficit Theory of Nursing, formulate plans of care for patients across the life span. 6. Integrate knowledge of the humanities, sciences and nursing research to provide rationale for nursing practice. 7. Demonstrate the consistent performance of safe, effective nursing skills in entry level associate degree practice. 8. Demonstrate interpersonal skills throughout nursing practice. 9. Practice Christian values within the ethical, legal and professional standards of nursing practice. Curriculum Plan The associate degree in nursing (ASN) is a minimum level of education for technical nursing practice. Upon completion of the degree, students are eligible to sit for the State Board examination to practice as a registered nurse. Associate level nursing education prepares nurses to provide services to individuals with common or recurring health problems. The associate degree nurse promotes health and provides, maintains and restores wellness of individuals and their families within structured healthcare settings. All curriculum requirements for the nursing degree are arranged so that students follow a sequence of prerequisite courses building on previous studies and preparing them for future courses. The curriculum consists of five semesters over two calendar years. 142 nursinG - associate of science SEmEStER i cREdit HOURS BIO 220 Anatomy & Physiology I 4 ENG 101 English Composition I 3 NUR 110 Introduction to the Profession of Nursing 5 PSY 101 Introduction to Psychology 3 15 SEmEStER ii cREdit HOURS BIO 221 Anatomy & Physiology II 4 BIO 201 The Physiological Basis of Nutrition 2 NUR 112 Universal Self-Care Requisites I 5 ENG 102 English Composition II 3 14SEmEStER iii cREdit HOURS NUR 123 Integration of Self-Care Requisites I 3 NUR 122 Universal Self-Care Requisites II 4 PSY 201 Lifespan Psychology 3 BIO 320 Pathophysiology 3 13SEmEStER iv cREdit HOURS NUR 233 Developmental Self-Care Requisites I 4 NUR 232 Integration of Self-Care Requisites II 5 SOC 211 Cultural Diversity 3 BIO 210 Microbiology 4 16SEmEStER v cREdit HOURS NUR 241 Integration of Self-Care Requisites III 8 NUR 242 T ransition to Practice 3 REL 301 Medical Ethics 3 (Medical Ethics taught from the Catholic perspective is required) 14 TOTAL CREDIT HOURS: 72The College requires that first time college students take GEN 101: Student Success Strategies.143 nursinG - associate of science Evening Option An evening/weekend program is available and is designed to be complete in 10 (ten) semesters of part time study.

See \"Program Admissions Guidelines\" available online or from the Student Records office, 5 th floor. History From the inception of Mercy College in 1993, its strategic plan had included the eventual implementation of a baccalaureate program in nursing. In 1999, the Ohio Board of Nursing (OBN) and the Ohio Board of Regents (OBR) granted program approval. In June 2000, The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools approved the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program. Both pre-licensure and Registered Nurse (RN) completion students were admitted for the first BSN classes in Fall 2000. Philosophy The faculty of the School of Nursing believes that the education of professional nurses must include the concepts around which nursing knowledge is structured: the individual, society, health, nursing and learning. The philosophy of the Division of Nursing is congruent with the philosophy of Mercy College of Ohio. The faculty holds the following beliefs:Individual Based on fundamental Christian principles, sacredness of life and human dignity, the individual is viewed as a creature of God, composed of body and soul, endowed with intellect and free will from which stems a person's dignity and integrity as a unique individual. Each 148 nursinG - bacHelor of science 148individual has the right to be treated with respect and dignity. The individual is a complex being who has unique values, beliefs and life experiences that influence self-care behavior. Individuals have vast resources for self-directed behavior enabling them to make decisions, set goals and take action to promote, maintain and restore health. Society Society is a complex social system comprised of unique individuals, groups, families and communities existing within a changing environment. The environment includes spiritual, physical, psychological, cultural, social, technological, economic, geographic, ecological and political forces. Changes in society influence the values and expectations placed upon healthcare professionals and institutions. The needs and influences of society impact the delivery of nursing care and the continued development of nursing roles that promote the well being of others. The nursing program fulfills its responsibility to society by caring for the health needs of the diverse community. Faculty and students practice in multiple settings with patients across the lifespan. Health Health is a dynamic state of bio-psycho-social-spiritual functioning of a person, family, group or community and is viewed on a continuum throughout the lifespan. All individuals have the right, as well as a responsibility, to maintain health, based on their inherent capabilities, depth of knowledge, growth and development, environment, culture, perception of needs and accessibility to resources. The deliberative actions that individuals, families, groups and communities take to maintain an optimal state of health are designated as self-care. When self-care actions are not sufficient to maintain health, a self-care deficit results, necessitating nursing interventions. Nursing Nursing, a dynamic discipline, is both a science and an art. Professional nursing practice is based on a firm foundation of the physical, behavioral and nursing sciences; humanities; and liberal arts. The discipline is expressed in nursing practice, the development of theory and integration of scholarship. Nursing includes therapeutic use of self, critical thinking, problem solving, psychomotor skills, management of information, effective communication and collaboration skills. As a caring service, nursing involves acting with compassion to design, provide, manage and coordinate care for individuals, families, groups and communities within established legal, ethical and professional standards. Holistic nursing practice is further defined through application of research and the essential concepts of caring and self-care derived from a variety of nursing theorists. Assessment, focusing on functional health patterns, provides the data for clinical inference and judgment as a component of nursing process. Further, the appropriate integration and application of knowledge from a wide array of other fields and 149 nursinG - bacHelor of science 149disciplines enhance the practice of nursing. As a member of a profession, the nurse assumes responsibility and accountability for care management, positive patient care outcomes and quality care. The nurse forms partnerships with others in order to assure effective responses to health issues. The nurse functions as an advocate for individuals, families, groups and communities through interdisciplinary collaboration, delegation, education and communication in the organization and management of care. Nurses are members of healthcare teams that deliver care to an increasingly diverse population. Sensitivity to and knowledge of age, gender, religion, culture, race, socioeconomic status, educational level, cognitive ability and lifestyle preference are essential in the provision of competent holistic nursing care. Learning Education is a lifelong process through which learners develop knowledge, skills and attitudes resulting in cognitive, affective and psychomotor changes. Learning is a reciprocal process in which the learner and faculty are active and willing participants. Faculty members facilitate and promote learning in an environment, which fosters mutual trust, accountability, responsibility, self-expression, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking and creativity. Faculty members recognize that learners enrich this environment by bringing to it a diversity of backgrounds, age, education and life experiences. The success of the learner is dependent upon self-motivation, active participation and goal directed behavior in the planned curriculum experiences. Bachelor of Science Degree Nursing Education Program Bachelor nursing education is provided within institutions of higher learning and prepares graduates with the knowledge, skills and values needed to practice nursing with competence, compassion and integrity. Baccalaureate nursing is dependent on understanding and integration of general education, liberal arts, biological sciences, social sciences and nursing theory. Bachelor of Science degree nurses are prepared to function as providers, designers, managers and coordinators of care in acute, long-term and community settings. They are responsible for delegation to and supervision of supportive healthcare workers and for collaboration with other members of the healthcare team. Professional Development Changes in healthcare and the role of professional nurses mandate that baccalaureate nurses are prepared for career mobility. Their nursing education must provide the basis for ongoing study, both formal and informal. Furthermore, the nursing program must instill the value for lifelong personal and professional development.150 nursinG - bacHelor of science Program Learning Outcomes The terminal learning outcomes of the program identify behaviors that are to be demonstrated by the graduate. Derived from the mission, philosophy and organizing framework, they are: 1. Incorporate core values of compassion, excellence, human dignity, justice, sacredness of life and service in the practice of nursing. 2. Integrate knowledge from physical, behavioral and nursing sciences; humanities; and liberal arts as a basis for professional nursing practice. 3. Use Self-Care-Deficit Theory of Nursing and nursing research to provide therapeutic nursing interventions that assist individuals, families, groups and communities to attain optimal health. 4. Practice critical thinking through intellectual curiosity, rational inquiry, problem-solving skills and creativity in the management and coordination of care. 5. Integrate professional behavior in the multidimensional role of the nurse in a variety of settings. 6. Provide holistic nursing care to diverse individuals, families, groups and communities. 7. Coordinate community resources to promote, maintain and restore health in the individual, family, group and community. 8.

Curriculum Plan The Medical Coding certificate program will prepare students to work as part of the healthcare team as integral members of the health information industry. Medical coders are responsible for selecting the appropriate diagnostic and procedural codes of various medical services for data analysis and reimbursement. The program will include didactic and hands-on laboratory components specifically designed to prepare students for entry into professional practice as medical coders and prepare them to sit for the Certified Coding Associate (CCA) exam through the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The CCA is the only HIM credential worldwide currently accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). Mercy College no longer offers a non-credit certificate program in medical coding and is developing the proposed credit certificate in order to meet the more rigorous demands of the medical coding industry. Mercy College's Medical Coding certificate program will be 25.5 credit hours spanning three semesters. Program content includes several courses that currently exist as part of the Associate degree program in Health Information Technology (HIT) at Mercy College, with the addition of a newly developed course in Medical Reimbursement. The Medical Reimbursement course will serve as a synthesis of inpatient and outpatient coding classification systems that will be used in a variety of healthcare settings. The credit certificate program in Medical coding will allow the student to smoothly transition into the Associate degree program in HIT if they choose or employment trends dictate the need to do so.
