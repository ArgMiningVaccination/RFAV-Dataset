As of September 2020, Nature Box is officially a natural cosmetics brand. A high proportion of ingredients of natural origin and sustainable bottle bodies make Nature Box more authentic than ever before: The bottle bodies are made of 98% Social Plastic\u00ae*, that is, plastic collected from the beach and the land.

Nature Box products are made with at least 98% natural-origin ingredients*, vegan formulas** free from synthetic colorants, silicones and with sustainable bottle bodies with 98% recycled plastic***. On the back of each product is a transparent list of all ingredients. On top of that, Nature Box supports Plastic Bank, which aims to prevent plastic waste while helping improve living conditions in areas of poverty through its Social Plastic\u00ae project. Nature Box is hereby the first consumer goods brand in the world to introduce Social Plastic\u00ae as a packaging material in its baseline portfolio. * including water ** free from ingredients of animal origin *** excluding caps, packaging of shampoo bars and shower bottles & tubes Every year, about eight million tons of plastic waste are released into the oceans. Eighty percent of this comes from developing countries with no recycling infrastructure. Plastic Bank has set itself the goal of combatting plastic waste and \"ocean plastic\" (plastic in the world's oceans) while also improving the living conditions of local populations with low income, particularly in countries without public recycling systems. To this end, Plastic Bank has set up various collection centers where people can exchange plastic waste for rewards such as schooling for children, medical or technical services, and also for money. This plastic is sorted and processed into Social Plastic\u00ae, which can be used for packaging. Minimizing waste from packaging is of great importance to Nature Box. The new body lotions and hand creams from Nature Box are now available in tubes that are 100% recyclable. Nature Box therefore contributes to sustainability and protection of the environment. The new argan oil line from Nature Box provides intensive care for hair and skin: Its' nutritive properties with cold-pressed oil made from kernels of the argan tree are particularly well-suited for stressed and dry skin and hair. This line is made up of a shampoo, conditioner, shampoo bar and shower gel - every product gives hair and skin a portion of extra care. The new Nature Box shower gel with cold-pressed olive oil pampers the whole body while providing a fresh olive scent. With specially selected ingredients and vegan formulas*, Nature Box redefines beauty care. The brand stands for high production and quality standards and long-term responsibility.
