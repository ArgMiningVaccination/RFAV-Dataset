KROPF, Chief Clerk PREFACE Tremendous advances in health care technology and unprece- dented growth in the number of Americans living to old age con- tinue to create profound new challenges for our society. Improve- ments in medical care technology are a tribute to this Nation's commitment to research and innovation. These same technologies, however, can threaten to erode cherished American values of au- tonomy and freedom of choice. Older Americans are especially at risk as serious illness and incapacity often decrease their ability to make and communicate choices about health care. The challenge we face as a Nation, therefore, is to protect the rights of individ- uals while pursuing the best medical care possible. To meet this challenge, State legislative bodies, in conjunction with legal and medical professionals and advocates for the elderly and disabled, have devised mechanisms for Americans to express their wishes and make choices in advance about future health care needs. Among these advance directives are so-called \"living wills\" and durable powers of attorney. While these may not be the only possible vehicles for exercising choice, their widespread availability and use make them a subject of great interest to those who work with the aged. While this paper addresses an important issue in our society, we recognize that there are other significant and highly sensitive issues involving health care and technology. We view this paper as the first of a two-part series concerning health care technology. We anticipate that the Special Committee on Aging will issue a follow- up paper that examines the complex and often highly charged issues of allocation of health care resources and the potential for discrimination against and abuse of the elderly and the disabled in health care decisionmaking and treatment. It is our view that dis- cussion of advance directives for health care decisionmaking would be complemented by a second paper that critically analyzes these issues from differing, and often competing, perspectives. For now, we are pleased, to make this report available to those who counsel, advise, and represent older persons. Lawyers, physi- cians, and other health care professionals, clergy, social workers, and others are in key positions to ensure that the difficult decisions made on behalf of others preserve personal values, preferences, and dignity. More directly, we hope that this report will help individ- uals understand the options available to them as they plan ahead to protect their fundamental right of personal autonomy in health care decisionmaking. This paper reflects the views of the author and does not necessar- ily reflect the views of any individual committee member. JOHN HEINZ, Chairman. JOHN GLENN, Ranking Member. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This report was prepared at the request of Senators John Heinz and John Glenn, Chairman and Ranking member of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging. The Senators wish to express their sincere appreciation to the author, Barbara Mishkin. Her knowledge of and respect for the rights and autonomy of individuals is clearly reflected in this im- portant monograph. Her national reputation regarding health care decisionmaking brings added prominence to the on-going discussion about the complex issues concerning treatment options for the in- capacitated and the dying. In addition, the Senators extend their gratitude to the law firm of Hogan & Hartson, whose willingness to commit resources to the author made this report possible. Special thanks are also due to several individuals who contribut- ed to the writing and production of this document, including Wil- liam Benson and Susan Beecher, staff of the Special Committee on Aging, and William Amatruda and Jeff Stryker, who provided val- uable research assistance.

In order to make a decision about health care, a patient must be able to understand the available treatment options and appreciate theimplications of choosing one option rather than another. The pa-tient also must be able to make a choice and to communicate that choice. If any of these elements are lacking, the decision will be made by someone else. When patients are unable to make decisions because of physical or mental incapacity at the time a treatment choice is presented,communication in advance is the most reliable way of assuringthat the individual's preferences and values are considered by those who must make the decisions. Family members, caregivers, judges and legal representatives are the ones who traditionally are called upon to make health care de- cisions on behalf of incapacitated adults. If there has been no prior communication with the patient, these decisionmakers will find it difficult to know what choices the patient would make under a given set of circumstances. Worse, they may disagree among them- selves as to what the patient would prefer. This report describes some of the problems that can arise in the absence of good communication among patients, family members, and caregivers. It also describes two kinds of written directives that can minimize the difficulties by stating in advance how choices about health care should be made if certain circumstances should develop in the future, and explains legal devices for making ana- tomical gifts. The first kind of directive provides specific instruc- tions about the kinds of health care that should be provided or foregone in particular situations. The second kind appoints an agent to make health care decisions in the event of the appointing individual's subsequent incapacity. The appointment directive can be combined with specific instructions thus giving the agent not only legal authority to act in certain situations but also instruc- tions as to how to act. Advance directives for health care extend an individual's self-de- termination to circumstances in which self-expression is no longer possible. By doing so, they alleviate some of the burden on family members and caregivers who must make difficult choices on behalf of a patient who is unable to make or communicate decisions about medical treatment. Equally important, however, are the opportunities and incentives that advance directives provide for discussion among family mem- bers and caregivers in advance of a medical crisis. Discussion is im- portant because pivotal terms typically used in advance directives (such as terminal illness, imminent death, supportive care, and competence or capacity to make decisions) often are not well de- fined in the law. Sometimes they are left undefined, and sometimes the legal meaning differs from either the medical or the common understanding of the term. The purpose of this report is to facilitate the use of advance di- rectives and to encourage communication between those who write them and those who must carry them out. The report is written for policymakers, health care professionals, attorneys, social workers, members of the clergy, and others who counsel patients and their families or who advocate on behalf of the elderly. It may also be useful for people who are currently in good health but who wish to make arrangements for their future care as part of the important process of preparing for possible physical or mental disability. Chapter I explains why it is important to know how to plan ahead for decisions about health care and the problems that can arise in the absence of advance planning. Chapter II describes tra- ditional approaches to health care decisionmaking, such as the in- formed consent of the patient, family consent, and court proceed- ings for guardianship or conservatorship. Chapter III describes more recent approaches, known as advance directives, and explains the advantages and disadvantages of \"living wills\" and durable powers of attorney. It also discusses ana- tomical gifts and provides basic information about Federal and State laws. Chapters IV (Bibliography) and V (Resources) are designed to assist the reader in obtaining additional information through fur- ther reading or by contacting one of the organizations listed. Chap- ter VI is a checklist for advisors. I. THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING CHOICES ABOUT PERSONAL HEALTH CARE Mary Severns, age 55, broke her neck and suffered extensive brain damage in an automobile accident. She was comatose when taken to the hospital immediately following the accident and remained in a coma thereafter, although she regained sufficient function to breathe without a respirator. She was fed through a naso-gastric tube and it was virtually certain that she would never emerge from her coma, described by doctors as a \"persistent vegetative state.\" A year following the accident, her husband asked that she not be put back on the respirator and that no drugs or medicines be ad- ministered except those necessary to maintain personal comfort and hygiene. When the attending physician refused to enter such an order, Mr. Severns petitioned the court to appoint him guardian and to authorize him to request that life-supporting treatments be with- held or withdrawn. He also asked the court to protect the physicians and the hospital from criminal or civil liability if they would comply with his request. The Court of Chancery, uncertain as to its powers, referred the matter to the Delaware Supreme Court, which held that Mary Sev- erns had a constitutional right to refuse treatment and that her husband, as guardian, could exercise that right on her behalf 'TT]o deny the exercise [of the right] because the patient is unconscious would be to deny the right.\" I The case went back to the Court of Chancery which ultimately granted all of Mr. Severns'requests.2 Mary Severns had been a member of an association advocating death with dignity and, five years before her accident, had suggest- ed to her husband that they each sign a living will. She wanted to document her wish that \"in the event she were to become unable to reason and care for herself as a result of an accident or illness ...she did not want to be kept alive in a vegetative state but would like to be allowed to die with dignity. \"3 She never exe- cuted a living will, however, apparently because of her husband's re- luctance to do so.4 A. MAKING CHOICES ABOUT PERSONAL HEALTH CARE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT In the United States, we cherish-and vigorously protect-our fundamental rights. One of the most basic is the right to privacy, which has been interpreted by many courts as including the right ' Severns v. Wilmington Medical Center, 421 A.2d 1334, (1347, Del. 1980). 2 In re Severns, 425 A.2d 156 (Del. Ch. 1980). 3 Id. at 158. 4 Id. to make one's own health care decisions and, by extension, to have those decisions implemented by others, if necessary.5 Over seventy years ago, Judge Cardozo (then recently appointed to New York's highest court) stated the basic principle underlying consent to health care: Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own bodyand cannot be subjected to medical treatment without his consent.6 Several years later, Supreme Court Justice Brandeis elaboratedthe concept of personal privacy, setting forth the principle that has since formed the basis of many court decisions about the right to refuse treatment: The makers of our Constitution ...sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the Gov- ernment, the right to be let alone-the most comprehen- sive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.7 The right to privacy-the right to be let alone-is particularly important in health care. With few exceptions, every adult who is capable of doing so has the right to decide which treatment to accept, and which to refuse. Occasionally, society may limit the right to make decisions about health care, usually to protect the public health (for example, by requiring a person to be vaccinated or quarantined). In rare in- stances, courts have required adults to accept unwanted treatment to protect the health and welfare of an unborn child or of depend- ent children, but that has happened in the vast majority of cases only when the treatment in question would restore the patient to a normal, healthy life. Such cases are very different from situations in which individuals may wish to refuse treatment that will mainly prolong a life of multiple incapacities and discomfort, and that will serve only to forestall-however briefly-impending death. B. MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER PERSONAL HEALTH CARE IS IMPORTANT FOR DIGNITY AND WELL-BEING A frequent complaint both of hospital patients and of the elderly is that they are treated with little respect-or worse, as if they have ceased to exist. When physical and mental infirmities force dependence upon others, it is difficult to maintain independence of thought and personal dignity. Scientific studies of emotional responses to stress strongly sug- gest that loss of the ability (or perceived ability) to control events can lead to both physical and emotional illness.8 Thus, it is impor- Se, e.g., Tune v. Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 602 F. Supp 1452 (D.D.C. 1985); BartlingSuperior Court, 147 Cal. App. 3d 1006, 195 Cal. Rptr. 220 (1984); John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital v. Bludworth, 452 So. 2d 921 (Fla. 1984); and cases cited therein. 6 Schloendorff v. New York Hospital, 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. 92, 93 (1914).'Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (dissenting opinion). Although all of the courts that have ruled on health care decisions have recognized a right to privacy, some have based their rulings on state constitutions or on a common law right to privacy rather than on a right emanating from the United States Constitution. 8 J. Rodin, \"Aging and Health: Effects on the Sense of Control,\" Science, Vol 233, No. 4770, 1271-1276 (Sept. 19, 1986). tant to both physical and emotional health that individuals main- tain control over their lives, particularly their medical care, to the extent they are able to do so and especially if they are already ex- periencing the stress of illness or physical incapacity. Decisions that must be made about the health care of incapaci- tated individuals may include not only whether to withhold or withdraw life-support systems, but also whether to place the pa- tient in a nursing home or a hospice, whether to perform invasive diagnostic tests (to determine, for example, if the patient has cancer), whether to perform dental surgery, and whether to insert a feeding tube. Usually, when a patient is incapacitated, such deci- sions are made by next of kin, in consultation with the patient's physicians. However, if there are disagreements among the family members or physicians, or if the family's decision differs from a medical consensus regarding proper treatment, the health care fa- cility may insist that the decision be made only by an individual- or a court-having clear legal authority to give (or withhold) con- sent on behalf of the patient. C. FEW PEOPLE HAVE PLANNED AHEAD FOR HEALTH CARE DECISIONS Despite the importance of maintaining control over one's health care, few people have made arrangements for someone to carry out their wishes in case they become unable to give directions concern- ing their own care. In 1982, a survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates revealed that only about one-third of the general population had given instructions to someone concerning how they would like to be treated in the event they are unable to make their own decisions about health care; and of those, only about one- fourth had put their instructions in writing.9 In the same survey, physicians were asked how they would treat a patient in the end stage of a painful and terminal illness, if the patient were unable to communicate his or her wishes. If the pa- tient had left written instructions not to prolong life through ex- traordinary means, most of the physicians said they would not re- suscitate in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. Later studies strongly suggest that physicians often do not have a good understanding of their patients' wishes concerning resusci- tation and, although the physicians say that such matters should be discussed with their patients, they actually do so infrequently.10 D. PROVIDERS OF HEALTH CARE, ATTORNEYS, AND OTHERS ARE SOMETIMES UNSURE AS TO WHAT Is REQUIRED Occasionally, people who have prepared written instructions about their health care report that physicians and hospital person- nel were unsure as to what to do with them. In the absence of clear policies and procedures for asking about such documents and making them a part of a patient's medical record, health care per- ' President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Making Health Care Decisions, Vol. 2, Appendix B (1982). 1o S. Bedell and T. Delbanco, \"Choices About Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in the Hospital: When Do Physicians Talk With Patients?\", New Eng. J. Med., Vol. 310, No. 17 (April 26, 1984) at 1089. sonnel may not know about-or implement-the few that have been prepared. More attorneys need to be educated. Some of those who preparewills and similar documents for the control and disposition of prop-erty after death do not fully appreciate the importance of encour-aging their clients also to prepare for the care and disposition oftheir person during illness. Yet, similar principles apply.Preparation of advance directives helps to assure that the indi-vidual's wishes about health care will be carried out. Written in-structions also will relieve family members of much of the burdenof making difficult decisions at a time when they may be underconsiderable stress, and can dispel confusion and conflict among close relatives who may have differing views as to what the patientwould want. Attorneys should explain the nature and scope of theright to make choices about health care to all clients who requestadvice concerning estate planning and assist those who would liketo prepare advance directives for health care at the same time thatthey prepare wills and trust agreements. Nurses, social workers, physicians, clergy, and others who coun-sel individuals and their families could provide much more assist-ance if they were better informed about procedures for making ad-vance directives concerning health care. II. LEGAL PROTECTION OF PATIENTS' RIGHTS: TRADITIONAL APPROACHES Bertha Harris was 73-years-old, and suffering from diabetes and circulatory problems, when she was transferred from a nursing home to a hospital for surgery. She understood that the gangrene in her foot would probably spread, and she consented to amputation of her left leg, above the knee. Both her sister and niece (who was a court-appointed conservator of Ms. Harris' estate) also consented to the operation. Two weeks later, the physicians found a small, black patch on the bottom of her right foot and recommended that the right leg also be amputated above the knee. Bertha Harris refused. When the physi- cians could not persuade Ms. Harris-or her sister or niece-to con- sent to the second amputation, the hospital petitioned the court to declare her incompetent and to authorize performance of the ampu- tation against her will. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals preserved Bertha Harris' right leg-and her individual rights-by sending the case back to the trial court with directions that a judicial determination of incompetency would require clear and convincing evidence that Bertha Harris lacked the specific capacity to make the health care decision.\"I The appellate court also ruled that Bertha Harris had the right to be examined by a psychiatrist and a physician of her own choosing. Following further evidentiary hearings, the trial court found that Bertha Harris \"understands the nature and consequences of the treatment choice being presented with respect to amputation of her leg, and chooses not to have the amputation at this time.\" 12 The Court therefore ruled that: Although there is convincing evidence, which the Court accepts, that the patient suffers confusion and lapse of memory, the [hospital] has not established a particularized connection between those conditions and the ability of the patient to make a treatment decision respecting her leg. See Lane v. Candura, 376 N.E. 2d 1232, 1235 (Mass. App. 1978). Absent the requisite showing of a particularized lack of competence to make a decision respecting amputation of her leg, the patient has a right to decline treatment, and there is no basis at this time on which the Court may or should interfere with her exercise of that right. 13 ' In re Harris, 477 A.2d 724 (D.C. 1984). 12 In the Matter of Bertha Harris, Misc. No. 126-84 (D.C Super. Ct., June 4, 1984) (slip op. at 2). 11 Id. at 2-3. Families and physicians confronting the need to make decisions about the health care of an incapacitated adult traditionally have taken one of three approaches: (a) the physician has made the deci- sion (usually-but not always-after discussing it with family members); (b) family members have made the decision, in consulta- tion with the physician; and (c) family members or the health care facility have petititoned for court appointment of a guardian or conservator-or for a judicial answer to the question posed. The case of Bertha Harris illustrates traditional methods of re- solving decisions about the health care of individuals whose com~p- tence to decide is in question. The hospital obtained the consent of available family members, in addition to consent of the patient, for the first amputation.14 When all three refused permission to ampu- tate the second leg, the hospital petitioned the court to determine,as a matter of law, whether the patient was competent to make a decision regarding the proposed surgery. The hospital also asked the court to authorize the surgery if it concluded that Ms. Harris lacked the competence to make her own decision regarding the second amputation. Several important principles, illustrated by this case, are discussed below. A. CONSENT BY THE PATIENT (OR A LEGALLY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE) Is REQUIRED 1. COMPETENT PATIENTS A physician or other health care provider may not administer treatments, diagnostic tests, or surgical interventions without the consent of the patient. If medical interventions are administered without consent, the doctor (and health care facility) may be sued for battery or for negligence.15 Of course, if an emergency exists and an advance directive to the contrary is not immediately avail- able, physicians may administer care necessary to preserve life and limb without consent of the patient or a legal representative. (Under the theory of implied consent, the law permits them to assume that the patient would consent to emergency treatment, if the patient were able to make the decision.) In the absence of an emergency, physicians may not presume to make decisions for their patients. Competent, adult patients have the right to make their own decisions, even if those decisions are not the ones their physicians would make for themselves, and even if their decisions seem unwise or foolish to others. Former Chief Justice Warren Burger once wrote that when our founding fathers sought to protect the right to make one's own decisions, they in- tended to protect even \"a great many foolish, unreasonable and even absurd ideas which do not conform, such as refusing medical treatment even at great risk.\" 16 14 In the Matter of Bertha Harris, Misc. No. 126-84 (Super. Ct. D.C.), transcript of hearing on June 1, 1984, at 35-36. \" See generally President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Making Health Care Decisions, Chapter 1 (1982). See also Leach v. Shapiro, 469 N.E.2d 1047 (Ohio, 1984). 16 Application of President and Directors of Georgetown College, 331 F.2d 1000, 1017 (1963) (Burger, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). The last point is important, because it makes clear that a patient not be deemed incompetent on the basis of what appears to be a foolish or irrational decision. Bertha Harris' physicians did not question her competence when she consented to the first amputa-tion. It was only when she refused to consent to the second thather competence was called into question.17 Thus, the only behav-ioral change leading to the change in status was her refusal toaccept an operation that her physicians strongly recommended. Asthe court made clear, however, Bertha Harris had the right to make a decision contrary to the one her doctors thought she shouldmake, so long as she understood the nature and the consequences of that decision, as explained more fully below. In protecting the right of patients to make their own choices, thelaw enforces widely accepted ethical principles concerning individ-ual autonomy, also referred to as self-determination. That principlestates that individuals have the right to self-determination so long as their exercise of that right does not infringe the rights of others.It is a principle that underlies many of the individual freedoms protected by our Constitution. Physicians, of course, also haverights; and when a patient's exercise of self-determination results in a decision that conflicts with a physician's personal beliefs orvalues, the physician is not obligated to comply. Instead, it is gen-erally expected that the physician will transfer the patient's care to another physician whose beliefs or values are more compatible with the patient's. 2. DETERMINING A PATIENT'S COMPETENCE OR CAPACITY TO CONSENT An adult is presumed to be competent unless a court has made a determination to the contrary. Even after an adjudication of incom-petency, however, an individual may have the capacity to make de- cisions about health care. The terms \"competency\" and \"capacity to consent\" are often used interchangeably. However, \"competency\" is technically alegal term, generally referring to a court determination. By con-trast, \"capacity to consent\" or \"decision-making capacity\" describesan individual's ability to make a health care decision. Only a fewstate statutes governing consent to health care have defined capac-ity to consent. For example, individuals who may consent to healthcare in Idaho are defined as: Any person of ordinary intelligence and awareness suffi- cient for him or her generally to comprehend the need for,the nature of and the significant risks ordinarily inherentin any contemplated hospital, medical, dental or surgical care, treatment or procedure ... .I' Similarly, in Mississippi, persons who are of \"unsound mind\" andtherefore unable to consent to health care are defined as those who are: unable to understand and appreciate the consequences of the proposed surgical or medical treatment or procedures 17 A similar sequence of events occurred in a Massachusetts case, Lane v. Candura, 376N.E.2d 1232 (Mass. App. 1978). 18 Idaho Code, Chap. 43, \u00a7 39-4302 (Michie 1985). so as to intelligently determine whether or not to consent to the same, regardless of whether such state of mind is only temporary or has existed for an extended period of time or occurs or has occurred only intermittently and whether or not it is due to natural state, age, shock or anxiety, illness, injury, drugs or sedation, intoxication or other cause of whatever nature.19 By contrast, in Maine, a valid consent to health care is defined merely as \"one which is given by a person who, under all the sur- rounding circumstances, is mentally and physically competent to give consent.\" 20 Maine's statutory definition, although circuitous, is nevertheless an attempt to provide guidance. A majority of states leave the term undefined. A determination concerning an individual's decisionmaking ca- pacity must be made with reference to a specific treatment choice and at a particular time. The determination is usually made by the patient's attending physician, sometimes in consultation with a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or neurologist. The President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research (hereafter re- ferred to as the President's Commission) analyzed the legal and ethical issues surrounding decisional incapacity in its 1982 report on Making Health Care Decisions.21 The Commission endorsed the traditional method by which a patient's decisionmaking capacity is determined by the attending physician, in consultation with rela- tives, close friends, and other caregivers.22 Recourse to the courts, according to the Commission, should be necessary only when uncer- tainty or conflict about the patient's decisionmaking capacity cannot be resolved at the institutional level.23 The capacity for health care decisionmaking is generally understood to depend upon the ability to: 1. Understand the nature of the treatment choice presented; 2. Appreciate the implications of the various alternatives; and 3. Make and communicate a reasoned choice. In determining whether a patient understands the implications of the choices presented, it is useful to assess the extent to which the choice made by the patient is consistent with what is known of the patient's personal goals, religious beliefs, and values. Relatives, friends, and those who have provided spirtual or personal counsel to the patient in the past can often provide important information about such matters. Special considerations apply in determining the decisionmaking capacity of patients with cognitive impairments. Their recent memory as well as their thought processes may be compromised. In addition, they may be depressed or angry (or both) because of infir- ig Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-41-3 (Supp. 1985). 2o Me. Rev. Stat.

Finally, patients in a health care facility may be attended by medical personnel who come from different cultures, have dif-ferent values, and may not be fluent-or understandable-in spoken English. This should be taken into account in evaluating as- sessments of a patient's responses made by such personnel. Consider again the case of Bertha Harris. She performed poorly on a mental status exam, routinely used to determined competen- cy, that depends heavily on the ability to remember lists of words and numbers and to count backward from 100 by sevens. She alsohad trouble responding to the questions put to her by a foreign- born psychiatrist whose spoken English was very difficult to under- stand. As a result, the psychiatrist testified that Bertha Harris was incompetent because she \"had difficulty grasping\" what was said toher.25 Nevertheless, she repeatedly demonstrated that she under- stood that the doctors wanted to amputate her second leg; she un- derstood that they thought she would die within weeks if the sur- gery were not performed, and she clearly stated that she wouldrather die than go to her grave without the leg.26 Bertha Harris also persisted in claiming that she was 37, al-though she knew the correct date of her birth. The hospital psychi-atrist interpreted this as another sign of incompetence. However, under sensitive questioning by another physician, Bertha Harris stated that she could not be 73 (her true age) because \"that would be old\"; and when asked what was wrong with being old, she re- plied: \"people don't care about old people.\" 27 As the consulting physician later observed, the misstatements about her age mayhave revealed more about Bertha Harris' fears than about anymemory deficit.28 B. STATE FAMILY CONSENT LAWS If the attending physician determines that a patient lacks the ca- pacity to make a health care decision (and if everyone concerned agrees that is the case), who may make the decision on the pa-tient's behalf? The answer depends upon state law or, in the case of facilities operated by the Federal Government, upon the laws andregulations of the department or agency in charge. By September 1986, a dozen -tates had enacted statutes provid-ing clear legal authority for family members to make health care 24 Recent studies by the National Institute of Mental Health found mild cognitive impairment in about 14% of persons age 65 and older, and severe impairment in 5.6% of the men and 3% ofthe women in that age group. A 1977 survey of nursing homes, conducted by the NationalCenter for Health Statistics, found that one-fifth of nursing home residents had a primary diag-nosis of mental disorder or senility without psychosis.

In six of those states, a family member may make all health care decisions for an incapacitated patient (except, in Mary- land, for sterilization, abortion, and treatment or hospitalization for a mental disorder). Nine additional states had passed laws giving family members authority to make decisions for an incapaci- tated patient if a physician certifies that the patient is terminally ill. (See Table 1.) In at least six states, court decisions have validat- ed the right of family members to make health care decisions, in- cluding withholding or withdrawing life prolonging treatment, for terminally ill or comatose patients.29 TABLE 1.-FAMILY CONSENT STATUTES State Statute Family may make health care decisions for incapacitated adults: Arkansas.........................

In states having no family consent law, hospitals and physicians may either choose to rely on family consent or petition a court for appointment of a guardian or for judicial authorization of treat- ment. A Model Health Care Consent Act was recently adopted by The National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws, a body of judges and legal scholars who develop model legislation that they recommend for adoption by the individual states.30 Sec- tion 4 of the Model Act provides that, when a patient is incapable of providing consent and has not designated another to make health care decisions, such decisions may be made on the patient's behalf by a spouse, adult child, parent, or adult sibling. (If a guard- ian or legal representative has been appointed in a judicial pro- ceeding, that person would have priority over the family members.) Under Section 3 of the Model Act, an adult is presumed capable of 29 Case law in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, and Virginia supports the right of family members to make health care decisions-including decisions to forego treat- ment-for terminally ill or comatose patients. 80 Uniform Law Commissioners' Model Health-Care Consent Act, 9 U.L.A. 332 (West Supp. 1984), reprinted as Appendix F of this report. consenting and thus, may consent \"unless, in the good faith opin- ion of the health-care provider, the individual is incapable of making a decision regarding the proposed care.\" The model act gives equal priority to all family members and provides no guidance on how to proceed if family members dis- agree. By contrast, some states specify the priority in which family members are authorized to act, and others require unanimity of all members in a given category (e.g., adult children). (See Table 2.) The model act emphasizes that individuals making health care de- cisions for incapacitated patients should be guided by the patient's previously expressed preferences and values, to the extent they are known-or can be determined. Although the model act was approved by the Uniform Law Com- missioners in 1982, it has had little impact to date. As the Commis- sioners observed in a footnote to their introductory remarks: \"There is no reason to believe that those states that enacted in- formed consent legislation [within the last decade] are dissatisfied with their efforts nor is there reason to believe that uniform legis- lation on this subject would be enacted by those states that decided not to adopt informed consent legislation in the 1970's.\" 31 31 9 U.L.A. at 332 (West Supp. 1984), n.1.

C. FEDERAL LAW 1. REGULATIONS Consent to health care, the right to refuse treatment, and familyconsent are typically governed by state law. However, federal facili-ties (such as Veterans Administration hospitals, military hospitals,and health care facilities operated by the Public Health Service)are not required to follow state law. Instead, the rights of patientsin federal facilities are governed by the regulations and policies ofthe agency operating the facility. In November 1985, Senators Heinz and Glenn, Chairman andranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, wroteto the heads of federal agencies that operate health care facilitiesrequesting information about their regulations and policies con-cerning consent to health care and the right to refuse treatment. Responses were received from the following: Department of Defense: -Department of the Air Force: Michael C. Kerby, Brigadier Gen-eral, Deputy Director, Legislative Liaison.-Department of the Army: Delbert L. Spurlock, Assistant Secre-tary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs).-Department of the Navy: James F. Goodrich, Acting Secretaryof the Navy. Department of Health and Human Services:-Public Health Service: Donald I. Macdonald, M.D., Acting As-sistant Secretary for Health, on behalf of:-Indian Health Service -Gillis W Long Hansen's Disease Center-National Institutes of Health: James B. Wyngaarden, M.D.,Director Federal Bureau of Prisons: Norman A. Carlson, Director Veterans Administration: Everett Alvarez, Jr., Acting Adminis-trator The descriptions below are based upon letters received fromagency officials and supporting documentation that was attached.32 Department of Defense The Department of Defense has no department-wide policy gov-erning health care decision-making. Instead, the Air Force, Army,and Navy develop and implement their own policies, as describedbelow. Air Force Although there is no requirement that it do so, the Air Force fol-lows the laws of the state in which its medical facilities are located. As a result, terminally ill patients may refuse life-sustaining treat-ment to the extent consistent with the law and medical practice ofthe host state. If medical personnel determine that a patient lacksthe capacity to make a decision regarding health care, family con-sent is accepted according to the state law. In medical facilities out- 32 Copies of all documents received are available from the Senate Special Committee onAging. side the United States, decisions are made \"in accordance with United States Law.\" 3 In the case of active duty personnel, a treatment refusal is reviewed by an evaluation board to determine whether the decision not to submit to recommended treatment will interfere with the patient's physical qualifications for active mili- tary sbrvice.34 Army The Army expressly follows the general policies of the Presi- dent's Commission regarding the right of patients to refuse treat- ment.35 Any competent patient may direct that life-sustaining pro- cedures be withheld or withdrawn after discussion with the attend- ing physician. Medical personnel are directed to proceed according to the patient's wishes. If a clinical assessment of the patient's mental and emotional status reveals incapacity to make a health care decision, family members may make decisions on behalf of the patient, according to the law of the state or jurisdiction in which the medical facility is located. Life-sustaining procedures may be withdrawn from an incapacitated patient who is terminally ill or in a chronic or persistent vegetative state with the consent of next of kin or legal guardian and the concurrence of the attending phy- sician. If there are differences of opinion among those parties, advice and consultation may be obtained from an ethics committee. Navy In the absense of evidence to the contrary, the Navy presumes that its patients are competent, in which case they have sole au- thority to consent to or refuse medical treatment.36 If an adult pa- tient is determined to be either incompetent or of diminished com- petence, treatment decisions may be made by the person author- ized under state law to consent on his or her behalf.37 Orders not to resuscitate a patient (\"DNR\" orders) may be written by the at- tending physician only after consultation with the patient, or if the patient is incapable of making a decision, with the patient's family. If there are disagreements among the patient, family members, and physician concerning DNR orders (or similar decisions concern- ing terminally ill patients), or if the lives of others are implicated, the case must be reviewed by the facility's ethics committee.38 Dis- cussions with the patient and family must be witnessed by a regis- tered nurse, social worker, or higher authority; and determinations of decision-making capacity must be reviewed by a legal officer and psychiatrist or psychologist.39 The Navy expressly follows general principles of the President's Commission and directs that: 33 Letter to Senators Heinz and Glenn from Michael Kerby, Deputy Director, Legislative Liai- son (February 13, 1986). 34 AFR 168-4, paragraph 12-113. 3 Dept. of the Army Policy Statement on Withdrawal of Life-Sustaining Treatment. * NAVMEDCOM Instruction 6320.16.

In all deliberations, the underlying principle is to attempt to determine the decision the patient would have made if he or she was fully competent and informed.40 Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health (NIH) The largest single provider of health services in the Department is the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a major research facility. The Clinical Center expressly follows the recommendations of the President's Commission and affirms the right of competent patients to forego any treatment, including one that sustains life.41 Family consent is accepted if the patient has provided written delegation of authority to a specific family member. In the absence of a prior directive, family members' de- sires concerning treatment of a patient will be given some weight, but are not controlling.42 To determine whether a patient has the capacity for decision-making, physicians discuss the matter with the patient and family, and also may request psychiatric and neur- ologic consultation. In addition, physicians may \"test\" the patient's understanding by posing questions about information that has been provided about the proposed treatment. The Department of Health and Human Services also operates health facilities through the Indian Health Service and at the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center, in Louisiana. Indian Health Service The Indian Health Service will honor a patient's refusal of treat- ment, although refusal of a blood transfusion that is considered necessary for preservation of life must be in writing.43 If, based upon a mental status examination, a patient is found to be incom- petent, consent of the natural or legal guardian is accepted (except for sterlization and abortion). Orders not to resuscitate in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest may be written by an attending physician after consulation with the patient (or, if the patient is in- competent, the patient's family and/or guardian), but only if a con- sensus is reached regarding resuscitation efforts.44 Gillis W Long Hansen's Disease Center At the Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) Center, parents or legal guard- ians may consent to health care on behalf of incompetent pa- tients.45 Orders not to resuscitate a terminally ill patient must be discussed with the patient, or a representative of the patient, to the extent possible.46 Differences of opinion concerning resuscitation may be discussed with an ethics committee. 40 Id.

Federal Bureau of Prisons 4 The Federal Bureau of Prisons views its responsibility concern- ing the inmates in its custody as including decisions concerning their health care. As a result, inmates may not refuse medical care deemed necessary to sustain life or to prevent harm to self or others. Elective treatment may be refused. Family consent on behalf of an incompetent inmate is not sought because decisions re- garding necessary treatment are made by the Bureau of Prisons. There are no formal policies or specific procedures for determining the decisionmaking capacity of an inmate. Veterans Administration The right to refuse treatment in Veterans Administration hospi- tals is clear and will be honored, so long as the consequences of re- fusal have been explained to the patient.48 The explanation con- cerning the consequences of refusal must be documented in the medical record. A family member may consent or refuse treatment on behalf of an incompetent patient, in the following order of prior- ity: spouse, adult child, parent, adult sibling.49 Family consent for procedures such as sterilization, psychosurgery and aversive condi- tioning (behavior modification) will be accepted only where permit- ted by state or court authorization.50 Orders not to resuscitate a patient may be written only after con- sulting with the patient, if the patient is competent, and encourag- ing the patient to discuss the matter with family members.51 If the patient is incompetent, orders not to resuscitate must be discussed with the patient's surrogate or family members. If the next of kin disagree among themselves, no order not to resuscitate may be written for an incompetent patient unless the patient has provided an advance directive, as discussed later in this report. 2. COURT CASES Twice in recent years, courts have been asked to determine the right of patients in federal hospitals to refuse life-prolonging treat- ment. In 1981, a patient suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"Lou Gehrig's disease\") requested that he be removed from a venti- lator. His wife and son objected and VA medical personnel refused to honor his request. The patient sued the Veterans Administration, charging assault and battery, breach of fiduciary duty, and viola- tion of his constitutional right of privacy as well as his common law right to refuse medical treatment.52 A federal district court in California held that when a competent patient, informed of the con- sequences, requests discontinuation of a respirator, refusal of the hospital to honor his wishes is an invasion of his constitutional right of privacy and dignity. The court's order to remove the respira- tor was stayed, pending an appeal by the Veterans Administration, 4 Letter from Norman A.

Nov. 16, 17, 1981). and the patient died (still connected to the machine) before the appeal could be filed. As a result, there is no appellate court deci- sion in this case. Martha Tune, a 71-year-old widow with terminal cancer asked physicians of Walter Reed Army Medical Center to disconnect her respirator. No one doubted her competence; but the medical staff be- lieved that policies of the Department of the Army prohibited re- moval of life support even when requested by a competent patient. 5 When Martha Tune sued, the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia held that competent adult patients in federal medical facilities, who are terminally ill and in Mrs. Tune's circumstances, have the right to have life-support equipment withdrawn.54 The Army did not appeal. D. GUARDIANSHIPS, CONSERVATORSHIPS, AND COURT ORDERS All 50 states and the District of Columbia have a mechanism by which courts can appoint a guardian to manage the assets or make personal decisions on behalf of those who have become unable to care for themselves. The statutes and common law principles are grounded in the state's police power and the responsibility of the state, as parens patriae (the state acting as parent), to protect those who cannot or will not take care of themselves. 1. WHAT GUARDIANSHIP IS Guardianship or conservatorship of the estate (an individual's property) is available in all 50 states. Although some states use the term \"guardianship\" while others use \"conservatorship,\" the duties of both are similar to those of a trustee in managing the assets of a ward. In contrast, guardianship or conservatorship of the person involves fundamental decisions such as where the ward will live (whether at home or in an institution), who will provide necessary care, and the kind of activities in which the ward will be permitted to engage. The terms guardian and conservator are often used interchange- ably. In a number of states, if a court does not specify a type of guardianship, there is a presumption in favor of \"full\" guardian- ship (i.e., of both the person and property). 2. WHY GUARDIANSHIP IS SOUGHT The intent of guardianship is benevolent: to provide care and de- cision-making authority for those who cannot manage their own af- fairs. However, it should not be sought unnecessarily because it can result in substantial deprivation of liberty and property. Guardianships are usually sought by parties with genuine con- cern for the needs of the proposed ward. Sometimes, family mem- bers seek guardianship when health care providers, fearing legal li- ability, are fearful of implementing a decision to withhold or with- 53 See policy statement of the Acting Surgeon General, Department of the Army (that former- ly prohibited the use of living wills and similar directives in Army Military Treatment Facili- ties) (May 23, 1978) reprinted in President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Deciding to Forego Life-Sustaining Treat- ment, Appendix I, 520-22 (1983). 54 Tune v. Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 602 F. Supp. 1452 (D.D.C. 1985). draw treatment. At other times, concerned friends and family of a patient disagree on the best course of action and seek court review to resolve their conflict. Occasionally, health care providers seek court assistance to establish who is responsible for payment or who can provide legally valid informed consent. In addition, some states have laws that require physicians and other health professionals to notify appropriate state or community agencies when they know of an individual who needs guardianship services. Occasionally, determination of incompetency is sought to subject an unwilling patient to medical treatment. Sometimes a guardian is appointed even when family members are available who have in- timate knowledge of the patient's wishes. This may happen because the family members are not closely enough related to bring them within the scope of family consent statutes. 3. HOW THE NEED FOR GUARDIANSHIP IS DETERMINED Although statutory language and case law vary among the states, a determination of the need for guardianship generally re- quires two steps. First, the proposed ward must have a specified di- agnosis or disability. Second, as a result of that disability, the pro- posed ward must be unable to make decisions on his or her own behalf. The Uniform Probate Code defines an \"incapacitated person\" as one \"who is impaired by reason of mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, advanced age,55 chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication, or other cause (except minority) to the extent lacking sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions.\" 56 Courts frequently appoint a \"guardian ad litem,\" usually an at- torney, whose responsibility is to represent the proposed ward's in- terests during the guardianship proceedings. In some states, guard- ianship decisions require the judge personally to observe the pro- spective ward; elsewhere, this is discretionary. Courts typically re- ceive testimony from hospital physicians concerning a patient's competency. In states that have adopted the Uniform Probate Code, the court is directed, or has the discretion, to have a court \"visitor\" interview the patient. The visitor may be a court employ- ee, a representative of a public or private charity, or a staff member of an adult protective service agency. Community re- sources (such as public health departments, agencies providing services for the elderly, and schools of public health or nursing) can provide additional assistance. A conference of probate judges in Massachusetts has established a specialized panel of guardians ad litem to assist courts with questions about life-sustaining treat- ments. A serious drawback to many systems is that, even where visits, evaluations, and legal representation have been mandated by law, there often is no provision for paying the professionals who per- form the services. That is now the situation in New Jersey follow- ing the landmark case involving Claire Conroy. In that state, a pro- posal to withdraw life-sustaining treatment from a patient in a 5 Advocates for the elderly have vigorously protested the use of \"advanced age\" as a basis for defining incapacity; nevertheless, it remains in the Uniform Code. 56 Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 5-103, 8 U.L.A. 437 (West 1983). nursing home must be reviewed by the state ombudsman, who isdirected to treat every notification as a case of possible abuse. Inaddition, two independent physicians must confirm the patient's prognosis, but it is not clear who should pay for the physicians' services. 4. WHO MAY BE APPOINTED If the court finds that a person lacks decision-making capacity, it will appoint a guardian (sometimes referred to as a \"committee,\" even when an individual is appointed). Unfortunately, as the Presi-dent's Commission observed, guardianship proceedings are typical- ly initiated in response to an individual's inability to manage prop-erty and financial matters, and the guardians appointed are often financial institutions or their employees, who are ill-suited formaking decisions about personal matters.7 A major difficulty is that the person appointed by the court maynot be the one the ward would prefer to make health care deci-sions, even if it is a \"close\" relative. Indeed, the guardian may be atotal stranger, with beliefs and values that differ significantly from those of the ward. Because so many elderly individuals outlivetheir family (or have none nearby), a number of states have devised a \"public guardianship\" under which a government agency, rather than an individual, assumes the role of guardian for a ward who has no family member available. 5. THE EFFECTS OF GUARDIANSHIP The court may grant a guardian a broad range of powers affect- ing virtually every aspect of a ward's life, such as the management of assets, where and with whom the ward will live, and the grant- ing or withholding of consent for medical treatment. However, courts and legislatures increasingly are recognizing that compe- tence may fluctuate over time, and that patients may have the ca- pacity to make some choices, but not others. Thus, a growing number of states now permit a limited or partial guardianship, in which decision-making authority is confined to specific areas. Some states allow courts to structure the guardianship authority to fit the needs of an individual ward, while others require only that the guardian's powers be drawn as narrowly as possible. Thus, in somestates the appointment of a guardian does not necessarily deprive the ward of all civil rights and personal authority. Yet, the deprivation of autonomy and self-determination inher- ent in a finding of even partial incompetency and the appointment of a guardian can be devastating. To varying degrees, it can result in the loss of control over residence, associations, travel, and the freedom to vote, contract or execute a will. Moreover, the rules of discovery in competency proceedings allow for far-reaching inquiry and can be humiliating to the potential ward. One nurse with much experience as a participant in these proceedings writes; \"knowledge of such an adjudication can be lethal. [I have] known at least three wards whose physical conditions were not terminal but who refused to eat and died within two weeks of notice that 5 President's Commission, Making Health Care Decisions, supra n.9, at 175. guardianship had been imposed.\" 5 On the other hand, appoint- ment of a guardian may make possible some arrangements that are otherwise beyond the ward's reach due to inability to enter into contracts-for example, moving into a retirement community, public housing, or nursing home. 6. THE COST OF GUARDIANSHIP Unfortunately, the most vulnerable individuals (especially those without substantial assets) often fall through the bureaucratic cracks in the system of social services. Ironically, it may be more difficult to find a guardian, or to institute guardianship proceed- ings, when life and death questions are at issue than when the problem is one of financial management. Perhaps this is because guardianship proceedings are expensive as well as time-consuming and humiliating.59 58 B.

Lombard to Senate Special Committee on Aging (February 20, 1986) commenting on a draft of this report. III. NEW APPROACHES: ADVANCE DIRECTIVES One way to increase control over what happens in the event of incapacity is to write instructions in advance. Two kinds of ad- vance directives relating to health care are now recognized by law: so-called \"living wills\" and durable powers of attorney. It is impor- tant to bear in mind that advance directives (and the laws author- izing their use) do not create rights; rather, they are mechanisms for exercising the fundamental right to make one's own choices about health care. There are two important reasons for preparing advance direc- tives. The first is to help ensure that one's wishes will be hon- ored.60 The second is to protect family members, health care pro- fessionals, and others from the stress and potential conflict of making critical decisions without sufficient information concerning an incapacitated patient's preferences. Family members may dis- agree strongly-and in good faith-concerning a particular deci- sion. Written instructions could spare them considerable pain and guilt by designating who among them should make decisions and by relieving them of the burden of deciding what treatment should be provided. Advance directives for health care are in some ways similar to wills directing the distribution of property after death. They lift the burden of decisionmaking from the family members by setting forth instructions as to how to proceed, whether it be for care of a person during critical illness, or disposition of bodily organs and property following death. It is a way of extending the right of self- determination even to the time when one is unable to give instruc- tions in person. It is also an expression of care and concern for one's family-to have had the foresight to have taken the time to plan ahead and thus spare them additional pain during what inevi- tably will be a period of stress. As the courts repeatedly have said, one's right to self-determination with respect to health care deci- sionmaking is not lost when an individual is no longer capable of making-or expressing-personal choices. This section describes advance directives and explains some of their current limitations. A. LIVING WIus Many people by now have heard about \"living wills.\" These are documents by which an individual may give directions about health care, to be followed in the event he or she has a terminal s0 Even individuals under guardianship or conservatorship can benefit from advance direc- tives for health care. Priority often is given to agents designated under durable powers of attor- ney when guardians are appointed and, if a different person is serving as guardian or conserva- tor, the agent appointed by the patient generally may still carry out the patient's wishes con- cerning health care. illness and is unable to provide further instructions. Although most state laws refer to them as \"declarations\" or \"directives\" created pursuant to the state's Natural Death Act, these documents are popularly known as living wills. In this report, the familiar term \"living will\" is used generically to refer to written instructions con- cerning health care in the event of terminal illness or irreversible condition. Usually, a living will directs that if death is imminent, the process of dying should not be prolonged, but care necessary to maintain comfort and dignity should be provided while the termi- nal illness is permitted to take its natural course. By September 1986, living wills had been recognized by legislation enacted in all but twelve states. (See Table 3.) TABLE 3.-STATES THAT HAD NOT ENACTED NATURAL DEATH ACTS BY SEPTEMBER 1986 Kentucky Nebraska Ohio Massachusetts New Jersey Pennsylvania Michigan New York Rhode Island Minnesota North Dakota South Dakota In New York and New Jersey, written declarations such as living wills have been recognized by the courts as clear and convincing evidence of a patient's wishes that may be implemented by physi- cians, acting in good faith, without need for additional court pro- ceedings.61 It is likely that courts in other states would rule similarly, if the question were presented. As a matter of practice, however, health care providers may well accept living wills as trustworthy evidence of a patient's wishes and implement them, unless there is conflict among family members concerning the appropriateness of forego- ing a particular form of treatment. (Of course, family members have no right to override a specific treatment decision made by a patient while competent.) The major impediment to implementing living wills in the ab- sence of clear, statutory authority is the fear on the part of some physicians and hospital attorneys that patients' families will sue for failure to provide proper care. It is clear that such fears are misplaced, however. No health care provider to date has been sub- ject to sanction for withholding or withdrawing life prolonging treatment based upon a written directive signed by the patient or with the agreement of next of kin. The closest example of potential liability occurred in 1983 when criminal charges were brought against two California physicians who, with the family's consent, removed life supporting equipment from a terminally ill, comatose patient. But the charges were dis- missed by the California Court of Appeal, ruling that physicians, acting in good faith and with family consent, may withdraw life- sustaining treatment even in the absence of a declaration, prepared under the state's Natural Death Act.62 The court based its ruling on the principle that physicians are not required to continue ther- 61 In the Matter of Selma L.

Superior Court, 147 Cal.App.3d 1006, 195 Cal. Rptr. 484 (1983). apy that is useless (i.e., that can not improve the likelihood of re- covery).63 In fact, health care providers that continue to apply life-sustain- ing treatment against the expressed wishes of a patient or the pa- tient's family risk liability for wrongful treatment or battery.64 1. TYPICAL PROVISIONS Natural Death Acts typically provide that life-prolonging treat- ments may be withheld or withdrawn from a patient who has pre- pared a valid living will (i.e., one that complies with the formal re- quirements set forth in the statute). Generally, before a living will may be implemented, two physicians (including the attending phy- sician) must certify in writing that the patient is terminally ill, as defined by the Act. In seven states, certification by only one physi- cian is sufficient.65 The definition of \"terminal illness\" varies among the states, but generally requires diagnosis of an irreversible condition that will lead to death; many states add: \"with or without the administra- tion of life-sustaining treatment.\" In many states, death must be \"imminent\", but \"imminent\" often is not defined. The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, approved in August 1985 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uni- form State Laws, uses the phrase \"terminal condition,\" as defined as \"an incurable or irreversible condition that, without the admin- istration of life-sustaining treatment, will, in the opinion of the at- tending physician, result in death in a relatively short time.\" (As noted earlier, the Commissioner's approval of a Uniform Act car- ries with it a recommendation that the Act be adopted by all of the states.) The physicians' certification of terminal illness and the pa- tient's Declaration must both be made part of the medical record. Natural Death Acts specifically protect health care providers from civil and criminal liability for withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment in compliance with living wills. In addi- tion, the Acts typically state that refusal of life-prolonging treat- ment by a terminally ill patient does not constitute suicide for in- surance or other purposes. In most states, a health care provider who is unwilling to comply with the patient's directive for religious or personal reasons is obliged to try to transfer the patient to the care of another who will comply. In one-third of the states, failure to follow a patient's valid directive, or to transfer the patient to an- other's care, constitutes unprofessional conduct on the part of the doctor or hospital. In some states, such failure is a misdemeanor- as it is in the Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.6 6 State laws vary with respect to: (1) requirements for executing a valid living will, and (2) conditions under which a living will may be implemented. As a result, a document that is legally valid in the state where it was signed may not always be as clearly within the statutory protections of other states. It is possible that the inten- 64 Leach v. Shapiro, 13 Ohio App.3d 393, 469 N.E.2d 1047 (1984)1 5Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Montana and Vermont require certification of terminal illness only by the attending physician. 66 See Section 9(a) of the Act. The entire text of, and accompanying commentary to, the Uni- form Rights of the Terminally Ill may be found at Appendix G of this report. 66-265 0 -87 -2 tions of a living will would be given effect despite technical devi- ations from the form required by a particular state. Nevertheless, uniformity across the states would eliminate uncertainty. 2. HOW TO CREATE A LEGALLY VALID LIVING WILL Although most states provide a form that may be used to create a living will, only California, Idaho and Oregon require that the form be strictly followed. The remaining states permit individual variations so long as the state's requirements for making a valid living will are satisfied. A sample living will is reproduced at Ap- pendix B of this report. All states that recognize living wills by statute require that they be signed in the presence of at least two adult witnesses.67 Because of possible conflicts of interest that may arise, the states usually prohibit at least one (and sometimes both) of those witnesses from including relatives, persons who might be entitled to inherit the person's estate, individuals who have financial responsibility for the person's health care, and individuals who have professional re- sponsibility for the person's health care (such as the physician or employees of the health care facility). A few states require that one witness be the nursing home ombudsman when a nursing home resident signs a living will. (See Table 4.) Some states require that the living will be notarized, and a few have additional requirements such as filing with a government office. Two states (California and Idaho) require that living wills be reaffirmed after a certain number of years. (See Table 5.) In some states, a terminally ill patient may make an oral decla- ration in the presence of witnesses who then sign a written version. Table 5 presents the significant requirements for creating a valid living will in the 39 states that have enacted Natural Death Acts. Only four states (Hawaii, Maine, Maryland and Montana) specifi- cally recognize a living will from another state. In the Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, there are no specific qualifications (or disqualifications) for witnesses. Moreover, Section 11 of the Act specifically recognizes the validity of living wills validly executed in other states. This approach simplifies the procedure, solves the problem of using the declaration in a stateother than where it was signed, and removes from health care pro- viders the burden of determining whether technical witness re- quirements have been met. In two states (California and Oklahoma), a living will is binding only if it is signed after a diagnosis of terminal illness has been made. 3. HOW LIVING WILLS ARE PUT INTO EFFECT Most of the Natural Death Acts require patients to notify their physicians that they have signed a living will and require the phy- sicians to include a copy in the patient's medical record. These re- quirements have obvious utility. However, sometimes a primary physician is not in charge of the patient's care during a particular \" South Carolina requires three witnesses and a notary. South Carolina Death With DignityAct, H.B. 2041, 1986 S.C. Acts 127. hospitalization. This can happen if the patient becomes ill or is in- volved in an accident while away from home, or if the patient is hospitalized for surgery (in which case the surgeon, not the pri- mary physician, may be the physician in charge). Therefore, it is important to make several copies of a living will that can be given to a hospital or another physician should the need arise. One or two close friends or family members should also be given copies so that they can provide one, if need be. Once a patient has been diagnosed as terminally ill, and the di- agnosis is certified by the required number of physicians, some states require that the patient be informed of the terminal diagno- sis before the living will can be implemented. 4. STATUTORY LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF LIVING WILLS As previously indicated, Natural Death Acts generally apply only to patients who are \"terminally ill.\" Yet, even after a diagnosis of terminal illness has been made, there may be limitations on the use of a living will. Approximately half the states that have en- acted a Natural Death Act prohibit implementation of a living will if the patient is pregnant. (See Table 5.) In addition, almost half the states specifically exclude the provision of nourishment and hy- dration from the category of \"extraordinary care\" that may be withheld or withdrawn from a terminally ill patient under the gen- eral authority of a living will. (See Table 5.) In such states, whether it is possible for the patient's legal representative to direct that nu- tritional support be withheld or withdrawn, is not entirely clear. (See section on Nourishment and Hydration, below.) However, a Florida appellate court recently ruled that the Constitutional right to refuse treatment includes the right to have a nasogastric feeding tube removed and such rights may not be limited by legislation. (See Corbett v. DAllessandro, No. 85-1052, Fla. App. 2nd Dist., April 18, 1986.) As noted earlier, living wills valid in one state might not be hon- ored in another if the formal requirements for creating a valid doc- ument differ significantly or if the second state has not enacted a Natural Death Act. This is of particular concern in a mobile socie- ty. In addition, there are definitional problems that may frustrate the declarant's intentions. For example, the requirement that a pa- tient be \"terminally ill\" may present difficulties. Victims of serious accidents or strokes, who are in a coma or persistent vegetative state, are not \"terminally ill\" as that phrase is defined in most Natural Death Acts and as generally understood; yet such patients may not wish to live for years in a coma if recovery is virtually impossible. Similarly, many individuals suffering from progressive deterioration of various organ systems or the combined effects of degenerative disorders may not want to be kept on life-support sys- tems if they no longer have any awareness of life. Yet, living wills would not apply in their case under most Natural Death Acts. Similarly, it may not be clear whether a proposed medical treat- ment should be considered \"extraordinary\" (and therefore may be foregone) or \"supportive\" (and therefore must be provided). 28 Although many Natural Death Acts have used these terms, thePresident s Commission presented persuasive arguments that thedistinction between \"ordinary\" and \"extraordinary\" is not usefulin this context. One reason is that \"extraordinary' has a numberof possible meanings, including: very expensive, highly complex, ex-tremely unusual, artificial, or highly invasive. In addition, a par-ticular intervention might be viewed as extraordinary with respectto one patient, but ordinary with respect to another, because of dif-ferences in the patients' conditions.68 A more useful analysis, ac-cording to the Commission, is one that weighs the burdens and ben-efits of a proposed treatment for a particular patient given that pa-tient's medical condition and prognosis at the time a decision mustbe made.69 Several courts have since adopted the Commission'sreasoning and terminology,70 as have professional associations.71 TABLE 4.-WITNESS REQUIREMENTS FOR DECLARATIONS Witness may not be- Empoe Repn- State Related by Hir tor Declar- E r h Re r Nursing home patient requires special witnessblood or toam ants ant's ant's* maage state physician health ants cie care costs Alabama............................

THE ISSUE OF NOURISHMENT AND HYDRATION One example of the difficulty in applying distinctions between or-dinary vs. extraordinary care, or aggressive treatment vs. support-ive or comfort care, is the issue of whether artificial nourishmentand hydration may be withdrawn from a terminally ill or comatosepatient. (Artificial nourishment would include, for example, naso-gastric feeding tubes, intravenous solutions, and gastrostomytubes.) All of the courts that have addressed the problem of withdrawingartificial feeding have taken the position that the replacement of anonfunctioning digestive system by mechanical means (such as anasogastric feeding tube) is no different legally from the mechani-cal replacement of a nonfunctioning respiratory system. Thus, thecourts have held, artificial nourishment (like any other form ofmedical treatment) may be withheld or withdrawn from an inca-pacitated patient if the burdens imposed by it outweigh the bene-fits received by the patient, given that patient's current conditionand prognosis.7 2 Most recently, the Supreme Court of Massachu-setts ruled that the wife of a permanently comatose, 49-year-oldformer fireman and emergency medical technician (with the con-currence of their five adult children) may carry out his previouslystated wishes and withdraw the tube feedings that had sustainedhim through three years of comatose existence.7 Some people feel strongly that there is something qualitativelydifferent about the provision of food and drink that provokesstrong opposition to the idea of withholding them from someonewho is ill. They emphasize that the provision of nourishment is a ne For a description of recent cases involving artificial nourishment, see B. Mishkin, \"CourtsEntangled in Feeding Tube Controversies,\" 1(4) Nutrition in (August1986). Recent cases include: Corbett v. DAlessandro, 487 So.2d 368 (Fla. App. 1986) (rev. denied);In re Nancy Ellen Jobes, No. C-4971-85E (Super. Ct. N.J., April 23, 1986); Conroy, N.J.321, 486 A.2d 1209 (N.J. 1985); In re Hier, 18 Mass. 200, 464 N.E.2d 959, review denied, 392 Mass.1102, 465 N.E.2d 261 (1984); Barber v.

Therefore, as at least one bioethicist has sug- gested, it may serve humanity to pay attention to the \"moral revul- sion\" some feel about withholding nutrition, while accepting that ventilators may be withdrawn.74 Others suggest that it should not be obligatory to provide artifi- cial nourishment and hydration, in the following rare situations: (1) The procedures that would be required are so unlikely to achieve improved nutritional and fluid levels that they could be correctly considered futile; (2) The improvement in nutritional and fluid balance, though achievable, could be of no benefit to the pa- tient; and (3) The burdens of receiving the treatment may outweigh the benefit.75 They would agree, however, that even in the situations described, it may be important to provide nourishment and hydration if that is what the patient wants, or would want, or if interested persons (family, friends, or caregivers) \"feel that such procedures affirm important values.\" 76 Finally, those who believe it may be accepta- ble, in limited cases, to forego artificial nourishment and hydra- tion, caution that in most cases, \"patients will be best served by providing nutrition and fluids\" and that the presumption should be that nutrition and fluids will be provided.77 The American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judi- cial Affairs recently issued the following statement on the subject: Life prolonging medical treatment includes medication and artificially or technologically supplied respiration, nu- trition or hydration. In treating a terminally ill or irre- versibly comatose patient, the physician should determine whether the benefit of treatment outweigh its burdens. At all times, the dignity of the patient should be main- tained.78 The AMA's position, as stated, is consistent with that of the Presi- dent's Commission. In the end, decisions of this sort are inescapably personal. There- fore, it is important to indicate one's own feelings on the matter in an advance directive and to arrange for someone to serve as an ad- vocate in this regard, should the need arise. The section on Durable Powers of Attorney explains how this may be done. 6. HOW TO REVOKE A LIVING WILL A living will may always be revoked. This is consistent with the principle that consent to treatment is an ongoing process and a pa- tient may always have a change of mind. Generally, living wills 74 D.

Childress, \"Must Patients Always Be Given Food and Water?', 13(5) Hast- ings Center Report 17-21 (Oct. 1983); J.

Barry, F. Rouse, F. Davila and N.W. Dickey, \"Withholding or Withdrawing Treatment,\" (letters) JAMA, Vol. 256, No. 4, 469-471 (July 25, 1986). may be revoked by an oral declaration of the patient. Even in the one state (Mississippi) that requires living wills to be filed with the Bureau of Vital Statistics, and that requires revocations to be simi- larly witnessed and filed, an oral revocation is sufficient if the pa-tient is physically unable to sign the revocation document, have it witnessed, and file it with the Bureau. 7. RECOGNITION OF LIVING WILLS IN FEDERAL FACILITIES The Air Force, the Navy, the Veterans Administration, theIndian Health Service and the Hansen's Disease Center honor living wills to the extent permitted by the state in which their fa-cilities are located.79 In the Veterans Administration, a living willthat lacks legal effect in the host state may nevertheless be enteredinto a patient's medical record to be considered, along with other factors, in determining the patient's wishes.80 The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) accepts living wills prepared in any state, so long as the maker was 18 years or older and the document was signed and witnessed by atleast two persons (who also were 18 years of age or older). Nonotary is required. The Army has no stated policy regarding living wills although, as noted earlier, a competent patient may direct that life-sustain- ing procedures be withdrawn or withheld. The Federal Bureau of Prisons also has no policy concerning living wills. However, such documents presumably would have no effect since the Bureau does not permit inmates to refuse treat- ment necessary to sustain life. B. DURABLE POWERS OF ATTORNEY Powers of attorney traditionally have been used in the context of commercial transactions and the management of property. For ex- ample, one could delegate power of attorney to a trusted friend, rel- ative, or lawyer in order to give that person authority to complete a transaction (such as purchase or sale of a house) if one's own presence were not possible.81 Or, one could give power of attorney to a financial advisor to manage investments. An individual must be a competent adult to give such importantauthority to another. And, since a power of attorney may always be revoked, historically it was necessary for one to remain compe-tent in order to have the power remain in effect (because, it wasthought, one must always competently choose not to revoke the power). Clearly, such an arrangement would defeat the purpose ofarranging for another to take over in the event of one's own inca- pacity (since the power of attorney would become void just at the time it was designed to take effect). To overcome the operation of law that automatically revoked the effectiveness of a power of attorney when the maker became in- 9 Letter from Michael Kerby, supra n.33; enclosure (1) of letter from James F. Goodrich, supra n.37; VA Circular 10-85-79 (May 14, 1985); Indian Health Service Circular No. 85-1 (Feb.28, 1985); Carville Medical Staff By-Laws, Section 33(8).80 VA Circular 10-85-79 (May 14, 1985), section 3(c)8' There are a few exceptions to the general rule. For example, in the District of Columbia,real estate may not be transferred through a power of attorney. competent, state legislatures have enacted laws permitting powers of attorney to be durable-in other words, to endure even if the maker's competency does not. To create a durable power of attor- ney, the document must merely state that it is intended to be dura- ble, or that the power created will not be affected by the incapacity of the principal (the person writing the document). 1. POWERS OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE Although powers of attorney were developed and used tradition- ally in areas of commercial transactions and transfers of property, most state statutes provide that a power of attorney may be either \"dgeneral\" (i.e., for making any and all decisions in a variety of areas) or \"specific\" (i.e., limited to a particular area of concern, transaction, or time frame). The President's Commission and many legal scholars have taken the position that in the absence of a stat- utory limitation on the use of powers of attorney, nothing should prevent their use for appointing individuals to make health care decisions.82 The applicability of powers of attorney for health care decisions has been affirmed by statute in a small number of states. No court has ruled on the validity of powers of attorney in this context, however; therefore, no one can say with absolute certainty that a power of attorney for health care would be implemented by a court, if the question were posed. Nevertheless, since courts gen- erally will accept clear and convincing evidence of a patient's wishes in matters concerning health care, the probability is high that a court would accept an incapacitated patient's designation of a proxy health care decision maker through a durable power of at- torney.83 The Supreme Court of New Jersey, ruling in the case of Claire Conroy, indicated that it would recognize the authority of a durable power of attorney for health care created in conformity with New Jersey's general durable power of attorney statute. (Conroy, supra n.72, 486 A. 2d at 1229). 2. ADVANTAGES OF DURABLE POWERS OF ATTORNEY Durable powers of attorney are more flexible, and apply to more situations, than living wills. They also permit the individual (rather than a court) to decide who should make decisions on his or her behalf in the event of incapacity. Although the word \"attorney\" is used, powers of attorney may be given to virtually anyone (family member, trusted friend, clergy, or financial advisor) including attorneys.84 82 President's Commission, Deciding to at 146- 147; F. Collin, J. Lombard, A. Moses and H. Spitler, Drafting the Durable Power of Attorney, supm n.59, at 24-25. ** The Attorney General of New York recently suggested that a durable power of attorney is \"an uncertain vehicle\" for delegating general authority for making health care decisions; how- ever, he added that such a document could be used to delegate to an agent the responsibility for communicating an individual's decision to decline medical treatment under certain circum- stances. Op. Atty. Gen. No. 84-F16 (Dec. 28, 1984). A special task force convened by the Governor of New York recently recommended legislation that would authorize written delegations of authority appointing individuals to make health care decisions in the event of later incapacity. New York Tak Force on Life and the Law, Do not Resuscitate Orders: The Proposed Legislation and the Report of the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law (April 1986). 84 In Florida, however, only certain family members may be appointed under a \"family dura- ble power of attorney.\" Durable powers of attorney are recognized everywhere in theUnited States except the District of Columbia.85 As a result, a du-rable power of attorney created in one state is more likely to behonored in another. In addition, durable powers of attorney can be used by individ-uals who want life-prolonging treatments continued, as well as bythose who prefer (as in most living wills) to forego such treatment.Finally, durable powers of attorney can be used to make deci-sions on behalf of individuals who are not terminally ill, but whoare incapable of making their own decisions because of some otherreason (for example, a serious accident, a permanent loss of con-sciousness, an incapacitating degenerative illness). Durable powersof attorney can be applied to decisions about all forms of healthcare (for example, whether a nursing home resident should havedental surgery or undergo an invasive diagnostic procedure); theyare not limited to questions about life prolonging treatment.For all of these reasons, durable powers of attorney are muchmore flexible documents than living wills. 3. HOW TO CREATE A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY Durable powers of attorney are relatively simple to create. Theymay be either broad (delegating the power to act in a number ofareas, both financial and personal) or they may be very specific(e.g., limited to decisions concerning health care).To create a durable power of attorney for health care, it is gener-ally possible to follow a standard form and merely fill in the blanksso long as other formalities set forth in state laws are followed.86 (See Appendix C.) It is advisable to designate one or more successoragents in case the primary agent is unavailable or unable to act.For example, a spouse is often designated as the primary agent,but both husband and wife could be injured in a common accident.If both are too seriously injured to make their own decisions or todecide for each other, then someone else will have to make deci-sions on behalf of both. Thus, individuals typically designate first aspouse, then either an adult child or a brother or sister. One couldalso designate a close friend or advisor. The most important consid-eration is that individuals appoint people in whom they have confi-dence and who can be relied upon to act according to the interestsand values of the person who appointed them.Because of possible conflicts of interest or the appearance of im-propriety, it is recommended that the following not be designatedas an agent for making health care decisions: the primary physi-cian, or anr other practitioner with professional responsibility forthe patient s health care, and any employee of a health care facili-ty (such as a hospital, nursing home, home health agency or hos-pice) in which the individual is, or is likely to be, receiving care.Durable powers of attorney must be witnessed and notarized asrequired by state law. Because of the variations among state laws 5 A bill authorizing durable powers of attorney in the District of Columbia was approved bythe D.C. City Council on Dec. 16, 1986, and awaits the Mayor's signature. Bill 6-7 (District ofColumbia Guardianship, Protective Proceedings and Durable Power of Attorney Act of 1986). 8 For example, California requires that a nursing home ombudsman witness a power of attor-ney for health care prepared by a resident of a skilled nursing facility. (See Appendix E to thisreport.) (described below) and the possibility that a power of attorney may need to be used in a state different from the one in which it was prepared, it is often suggested that the document be witnessed and notarized, to cover all eventualities. 4. VARIATION AMONG STATE LAWS A Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act was approved in 1979 by the National Commissioners on Uniform Laws; however, only a handful of states have adopted it as a statutory means of recogniz- ing powers of attorney that survive the incompetence or disability of the maker. Most states have incorporated language from the Uniform Probate Code providing that powers of attorney will not be affected by the incapacity of the individual conveying the power (i.e., the \"principal\").87 Several states (notably California, Connecti- cut, New York, and Rhode Island) have their own formulations. (See Appendix D.) The Uniform Durable Power of Attorney provisions adopted from the Uniform Probate Code, however, do not assure uniform require- ments for creating these documents. That is because the \"durable\" provision is merely added onto pre-existing requirements for creat- ing valid powers of attorney-and those requirements vary among the states as to whether a notary is required, whether the power of attorney must be filed with a government office, and (in the case of South Carolina) how many witnesses are required. (See Table 6.) -In California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New York and Rhode Island, a special statutory form is provided, however, it may be modified to meet individual needs. -In the following states, a power of attorney must be notarized: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina. -In Oklahoma and Wyoming, a power of attorney must be ap- proved by a judge of the state district court. -In the following states, a power of attorney must be filed with a specified government office: Arkansas, Missouri, North Caroli- na, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming. (See Table 6.) In a society as mobile as ours, lack of uniformity concerning pro- cedural requirements raises the possibility that advance planning will be frustrated by technical differences among state laws.

California and Rhode Island have statutory forms for durable powers of attorney for health care which include a cautionary notice to personsexecuting the document. 5. RECOGNITION OF DURABLE POWERS OF ATTORNEY IN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE FACILITIES Durable powers of attorney are recognized explicitly in the poli- cies of only two federal agencies: the Air Force and the NIH Clini- cal Center. Air Force policy is to recognize durable powers of attor- ney if they are validly en:ecuted and enforceable according to the laws in the state in which the medical facility is located. Under a \"trial policy,\" the NIH Clinical Center not only recog- nizes but actively encourages the use of durable \"Medical Powers of Attorney.\" The Medical Power of Attorney must be signed, wit- nessed, and notarized. Forms, information and assistance are avail- able to patients. A copy of the power of attorney is included in the medical record of inpatients and the original is given to the patient or a family member. The Navy accepts health care decisions made by persons author- ized under state law to consent on behalf of another, and therefore implicitly recognizes durable powers of attorney to the extent they are authorized by state law. The Army permits parents to execute powers of attorney giving authority to others to make decisions concerning the health care of minor children, if not prohibited by the laws of the host state. The Veterans Administration, Indian Health Service, and Han- sen's Disease Center have no policies concerning durable powers of attorney. The Federal Bureau of Prisons also has no policy concerning du- rable powers of attorney and, presumably would not honor such documents in view of the Bureau's position that it is responsible for making decisions concerning the health care of incompetent in- mates in its custody. 6. WHAT TO DO AFTER SIGNING A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY As with living wills, an important part of signing a durable power of attorney is what happens next. Those who have been ap- pointed as agents should discuss with the maker as many aspects of health care as they can imagine might require attention. It is especially important, given the developing state of the law regard- ing nutrition and hydration, to discuss one's feelings and intentions about artificial feeding in addition to other forms of life-sustaining treatment to make sure that written instructions about such mat- ters are fully understood. It would also be useful to discuss possible placement in different kinds of health care facilities, such as hos- pices and nursing homes. For persons already in a nursing home, it is important for those making decisions to understand the resi- dent's feelings about being transferred to a hospital, in specific cir- cumstances. Agents should also understand how the individual feels about orders not to resuscitate (DNR orders) in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest. In addition to discussions with the named agents, discussions should be initiated with one's primary physician and family mem- bers. Those who have not been named as agents should understand that decisionmaking authority has been delegated to particular in- dividuals and what the practical effects of that delegation are. Finally, copies of the durable power of attorney should be given to the named agents, the primary physician, and close family mem- bers. Extra copies should be kept for medical records in health care facilities. C. ANATOMICAL GIFTs Although somewhat different from living wills and durable powers of attorney, donations of bodily tissues and organs following death may also be arranged in advance. In 1968, the National Com- missioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Anatomi- cal Gift Act which permits competent adults to indicate, in ad- vance, their intent to donate organs (such as corneas, kidneys, hearts, and livers) at the time of their death.88 The law permits the donor to sign a legally valid document authorizing such gifts, and no additional permission by family members or others is re- quired. The procedure is designed to permit the directive of the donor to be implemented automatically, at the time of death, with- out consulting family members. In many ways, the organ donor laws are similar to laws requir- ing probate courts to follow a deceased person's instructions for dis- tribution of property (as set forth in a legally valid will)-whether or not family members and other heirs agree with that distribu- tion. The actual implementation of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act has differed from the intent of the drafters, however, and prac- tices could be revised to be more consistent with the intent of the statutes. 88 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, 8A U.L.A. 15 (1983). 1. HOW TO MAKE AN ANATOMICAL GIFT The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act was designed to eliminate theconfusion of having a variety of laws around the country and to en-large the class of organ donors to the extent possible.89 Under theAct, any person 18 years of age or older and of sound mind may\"give all or any part of his body for an7 purpose specified [by theAct], the gift to take effect upon death.' (See Section 2 of the Actwhich is reproduced at Appendix K.) Anatomical gifts may bemade either by a will or by a document other than a will. In eithercase, the gift becomes effective upon the death of the donor. If thegift is made through a traditional will, it is effective automaticallyat the death of the donor, without going through probate. (See Sec-tion 4 of the Act.) The gift may be made to a specified donee (recip-ient), but it need not be. The Commissioners' Commentary (accompanying the text of theUniform Law) urges states to print forms or notices on driver's li-censes to simplify the process of organ donation, and 45 states have done so. Wallet-sized organ donor cards are also widely distributed by private organizations such as the National Kidney Foundation,to be signed and witnessed under the provisions of the UniformAnatomical Gifts Act. In the absence of a document indicating the deceased's inten-tions, members of the family (in the following priority) may makean organ donation: (1) the spouse; (2) an adult son or daughter; (3)either parent; (4) an adult brother or sister; (5) a guardian of theperson of the decedent at the time of his death; or (6) any otherperson authorized or under obligation to dispose of the body. No family member may authorize an anatomical gift if there isknowledge of a contrary intention on the part of the deceased orknown opposition by a member of the same or a prior class. (SeeSection 2 of the Act.) A few states have enacted laws requiring hos-pitals to discuss possible organ donation with families of dying pa-tients. 2. HOW DEATH IS DETERMINED Some individuals fear that organs will be removed before the pa-tient is \"really dead.\" However, the Act protects against suchaction by requiring that the physician who declares time of deathor who certifies death not be the physician who removes any tissueor organs for transplantation. (See Section 7(b).) This is intended toexclude the attending physician from taking any part in the trans-plant procedures. In addition, detailed guidelines explain how todetermine that death has occurred. Before respirators were devised, death was defined merely as thecessation of heartbeat and respiration. Now, respirators can main-tain the heart and lungs even when the entire brain has ceased tofunction. Today, most states recognize an alternative definition ofdeath based on the total and irreversible cessation of all brainfunction. In the last two decades, a number of statutory variationson this theme were enacted, all with the same intent. Unfortunate- \" Id.; Comment to Section 2 at 35. ly, the variations left the disconcerting impression that a person could be simultaneously alive in one state and dead in another, de- pending upon the statutory language. To remedy this situation, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine proposed a model law, the Uniform Determination of Death Act.90 It was drafted in consulta- tion with the American Bar Association, the American Medical As- sociation, and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uni- form State Laws. All three of these groups have endorsed the model act as preferable to versions they supported in the past. More than a dozen states have adopted the Uniform Determina- tion of Death Act, providing a uniform definition of death for pur- poses of criminal law, tort law, family law, insurance law, and the disposition of an estate. Although revising the law permits death to be determined on the basis of brain-related criteria, it is still the physician's responsibility to determine whether an individual pa- tient's brain has ceased to function totally and irreversibly. The President's Commission published guidelines, developed by a group of prominent physicians and scientists, for determining death ac- cording to brain criteria through the use of up-to-date tests and technologies.91 These guidelines, applied by physicians, provide a means of confirming that death has occurred even when machines are pumping air and blood through organs incapable of functioning on their own. (The text of the Guidelines appears in Appendix L of this Report.) 3. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE TIME OF DEATH Under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, an organ donation be- comes effective (vests) upon the death of the donor. It is only after the organs have been removed that the remains may be given over to the custody of the surviving spouse, next of kin, or other person under obligation to dispose of the body. (See Section 7.) If the gift is of the entire body, the recipient \"may, subject to the terms of the gift, authorize embalming and the use of the body in funeral serv- ices.\" (Id.) The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act does not provide for family members to be asked to approve a donor's gift or to be given an opportunity to defeat the donor's intent. Yet, that is the current custom. Hospitals uniformly seek the consent of next of kin to carry out the wishes of the donor and apparently seldom proceed without such consent.92 In a survey conducted recently by the Gallup Organization, hos- pitals said they seek family consent in order to avoid legal liabil- ity.93 Yet, Section 7(c) of the Act states clearly that: A person who acts in good faith in accord with the terms of this Act or with the anatomical gift laws of another state [or foreign country] is not liable for damages in any s0 President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Defining Death (Washington, 1981) at 119. ex Id., Appendix F at 159-166; reprinted in 246(19) JAMA 2184-186 (November 13, 1981). 92 H. Schwartz, \"Bioethical and Legal Considerations in Increasing the Supply of Transplant- able Organs: From UAGA to 'Baby Fae,'\" 10(4) Amer. J Law & Med. 397, 406 (Winter 1985). *3 Id. civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal pro- ceeding for his act. Moreover, the commentary to the Act states that at the time of the donor's death, the donee (recipient) has absolute ownership of the body, if he accepts the gift, and that: The entire section 7 merits genuinely liberal interpreta- tion to effectuate the purpose and intent of the Uniform Act, that is, to encourage and facilitate the important and ever increasing need for human tissue and organs for med- ical research, education and therapy, including transplan- tation. According to the Centers for Disease Control, of the approximate- ly 20,000 persons who are declared dead each year on the basis of brain-related criteria and who are potential organ donors, organs are obtained from only approximately 2,000. This is due in part to logistical problems; for example, kidneys must be used within 48 hours of the donor's death and other organs can be maintained for only a few hours. However, available organs may be lost merely be- cause health care providers fail to find-or honor-the decedent's donor card, or are reluctant to raise the issue with the decedent's family.94 A number of states have enacted laws requiring hospital personnel to inquire about organ donor cards and to seek permis- sion for organ donation from next of kin when a potential donor dies. Physicians and hospital administrators should educate them-selves-and then, educate the families of their patients-about the legal rights and obligations created by a valid anatomical gift. One reason individuals make donations in advance is to save their family from having to make difficult decisions at a time of extreme stress. Such individuals have the right to expect that their legally valid donations will be given effect. Their families should be in- formed by attending physicians that the deceased made an anatom- ical gift and that the law not only permits, but requires, the hospi- tal to honor that gift. That is the purpose of the Uniform Anatomi- cal Gift Act. Most recently, the United States Congress passed legislation re- quiring hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid to estab- lish written policies and procedures to identify potential organ donors while, at the same time, encouraging discretion and sensi- tivity to the circumstances, views and beliefs of the potential donor's family.95 D. Conclusion This report has emphasized the importance of communication (both written and oral) in health care decisionmaking, and has de- scribed ways in which advance directives can help to assure that *4 B.

Although most states now recognize both living wills and durable powers of attorney, state laws differ as to requirements for wit- nesses and notaries. Because we live in a mobile society, confidence in the usefulness of advance directives would be enhanced if states would honor documents prepared in other jurisdictions. It would be even better for all states to adopt the same requirements for pre- paring living wills and durable powers of attorney. Uniform recog- nition of advance directives by federal agencies would complete the picture. There is a clear need for additional education by professional schools, professional societies, public interest groups, and advo- cates. This report is designed to assist in a larger effort of legisla- tion, education, and individual counseling so that ultimately, every individual who so desires will be able to plan ahead for decisions about their health care.

Since the definition of health care is broader in scope than medical care, there is a need to limit the coverage of the Act so that the rendition of routine care by family member, would not be within its cov- erage. One limitation on the scope of the Act is found in the definition of a health-care provider in sub- section 3. That definition excludes those who are not licensed, certified or otherwise authorized to render health care. Hence, the rendition of simple care by a family member to one who is ill at home would not be covered by this Act while that same treatment would be covered if provided in a hospital.

Individuals Who May Consent to Health Care Unless incapable of consenting under Section 3, an individual may consent to health care for himself if he is: (I) an adult: or (2) a minor and (i) is emancipated. (ii) has attained the age of 1141 years and. regardless of the source of his income. is living apart from his parents or from an individual in loco parentis and is manag- ing his own affairs, from: 9 Untfornm LnsWs Ann. (West Supp. 1985). (iii) is or has been married. (i), is in the military service of the United States, or (v) is authorized to consent to the health care oy any other law of this State. COMMENT Section 2 describes those individuals who may consent to health care for themselves.' All adult,. unless disqualified by Section 3. may consen; to health care. These two provisions basicall, restate the common law with regard to consent by adults. At common law minors were not presumed to be com- petent to consent to health care. However, there are certain status exceptions. both statutory and com- mon law. which render a minor capable of consent- ing. Section 2(2) is a compilation of the more widel recognized exceptions to the traditional requirement of consent by a parent or guardian which permit a minor. unless disqualified by Section 3. to consni it) health care for himself as if he were an adult The exceptions are based on the assumption that a minor who has made the described decisions or taken the described actions in his life has demon- str2ted his capacity to make decisions concerning his health care. The emancipated minor exception is widely recognized in case law and in the statutes of more than thirty states. See Wilkins, Children s Rights: Removing the Parental Consent Barriers to Medical Treatmnent of Minors, 19'5 Arizona St.LL 31. 59(195). Paragraph (2)(ii) is an explicit emanci- pation provision based on objective criteria shich will not require a formal adjudication of emancipa- tion. The age is bracketed. but the age of l-# is a rea- sonable age when coupled with the other require- mient of this paragraph. Other objective criteria which courts and state legislatures have accepted as showing a minor's maturity to make decisions affecting his health. are marriage and service with the armed forces. (See, e.g.. Ind.Ann. Stat. 16-8-4-1 (Burns 1973).) Once a minor has satisfied any of these criteria he mas con- sent to health care for himself as if he were an adult. In addition to the status exceptions permitting consent by minors, many legislatures have created additional exceptions authorizing minors to consent to treatment for specific conditions or diseases with- out regard to their status. For instance, 45 states pres- ently allow minors to obtain treatment for venereal '1Wil the language of Section 2 is cast in terms of an authorz4 tion to consent, that necessaril means that one authorizcd io con- sent may also refuse consent or withdraw consent to a course of health care once givendisease without parental consent. One or more states permit minors to consent to the following forms of health care: (1) health care necessary to diagnose or treat pregnancy; (2) health care necessary to diagnose or treat venereal disease; (3) health care necessary to diagnose or treat alcohol or drug dependency or abuse; (4) psychiatric or psychological counseling. (5) health care necessary for the performance of an abortion; (6) health care necessary for counseling in the use of contraceptive devices; and (7) health care necessary for the performance of any type of sterilization. Paragraph 2(v) of this Act leaves intact those state laws which permit a minor to consent to one or more specific health-care procedures. regardless of whether the minor meets the status exceptions of paragraph 2.

Individuals Incapable of Consenting An individual otherwise authorized under this [Act] may consent to health care unless. in the good faith opinion of the health-care pros ider. the individ- ual is incapable of making a decision regarding the proposed health care. COMMENT Section 3 uses the phrase incapable of consenting as opposed to incompetency. This choice is deliber- ate. Incompetency in American law carries the con- notation of permanency and is often thought to in- volve an adjudicative declaration. Howev er. a person may be de jure competent when in fact he is incapa- ble of making a decision regarding his own health care. An otherwise competent adult w ho has been rendered unconscious in an accident is at that time de facto incompetent or incapable of making 2 deci- sion regarding proposed health care. Section 3 is phrased negatively as the law presumes that adults. and under certain circumstances minors as well, are capable of making decisions unless there is some determination of a contrary status. The de- termination called for in Section 3 is to be made by the health-care provider, and the standard is whether the individual is incapable of making a decision re- garding the proposed health care. If the individual is capable of making a decision, the health-care pro- vider must abide bs that decision. Custom suggests and necessity dictates that the in- itial determination that one is incapable of consent- ing rest with the health-care provider. Section 3 in recognition of necessity legitimates that custom. Unlike the decision to invoke the emergency excep- tion to the requirement of informed consent which has the effect of bypassing consent altogether, a deci- sion that one is incapable of consenting merely shifts the decision regarding the rendition of health care to a third party. This is an important difference for the health-care provider's decision is ex necessitae a low visibility' one. Any decision to bypass the pa- tient by deciding that he is incapable of making a decision endangers the values of individualism and personal autonomy. What is needed in any such deci- sion is a proper combination of deference to profes- sional judgment and health-care values on the one hand and respect for personal autonomy and in- dividualism on the other. Reposing the ultimate deci- sion to proceed with medical treatment in a third party should assure that values of personal autonomy and individualism receive proper consideration. The requirement that the individual be incapable of engaging in decision-making is consistent with the underlying notion of consent. A unique human char- acteristic is the power to make decisions. The lan- guage of Section 3 focuses on the ability of one to make 2 decision as opposed to the content of a health-care decision. A decision to refuse a specific course of treatment may be based on moral or reli- gious grounds. An individual who refuses treatment because he has consistently relied on prayer for heal- ing in accordance with his religious tradition is capable of making his own health-care decisions. A decision to refuse treatment made under those cir- cumstances should be honored by a health-care provider. The uncertainties of medical practice and the deci- sion to be made do not make precise statements of the test for determining incapacity easy. However. the context in which the decision is made and the ef fect of such a decision render the lack of precisionless onerous.' The health-care provider who decides that one is incapable of consenting must then turn it another who is charged with making the ultimate treatment decision in the best interest of the patient.

Individuals Who May Consent to Health Care For Others (a) If an individual incapable of consenting under Section 3 has not appointed a health-care represen- tative under Section 6 or the health-care represen- taiive appointed under Section 6 is not reasonably available or declines to act, consent to health care may be given: (1) b) a guardian of his person. a represen- tative appointed under Section -. or a rep- resentative designated or appointed under other law of this State: or (2) by a spouse, parent, adult child. or adult sibling, unless disqualified under Section 8, if there is no guardian or other represen- tative described in paragraph (1) or he is not reasonably available or declines to act. or his existence is unknown to the health- care provider. (b) Consent to health care for a minor not author- ized to consent under Section 2 may be given: (1) by a guardian of his person. a represen- tative appointed under Section -. or 2 rep- resentative designated or appointed under other law of this State; (2) by a parent or an individual in loco paren- tis. if there is no guardian or other repre- sentative described in paragraph (1) or he is not reasonably available or declines to act, or his existence is unknown to the health-care provider; or (3) by an adult sibling of the minor. if a parent or an individual in loco parentis is not rea- sonably available, declines to act, or his existence is unknown to the health-care provider. (c) An indisidual delegated authority to consent under Section 5 has the same authority and respon- sibilits as the individual delegating the authority. I .See A. Meisd, The Exceptions\" to the Informed Consri Doctnrne Striking a Between Values in Medcl Decisioaking. 1979 Wis.L.Rev. 413, 452, 472-43. (d) A person authorized to consent for another under this section shall act in good faith and in the best interest of the individual incapable of consenting. COMMENT Section 4 authorizes designated persons to exercise health-care decision-making powers for individuals who cannot consent for themselves and who have not appointed a health-care representative to act tin their behalf as authorized in Section 6. Ifa he2lth care representative has been appointed and is willing to act, that preempts the operation of this section. Subsection (a) is concerned with adults and minors authorized to consent under Section 2. It sets forth an order of priority among substitute decision- makers. The first priority is given to individuals ap- pointed by a court. a guardian or an individual ap- pointed under Section -. The second priority class is the family Within this class, the spouse. parents. adult children and adult siblings are ranked equall.. Ans member of the class is authorized to act. Any decision establishing priority among family members would be largely arbitrary. The objective is to have someone who has a close personal relationship with the patient and who will consider his best interest acting for him. If one of those authorized to act disagrees with the decision of another who has been designated a proxy decision maker, that person can seek formal judicial appointment to act for the one incapable of consenting. However, an objector would be required to show that the other authorized decision-maker was not acting in the patient's best interest. (See Section 7.) Subsection (b) authorizes substitute decision- makers for minors who are not authorized to consent under Section 2. The first priority. is given to court- appointed officials. If the parents are alive, it is unlikely that there would be a court-appointed guardian and the parents would have first priority. If there is no court-appointed official and if the parents are unavailable, any adult brother or sister of the minor is authorized to make health-care decisions. Family members authorized to consent for one in- capable of consenting under this section may dele- gate their decisional authorit) to another. The per- son to whom authority is delegated under Section 9 has the same priority to act for the patient as the delegating individual, One authorized by this section to act for another must act in good faith and in the best interest of the individual incapable of consenting.Library References Husband and Wife 0 1.

Delegation of Power to Consent to Health Care for Another (a) An individual authorized to consent to health care for another under Section 4(aX2), 4(b)(2) or 4(bX3) who for a period of time will not be reasonably available to exercise the authority may delegate the authority to consent during that period to another not disqualified under Section 8. The delegation must be in writing and signed and may specify conditions on the authority delegated. Unless the writing expressly provides otherwise. the delegate may not delegate the authority to another. (b) The delegant may revoke the delegation at any time by notifying orally or in writing the delegate or the health-care provider. COMMENT Section 5 permits a limited delegation of authority to consent for another. Family members authorized to consent for another under Section 4 may delegate their decisional authority. This provision should he helpful in situations in which parents want to delegate health-care decision- making to a temporary custodian of their children. for instance when parents plan to be away or when a child is at camp. This section follows closely Section 5-104 of the Uniform Probate Code. Library References Mental Health C=-179. 236. CJ.S. Insane Appointment; Qualification; Powers; Revocation and Responsibility (a) An individual who may consent to health care under Section 2 may appoint another as a health-care representative to act for the appoinior in matters af- fecting his health care.

(d) The appointor may specify in the writing terms and conditions considered appropriate, in- cluding an authorization to the health-care represen- tative to delegate the authority to consent to another. (e) The authority granted becomes effective ac- cording to the terms of the writing. (f) The writing may provide that the authority does not commence until, or terminates when, the appointor becomes incapable of consenting. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the authority granted in the writing is not affected if the appointor becomes incapable of consenting. (g) Unless the writing provides otherwise, a health-care representative appointed under this sec- tion who is reasonably available and willing to act has priority to act for the appointor in all matters of health care. (h) In making all decisions regarding the appoint- or s health care. a health-care representative ap- pointed under this section shall act (i) in the best in- terest of the appointor consistent with the purposes expressed in the appointment and (ii) in good faith. (i) A health-care representative who resigns or is unwilling to comply with the written appointment may exercise no further power under the appoint- ment and shall so inform (i) the appointor. (ii) the ap- pointor's legal representative, if one is known, and (iii) the health-care provider, if the health-care repre- sentative knows there is one. (j) An individual who is capable of consenting to health care may revoke: (i) the appointment at any time by notifying the health-care representative oral- l or in writing. or (ii) the authority granted to the health-care representative by notifying the health- care provider orally or in writing. COMMENT Section 6 is designed to extend the concept of pa- tient autonomy by permitting a person to transfer his health care decision-making power to another. Many individuals who are competent to make health care decisions nevertheless want to delegate this deci- sional authority to a relative or friend. In addition, in the event they are rendered incapable of consenting, many people want the assurance that some other in- dividual whom they trust will make health-care deci- sions on their behalf. It is generally thought that if one cannot or does not exercise his own decisional authority in health-care matters this authority should he placed in the hands of the state (i.e.. a court). a health-care pro- vider or the next of kin. Any of these choices may be seen as a restriction on autonomous choice. Leaving this authority in the hands of a court when there are other alternatives available is particularly vexing because it allows the state a measure of control over individuals to which it has no obvious moral right and for which it has no special expertise. Section 6 provides an alternative. The decision to allo the transfer of authority rests on the principle of the basic human need of self determination and individ- ual autonomy. The patient himself can designate the person who is to make these health-care decisions. Section 6 does not prescribe the nature of the decision-making relationship between the appointing individual and the person appointed The appointing individual has the opportunity to engage in moral discourse with his agent, and to specify in the docu- ment the terms and the conditions, of the appointment. Subsection (h) provides that a health-care represen- tative must act in the best interest of the appointor consistent with the purposes expressed in the ap- pointment and in good faith. Cases often purport to draw a distinction between a best interest and substi- tuted judgment standard. (Compare In re Guardian- ship of Pescinski, 67 Wis.2d 4. 226 N.W.2d 180 (1975) (best interest) with In re Quinlan. 70 N.J. 10, 335 A.2d 647 (1976) (substituted judgment)). Yet the two terms reflect not so much a difference in con- cept as a difference in emphasis- The standard of best interest is generally thought to incorporate a concept of objective reasonableness with reference to the in- terests of society and others while the substituted judgment standard focuses on the interest of the par- ticular patient- That the patient may define what is in his best interest and that such a declaration should be accepted by surrogate decision-maker is well recog- nized in many adjudicated cases. (See In rc Quinlan. 70 NJ. 10, 355 A.2d 647 (1976); Superintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz. 370 N.E.2d 417 (Mass. 19\") and Eichner v. Dillon. 426 N.Y. S.2d 51 (1981)). Personal autonomy is the basis for the concept of the health-care representative in Section 6. Where a person appointing a health-care representative has given particular instructions, those instructions should define the best interest of a patient. If no specific directions are given, the more general best interest standard applies. If the health-care representative cannot in good conscience follow the directions provided by his ap- pointor he must resign or seek relief from that man- date by a court. The health-care representative would be an interested individual entitled to petition a court under Section -. In the event the health-care representative does not act, consent must be ob- tained from one of those individuals authorized in Section 4 to act for the patient or from a court under Section 7. Section 6 is consistent with the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act. The appointment made under this section would be given effect without this Act in a jurisdiction which has enacted the Durable Power of Attorney Act. By incorporating this section into the Act, the power of appointment will be brought to the attention of persons who may not be aware of the Durable Power Act.

Court-Ordered Health Care or Court-Ordered Appointment of a Representative (a) A health-care provider or any interested in- dividual may petition the I -_ _ court to (i) make a health-care decision or order health-care for an individual incapable of consenting or (ii) appoint a representative to act for that individual. 1(b) Reasonable notice of the time and place of hearing a petition under this section must be given to the individual incapable of consenting and to in- dividuals in the classes described in Section i who are reasonably available. (c) The court may modify or dispense with notice and hearing if it finds that delay will have a seriou . adverse effect upon the health of the individual.] (d) The court may order health care. appoint a representative to make a health-care decision for the individual incapablc of consenting to health care with such limitations on the authority of the repre- sentative as it considers appropriate, or order any other appropriate relief in the best interest of that in- dividual, if it finds: (1) a health-care decision is required for the individual. (2) the individual is incapable of consenting to health care: and (3) there is no individual authorized to con- sent or an individual authorized to consent to health care is not reasonably available, declines to act, or is not acting in the best interest of the individual in need of health care. COMMENT Section 7 is designed to operate in two basic situa- tions. The first is that in which an individual is in need of health care and incapable of consenting and there is no one to act on his behalf. It is not infre- quent that a person admitted to a hospital has no known relatives or friends. The second is that in which one authorized to act is not acting in the best interest of the individual who is incapable of con- senting. If the parents of a minor refuse medical treatment because of the parents' religious convic- tions courts have not hesitated to take the decision- making authority from the parent when the child's life is endangered.' The removal of a parent's power to consent is gen- crally taken pursuant to state child neglect statutes. However, in some instances courts simply assume the decision-making authority under the parens patriae doctrine. Section 7 provides for the same kind of relief that is provided in the child neglect statutes. Section -provides a certain and expeditious means for removing one authorized to consent who 'On occasion tan' hatt ordered ireaimenI ovtr the thugh the prop-otd treatment tta not nrtar, to sas the child ' fe but poed substantial risk, and Ua not (cr fain Ito curc the condtion tstt in r Sampomn 31 NY S 2d li] i 19th affirmed 291 NY 2d no0, 328 N 5 ttergrowth of faiatl tissue causing a str deformit on the right side of hi, face and neck The need for tratment wat hown h titimon that he did not attend sch,! and suffered a sciert learning ditabilitt rtlating to the deformit The court conluded that the disfigurement .t limited the child deelopminenm that it had Ito assum responsihityt and order the surger. ceen though the procedure eniailed oh ions risks.

There is a developing body of law on that question; however, its contours are not yet clear. (See M. Wald.

Any health-care provider or any individual is given standing to petition for the appointment of a compe- tent representative to consent to the rendition of health care. A court acting pursuant to this section is authorized to order health care or to appoint a com- petent representative who is authorized to make health-care decisions. This section does not displace any other state procedures designed to accomplish the same result Because most states have existing mechanisms to address these questions. the purely procedural portions of Section 7. subsections (b) through (d) are bracketed. They may be deleted from the Act ws ithout destroying its integrity. Library References Mental Health -213. 236. Cj.S. Insane Persons \u00a7\u00a7 79, 85. \u00a7 B. Disqualification of Authorized Individuals (a) An individual who may consent to health care for himself under Section 2 may disqualify others from consenting to health care for him. (b) The disqualification must be in writing. signed by the individual. and designate those disqualified. (c) A health-care provider who knows of a written disqualification may not accept consent to health care from a disqualified individual. (d) An individual who knows he has been disquali- fied to consent to health care for another mas not act for the other under this [Act]. COMMENT A full recognition of individual autonomy requires not only that one be authorized to appoint his health- care representative but that he also be authorized to say whom he does not want to act for him. Section 8 permits this disqualification. A patient may not want to go through the formalit% of appointing a Section 6 health-care representative but may well wish to ex- clude certain persons from acting on his behalf. One who is disqualified under Section 8 has no au- thority to act. However, unless that disqualification is known to a health-care provider, he may neverthe- less rely on an authorization from one who is dis- qualified. (See Section 9.)

Limitations of Liability (a) A health-care provider acting or declining to act in reliance on the consent or refusal of consent of an individual whom he believes in good faith is authorized by this [Act] or other law of this State to consent to health care is not subject to criminal pro- secution, civil liability, or professional disciplinary action on the ground that the individual who con- sented or refused to consent lacked authority or capacity. (h) A health-care provider who believes in good faith an individual is incapable of consenting under Section 3 is not subject to criminal prosecution. civil liability. or professional disciplinary action for failing to follow that individuals direction. (c) A person who in good faith believes he is au- thorized to consent or refuse to consent to health care for another under this [Act] or other law of this State is not subject to criminal prosecution or civil liability on the ground he lacked authority to consent. COMMENT Under Section 9, the health-care provider is per- mitted to rely on the consent of an individual whom he believes in good faith is authorized to consent to health care. In meeting this standard under the Act. a health-care provider could not close his eyes to the truth. of course, but to prescribe an affirmative re- quirement of detailed investigation would make reli- ance impossible. Similarly, a health-care provider who makes a de- termination that one is incapable of consenting and thus calls in a third-party decision-maker is not sub- ject to liability for discharging his obligation in good faith. An individual acting for another is in every sense of the word a fiduciary and has those obligations which a fiduciary owes his ward. The immunity pro- vided in this section does not protect a substitute decision-maker from negligence or other breach of duty but only from acting without authority if he in good faith believes that he is authorized to give consent.

Availability of fedical Information An individual authorized to consent to health care for another under this [Act] has the same right as does the individual for whom he is acting to receive infor- mation relevant to the contemplated health care and to consent to the disclosure of medical records to a contemplated health-care provider. [Disclosure of in- formation regarding contemplated health care to an individual authorized to consent for another is not a waivcr of an evidentiary privilege.) COMMENT An individual authorized to consent for another stands in the shoes of the patient when making health-care decisions. The individual authorized to consent is entitled to receive information relevant to the proposed health care whether or not that is allowable under any other provision of state law. This section guarantees that right but makes no at- tempt to define the scope of disclosure required.I In many cases, proper diagnosis and treatment re- quire that medical information must be passed from one doctor or hospital to another. Because of the confidential or privileged nature of much of this in- formation, the patient's consent is necessary before the information can be disclosed. (61 AmJur.2d Physicians & Surgeons \u00a7 101 (1972) and 20 A.L.R.3d 1109 (1968).) To the extent that the patient has a right which can be waived, an individual acting on his behalf has the same right of waiver. The Act does not determine whether confidential information or a privilege exists in the first instance. Library References Physicians and Surgeons (-15(8) Witnesses 0=208(1). CJ.S.

COMMENT Section II contains important limitations. It is written to make clear that this Act does not intrude into areas of the law where its operation would be in- appropriate. The law with respect to the withdrawal of life sup- port systems in the case of the terminally ill is chang- ing rapidly. At least 10 states have Natural Death Acts and there have been several court decisions concern- ing the issue of termination of treatment. Nothing in this Act changes existing law in that regard. All proxy decisionmakers are charged with acting in the best interest of the patient w ho is incapable of consent- ing. If a patient had appointed a health-care represen- tative and had made known his wish that life support systems are withdrawn in the event of terminal ill- ness. many courts would consider that evidence con- clusive of the patient s best interest. However, this Act does not provide an answer to the question of what is in the patient's best interest in such a cir- cumstance. Subsection (b) provides that the Act w ill not over- ride the operation of mental health code, All states require that commitment proceedings be surrounded with stringent procedural safeguards which must be adhered to before an individual can be ins-luntarily committed. Subsection (b) makes it clear that this Act does not allow any individual authorized to consent for another to bypass those commitment statutes un- der the guise of a voluntary commitment. In addition.subsection (h) prohibits this Act from being used to authorize forcible drug medication unless in confor- mity with other proper procedural requirements. Subsection (c) is written to make it clear that this Act does not authorize one to consent to medical procedures which are prohibited by law. The Supreme Court has held in Belloti v. Baird. 443 U.S. 622 (1979) that minors are entitled to con- sent to an abortion without parental consent. That holding is recognized in Section 2 which permits minors to consent to health care which is otherwise authorized by law. However, the Supreme Court held in the case of H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398, 101 S.Ct. 1164 (1981) that a state requirement of notice to parents does not violate the constitutional rights of a minor. Subsection (d) is written to ensure that state statutes. such as the Utah statute under review in Matheson. are not affected b this Act. This Act is narrow in scope. It is not concerned with the standard of care required of health-care pro- viders. It is not concerned with whether. how and under what circumstances consent to health care is required. Nor is it an informed consent statute. As outlined in the Prefatory Note, this statute is basically a procedural one and matters of state substantive law are unchanged. Section 2 of this Act limits health-care providers to those who are licensed, certified or otherwise au- thorized to provide health care. Practitioners of reli- gious healing, for instance, Christian Science Practi- tioners are not licensed, certified or authorized by the state but practice as matter of the free exercise of religion. Yet spiritual healing is a well recognized form of health care and there is no intention to make this religious activity illegal by the operation of this Act. There is no intention to prevent an individual capable of consenting to health care from consenting for another or himself to spiritual healing which is health care administered in good faith pursuant to religious tenets of the individual requiring health care as a matter of free exercise of religion. Certainly those practitioners of religious healing should not be required to seek state authorization to practice their faith. Hence, subsection (f) is an express savings clause to permit one to consent to spiritual healing as health care. Library References Assault and Battery 2, 11. Physicians and Surgeons C 15(8). CJ.S.

As the pre- ceding sentence indicates, the scope of the Act is nar- row. It does not address treatment of persons who have not executed such a declaration; it does not cover treatment of minors; and it does not address treatment decisions by proxy. Its impact is limited to treatment that is merely life prolonging, and to pa- tients whose terminal condition is incurable and/or irreversible, whose death will soon occur. and who are unable to participate in treatment decisions. Beyond its narrow scope, the Act is not intended to affect any existing rights and responsibilities of per- sons to make medical treatment decisions. The Act merely provides one way by which 2 terminally-ill patient's desires regarding the use of life-sustaining procedures can be legally implemented. The purposes of the Act are (1) to present an Act which is simple, effective, and acceptable to persons desiring to execute a declaration and to physicians and health-care facilities whose conduct will be af- fected, (2) to provide for the effectiveness of a declaration in states other than the state in which it is executed through uniformity of scope and proce- dure, and (3) to avoid the inconsistency in approach which has characterized the earlv statutes. The Act's basic structure and substance are similar to that found in most of the existing legislation. The Act has drawn upon existing legislation in order to avoid further complexity and to permit its effective operation in light of prior enactments. Departures from existing statutes have been made, however, in order to simplify procedures, improve drafting, and clarify language. Selected provisions have been reworked to express more adequately a specific con- cept (i.e., life-sustaining treatment, terminal condi- tion), or to reflect changes in established procedure (i.e., the qualifications of witnesses). The Act's stylistic and substantive departures from existing legislation were pursued for the purposes of clarity and simplicity. \u00a7 1. Definitions As used in this (Act], unless the context otherwise requires:(1) \"Attending physician means the physician who ha. primary responsibilit% for the treatment and care of the patient. (2) \"Declaration\" means a writing executed in ac- cordance with the requirements of Section 2(a). (3) \"Health-care provider means a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the law of this State to administer health care in the or- dinary course of business or practice of a profession. (4) \"Life-sustaining treatment\" means any medical procedure or intervention that. when administered to a qualified patient, will serve only to prolong the process of dying. (5) \"Person\" means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government. governmental subdivi- sion or agency, or any other legal or commercial entity. (6) \"Physician\" means an individual [licensed to prctice medicine in this State]. (7) \"Qualified patient\" means a patient [18] or more years of age who has executed a declaration and who has been determined by the attending physician to be in a terminal condition. (8) \"State\" means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (9) \"Terminal condition\" means an incurable or irreversible condition that, without the administra- tion of life-sustaining treatment, will, in the opinion of the attending physician, result in death within a relatively short time. COMMENT The Act's definitions of \"life-sustaining treatment\" and \"terminal condition\" are interdependent and must be read together. This has caused drafting prob lems in many existing acts. and the Act has been drafted to avoid the problems detected in existing legislation. Most of the \"life-sustaining treatment\" and \"ter- minal condition\" definitions in existing statutes were considered problematical in that they (1) were tauto- logical, defining \"terminal condition\" with respect to \"life-sustaining treatment\" and vice versa, and (2) defined terminal condition as requiring \"imminent\" death \"whether or not\" or \"regardless of\" the ap- plication of life-sustaining treatment. Strictly speak- ing, if death is \"imminent\" even with the full ap- plication of life-sustaining treatment, there is little point in having a statute permitting withdrawal of such procedures. The Act's definitions have at- tempted to avoid these problems. The \"life-sustaining treatment\" definition found in many statutes inserts the clause \"and when, in the judgment of the attending physician, death will oc- cur whether or not such procedure or intervention is utilized,\" after the phrase \"will serve only to prolong the dying process\" found in the Act's provision. Because the Act's life-sustaining treatment definition concerns only those procedures or interventions ap- plied to \"qualified patients\" (i.e.. those who have been determined to be in a terminal condition). and because a terminal condition is defined as \"incurble or irreversible\" with death resulting \"in a relatively short time,\" the requirement that death be \"in- evitablc\" has been satisfied by the presence of \"qualified patient\" in the life-sustaining treatment definition. Therefore, this additional clause was ex- cluded because it was considered repetitious and possibly confusing The Act defines \"life-sustaining treatment in an all-inclusive manner, dealing with those procedures necessary for comfort care or alleviation of pain separately in Section 6(b), where it is provided that such procedures need not be withdrawn or withheld pursuant to a declaration. Most existing statutes in- corporate \"comfort care\" as an exclusion from the definition of life-sustaining treatment. Because many such procedures are life-sustaining, however, the Act avoids definitional confusion by treating them in a separate provision that reflects the Act's policy more clearly, and better reflects the fact that comfort care does not involve a fixed group of procedures applicable in all instances. Subsection (9) of Section I is the \"terminal condi- tion\" definition. The difficulty of trying to express such 2 condition in precise, accurate, but not unduly restricting language is obvious. A definition must preserve the physicians' professional discretion in making such determinations. Consequently, the Act's definition of terminal condition incorporates not only selected language from various state acts, but also suggestions from medical literature in the field. The Act employs the term \"terminal condition\" rather than terminal illness, and it is important that these two different concepts be distinguished. Ter minal illness, as generally understood, is both broader and narrower than terminal condition. Ter- minal illness connotes a disease process that will lead to death; \"Terminal condition\" is not limited to disease. \"terminal illness\" also connotes an in- evitable process leading to death, but does not con- tain limitations as to the time period prior to death. or potential for nonreversibility, as does \"terminal condition.\"The terminal condition definition requires that the condition be \"incurable or irreversible.' These ad- jectives were chosen over the similar phrase. \"no possibility of recovery,\" because of possible ambigu- its in the term \"recovery\" (i.e., recovery to \"normal\" or to some other stage). A number of state statutes now use \"incurable\" and/or \"irreversible,\" and the terms appear to comport with the criteria ap- plied by physicians in terminal care situations. The phrase \"incurable or irreversible\" to to be read con- junctively when the circumstances warrant. A condi- tion which is reversible but incurable is not a ter- minal condition. Subsection (9) also requires that the condition result in the death of the patient within a \"relatively short time ...without the administration of life-sus- taining treatment. This requirement differs to some degree from the language employed in most of the statutes. First, the decision that death will occur in a relatively short time is to be made without consider- ing the possibilities of extending life with life- sustaining treatment. The alternative is that required by a number of states-that death be imminent whether or not life-sustaining procedures are ap- plied. The President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical Re- search has noted that such 2 definition severely limits the group of terminally-ill patients able to qualify under these acts. It is precisely because life can be prolonged indefinitely by new medical technology that these acts have come into existence. Though the Act intends to err on the side of prolonging life. it should not be made wholly ineffective as to the ac- tual situation it purports to address. The provisions which require that death be imminent regardless of the application of life-sustaining procedures appear to have that effect. Therefore. such provisions have been excluded in the Act. The terminal condition definition of subsection (9) requires that death result \"in a relatively short time. Rejecting the \"imminency\" language employed in a number of statutes, this alternative was chosen because it provides needed flexibility and reflects the balancing character of the time frame judgment Though the phrase. \"relatively short time. does not eliminate the need for judgment, it focuses the physi- cian s medical judgment and avoids the narrowing implications of the word \"imminent.\" The \"relatively short time\" formulation is em- played to avoid both the unduly constricting mean- ing of \"imminent\" and the artificiality of another alternative-fixed time periods, such as six months, one year, or the like. The circumstances and in- cvitahle variations in disorder and diagnosis make unreali'tic 2 fixed time period. Physicians may he hesitant to make predictions under a fixed time period standard unless the standard of physician judgment is so loose as to be unenforceable. Under the Act*. standard, considerations such as the strength of the diagnosis, the type of disorder, and the like can be reflected in the judgment that death will result within a relatively short time. as they are nov reflected in judgments physicians must and do make. The life-sustaining treatment and terminal condi- tion definitions exclude certain types of disorders, such as kidney disease requiring dialysis, and diabetes requiring continued use of insulin. This is accomplished in the requirement that terminal con- ditions be \"irreversible, and that life-sustaining pro- cedures serve \"only to prolong the dying process. For purposes of the Act. diabetes treatable with in- sulin is reversible,\" a diabetic person so treatable is not in the -dying process.\" and insulin is a treatment the benefits of which foreclose it serving \"only to prolong the dying process. \u00a7 2. Declaration Relating to Use of Life- Sustaining Treatment (a) An individual of sound mind and 118] or more years of age may execute at any time 2 declaration governing the withholding or withdrawal of life-sus- tamining treatment. The declaration must be signed by the declarant. or another at the declarant's direction, and witnessed by two individuals. (b) A declaration may, but need not. he in the following form: Declaration If I should hase an incurable or irreversible condi- tion that will cause my death within a relatively short time, and I am no longer able to make decisions regarding my medical treatment, I direct my attend- ing physician. pursuant to the Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of this State. to withhold or withdraw treatment that only prolongs the process of dying and is not necessary to my comfort or to alleviate pain. Signed this _ day of Signuiure AddressThe declarant voluntarily signed this writing in my presence- Witness Address Witness Address (c) A physician or other health-care provider who is furnished 2 copY of the declaration shall make it 2 part of the declarant's medical record and, if unwill- ing to comply with the declaration, promptly so ad- vise the declarant. COMMENT Section 2 sets out the minimal requirements re- garding the making and execution of a valid declara- tion. A \"sample\" declaration form is offered in this section. The form is not mandatory, as some acts re- quire; it \"may, but need not, be\" followed. The form provided also is not as elaborate as others. The drafters rejected a more detailed declaration for two reasons. First, the form is to serve only as an example of a valid declaration. A more elaborate form may have erroncously implied that a declaration more simply constructed would not be legally sufficient. Second, the sample form's simple structure and specific language attempts to provide notice of exact- ly what is to be effectuated through these documents to those persons desiring to execute a declaration and the physicians who are to honor it. The Act's provisions governing witnesses to a declaration have also been simplified. Section 2 pro- vides only that the declaration be signed by the declarant in the presence of two witnesses. The Act does not require witnesses to meet any specific qualifications for two primary reasons. First, the in- tcrest in simplicity mandates as uncomplicated a pro- cedure as possible. It is intended that the Act present a viable alternative for those persons interested in participating in their medical treatment decisions in the event of a terminal condition. Second, the absence of more elaborate witness re- quirements relieves physicians of the inappropriate and perhaps impossible burden of determining whether the legalities of the witness requirements have been met. Many physicians understandably and rightly would be hesitant to make such decisions and, therefore, the effectiveness of the declaration might be jeopardized. It should be noted, as well. that protection against abuse in these situations is provided by the criminal penalties in Section 9. The attending physicians and other health-care profes- sionals will be able, in most circumstances, to discuss the declaration with the patient and family and any suspicion of duress or wrongdoing can be discovered and handled by established hospital procedures. Section 2(c) requires that a physician or health-care provider who is given a copy of the declaration record it in the declarant's medical records. This step is critical to the effectuation of the declaration, and the duty applies regardless of the time of receipt. If a copy of the same declaration is already in the record, its rerecording would not be necessary, but its receipt should be noted as evidence of its continued force. Section 2(c) is not duplicative of Section 5 which requires recording the terms of the declara- tion (or the document itself, when available, in the event of telephonic communication to the physician by another physician. for example) at the time the physician makes a determination of terminal condi- tion. It was deemed important that knowledge of the declaration and its continued force be specifically noted at this critical juncture. Section 2(c) imposes a duty on the physician or other health-care provider to inform the declarant of his or her unwillingness to comply with the provi- sions of the declaration. This will provide notice to the declarant that certain terms may be deemed med- ically unreasonable (Section 10()), or that a different provider who is willing to carry out the Act (Section 7) should be informed of the declaration. \u00a7 3. When Declaration Operative A declaration becomes operative when (i) it is com- municated to the attending physician and (ii) the declarant is determined by the attending physician to be in a terminal condition and no longer able to make decisions regarding administration of life-sustaining treatment. When the declaration becomes operative, the attending physician and other health-care pro- viders shall act in accordance with its provisions or comply with the transfer provisions of Section 7. COMMENT Section 3 established the preconditions to the declaration becoming operative. Once operative, Section 3 provides that the attending physician shall act in accordance with the provisions of the declara- tion or transfer care of the patient under Section 7. This provision is not intended to eliminate the physi- cian's need to evaluate particular requests in terms ofreasonable medical practice under Section 10(f), nor to relieve the physician from carrying out the declaration except for any specific unreasonable or unlawful request in the declaration. Transfer of the patient under Section ' is to occur if the physician, for reasons of conscience, for example, is unwilling to carry ouf the Act or to follow medically reason- able requests in the declaration. \u00a7 4. Revocation of Declaration (a) A declaration may be revoked at any time and in any manner by the declarant, without regard to the declarant's mental or physical condition. A revocation is effective upon communication to the attending physician or other health-care provider by the declarant or a witness to the revocation. (b) The attending physician or other health-care provider shall make the revocation a part of the declarant s medical record. COMMENT Section 4 provides for revocation of a declaration and is modeled after North Carolina's similar provi- sion. Virtually every other statute sets out specific examples of how a declaration can be revoked-by physical destruction, by a signed, dated writing, or by a verbal expression of revocation. A provision that freely allowed revocation and avoided proce- dural complications was desired. The simple lan- guage of Section 4 appears to meet these qualifica- tions. It should be noted that the revocation is, of course, not effective until communicated to the at- tending physician or another health-care provider working undr a physician's guidance, such as nursing facility or hospice staff. The Act, unlike many statutes, also does not explicitly require that a person relaying the recovation be acting on the declarant's behalf. Such a requirement could impose an unrea- sonable burden on the attending physician. The com- munication is assumed to be in good faith, and the physician may rely on it. In employing a general revocation provision, it was intended to permit revocation by the broadest range of means. Therefore, for example, it is in- tended that a revocation can be effected in writing. orally, by physical defacement or destruction of a declaration, and by physical sign communicating in- tention to revoke. \u00a7 5. Recording Determination of Terminal Condition and Declaration Upon determining that the declarant is in a ter- minal condition, the attending physician who knows of a declaration shall record the determination and the terms of the declaration in the declarant's medical record. COMMENT Section 5 of the Act requires that an attending physician record the determination that the patient is in a terminal condition in the patient's medical records. The section provides that an attending physician must know of the declaration's existence. It is anticipated that knowledge may in some in- stances occur through oral communication between physicians. if the attending physician determines that the patient is in a terminal condition, and has been notified of the declaration, the physician is to make the determination of terminal condition, as defined in Section 1(8), part of the patient s medical records. There is no explicit requirement that the physician inform the patient of the terminal condition. That decision is to be left to the physician's professional discretion under existing standards of care. The Act also does not require, as do many statutes, that a physician other than the attending physician concur in the terminal condition determination. It appears to be the established practice of most physicians to request a second opinion or, more often, review by a panel or committee established as a matter of hos- pital procedure, and the Act is not intended to dis- courage such a practice. Requiring it, however, would almost inevitably freeze in a single process or set of processes for review in this evolving area of medicine. Because existing policies and regulations typically address the review issue, requiring a spe- cific form of review in the Act was viewed as an un- necessary regulation of normal hospital procedures. Moreover, in smaller or rural health facilities a sec- ond qualified physician or review mechanism may not be readily available to confirm the attending physician's determination. The physician must record the terms of the dec- laration in the medical record so that its specific lan- guage or any special provisions are known at later stages of treatment. It is assumed that 'terms of the declaration will be a copy of the declaration itself in most instances, although cases of an emergency chat- acter may arise, for example, in which the contents of a declaration can be reliably conveyed. and where obtaining a copy of the declaration prior to making decisions governed by it will be impracticable. In such cases, the terms of the declaration will suffice for recording purposes under Section 5.\u00a7 6. Treatment of Qualified Patient (2) A qualified patient may make decisions regard- ing life-sustaining treatment as long as the patient is able to do so. (b) This [Act] does not affect the responsibility of the attending physician or other health-care provider to provide treatment, including nutrition and hydra- tion, for a patient's comfort care or alleviation of pain. (c) Unless the declaration otherwise provides, the declaration of a qualified patient known to the at- tending physician to be pregnant must not be given effect as long as it is probable that the fetus could develop to the point of live birth with continued ap- plication of life-sustaining treatment. COMMENT Section 6(a) recognizes the right of patients who have made 2 declaration and are determined to be in a terminal condition to make decisions regarding use of life-sustaining procedures. Until unable to do so, such patients have the right to make such decisions independently of the terms of the declaration. In af- fording patients a \"right to make decisions regarding use of life-sustaining procedures.\" the Act is in- tended to reflect existing law pertaining to this issue. As Sections 10(e) and (f) indicate. qualifications on a patient's right to force the carrying out of those deci- sions in a manner contrary to law or accepted standards of medical practice. for example, are not intended to be overridden. In Section 6(b) the Act uses the term \"comfort care\" in defining procedures that may be applied notwithstanding a declaration instructing with- drawal or withholding of life-sust2ining treatment. The purpose for permitting continuation of life- sustaining treatment deemed necessary for comfort care or alleviation of pain is to allow the physician to take approprite steps to insure comfort and freedom from pain, as dictated by reasonable medical stan- dards. Many existing statutes employ the term \"com- fort care\" in connection with the alleviation of pain, and the Act follows this example. Although the phrase \"to alleviate pain\" arguably is subsumed within the term comfort care, the additional spe- cificity was considered helpful for both the doctor and layperson. Section 6(b) does not set out a separate rule gov- erning the provision of nutrition and hydration. In- stead, each is subject to the same considerations of necessity for comfort care and alleviation of pain as are all other forms of life-sustaining treatment. If nutrition and hydration are not necessary for com fort care or alleviation of pain, they may be with- drawn. This approach was deemed preferable to the approach in a few existing statutes, which treat nutri tion and hydration as comfort care in all cases. regardless of circumstances, and exclude comfort care from the life-sustaining treatment definition. It is debatable whether physicians or other profes- sionals perceive the providing of nourishment through intravenous feeding apparatus or nasogastric tubes as comfort care In all cases or whether such procedures at times merely prolong the dying pro- cess. Whether procedures to provide nourishment should be considered life-sustaining treatment or comfort care appears to depend on the factual cir- cumstances of each case and. therefore, such deci- sions should be left to the physician, exercising reasonable medical judgment. Declarants may, how- ever. specifically express their views regarding con- tinuation or noncontinuation of such procedures in the declaration, and those views will control. Section 6(c) addresses the problem of a qualified patient who is pregnant. The states which address this issue typically require that the declaration be given no force or effect during the pregnancy. Be- cause this requirement inadvertently may do more harm than good to the fetus, Section 6(c) provides 2 more suitable, if more complicated, standard. It is possible to hypothesize a situation in which life- sustaining treatment, such as medication, may prove possibly fatal to a fetus which is at or near the point of viability outside the womb. In such cases, the Act's provision would permit the life-sustaining treat- ment to be withdrawn or withheld as appropriate in order best to assure survival of the fetus. Also, for ex- ample, if the qualified patient is only a few weeks pregnant and the-physician, pursuant to reasonable medical judgment, determines that it is not probable that the fetus could develop to a point of viability outside the womb even with the application of life- sustaining treatment, such treatment may also be withheld or withdrawn. Thus, the pregnancy pro- vision attempts to honor the terminally-ill patient s right to refuse life-sustaining treatment without jeop- ardizing in any respect the likelihood of life for the fetus. The declaration can, however, specifically ad- dress this issue, and should control the treatment provided, whether it calls for continuation of life- sustaining treatment in all cases, or in none.\u00a7 7. Transfer of Patients An attending physician or other health-care pro vider who is unwilling to comply with this [Act] shall as promptly as practicable take all reasonable steps to transfer care of the declarant to another physician or health-care provider. COMMENT Section 7 is designed to address situations in which a physician or health-care provider is unwilling to make and record a determination of terminal condi- tion, or to respect the medically reasonable decisions of the patient regarding withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures, due to personal con- victions or policies unrelated to medical judgment called for under the Act. In such instances, the physi- cian or health-care provider must promptly take all reasonable steps to transfer the patient to another physician or health-care provider who will comply with the applicable provisions of the Act. g8. Immunities (a) In the absence of knowledge of the revocation of a declaration, a person is not subject to civil or criminal liability or discipline for unprofessional con- duct for carrying out the declaration pursuant to the requirements of this [Act]. (b) A physician or other health-care provider. whose actions under this [Act] are in accord with reasonable medical standards, is not subject to criminal or civil liability or discipline for unprofes- sional conduct with respect to those actions. COMMENT Section 8 provides immunities for persons acting pursuant to the declaration and in accordance with the Act. Immunities are extended in Section 8(a) to physicians as well as persons operating under the physician's direction or with the physician's authori- zation, and to facilities in which the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining procedures occurs. Sec- tion 8(b) serves both to immunize physicians from liability as long as reasonable medical judgment is ex- crcised, and to impose \"reasonable medical stan- dards\" as the criterion that should govern all of the specific medical decisions called for throughout the Act. Section 8(h), in conjunction wiih Section 10(). therefore, avoids the need to restate the medical standard in each section of the Act requiring a medical judgment. \u00a7 9. Penalties (2) A physician or other health-care provider who willfully fails to transfer in accordance with Section 7 is guilty of [a class- misdemeanor. (b) A physician who willfully fails to record the determination of terminal condition in accordance with Section 5 is guilty of [a class-misdemeanor]. (c) An individual who willfully conceals, cancels, defaces, or obliterates the declaration of another without the declarant's consent or who falsifies or forges a revocation of the declaration of another is guilty of [a class- misdemeanor]. (d) An individual who falsifies or forges the decla- ration of another, or willfully conceals or withholds personal knowledge of a revocation as provided in Section 4. is guilty of [a class- misdemeanor[ (e) A person who requires or prohibits the execu- tion of a declaration as a condition for being insured for, or receiving. health-care services is guilty of [a class-misdemeanor] (f) A person who coerces or fraudulently induces another to execute a declaration under this [Act] is guilty of ja class- misdemeanor]. (g) The sanctions provided in this section do not displace any sanction applicable under other law. COMMENT Section 9 provides criminal penalties for specific conduct that violates the Act. Subsections (a) and (b) provide that a physician's failure to transfer a patient or record the diagnosis of terminal condition consti- tutes a misdemeanor. Subsection (c) makes certain willful actions which could result in the unauthor- ized prolongation of life 2 misdemeanor. Subsection (d) governs acts which are intended to cause the unauthorized withholding or withdrawal of life- sustaining treatment, thereby advancing death. Sub- sections (c) and (f) concern situations that may be coercive, and therefore are against public policy. Some of the criminal penalties-particularly sub- section (d)-depart significantly from most existing statutes. Most statutes provide penalties for inten- tional conduct that actually causes the death of a declarant, and define such conduct as murder or a high degree felony. The Act does not take this ap- proach. Assuming that such conduct will already be covered by a state's criminal statutes, the Act only addresses the situations in which the actor willfully falsifies or forges the declaration of another or con ceals or withholds knowledge of revocation. To be criminally sanctioned as a misdemeanor under the Act the circumscribed conduct need not cause the death of a declarant. The approach taken by moststates, that of providing a felony penalty for those acts that actually caused death. was considered un- necessary, as existing criminal law will also apply pursuant to Section 9(g). A specific penalty for the conduct described in Section 9(d). however, was deemed appropriate, as existing criminal codes may not adequately address it. \u00a7 10. Miscellaneous Provisions (a) Death resulting from the withholding or with- drawal of life-sustaining treatment pursuant to a dec- laration and in accordance with this [Act) does not constitute. for any purpose a suicide or homicide. (b) The making of a declaration pursuant to Sec- tion 2 does not affect in any manner the sale, pro- curement. or issuance of any policy of life insurance or annuit. nor does it affect, impair, or modify the terms of an existing policy of life insurance or annu- ity. A policy of life insurance or annuity is not legally impaired or invalidated in any manner by the with- holding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from an insured qualified patient. notwithstanding any term to the contrary. (c) A person may not prohibit or require the exe- cution of a declaration as a condition for being in- sured for, or receiving, health-care services. (d) This [Act] creates no presumption concerning the intention of an individual who has revoked or has not executed a declaration with respect to the use, withholding. or withdrawal of life-sustaining treat- ment in the event of a terminal condition. (e) This [Act] does not affect the right of a patient to make decisions regarding use of life-sustaining treatment, so long as the patient is able to do so, or impair or supersede any right or responsibility that a person has to effect the withholding or withdrawal of medical care. (f This [Act] does not require any physician or other health-care provider to take any action con- trary to reasonable medical standards. (g) This [Act] does not condone, authorize, or ap- prove mercy-killing or euthanasia. \u00a7 11. When Health-Care Provider May Pre- sume Validity of Declaration In the absence of knowledge to the contrary. a physician or other health-care provider may pre- sume that 2 declaration complies with this [Act] and is valid. \u00a7 12. Recognition of Declaration Executed in Another State A declaration executed in another state in corn- pliance with the law of that state or of this State is validly executed for purposes of this [Act]. COMMENT Section 12 provides that a declaration executed in another state, which meets the execution require- ments of that other state or the enacting state (adult. two witnesses, voluntary), is to be treated as validly executed in the enacting state, but its operation in the enacting state shall be subject to the substantive policies in the enacting state's law. \u00a7 13. Effect of Previous Declaration An instrument executed before the effective date of this [Actj which substantially complies with Sec- tion 2(a) must be given effect pursuant to the pro- visions of this [Act]. \u00a7 14.

Where the perfor- mance of one duty conflicts with the other, the choice of the patient, or his family or legal represen- tative if the patient is incompetent to act in his own behalf, should prevail. In the absence of the patiens choice or an authorized proxy, the physician must act in the best interest of the patient. For humane reasons. with informed consent. a physician may do what is medically necessary to alle- viate severe pain, or cease or omit treatment to per- mit a terminally ill patient whose death is imminent to die. However, he should not intentionally cause death. In deciding whether the administration of potentially life-prolonging medical treatment is in the best interest of the patient who is incompetent to act in his own behalf, the physician should determine what the possibility is for extending life underhumane and comfortable conditions and what are the prior expressed wishes of the patient and atti- tudes of the family or those who have responsibility for the custody of the patient. Even if death is not imminent but a p2tient's coma is beyond doubt irreversible and there are adequate safeguards to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and with the concurrence of those who have respon- sibility for the care of the patient, it is not unethical to discontinue all means of life prolonging medical treatment. Life prolonging medical treatment includes medi- cation and artificially or technologically supplied respiration, nutrition or hydration. In treating a ter- minally ill or irreversibly comatose patient, the physician should determine whether the benefits of treatment outweigh its burdens. At all times, the dignity of the patient should be maintained. 78 AIPPIENDIX RI VXIEWS OF Health Care Association (AHCA), representing over 8,000 nursing homes caring for more than 800, 000 infirm elderly convalescent and chronically ill individuals ofall ages, has developed this polio on health care dectsionmaking in order to state its position on these issues, raise questions of public policy and provide guidance to state af- filiates and member facilities. This policy makes recommendations for consid- eration by state affiliates and individual facilities. However. because of wide differences in state law and the rapidly' changing state of the lauw within jurisdictions, it does not attempt to provide specific guidance and should be considered onlY as a start- ing point in the development of specific policies and procedures. Introduction Health care treatment decisions, frequently with life and death implications, are made in long term care facilities on a daily basis. The American Health Care Association (AHCA) believes that the issues and problems accompanying the decisionmaking process are too important to be ignored; they must be dis- cussed and resolved openly. Realizing that these issues should most appropriately be resolved at the state level. AHCA has developed this policy to assist its state affiliates and member facilities in developing their own policies and promoting resolution of these issues. In this statement, AHCA highlights legal and public policy issues which must be considered, and discusses specific procedural matters that should be addressed in facility policies and procedures. AHCA believes that state laws addressing these issues should specify decisionmaking procedures and identify, in broad terms, circumstances in which such proce- dures may be used. Such laws should not, however, attempt to define the precise conditions (such as \"when death is imminent\" or \"in a persistent vegetative state\") when the specified procedures may be used. Facility policies and procedures should provide for prompt. orderly and informed decisionmaking. Among other things, they should recognize residents' competence, provide efficiently and appropriatelyfor opportunities to designate surrogates, ensure that residents are adequately informed and their rights are protected and where appropriate, provide for review of decisionmaking. Procedures must also ensure ade- quatc documentation throughout the process. The role of state affiliates will vary. In some cases, they may play a primary role in facilitating public dis- cussion and presenting issues to state legislators and administrative officials. In others, they may choose to coordinate the development of policies and proce- dures that can be adopted by individual facilities. While recognizing the importance of the state af- filiate's role, this document focuses on facility policies and procedures, for it is the individual facil- ity that is directly involved in and potentially respon- sible for the ways in which health care decisions are made by and for its residents. In developing policies and procedures, state affili- ates and individual facilities should also consider state statutory and case law, ethical codes and prac- tice rules for the professionals involved in the deci- sionmaking process, the impact of residents' reli- gious beliefs and, of course, in religiously affiliated facilities, the tenets of the applicable religious orga- nization. Specific facility or corporate priorities and policies should also be considered, as well as the ad- vice of legal counsel knowledgeable about health care issues. I. Overview A. Public Concern Recently, public interest in and concern about health care treatment decisions, especially those with immediate life and death implications, have in- creased markedly. Coverage in the media has in- cluded reporting of judicial decisions and interviews with an assortment of legal, medical and ethical authorities. Additionally, numerous treatises and other scholarly works have addressed the significant legal and moral aspects of the issue. Part of the reason for increased public concern in this area is that medical technology has made it possi- ble to sustain life in circumstances that would have been incomprehensible even ten years ago. As a re- sult, society is now asking whether it is always neces- sary to do all that is technologically possible to sustain life, and. if not. who has authority to make decisions, what criteria should be applied, and what processes should be used. These questions apply to 2 wide variety of circumstances involving severely handicapped newborns. apparently healthy adults who suffer cardiac arrest or accidental brain injury. and elderly, severely debilitated individuals with multiple illnesses and other problems. Many long term care facility residents fall into the last category. The average resident is 84 years old has multiple diagnoses. and requires assistance in three or more activities of daily living. Approxi. mately 50 percent also suffer from some degree of impairment of their mental or decisionmaking capac- ities. Many have outlived family or close friends who might otherwise participate or assist in making health care decisions. These factors not only require that the policies and procedures for decisionmaking in long term care facilities he somewhat different from those used in other settings, but they render all the more critical the need for such policies and procedures. B. Provider Roles Although health care decisionmaking traditionally has been viewed as the responsibility of physicians. there has been an increasing use of a \"team\" ap- proach, aimed toward collaboration with patients themselves. Without displacing the continuing need for compassionate, professional judgments by physi- cians, long term care facilities and their staffs have important responsibilities in facilitating and, where necessary, participating in sound, informed decision- making with residents, their families, friends and guardians. Although no staff member should be per- mitted to assume responsibility for individual deci- sions, the important role often played by staff should be recognized in facility policies and procedures. In reviewing the following materials, long term care facilities should consider the existence and 2de- quacy of their current procedures regarding all treat- ment decisions. They should seek not only to de- velop, refine and improve existing procedures, but also to aid in increasing public awareness of issues in- volved in health care decisionmaking. By giving thoughtful attention to their own policies and pro- cedures and the need for public directives, long term care providers can do much to facilitate medically and ethically appropriate decisionmaking for all individuals. C. Categories of Decisions For purposes of this discussion, treatment deci- sions can be divided into three categories; routine,non-routine and \"life and death.\" While the same basic principlcs arc applicabic to all three. categoriza- tion is useful both for discussion purposes and to en- sure adequate protection of all those involved in and affected by the decisionmaking process. Routine de- cisions, including those regarding most medications and non-invasive procedures, present few problems. Most long term care facility residents anticipate and accept as a matter of course routine and necessary treatment such as dressing changes, mild analgesics, or medication to regulate heart rate. Non-routine decisions concern invasive pro- cedures, such as any surgical procedure and adminis- tration of medications that have the potential for ma- jor effects on physical and mental conditions. These require that facilities observe additional procedures in terms of obtaining specific consent. Treatment decisions with \"life and death \" implic- tions have significant short-range effects on life ex- pectancy; they are often the most difficult for resi- dents and facilities alike. This can be due to the nature of the treatment, the uncertainty of its effects, or other factors in the resident's condition. For ex- ample, when an individual is suffering from a ter- minal disease, radical treatment for another illness may not be desirable or appropriate, even though not treating may result in an earlier death. II. Legal Issues The following sections provide an overview of the legal considerations involved in health care decision- making and the specific issues confronted by pro- viders in individual cases. Again, state law will generally determine procedural decisionmaking re- quirements for each jurisdiction. A. Informed Consent The doctrine of informed consent speaks to an ideal of how medical decisionmaking between pa- tient and physician should be conducted. On the one hand, the physician can bring to bear expertise in ex- plaining a particular diagnosis or type of treatment. The patient on the other hand, knows his or her goals. values and ability to endure treatment. Through a collaborative process, these two types of expertise can be combined, resulting. ideally. in the best decision for a particular patient. The legal doc- trine of informed consent, seeking to encourage in- dividual autonomy and rational decisionmaking. re- quires full disclosure of information to patients, and the obtaining of patients' permission prior to specific procedures being performed. In general, a competent person has the right to re- fuse medical treatment in appropriate circumstances, determined by balancing the individual's interests in self-determination against countervailing state in- terests, particularly the state's interest in preserving life. Other state interests include the protection of third parties who may be dependent on the individ- ual refusing treatment, the prevention of suicide, and the preservation of ethical integrity of the medical profession. The right to refuse life-sustaining treat- ment generally follows the precepts of the informed consent doctrine. B. Competency An individual must be presumed competent and able to make informed decisions unless he or she is determined, according to applicable law, to be in- competent. Incompetence comprises an established exception to the informed consent doctrine. Unfor tunately. little judicial guidance exists to define in- competency or to establish applicable standards. Ad- ditionally, doctrines regarding incompetency and guardianship often make no provision for the in- dividual who is questionably competent or exhibits intermittent or limited decisionmaking impairment. For purposes of this discussion, competency or deci- sionmaking capacity can be defined in terms of an in- dividual's capability to understand information rele- vant to the medical decision at hand, and to reason about relevant alternatives against a background of stable personal values and life goals. (President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. Making Health Care Decisions. Washington, D.C.: 1981.) An advance directive is an oral or written instruc- tion prepared by an individual concerning his or her health care in the event of later loss of competence or decisionmaking capacity. Some states have enacted statutes prescribing standards applicable to advance directives. \"Living wills.\" for example, are a type of advance directive, as are durable powers of attorney which name persons with authority to make medical decisions on another's behalf. State law will deter- mine the validity of a particular advance directive in each case. In states in which living wills or similar documents are legislatively authorized or judicially considered as valid. the wishes of the individual, as stated in these documents, will generally be honored, even if the individual is incompetent at the time the treatment decision must be made. C. Surrogates For individuals who are unable to be responsible for making their own decisions and who have not previously expressed their wishes by legally accep- table means, a surrogate decisionmaking process isrequired. A surrogate decisionmaker, for purposes of this discussion, is anyone who has the legal authorityto make health care decisions for another, such as the court-appointed guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent or the attorney-in-fact named in a durable power of attorney. Using the categorization of treatment decisions referenced previously, a guardian generally may make \"routine\" and \"non-routine\" medical decisions independently. An attorney-in-fact may make decisions specifically authorized or permitted by law. For \"life and death\" and other specified treatment decisions, special pro- cedures or specific authority typically are required, although several states permit designation of a sur- rogate to make all such decisions. Often, long term care facilities must address the question of decisionmaking for a questionably com- petent (or apparently incompetent) resident who has not executed a durable power of attorney and for whom a guardian has not been appointed. Unless state law specifically permits decisionmaking. under these circumstances, by a family member or other in- dividual, facilities often have no alternative other than to seek judicial direction when particularly in- vasive \"non-routine\" or \"life and death\" decisions must be made, while depending upon an informal process, involving family or friends, for \"routine\" or some non-invasive \"non-routine\" decisions. When a durable power of attorney has been ex- ecuted, the question often arises as to when the in- dividual has become sufficiently incapable of making decisions so as to require the attorney-in-fact to exer- cise his authority. Often the person is not sufficiently impaired to be legally incompetent, and the impair- ment itself may be intermittent or selective so that decisionmaking ability varies from time to time or situation to situation If the individual is included in the decisionmaking process and if his or her ex- pressed wishes and the decision of the attorey-in- fact are compatible, no problems should arise. If, however, there is disagreement, the differences must be reconciled before a valid decision can be made. In this case, judicial resolution may be required. Judicial proceedings may also be necessary when any interested person questions the decision of the surrogate or when a decision must be made which is beyond the scope of the surrogate's authority. In some jurisdictions, an institutional ethics or over- sight committee may reconcile differences and make or approve treatment decisions. In any type of sur- rogate decisionmaking, the wishes of the individual should be ascertained whenever possible and, when known, should be given great weight. In general, the more significant the decision, the greater the need for understanding and agreement among those in, volved in and affected by it. III. Developin3 Policies and Procedures A. The Policy Development Process As noted, facilities must address, in both the long and short-term, development of policies and proce- dures which ensure legally, medically and ethically sound decisionmaking. Long term resolution will generally require state legislative action. In order to achieve passage of appropriate laws, legislators, special interest groups, and the public must be in- formed of issues and given opportunity to discuss them and otherwise participate in the legislative development process. Because health care providers are knowledgeable about the broad spectrum of these issues, they should participate actively in the information dissemination, discussion and legislative development processes. While meeting their long-range responsibility, pro- viders can and should develop policies and proce- dures for present use. These must conform with existing state law, protect residents for whom deci- sions must be made, and be satisfactory to families, staff and others interested in and affected by those decisions. At the outset, facilities should consider involving individuals from outside the facility in the policy development process. Valuable input may be ob- tained from representatives of the community, con- sumer advocacy organizations, the long term care ombudsman program, professional groups that pro- vide services in the facility. residents and their families, clergy, attorneys, scholars and facility staff, Facilities should also be familiar with the policies and procedures of other institutional health care pro- viders in their communities and states. Goals should be clearly defined so that all involved in the process understand and accept them. Those involved should be assigned responsibilities for writing, consulting and reviewing the policies as they are developed. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that those individuals who will be affected by the policies and procedures are able to provide comments. Facil- ity policy should also address the need for initial and continued staff education at all levels. Finally, pro- vision should be made for review, by legal counsel experienced in health care issues, of any policy prior to its adoption and implementation. B. Interests to be Considered Before developing specific procedures to be fol- lowed, the drafters of facility policies must consider the framework within which health care decisionsaffecting residents will be made and the interests of the respective parties involved in any given decision: the resident, the facility, the resident's family and society as a whole. Legal concerns must also be addressed. The interests of the individual most affected by health care decisions-the resident-must be consid- ered first. Residents' rights, as defined by state and federal law and regulations, include the right to ap- propriate treatment, to be fully informed of and par- ticipate in decisions involving treatment, and to have one's dignity and wishes respected. The constitu- tional right to privacy includes the right to control one's own body, with decisions based upon the indi- vidual's beliefs, values and desires. Health care providers-facility owners, adminis- trators and staff, physicians and other involved pro- fessionals-also have interests that must be con- sidered in drafting facility decisionmaking policies. These interests include personal values and beliefs, professional codes of ethics, applicable laws, the allocation of health care resources, the commitment to provide care and concerns about insurance cover- age and legal liability. Also to be considered in the drafting process are family concerns, including the welfare of loved ones, the family's relationship with the resident and per- sonal values. As noted previously, society as a whole has an in- terest in cumulative and long-range Implications of medical decisions, their financial and ethical costs, equitable resource allocation and the decisionmaking processes used. Finally, legal concerns accompanying any medical decisions include the existence of applicable and ap- propriate law and its orderly, consistent interpreta- tion and application. Identification of applicable criteria and acceptable procedures are essential com- ponents of such laws. C. Specific Issues to be Addressed Policies should identify those responsible for in- itiating and implementing decisionmaking proce- dures, methods for designating surrogates and ren- dering decisions, and the events (such as change in resident condition) that require initiation of any for- malized review process. The following issues should be considered. 1. Specific decision categories: Procedures should be developed for each category of medical decision to be made in the long term care facility, including identification of medical and other staff involved, procedures to be followed if disagreement exists, and documentation required in each case. Again, it should be emphasized that, in each category, the competent resident's decision generally will control and that the wishes of the questionably competent or judicially declared incompetent resident should, whenever possible, be ascertained and given great weight in the decisionmaking process. a. Routine treatment decisions. Procedures for routine treatment decisions need not be unnecessarily involved or prolonged. Often, a general consent signed at the time of ad- mission will be sufficient authority for the provision of simple treatments and medica- tions. Facilities should, however, make every effort to ensure that even the simplest treatments and medications are not ini- tiated, modified or terminated without in- forming residents or, if necessary, families and surrogates and giving them opportunity to consent or object to the proposed treat- ment or medication. Often the charge nurse. after consulting with the physician, can per- form this task. b. Non-routine treatment decisions: For deci- sions other than routine decisions, the phy- sician should be responsible for obtaining specific consent. In some cases, a notation on the chart will be sufficient documenta- tion. In others, depending upon state law, written consent must be obtained from the competent resident or, for an incompetent or questionably competent resident, from the surrogate decisionmaker. c. \"Life and death\" treatment decisions: For life and death treatment decisions, precise and thorough procedures addressing the issues described below should be estab- lished. i. Disclosure and consent: Facility pro- cedures should assign one individual primary responsibility for providing in- formation to the resident and/or the sur- rogate decisionmaker and eliciting their opinions. Generally, this person should be the attending physician, although nursing staff may provide reinforcement and support to the resident and family. ii. Decisions to u'itbbold treatment Facil- ity procedures should identify specific criteria, such as patient condition or prognosis, that must be considered in making decisions not to treat or to cease treatment. For example, a policy might require, as a prerequisite to withholding treatment, that the physician make aspecific determination that a resident is terminally ill or in a medically hopeless condition, that little improvement or benefit can be expected from the treat- ment being considered and/or that the benefit of a given treatment is out- weighed by the burdens it would im- pose. iii. Evaluation criteria: Facility procedures should set forth criteria for evaluating the relative benefits and burdens of the treatment being considered. For exam- ple, surgery that is not expected to pro- long life may be appropriate if it will relieve pain significantly. Conversely, it may be inappropriate to initiate or con- tinue a treatment that can only extend for a short period of time the life of an individual who is in great pain. if the pain cannot be relieved. iv. Review ofprior decisions: Facility pro- cedures should address circumstances and time frames for review of decisions to withhold treatment or initiate treat- ment, including a provision for periodic review and reevaluation. Marked change in a resident's mental or physical condi- tion will require review of previous de- cisions. Even when an individual has executed an advance directive, periodic review should take place to ascertain that the individual's wishes have not changed. v. Documentation: Facility procedures should set forth the amount and kind of documentation to be required in spe- cific instances of life and death decision- making. At minimum, the record should document discussions with the resident. family and any surrogate decisionmaker: the participants in and results of team conferences; the resident's continuing physical and mental condition; and the evaluation of treatments being con- sidered. 2. Decisionmakers Facility procedures should identify the categories of individuals who may ap- propriately be involved in the decisionm2king pro- cess, including the attending physician, surrogate decisionmaker, the resident's clergyman or a long term care ombudsman representative. The attending physician has responsibility for informing residents and their families about treatment choices. If a team or committee will be utilized, procedures should specify the composition, scope, responsibility and authority of the committee in conformance with state law. The process must be flexible enough to permit decisionmaking in varied situations. Facility staff should not be responsible for informing resi- dents and their families of treatment choices or for participatirng in the actual decision. They may, how- ever, upon request, present information in response to the concerns of those having responsibility. D. Implementing the Decislonmaking Proce- dures Incident to admission, the resident, family or guardian should be informed of the facility's policy and procedures. The policy may provide for the dis- semination of information regarding durable powers of attorney and, if state law permits, the execution and application of living wills and similar docu- ments. Although the facility should neither encour- age nor be actively involved in execution of these documents. copies should be obtained and placed in the medical record. Often, when state law does not specifically provide for living wills. courts will give great deference to the wishes of the individual ex- pressed in such a document-clearly a benefit to the facility faced with difficult decisions concerning an incompetent or questionably competent resident. Documentation of expressed wishes of the resident, family or guardian should also be included in the medical record. Additionally, the medical record should contain sufficient information so that the pro- cedures to be followed are current and clear. Overall, facility policies concerning medical deci- sionmaking generally, and \"life and death decision- making in particular, should be clear, explicit andconsistently applied. While the professionals involved in the actual deci- sionmaking process may understand the reasoning involved, many staff members will need special help in understanding why and how these decisions are made. Facility policies should be flexible enough to account for individual circumstances and staff should be given sufficient information to understand the differences. Direct care staff, in particular, will need careful training and continued support to carry out \"com- fort measures only' or supportive care plans. Physi- cians' orders that include detailed components of a supportive care plan for the individual resident should be required by the facility's procedures. Under no circumstances should it be possible to in- fer that the resident for whom supportive care only is appropriate has been abandoned by the health care team or the facility. Conclusion In summary, changing medical technology and in- creased capacity to prolong life are presenting health care providers with new responsibilities and oppor- tunities. Providers will have the opportunity to par- ticipate in shaping public policy and law concerning health care decisionmaking. However, they are well advised to first fulfill their responsibilities to develop appropriate procedures to aid in prompt, orderly and informed decisionmaking within their own facilities. Only by striving to develop and follow legally, medi- cally and ethically sound practices will providers be able to adapt to continued changes, and provide the best possible care for their residents.

PlOILlCYf AND STAflEM(EM7 The Patient's Choice of Treament Options Policy Health care decision making should be based on a collaborative relationship between the patient and the physician and/or other health care professionals who are primarily responsible for the patient's care.* The collaborative framework encourages communication, which contributes to sound decision making. When- ever possible, however, the authority to determine the course of treatment, if any. should rest with the patient, who may choose to delegate it. In the hospital setting, institutional methods should be established to reasonably assure that the patient may exercise this authority on the basis of relevant information necessary to make a sufficientiv voluntars and informed decision. In addition, the health care institution should have methods to identify circumstances under which the patient's authority may be constrained, and recourse to the judgment of others, including the courts, is appropriate.

This process requires the patient's adequately- informed consent and may involve an evaluation of the patient's capacity to make a decision. Collaborative Decision Making Informed consent should reflect shared or collabora- tise decision making by the patient and the physician. The physician should provide information on the pa- tient's condition, the recommended procedure and/or treatment with its significant benefits and risks, the significant alternatives for care or treatment (including no specific treatment), and the likely duration of in- capacitation, if any.t Because patient's understanding of this information is essential to informed consent, care should be taken to present it in language familiar to them. Although institutional policy should promote documentation of consent decisions, such documenta- tion is evidence of but not a substitute for communica tion and understanding between patient and physician. Unless the physician believes the patient would object. it may be advisable and useful if this information is shared with the patient's family, which often is a valuable resource for both the patient and the physi- cian. Health care institutions and professionals should see to it that patients have access to understandable in- formation relevant to the treatment choices before them. In cases where the patient has chosen to delegate the treatment choice selection to the physician or someone else, a discussion with the patient about the implications and ramifications of the treatment course to be pursued is still recommended. Often family and friends should be included in this discussion. In some emergencies. obtaining voluntary and ade- quately informed consent may not be possible or may be detrimental to the patient's well-being. In such cases, the patient's consent to the course of treatment chosen by a physician may be legally im- plied from the urgent circumstances surrounding the provision of that care. tSee the AHA Policy on A Palients Bill of Rights. Implications of Treatment Choice The right to choose treatment includes the right to refuse a specific treatment or all treatment, or select an alternative form of treatment. If the patient de- cides to refuse all treatment, a written informed refusal is strongly recommended to protect the hos- pital, the physicians, and all other personnel from lia- bility. if any, for failure to furnish treatment. This decision should also be documented on the patient's chart. If a patient chooses a course of treatment that is not acceptable to the attending physicians or other health care professionals, those individuals may withdraw from the case, so long as doing so does not amount to legal abandonment. If a suitably qualified alternative physician or health care professional will- ing to comply with the patient's preference is avail- able, transfer to the care of that individual should be offered to the patient. If no physician or qualified health care professional is willing to undertake the patient's choice of treatment, the hospital should have a policy to address what procedures relative to care of the patient should be followed. The hospital also should have a policy to help identify and address those situations when the course of treatment selected is unacceptable to the mission of the institu- tion. Laws regarding the right of a patient or someone on the patient's behalf to refuse treatment vary from state to state. Some state laws limit a patient's right to refuse treatment, and others make provisions to facil- itate the exercise of this right. The hospital's and the physician's response to a refusal, whether action or nonaction, must be consistent with applicabic law. If a refusal can potentially result in substantial detri- ment to the patient's health and well-being. institu- tions should require that the appropriate administra- tive authority be informed. Protection of the patient's authority to select treatment at times may require either legal counsel or judicial proceedings. Decision-Making Capacity Decision-making capacity is the ability to make choices that reflect an understanding and apprecia- tion of the nature and consequences of one's actions. Attention should be paid to the difference between decision-making capacity and legal competency. De- cision-making capacity may exist, as in the case of a minor, where no legal competency exists. Legal com- petency may exist where decision-making capacity does not, as in the case of a temporarily impaired adult who has not been deemed legally incompetent. In health care treatment decisions, decision-makingcapacity is best understood as the patient's ability to understand the nature and effects of treatment op- tions, and appreciate the impact of a choice. Only when the patient's capacity to make decisions is definitely impaired and the effect of flawed decision making is potentially serious should the patient's right and responsibility for decision making be transferred to others. When there is reason to doubt the usual presump- tion of adequate decision-making capacity, an assess- ment of capacity is made by the physician in consul- tation with the family, friends. nurses, and other health care professionals. The institution should have effective policies to facilitate assessment of patients' decision-making capacity. The institution should have methods to ensure that the physician conducts these assessments when necessary. The hospital should also see to it that there are accessible and practical avenues b y which concerns about a patient's capacity to make decisions may be raised by others, including family. friends. nurses, and other health care professionals. The hospital may also wish to have a policy under which a patient, in ap- propriate circumstances, should be informed both of any concerns raised by the assessment and of access to procedures for reassessment or to legal counsel. Only when the determination regarding decision- making capacity is controversial among concerned persons (including the patient) should legal guardian- ship proceedings be required. When a patient lacks adequate decision-making ca- pacity, substantial effort should be made to ensure that the choice of medical treatment is consistent with the known views of patient. The decision makers must seek and take note of any information reflected in oral statements, life-style commitments, living wills, and so forth made by the patient before deterioration of decision-making capacity. These known views can sometimes be supplied by the fam- ily or an individual acting as surrogate. The surrogate should be a person or group of persons most likely to be able to advocate on the patient's behalf and to assess the patient's preferences and experiences. If the physician knows through informal communica- tions, durable power of attorney. or living will of the patient's designation of a surrogate, that person should serve unless mitigating factors are apparent. If the selection of the surrogate seems controver- sial, methods for institutional review and, if necessary, court adjudication are required. In some cases, court appointment of a surrogate may be legally required. The institution should be prepared to refer difficult cases to court for guardianship determinations. Role of Minors in Decision Making Patients who are minors should be allowed to par- ticipate in decision-making about their care to the ex- tent possible with regard to their capacity to under- stand treatment options and outcomes. When a minor is deemed legally incapable of mak- ing a decision, that is, not considered to be a 'mature\" or \"emancipated' minor according to state law, the parent or legal guardian usually will have the final decision-making authority. Mature or emancipated minors, as determined by state law, should be treated as adults with decision-making capacity. Institutions should establish policies concerning the circumstances under which legal advice is to be sought for either the institution or the minor, in- cluding cases where a parent or guardian makes a decision that may be deemed adverse to the interests of a minor or opposed to the expressed views of a relatively mature minor. Management Practices and Procedures Hospitals have a responsibility to assess the effect of management practices and procedures on patient decision-making options and to foster awareness among health care professionals and key hospitalpersonnel that some institutional practices necessary to ensure efficiency, such as some admissions or food service procedures, can unintentionally limit patient choices. For example, the patient often does not have the opportunity to make many of the routine choices in d2y-to-day living-when to have meals, wake up, have visitors, etc. Documentation of Decision Making Documentation of decisions regarding patient treatment promotes orderly procedures and more thorough consideration of options. Documentation also provides legal protection for and is often in the best interests of patients, patients' families, con- cerned health professionals, and hospitals. Conclusion The patients role in determining the course of their medical treatment must be ensured in the in- stitutional setting. Although these decisions should be made in collaboration with the attending physi- cians. the hospital must take a leadership role in en suring institutional practices that support patients decision making and in identifying when recourse to the judgment of others is necessary. .87 APPENDIX K UNIFORM ANATOMICAL GIFT ACT An Act authorizing the gift of all or part of a human body after death for specified purposes. 1968 ACT Sec. 1.

The document, which may be a card designed to be carried on the person, must be signed by the donor [in the presence of 2 witnesses who must sign the document in his presence]. If the donor cannot sign, the document may be signed for him at his direction and in his presence in the presence of 2 witnesses who must sign the document in his pres- ence. Delivery of the document of gift during the donor's lifetime is not necessary to make the gift valid. (c) The gift may be made to a specified donee or without specifying a donee. If the latter, the gift may be accepted by the attending physician as donee upon or following death, If the gift is made to a specified donee who is not available at the time and place of death, the attending physician upon or following death, in the absence of any expressed in- dication that the donor desired otherwise, may ac- ccpt the gift as donee. The physician who becomes a donee under this subsection shall not participate in the procedures for removing or transplanting a part. (d) Notwithstanding Section 7(b). the donor may designate in his will, card, or other document of gift the surgeon or physician to carry out the appropriate procedures. In the absence of a designation or if the designee is not available, the donee or other person authorized to accept the gift may employ or author- ize any surgeon or physician for the purpose. (e) Any gift by a person designated in Section 2(b) shall be made by a document signed by him or made by his telegraphic, recorded telephonic, or other recorded message.Anatomical Gift by a Liting Donor I am of sound mind and 18 years or more of age.

Although the practice of Individ- ual signatories may vary slightly, signatories agree on the acceptability of these guidelines: Jesse Barber, MD; Don Becker, MD; Richard Behrman, MD, JD; Donald R. Bennett, MD; Richard Beresford, MD, JD; Reginald Bickford, MD; William A. Jr., MD; Benjamin Boshes, MD, PhD; Philip Braunstein, MD; JD; Butler, MD; John Caronna.

Henry, PhD; John Hughes, MD, PhD, DM; Howard Kaufman, MD; MD, Don Harper Schlesinger, Selby, MD; Barry Tharp, MD; Fernando Torres, Earl Arthur Jack Whisnant, MD; Robert Wilkus, MD; and HarryZimmerman, MD. The preparation of this report was facilitated by the President's Commission but the guidelines have not been passed on by the Commission and are not intended as matters for governmental review or adoption. The advent of effective artificial cardiopulmonary support for severely brain-injured persons has created some confusion during the past several decades about the determination of death. Previ- ously, loss of heart and lung functions was an easily observable and sufficient basis for diagnosing death,whether the initial failure occurred in the brain, the heart and lungs, or elsewhere in the body. Irrevers- ible failure of either the heart and lungs or the brain precluded the continued functioning of the other. Now, however, circulation and respiration can be maintained by means of a mechanical respirator and other medical interventions, despite a loss of all brain functions. In these circumstances, we recognize as dead an individual whose loss of brain functions is complete and irreversible. To recognize reliably that death has occurred, ac- curate criteria must be available for physicians' use. These now fall into two groups, to be applied de- pending on the clinical situation. When respiration and circulation have irreversibly ceased, there is no need to assess brain functions directly. When cardio- pulmonary functions are artificially maintained, neurological criteria must be used to assess whether brain functions have ceased irreversibly. More than half of the states now recognize, through statutes or judicial decisions, that death may be determined on the basis of irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain. Law in the remaining states has not yet departed from the older, common- law view that death has not occurred until \"all vital functions\" (whether or not artificially maintained) have ceased. The language of the statutes has not been uniform from state to state, and the diversity of proposed and enacted laws has created substantial confusion. Consequently, the American Bar Asso- ciation, the American Medical Association, the Na- tional Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedi- cal and Behavioral Research have proposed the following model statute, intended for adoption in every jurisdiction: Source: Report by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 'Defining Death,\" U.S. Government Printing Office (1981 pages 159-166. UNIFORM DETERMINATION OF DEATH ACT An individual who has sustained either (1) irrevers- ible cessation of circulatory and respiratory func- tions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is dead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with accepted medical standards. This wording has also been endorsed by the Ameri- can Academy of Neurology and the American Elec- troencephalographic Society. The statute relics on the existence of \"accepted medical standards\" for determining that death has occurred. The medical profession, based on carefully conducted research and extensive clinical experi- ence, has found that death can be determined reliably by either cardiopulmonary or neurological criteria. The tests used for determining cessation of brain functions have changed and will continue to do so with the advent of new research and technologies. The \"Harvard criteria\" (JAMA 1968; 205:337-340) are widely accepted, but advances in recent years have led to the proposal of other criteria. As an aid to the implementation of the proposed uniform statute, we provide here one statement of currently accepted medical standards. INTRODUCTION The criteria that physicians use in determining that death has occurred should (1) eliminate errors in classifying a living individual as dead; (2) allow as few errors as possible in classifying a dead body as alive; (3) allow a determination to be made without unreasonable delay; (4) be adaptable to a variety of clinical situations; and (5) be explicit and accessible to verification. Because it would be undesirable for any guidelines to be mandated by legislation or regulation or to be inflexibly established in case law, the proposed Uni- form Determination of Death Act appropriately spec- ifies only \"accepted medical standards.\" Local, state, and national institutions and professional organiza- tions are encouraged to examine and publish their practices. The following guidelines represent a distillation of current practice in regard to the determination of death. Only the most commonly available and veri- fled tests have been included. The time of death recorded on 2 death certificate is at present a matter of local practice and is not covered in this document. These guidelines are advisory. Their successful use requires a competent and judicious physician, expe-rienced in clinical examination and the relevant pro- cedures. All periods of observation listed in these guidelines require the patient to be under the care of a physician. Considering the responsibility entailed in the determination of death, consultation is recom- mended when appropriate. The outline of the criteria is set forth below in boldface letters. The lightface text that follows each heading explains its meaning. In addition, the two sets of criteria (cardiopulmonary and neurological) are followed by 2 presentation of the major compli- cating conditions: drug and metabolic intoxication, hypothermia, young age, and shock. It is of para- mount importance that anyone referring to these guidelines be thoroughly familiar with the entire document, including explanatory notes and compli- cating conditions. THE CRITERIA FOR DETERMINATION OF DEATH An individual presenting the findings in either sec- tion A (cardiopulmonary) or section B (neurological) is dead. In either section, a diagnosis of death re- quires that both cessation of functions, as set forth in subsection 1, and irreversibility, as set forth in subsection 2, be demonstrated. A. An Individual with Irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions Is dead. 1. Cessaton is recognized by an appropriate clinical examination. Clinical examination will disclose at least the absence of responsiveness, heartbeat, and respiratory effort. Medical circumstances may require the use of confirmatory tests, such as an ECG. 2. Irreversibility is recognized by persistent cessation of functions during an appropriate period of observation and/or trial of therapy. In clinical situations where death is expected, where the course has been gradual, and where ir- regular agonal respiration or heartbeat finally ceases, the period of observation following the cessation may be only the few minutes required to complete the examination. Similarly, if resuscitation is not undertaken and ventricular fibrillation and standstill develop in a monitored patient, the required period of observation thereafter may be as short as a few minutes. When a possible death is unobserved, unex- pected. or sudden, the examination may need to be more detailed and repeated over a longer period, while appropriate resuscitative effort is maintained as a test of cardiovascular responsiveness. Diagnosis in individuals who are first observed with rigor mor- tis or putrefaction may require only the observation period necessary to establish that fact. B. An Individual with Irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, Including the brain stem, Is dead. The \"functions of the en- tire brain\" that are relevant to the diagnosis are those that are clinically ascertainable. Where indicated, the clinical diagnosis is subject to confirmation by lab- oratory tests, as described in the following portions of the text. Consultation with a physician experi- enced in this diagnosis is advisable. 1. Cessation Is recognized when evaluation discloses findings of a and b. a. Cerebral functions are absent, and ... There must be deep coma, that is, cerebral unre- ceptivity and unresponsivity. Medical circumstances may require the use of confirmatory studies such as an EEG or blood-flow study. b. brain stem functions are absent. Reliable testing of brain stem reflexes requires a perceptive and experienced physician using adequate stimuli. Pupillary light. corneal. oculocephalic. ocu- lovestibular, oropharyngeal, and respiratory (apnca) reflexes should be tested. When these reflexes can- not be adequately assessed, confirmatory tests are recommended. Adequate testing for apnea is very important. An accepted method is ventilation with pure oxygen or an oxygen and carbon dioxide mixture for ten min- utes before withdrawal of the ventilator, followed by passive flow of oxygen. (This procedure allows PaCOz to rise without hazardous hypoxia.) Hyper- carbi2 adequately stimulates respiratory effort within 30 seconds when PaCO, is greater than 60 nun Hg. A ten-minute period of apnea is usually sufficient to at- tain this level of hypercarbia. Testing of arterial blood gases can be used to confirm this level- Spon- taneous breathing efforts indicate that part of the brain stem is functioning. Peripheral nervous system activity and spinal cord reflexes may persist after death. True deccrebrate or decorticate posturing or seizures are inconsistent with the diagnosis of death. 2. Irreversibility Is recognized when evalua- tion discloses findings of a and b and c: a. The cause of coma is established and is suf- ficient to account for the loss of brain func- tions, and ... Most difficulties with the determination of death on the basis of neurological criteria have resulted from inadequate attention to this basic diagnostic prerequisite. In addition to a careful clinical cx- amination and investigation of history, relevantknowledge of causation may be acquired by com- puted tomographic scan, measurement of core tem- perature, drug screening, EEG, angiography, or other procedures. b. the possibility of recovery of any brain functions Is excluded, and ... The most important reversible conditions are seda- don, hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade, and shock. In the unusual circumstance where a suffi- cient cause cannot be established, irreversibility can be reliably inferred only after extensive evaluation for drug intoxication, extended observation. and other testing. A determination that blood flow to the brain is absent can be used to demonstrate a suffi- cient and irreversible condition. c. the cessation of all brain functions persists for an appropriate period of observation and/or trial of therapy. Even when coma is known to have started at an earlier time, the absence of all brain functions must be established by an experienced physician at the in- itiation of the observation period. The duration of observation periods is a matter of clinical judgment. and some physicians recommend shorter or longer periods than those given here. Except for patients with drug intoxication, hypo- thermia, young age, or shock, medical centers with substantial experience in diagnosing death neurologi- cally report no cases of brain functions returning following a six-hour cessation, documented by clinical examination and confirmatory EEG. In the absence of confirmatory tests, a period of observa- tion of at least 12 hours is recommended when an ir- reversible condition is well established. For anoxic brain damage where the extent of damage is more difficult to ascertain, observation for 24 hours is generally desirable. In anoxic injury, the observation period may be reduced if a test shows cessation of cerebral blood flow or if an EEG shows electrocere- bal silence in an adult patient without drug intoxica- tion, hypothermia, or shock. Confirmation of clinical findings by EEG is desirable when objective documentation is needed to substantiate the clinical findings. Electrocerebral silence verifies irreversible loss of cortical functions. except in patients with drug intoxication or hypo- thermia. (Important technical details are provided in \"Minimal Technical Standards for EEG Recording in Suspected Cerebral Death\" [Guidelines in EEG 1980. Atlanta, American Electrocncephalographic Society. 1980, section 4, pp. 19-241.) When joined with the clinical findings of absent brain stem functions, elec- trocerebral silence confirms the diagnosis. Complete cessation of circulation to the normo- thermic adult brain for more than ten minutes is in- compatible with survival of brain tissue. Documenta- tion of this circulatory failure is therefore evidence of death of the entire brain. Four-vessel intracranial angiography is definitive for diagnosing cessation of circulation to the entire brain (both cerebrum and posterior fossa) but entails substantial practical dif- ficulties and risks. Tests are available that assess cir- culation only in the cerebral hemispheres, namely radioisotope bolus cerebral angiography and gamma camera imaging with radioisotope cerebral angio- graphy. Without complicating conditions, absent cerebral blood flow as measured by these tests, in conjunction with the clinical determination of cessa- tion of all brain functions for at least six hours, is diagnostic of death. COMPLICATING CONDITIONS A. Drug and Metabolic Intoxication.-Drug intoxication is the most serious problem in the deter- mination of death. especially whcn multiple drugs are used. Cessation of brain functions caused by the sedative and anesthetic drugs. such as barbiturates. benzodiazepines, meprobamate, methaqualone, and trichloroethylene, may be completely reversible even though they produce clinical cessation of brain functions and electrocerebral silence. In cases where there is any likelihood of sedative presence, toxi- cology screening for all likely drugs is required. If exogenous intoxication is found. death may not be declared until the intoxicant is metabolized or intra- cranial circulation is tested and found to have ceased. Total paralysis may cause unresponsiveness, areflexia, and apnea that closely simulates death. Ex- posure to drugs such as neuromuscular blocking agents or aminoglycoside antibiotics, and diseases like myasthenia gravis are usually apparent by careful review of the history. Prolonged paralysis after use of succinylcholine chloride and related drugs re- quires evaluation for pseudocholinesterase defi- ciency. If there is any low-dose atropine electromyogram, peripheral nerve stim- ulation. EEG. tests of intracranial circulation, or ex-tended observation, as indicated, will make the diag- nosis clear. In drug-induced coma, EEG activity may return or persist while the patient remains unresponsive, and therefore the EEG may be an important evaluation along with extended observation. If the EEG shows electroccrcbral silence, short latency auditory or som2tosensory-cvoked potentials may be used to test brain stem functions. since these potentials are unlikely to be affected by drugs. Some severe illnesses (eg, hepatic encephalopathy, hyperosmolar coma, and preterminal uremia) can cause deep coma. Before irreversible cessation of brain functions can be determined, metabolic abnor- malities should be considered and, if possible, cor- rected. Confirmatory tests of circulation or EEG may be necessary. B. Hypothermia.-Criteria for reliable recogni- tion of death are not available in the presence of hypothermia (below 32.2 *C core temperature). The variables of cerebral circulation in hypothermic pa- tients are not sufficiently well studied to know whether tests of absent or diminished circulation are confirmatory. Hypothermia can mimic brain death by ordinary clinical criteria and can protect against neurological damage due to hypoxia. Further com- plications arise since hypothermia also usually precedes and follows death. If these complicating factors make it unclear whether an individual is alive, the only available measure to resolve the issue is to restore normothermia. Hypothermia is not a com- mon cause of difficulty in the determination of death. C. Children.-The brains of infants and young children have increased resistance to damage and may recover substantial functions even after ex- hibiting unresponsiveness on neurological examina- tion for longer periods compared with adults. Physi- cians should be particularly cautious in applying neurological criteria to determine death in children younger than 5 years. D. Shock.-Physicians should also be particu- larly cautious in applying neurological criteria to determine death in patients in shock because the reduction in cerebral circulation can render clinical examination and laboratory tests unreliable.
