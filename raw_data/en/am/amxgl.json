The symptoms changed, it was like an advent calendar, every day there was a surprise, something new. A muggy head; acutely painful calf; upset stomach; tinnitus; pins and all over; breathlessness; dizziness; arthritis in my hands; weird sensation in the skin with synthetic materials. Gentle exercise or walking made me worse - I would feel absolutely dreadful the next day . Paul Garner, Professor of I nfectious Diseases, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Nick Caputo, MD This article is g oing to go into quite a bit more depth than the one I posted the first of March, 2020 - nevertheless, it will not be nearly so complete as my work on the L yme-g roup of organisms. And while I will list a number of journal papers and articles in the reference section, it will be far less comprehensive than those included in my medical herbals. Still, this should give a decent overview with better complex ity about what is now known and how treatment can best be approached with herbal medicines. (Thoug h, of course, thing s will continue to develop as2 more is learned about SARS-CoV-2. . . . B tw, the virus that causes the infection is called SARS- CoV-2, the infection it causes is Covid-19, which I think is really stupid and confusing and serves no really useful purpose. However, Covid-19, as a number of ill-informed pundits have had it, does not mean that there were 18 Covids before 19. I t refers to the COronaVIrus Disease of 20 19, usually written COVI D-19.) Note: I promised my self after I finished the last of the five hig hly technical medical herbals I wrote that I would never do another one. Reg rettably , the coronavirus has necessitated a return to that world. W hen writing those books I spent six months, 6-10 hours a day , six days a week researching and integ rating the research until I achieved a holistic g estalt of the org anisms involved and the plants and protocols that could treat them. Given the state of thing s, I feel compelled to do thing s a bit more quickly with the coronavirus, as many in the medical community are doing , in order for people to have access to reality -based herbal protocols to help them throug h this pandemic we are ex periencing . What y ou are g etting here will lack the polishing and depth interconnectedness that is present in those other books. I n essence, this is pretty much what those other books looked like two months into the research and writing . I will update this as I can and as more information and insig ht on the virus is available. * * * * * As the coronavirus pandemic has ex tended its reach, much more has been learned about what it does and how it does it. W hat has been learned and what is being learned about the virus is presenting a far more frig htening picture of what we, as a species, are facing than what was first3 suspected. On a positive note, before I get further into how scary it is, herbal medicines (despite media hy steria on the subject) are q uite capable of treating this virus and the damag e it causes in the body - thoug h of course, as is alway s true, technolog ical medicine has a place in treating the virus as well, especially in its acute stag es. A Brief (and F rightening) Look at What We are F acing This particular virus, it is becoming clear, is far more dang erous than first believed. I t is also a great deal more ag gressive than influenz a, to which it has been erroneously compared. And further, it is far more complex and subtle in its actions and much more damag ing to the human body during infection than any pandemic respiratory pathog en since the 1918 influenz a. It combines the behavior of stealth pathog ens and their associated sy stemic effects (similar to organisms such as Borrelia , i.e., L yme disease) with that of some of the more deadly forms of influenz a. W hile primarily thoug ht of as a respiratory pathog en it is becoming clear that the nose/mouth/lung s are only the entry point for the org anism. I t often spreads outward from those locations, infecting and damag ing a wide variety of org ans in the body as it does so. This is especially true for those that show no sy mptoms of infection y et are positive for the virus. At this point in time the lung s, kidney s, heart, brain, GI tract, skin, and the blood cells/circulatory system are the main org ans affected. Twenty to fifty percent of people hospitaliz ed for Covid-19 have some form of heart damag e or arrhy thmias. About twenty percent have skin rashes. Sig nificant blood clotting is occurring throug hout the body for many people - this is probably the most serious common problem. As Dr. J effrey Laurence, a hematolog ist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City commented, \"The number of clotting problems I 'm4 seeing in the I CU, all related to Covid-19, is unprecedented. B lood clotting problems appear to be widespread in severe Covid.\" Worry ingly, many people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, without any other sy mptoms, have this kind of clotting but it is only being discovered after severe heart attack or stroke. Damag e to the endothelial cells (which are hig h in ACE2 receptors) which line blood vessels, veins, and arteries is far more common than suspected, even in those with mild or no symptoms. This is the main source of the clotting problems people ex perience . . . althoug h the inflammatory cascade that the virus initiates play s a part as well, as it often does in many different ty pes of microbial infections. In consequence, it's clear that in addition to the testing necessary to determine if people are infected, a blood test for D-dimer levels is crucial. D-dimer is a fibrin deg radation product that is present in the blood after clots are deg raded by fibrinoly sis in the body . Levels of D-dimer in the blood g ive a g ood indication of how pervasive clotting is, especially in those with no symptoms. (W ithout this, the only other test that can g ive an indication of problems is the use of an ox imeter which measures blood ox ygen levels. Healthy reading s should run around 98%. I f those levels beg in to decrease it indicates problems in lung /blood ox ygen ex chang e. (Ox imeters are very inexpensive and can be ordered online - it is a very good idea to g et one.) Neurolog ists removing large clots from the brains of fairly young people infected with the virus have found that as fast as they remove the clots, more form. Many of those who have died from the virus have been found to have hundreds if not thousands of tiny blood clots throug hout the lung s and, many times, in other org ans such as the brain and the kidney s. Damag e to the blood vessels close to the surface of the skin is the source of the rash that5 is now known to be relatively common in around 20% of those infected. I nfection of the GI tract can present merely as mild g astrointestinal upset, transient or continuing diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal pain. However, it has recently been discovered that damag e to the GI tract can be severe. Diag nostic imag ing of the GI tract of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 (even in those with no pulmonary symptoms) has found severe damag e to the bowel in a number people who were admitted to hospitals. Ex tensive clotting has led to the loss of circulation to portions of the bowel (ischemia) with portions of the bowel becoming necrotic (dead) in consequence. As Rajesh B hayana notes: \"Some finding s were ty pical of bowel ischemia, or dy ing bowel, and in those who had surg ery we saw small vessel clots beside areas of dead bowel\" (Palmer, 2020). This indicates that long term damag e to the bowel may occur during infection. There is no way , as yet, to determine the percentag e of people whose bowels are seriously affected as little diagnostic imag ing of this sort has occurred with Covid-19 patients. Half of the infected show sig ns of kidney damag e with up to a third needing temporary or permanent dialy sis; dialy sis catheters often clog with clots during treatment, itself a worry ing sign. Kidney failure is a common contributing factor to death from the virus. In the brain, ex cessive clotting is the source of the mild to severe strokes which sometimes occur in people, often with accompany ing slurring of speech and difficulty walking (some of the first sig ns). Serious strokes leading to necrotiz ing hemorrhag ic encephalopathy , incapacitation, and death are also being reported. B ut the impact on the neurolog ical sy stem can be far broader. Neurolog ical sy mptoms can run the g amut from mild to severe. Somewhere between one6 third and one half of the infected display some form of neurolog ical effects. These can be as mild as loss of smell or taste, muscle weakness, headache, nerve pain, depressed levels of consciousness, diz ziness, ting ling/fizzing sensation, hair and scalp pain, confusion, a sense of not being one's self or as serious as encephalitis, seiz ures, and long term mental impairment. This virus, like SARS-CoV-1, attaches to olfactory neurons in the nose. To infect neurons the virus doesn't utiliz e ACE2 but a different cellular receptor - CD147 - and from there spreads to the brain. (There is some confusion, aka arg ument, in the literature as to whether or not neurons ex press ACE2, some say yes, some say no, fisticuffs at 4 behind the play ground.) I t spreads outward from the olfactory bulb in the brain to reg ions closely affiliated with that initial site. Portions of the brain, as well as the brainstem and cerebral spinal fluid all show viral infection. Autopsies have found damag ed brain neurons and multi-focal lesions in the brain stem, cerebral white matter, and cerebellum. (I nfection of the cardiorespiratory center in the medulla, which has been found to occur, is possibly the reason for sudden respiratory failure in a number of the infected. This may also ex plain the ex tremely odd circumstance where some of the infected present with blood ox ygen levels as low as 50% - which should cause unconsciousness - show no sig ns of respiratory distress - aka \"happy hypoxia\".) There is no evidence y et of demy elination of the neural structures of the brain, something that often occurs with acute viral infections but the research on neurolog ical impacts is new. Such effects are often seen only weeks or months later. A number of specialists are sug gesting neurolog ical monitoring for some time, perhaps up to a y ear, after the virus is cleared from the body . Some of those who have recovered still show neurolog ical deficits which seems likely to7 be a continuing aspect of what is now becoming known as post-coronavirus sy ndrome (as are various forms of damag e to the kidney s, GI tract, heart, and lung s). Nearly all the infected show elevated liver enz ymes and there is some evidence of infection of the ACE2 receptors in the g all bladder ducts. B ut the data on how damag ing it is to the liver and g allbladder is very sparse at present; only two cases of severe hepatitis have y et been noted in the literature. However, many people, after infection, still show elevated liver enzymes. No one is quite sure why this is occurring . Post infection, the use of standardiz ed milk thistle seed to protect the liver and normaliz e its functioning is probably a very good idea. The virus does circulate throug h the spleen and ly mph sy stem but there is no data y et on whether it damag es that sy stem, or the bones, or pancreas, and so on. The virus has also been found in the testicles, which have a g reat many ACE2 receptors. Virus RNA has been found in semen but it is not known if it is infective. So, while there is some concern that it mig ht also spread via sex , it has not y et been proven. Still, there is some speculation about possible long term damag e to male fertility . Again something that will not be known for some time to come. I t is important to note here that until recently it was not known to seriously affect the kidney s, heart, GI tract, blood, or brain. Similarly to borrelial infections, early suspicions are arising that the virus may sequester itself in protected locations in the body only to re-emerg e later, after treatment has ceased and the infected person considered cured. There have been a sig nificant number of people who have recovered from infection only to later become positive for the virus, as y et no one knows why . (Nearly 200 people in South Korea who were considered cleared of the virus have tested positive once more; more are being found weekly .) 8 There are scores of people now, in the US and UK, who appear to have recovered only to \"relapse\" day s or weeks later. F urther, to make thing s worse, the sy mptom picture continually chang es, sometimes with every resurg ence. As Paul Garner, a professor of infectious diseases, comments in BMJ:Opinion (May 5, 2020), \"Every day there was a surprise, something new. . . . I spoke to others ex periencing weird sy mptoms, which were often discounted by those around them as anx iety, making them doubt themselves.\" (This is ty pical of those with recurring stealth- type infections - as many in the L yme community have discovered. They seem better, the disease resurg es, fatig ue and other sy mptoms recur and every one, including their doctors, default to \"it's all in y our head.) As he g oes on to say . . . The least helpful comments were from people who explained to me that I had post viral fatigue. I knew this was wrong. There was a pattern in that period from two weeks to six weeks: feeling absolutely dreadful during the day; sleep heavily, waking with the bed drenched in sweat; getting up with a blinding headache, receding during the day, turning me into a battered ragdoll in the evening. I joined a Facebook page ( Covid-19 Support Group ( have it/had it) ) full of people with these stories, some from the UK, some from the US. People suffering from the disease, but not believing their symptoms were real; their families thinking the symptoms were anxiety; employers telling people they had to return to work, as the two weeks for the illness was up. And the posts reflect this \"I thought I was going crazy for not getting better in their time frame\"; \"the doctor9 said there is zero reason to believe it lasts this long\". And too, people report that their families do not believe their ever changing symptoms, that it is psychological, it is the stress. As L uke Harding reports in The Guardian (May 15, 2020), \"According to the latest research, about one in 20 Covid patients ex perience long -term on-off sy mptoms. I t's unclear whether long-term means two months, or three or long er. The best parallel is deng ue fever, Garner suggests - a 'g hastly ' viral infection of the ly mph nodes which he also contracted. 'Deng ue comes and g oes. I t's like driving around with a handbrake on for six to nine months.' Or, as Lynne Turner-Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King 's Colleg e, London, puts it, for a percentag e of those infected there is a \"recrudescence of sy mptomatolog y.\" Despite the increasing evidence for viral sequestering , some are sug gesting that such may not be the reason; it may be reinfection after cure. (This is not uncommon with coronaviruses, the common cold is an ex ample.) This would mean that previous infection does not confer immunity . (In late-April, the W orld Health Org anization issued a statement that it should not be assumed that previous infection would confer immunity to repeat infections.) Neither is a g ood scenario; either way it is bad news. (A lessening number of people are still insisting that the resurg ence is simply due to testing failures. This is unlikely to be the sole reason; many of the people who are again showing symptoms had symptoms, were then treated in the hospital, recovered, went home, only to develop sy mptoms ag ain weeks later.) Of additional concern, the virus quite often infects the conjunctiva of the ey e (conjunctivitis) where it has been found (in one person) to continue to replicate, and be10 infectious, up to four weeks after the infection was thoug ht to have run its course. This indicates that the virus could use the ey e as a possible source to spread further infections. (Rub y our ey e, touch somone, and on it g oes.) And if all this were not enoug h, a g reat many people have been found to be asy mptomatic for the disease and y et be silent carriers. People have been known to carry and spread the virus for weeks before sy mptoms arise (if they ever do) and for up to four weeks after infection is thoug ht to have cleared. The true rates of infection and death from the virus are not y et known and probably won't be known for one to two y ears. The reasons actual fig ures can't be known for so long is due to a variety of factors. Those are: early , erroneous beliefs about the virus and what it did in the body , very poor tests, low testing rates, and in the US, reg rettably , the CDC criteria for both infection and death which nearly alway s are, and in this instance very much are, far too conservative and limited in scope. Low testing rates (in the US and in a number of other countries) g ive a false picture of infection in the g eneral population. F igures chang e weekly , often in response to complex research papers which are utiliz ing various forms of statistical analy sis. F ew of them ag ree. I have seen figures speculating that true infection rates are ten times official numbers; others insist it is one thousand times official numbers. Speculation about mortality rates runs from .01 percent to ten percent of the infected, sometimes more depending on the ag e group being examined. I n truth, infection and death rates are much hig her than the CDC and other sources (irrespective of the country ) indicate. While the elderly (due to simply aging of the body , its immune sy stem, and its org ans) and those with underly ing conditions (obesity , diabetes, etc) or immune dy sfunction are the most11 likely groups of people to die from the virus, sig nificant numbers of people in their late 20s, 30s, and 40s are also succumbing to the disease. F ar more, in fact, than first thoug ht. (Children of all ages are far more susceptible to infection than first believed and while rates are low death is occurring in this g roup as well. There is also a new sy ndrome emerg ing in children, especially in New York that is not y et understood enoug h for me to comment about intellig ently .) There are two main reasons for death rates being far hig her than is currently thoug ht - thoug h at root it comes down to the same thing , lack of testing . The first is that, because if its sy stem-wide impacts the virus is causing a great many heart attacks, strokes, and incidences of kidney failure. Unless those who die from causes other than respiratory failure are tested for coronavirus, the listed cause of death is g oing to be incorrect. Secondly , a great many people are dy ing at home. F ew of them are being tested for coronavirus. In fact, until recently , unless they had previously been tested for coronavirus and found positive, a death at home was not considered coronavirus related. It is helpful here to look at normal backg round deaths at home in New York City and deaths at home during the pandemic. Normal deaths at home in that city averag e around 25 per day. During this pandemic they have been as 250 per day - I have seen fig ures that run from 150 to 275, depending on the week and how dilig ently the national g uard is checking apartments. The true death rate is much hig her than believed (most likely 60% more than official fig ures), something that is now being widely recog nized. Coronaviruses are very stable and in that sense are much like bacteria. They are one of the few RNA viral g roups that, unlike other RNA viruses, make identical copies of themselves. Researchers and reporters tend to say that most RNA viruses lack a \"copy correct\" function so12 that their offspring are not identical but instead vary , sometimes, widely . (This makes them sound somewhat defective and stupid - poor thing s, can't even reproduce properly . This is a very bad metaphor as they are neither defective or stupid.) B ut this virus does have a \"copy correct\" ability , so. . . a slig htly smarter virus. (Still, not as smart as us.) Viruses are very old, they use patterns of behavior refined after long exposure to and experience with the world around them. Most viruses don't make identical copies of themselves because by making millions of variants their offspring will be more able to avoid effective immune responses as well as continually generate more complex and adaptable forms. But SARS-CoV-2, rather than producing a multitude of variants as it reproduces, utiliz es a different approach, one similar to that used by bacteria. I t alters its g enetic code by exchang ing genetic material with other coronaviruses (there are alway s some of these among the people being infected) and - possibly - by altering itself, as resistant bacteria have done, by analy zing host immune responses and then rearrang ing its g enome in response. (Yes, viruses are intellig ent and y es, contrary to common belief, they are also alive.) Most researchers are using the term \"mutation\" for these altered forms, which I think misplaced since they don't really mutate per se but rather, like bacteria alter their g enome in response to environmental pressures. They learn as they go and adapt to what they encounter. (Assuming that other forms of life, or simply different types of humans, are stupid rarely works out well in the long run - review F rench Revolution or dynamics of antibiotic resistance as ex amples.) There is evidence that there are at least eig ht forms of the virus now in circulation (thoug h I have seen one paper that indicates thirty ). Recent studies note that the viral infections on the west coast of the US are apparently from the initial Chinese form of the virus while the13 infections on the East coast of the US are from a European variant, spread to the US by travelers from the EU. I t is currently thoug ht that the European variant, which beg an in China, became more virulent as it moved throug h the EU countries and finally into the US. While research is ong oing, the increase in transmissibility and pathog enicity seems a consistent strateg y of this particular org anism - at least at this time. As Kroeber, et al comment (2020), about their discovery of a more transmissible form: To date we have identified fourteen mutations in Spike [the attachment organ of the virus] that are accumulating. . . . The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly became the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. Phelan, et al (2020) comment that We used 3,958 SNPs to build a phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and noted strong evidence for the existence of two major clades and six-sub-clades, unevenly distributed across the world. W e also noted that convergent evolution has potentially occurred across several locations in the genome, showing selection pressures, including on the spite glycoprotein where we noted a potentially critical mutation that could affect its binding to the ACE2 receptor.14 We also report on mutations that could prevent current molecular diagnostics from detecting some of the subclades. In other words, besides more pathog enic forms, there may possibly be variants emerg ing that cannot be detected by current tests. Yao, et al, note that they have found alterations in variants that \"show sig nificant variation in cy topathic effects and viral load, up to 270-fold differences\" during infection. As they go on to comment, \"W e provide direct evidence that the SARS-Cov-2 has acquired mutations capable of substantially chang ing its pathog enicity .\" That is, it is g etting more virulent. While there has been speculation (hope? ) that the virus would become less virulent as it moves throug h the human species, more researchers are doubting that it will occur - at least in the short term. There is no other way to say this . . . what we are facing is serious. I t is also a g reat deal worse than what we would have faced because of the ruinous (neoliberal and conservative) financial squeez e on working people (including the middle class) the past forty years, the takeover of American health care (supported by neoliberals and conservatives) by giant corporations (which have closed hundreds of hospitals the past ten y ears and reduced stocks of essential medicines and safety equipment), the offshoring by such corporations of essential medical supply manufacturers (including pharmaceutical) to China and I ndia, the long term Republican assault on robust public health care and associated public health institutions in the US (including groups such as the CDC and state health services), Republican-initiated severe reductions in the social safety net (supported by neoliberals as well), and the very poor responses15 to the pandemic by Republicans in cong ress, in the various states, and most especially the Trump administration. If the emerg ing picture of what the virus is doing is borne out, and if it continues to develop more sophistication with the human body and its immune responses, not only will a vaccine be much harder to create, the human species is g oing to be in for a very bumpy ride. Note: no successful vaccine has yet been created for any coronavirus, the common cold is a primary example. Further, immunity to coronavirus infections (again, see the common cold) typically only lasts a few months before it fades. That this might also be true for this coronavirus is the source of the fear that many virologists and epidemiologists have that the virus might become endemic and continually recur in the human population just as the cold virus does. There is little reason, at this point, to believe that this virus, as SARS did, will just fade away anytime soon. W e will only discover what is true over time, perhaps only over several y ears. W e are, in fact, in a hell of a mess. Organism Entry into the Body While my initial review of what this particular coronavirus does in the body was correct as far as it went, research since then has considerably broadened and deepened understanding of this virus and what it does. The same will be true of this look into the virus. I n another six or eig ht weeks even more will be known and so on ad infinitum . Nevertheless, here is a pretty good view of16 what is happening which g ives a g ood deal of information about how best to utiliz e sophisticated herbal protocols to intervene in the process. It is clear that during infection the virus utiliz es ACE2, which is a receptor on many cells in the body , in order to attach itself to those cells. Note: There are about 40 trillion cells in the averag e human body , a great many of these have ACE2 receptors on them. Once the virus enters the body , it has millions of options for attachment. The \"spikes\" on the virus (famous now from the many media representations of them) are the part of the virus which attaches to the ACE2 receptors on the cell. To facilitate this, the spikes utiliz e an enz yme found on our cells - transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) - to \"prime\" the virus's spike protein so that it display s itself as a \"fusion protein\" to the cell via the ACE2 receptors. This allows viral attachment to the ACE2 receptor and subsequent entry into the cell. (The primary herb which can be used to protect TMPRSS2 integ rity, and influenz viruses also utiliz e TMPRSS2 in this way . (Another intellig ent intervention is interfering with spike attachment to ACE2, discussed later in this article.) Generally , the virus first enters the so-called upper respiratory system (beg inning with the nose). There it attaches to ACE2 receptors on certain epithelial cells, specifically goblet secretory cells (which produce mucus) and ciliated cells (which have tiny hair-like ex trusions i.e., cilia, which move mucus and particulate matter up and out of the respiratory system). ( Bidens pilosa is protective of these cells.) The virus utiliz es those cells' TMPRSS2 to prime the spike, allowing entry inside. These particular cells possess a larg e number of innate immune-associated antiviral genes which is leading to speculation that the virus may be using its access to these cells to17 subvert a healthy immune response. (And, indeed, interferon production does seem to be inhibited early in the infection.) Once it g ains entry into the nasal cells, the virus beg ins to utiliz e those cells' structures in order to reproduce, creating more copies of itself. At this point in the infection there are often no symptoms. Then, for a week, sometimes long er, the virus releases copies of itself from the infected cells. (Tests of health care workers without sufficient protective equipment found that their noses and mouths were full of live viruses which they then ex haled onto every new patient they saw.) The viruses travel outward with the breath (and also spread to the hands when y ou rub your nose) enabling them to spread to other people thus passing the infection more widely into the species. (Evidence is mounting that ex haled aerosols, not just droplets, can possibly spread the virus, thus ex tending the rang e of infection far more than six feet.) Note: The main purpose of masks is to protect others if we are infected. I t is not to keep us from g etting infected. And y es, if you don't cover y our nose with the mask, y ou are still infecting people. Nevertheless, there are masks that will protect y ou from inhaling infectious viruses but very few people have them. I n hig h exposure situations I use a 3M Paint Project Respirator, 6000 Series, with a g as and vapor double-filter cartridg e attachment. And y es, I still feel silly .) The viral infection of olfactory sensory neurons, located in a small area of specializ ed tissue hig h in the nose are the reason for the loss of smell (sometimes taste) that is one of the early signs of infection. Those neural cells connect directly to the brain and are one avenue the virus uses to infect the brain. From the nose the virus beg ins to move deeper into the respiratory system, infecting18 goblet and ciliated cells in the throat and bronchi. This is the point where the first sy mptoms generally appear: slig ht fever, dry coug h, sore throat, head and body aches. I t then beg ins to move deeper into the lung s (the so-called lower respiratory system) where its preferred cell is ty pe II pneumocy tes (aka, ty pe II alveolar cells). (ACE2 receptors are also strong ly present in ty pe I cells as well, but the virus seems to prefer ty pe II; I can't find any thing on ty pe I infection.) These cells are common throug hout the lung 's alveoli (and along with ty pe I), exist in scattered pockets in the bronchioles, and as well in the alveolar ducts. The alveoli are incredibly tiny, microscopic, g rape-like sacs at the end of very tiny, also microscopic, bronchioles. Air travels throug h the bronchi which diverg e into smaller and smaller and still smaller air passag es at the end of which are the alveoli. The alveoli have an ex tremely thin ex terior membrane which is covered by a network of incredibly tiny blood vessels. As we breathe in, the alveoli ex pand much like very tiny balloons, then ox ygen (and other g ases and volatiles) pass throug h the thin alveoli membranes into the blood stream, carbon diox ide (and other g ases and volatiles) pass from the blood into the alveoli and are then breathed out. There are around 300 million alveoli so there are a g reat many ACE2 receptors in the lung s for the virus to attach to. As the infection prog resses, the immune sy stem responds, white blood cells release activated molecules to fig ht the virus (cy tokine is the g eneral name for messeng er molecules, chemokines are specializ ed cy tokines that call immune cells to the sites of infectio n, but I just call them all cy tokines). The alveoli fill up with fluid (edema) and dead cells which makes breathing more difficult (pneumonia). Coug hing, fever (often hig h), rapid and slow respiration are common. (There are ex ceptions, some people never show respiratory symptoms.) B lood19 oxygen content falls. Some people ex perience what is called acute respiratory distress sy ndrome (ARDS). This is g enerally accompanied by what is often called a cy tokine storm, a massive inflammatory response throug hout the body . The ox ygen levels in the blood plummet, the alveoli are filled with pus, mucus, white blood cells, dead viruses, and destroy ed lung cells. (These are the people most commonly put on ventilators. However, the majority of ventilated people, around 85% on averag e, die; there is g rowing recog nition that ventilators may not be a proper intervention with this particular infection.) F or many people, the damag e to the thin cellular barrier between the alveoli and the blood vessels, results in scarring , aka fibrosis. This is one cause of what is commonly called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or sometimes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This results in long term pulmonary problems. (B ecause of the scarring , the ox ygen ex chang e is impeded so that ox ygenization does not occur efficiently - thus during any event which demands the use of the muscles people run out of breath, often quite quickly . The scarring is often prog ressive over time.) I t is not known how many people are developing this post-infection complication, but it is cause for concern. It is particularly important to keep the ly mph sy stem working well during Covid-19 infection in order for the immune sy stem to work most effectively . (Salvia miltiorrhiza - and cleavers, Galium spp - will help both spleen and appendix work well as well as helping lymph nodes more efficiently clear of infection debris.) The lung s also possess an ex tensive ly mph sy stem with similar nodal structures which it uses to reg ulate interstitial fluid clearance. This sy stem is impaired during Covid-19 infection, in part throug h the viral damag e to ly mphatic endothelial cells. (L ymph vessels are lined with endothelial cells just like blood vessels.) During patholog ical states where the lung 's lymph20 system is impaired, this loss of ly mphatic function naturally leads to an inflammatory state. The alveoli are damag ed, hy poxia, and a state very similar to emphy sema occurs. (Protecting the cells from the induced hy poxia can help reduce the damag e in the lung s. Rhodiola is specific for this. It prevents hy poxia-induced ox idative damag e, increases intracellular ox ygen and increases the efficiency of ox ygen utiliz ation.) Keeping lymph function in the lung s healthy is essential, especially with this disease, thus protecting the integ rity of the endothelial cells of the ly mph vessels and stimulating healthy lymph function is strong ly indicated. L ymphatics have a long history in herbal medicine and there are some g ood ones. Given that Ceanothus (red root) does stimulate clotting I would suggest the use of cleavers ( Gallium spp ) as an adjunct instead. (This is not an issue for the people who have been using Ceanothus to this point. That herb is present in the initial protocol in relatively small quantities and that protocol contains, as well, a number of anticoag ulatory herbs which would counteract any coag ulant actions it has.) Herbs of note: Eleutherococcus senticosus (aka, Siberian g inseng ) has, among its many actions, the ability to stabiliz e lymphatic vessels by protecting and enhancing the endothelial cells of the ly mph sy stem. The use of the herb, in clinical trials, has been shown to stimulate lymph drainag e to such an ex tent that edema of the lower limbs was \"sig nificantly \" attenuated at 2 and 4 Salvia miltiorrhiza, and ly mphatic endothelial integ rity, interfering with cellular invasion by pathog ens or the damag ing impacts of stimulate ly mph drainag e from the lung s. 21 During viral infection of the lung s, the microbiome of the lung s is sig nificantly disturbed. This can allow a bloom of what are normally quiescent pathog enic members of the microbiome. This is why during viral pneumonia, most phy sicians will also prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics in an attempt to ward off pathog enic bacterial overg rowth. Additionally , coronavirus infection, which is common in the lower GI tract, will also affect its healthy microbiome. The lung/GI tract microbiome are, in essence, a sing le interconnected sy stem - what happens in one affects the other. Disturbances of the microbiome in the GI tract has also been found to negatively affect heart function as well as the function of other org ans, all of which contributes to various post coronavirus sy ndrome sy mptoms. (The daily use of a probiotic is strong ly suggested. The cheapest g ood one is PB 8, but those in the $40 to $60 rang e are better.) At first it was believed that the virus was a ty pical, althoug h unique, respiratory pathog en. It isn't. The virus can in many people become sy stemic, affecting many other org ans in the body . This is because ACE2 is widely distributed throug hout all the body 's tissues. As Hamming , et al (2004) noted in their ex ploration of SARS and ACE2: Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs ( oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain) . The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore,22 ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans . . . Because ACE2 is present throug hout the body , the virus can, theoretically , affect any location in which those receptors ex ist. Ag ain, at this point in time, the lung s, kidney s, GI tract, heart, blood vessels, skin, the ey es and liver/g all bladder are known to be common infection sites. ACE2 is ubiquitous in endothelial cells in all larg e and small arteries and veins in all the tissues of the body . Smooth muscle cells show them as do my ofibroblasts (their infection is possibly the source of muscle weakness during and after infection) and the membrane of fat cells in the org ans and every place that fat accumulates. The entire GI tract has larg e numbers of ACE2 receptors: the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and the colon. (Viral infection of the GI tract is the source of the diarrhea that many people ex perience.) ACE2 receptors are present in the basal cell lay er of the epidermis, hair follicles, in and around the sebaceous and sweat g lands, and in all the blood vessels that lie close to the skin surface. (This is the source of the skin rash that about 20% of those infected report.) The brain has ACE2 receptors as do the bile ducts, ly mph nodes, heart, and kidney s. More troubling , because ACE2 receptors are common throug hout the entire circulatory system in vessel and arterial walls, blood clotting in the circulatory system has become a serious issue. Blood Clotting The blood coag ulation problems seem to come from two main impacts of the infection. As the23 virus spreads throug h the blood sy stem of the body , it has access to a g reat many ACE2 receptors on the circulatory system's endothelial cells. Viruses attach to the receptors, enter the cells, reproduce, and blow the cells apart as their offspring exit. In essence, this is no different than a scrape to the surface of the skin. I t's a wound. So, the internal version of a scab beg ins to form. Unfortunately , this is happening not to one cell but thousands. Damag e to the endothelial cells that line the vessels recruits platelets to that location where they begin to cluster at the point of damag e. The platelets initiate the formation of fibrin which forms a kind of net that traps within it more platelets and red blood cells, essentially plugging the wound (i.e., creating a clot, aka the internal form of a scab) in the vessel wall. This is the initial, main cause of the massive clotting in the body - thoug h as mentioned earlier certain inflammatory processes stimulate sy stemic clotting as well. B ecause so many cells are affected, there are hundreds to thousands of clots forming throug hout the entire circulatory system and, potentially , in every organ of the body . Given that coag ulation (clotting ) problems are so ex tremely common with this infection - as well as the fact that many people appear well but suddenly experience stroke or heart attack - the use of anti-coag ulants is, I think, essential. A number of the herbs sug gested for use in treating Covid-19 infections are anticoag ulant and very specific for protecting endothelial cells from inflammatory damag e and/or stopping clotting - Salvia miltiorrhiza, Polygonum cuspitadum, and Scutellaria baicalensis are some ex amples. However, I think the daily use of specific anticlotting agents is warranted - whether someone is infected or not. I suggest either lumbrokinase or nattokinase (and y es, serrapeptase will work, too). Again, many people show no sy mptoms at all but are still ex periencing severe24 coagulation/clotting problems in their circulatory system. One of the way s to determine how much clotting is occurring is to check the blood for D-dimer levels. D-dimer is released during fibrin deg radation; the more D-dimer, the more clotting . Again, all people who are tested for the virus should also be being tested for D-dimer levels . . . but they are not and most probably will not be. Thus the daily use of an anticoag ulant such as lumbrokinase is strong ly suggested as well as checking blood ox ygen levels daily with an ox imeter. Immune Disregulation Nasal g oblet cells, which are some of the first cells infected, are involved with initial interferon responses to viral infections. B ut with this virus, there is considerable evidence that interferon responses are disreg ulated. During early infection, as soon as the nasal g oblet cells are infected, IFN responses are delay ed. L ater on in the infection they are often overactive, initiating highly inflammatory cytokine cascades. I n the latter situation, there is strong evidence that what is called GMP-AMP sy nthase (cGAS) and its down stream effector STI NG (STimulator of INterferon Genes) are overactive during Covid-19 infections. This same dy namic is the source of an unrelated but difficult and painful autoimmune disease called STI NG-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI ). Unsurprising ly, the sy mptoms it causes bears a resemblance to some of the sy mptoms that occur during Covid-19 infections. STING is an adaptor molecule which links sensing of foreig n microbial pathog en DNA to the production of ty pe 1 I FNs during the innate immune response. I t is ex pressed in alveolar macrophag es, bronchial epithelium, and ty pe II pneumocy tes - all SARS-CoV-2 infection sites. STING has a direct effect on endothelial cells, stimulating inflammation and initiating a25 coagulation cascade. This is in addition to the dy namics already in play throug h viral attachment to endothelial ACE2 receptors. STI NG disreg ulation, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is at the root of many of the pulmonary , coag ulation, and inflammation problems seen both in Covid-19 infections and SAVI . SAVI is accompanied by abnormal inflammation throug hout the body , especially in the skin, blood vessels, and lung s - idiopathic pulmonary disease is a common problem for children with SAVI . There are also continual problems with blood vessels (vasculopathy ) and damag e to the tissues that rely on these vessels for their blood supply . The condition causes a chronic vessel-endothelium inflammation which leads to the vasculitic rash common in SAVI . . . but seen also in Covid-19 infections. (This may be the dy namic underly ing the unique sy mptoms being seen in y oung children in New York.) This often ex tends to the toes and fing ers producing a condition which is very similar to what is being called Covid-toe. As with Covid-toe, the rash is not limited to the toes but ex tends to the sole, sides, and top of the foot and is sometimes accompanied by lesions. J NK inhibitors have been found to help quiet the STI NG-initiated, overactive I FN activity , reducing the sy stemic inflammation in the body . (Some plants - all of which have been found to be useful for treating pulmonary problems similar to those caused by this coronavirus.) As with L yme infections, interfering with the production of upstream cy tokines during Covid-19 infections can sig nificantly reduce the inflammatory cascades they initiate thus reducing the damag e to the body . Xiaobing Deng , Xiaoy u Yu, and J ianfeng Pai (2020, preprint)26 comment that control of upstream cy tokines is a promising strateg y in the treatment of Covid-19, with special attention paid to the disreg ulation of I FN-I which the virus causes early during infection. Stopping the virus-caused abnormal activity of cGAS-STI NG which is a main source of cy tokine overactivation and inflammation is one potential upstream point at which to intervene. The plant-derived cy clopeptide Astin C is particularly potent in accomplishing this. It's a compound from the plant Aster tataricus which has been used in Chinese medicine for some two thousand y ears. The root is often used to treat lung and bronchial disease, especially chronic bronchitis and coug hing. It is considered antibacterial and antifung al (with a g ood rang e of action ag ainst a number of pulmonary pathog ens), antitussive (reducing coug hs), ex pectorant (expressing mucus out of the sy stem), and stimulant. (This is not an herb that I have previously used or have ex perience with but g iven its history of use and its ability to inhibit J NK and cGAS- STING its use with Covid-19 certainly should be considered.) As noted, there are ACE2 receptors on macrophag es, monocy tes, and ly mphocy tes, including T-cells. This allows the viruses entry into those cells where they can then affect immune responses. There is g rowing evidence that like SARS-CoV-1, this virus can infect dendritic cells; it definitely interferes with their maturation. B y infecting a wide rang e of immune cells, the virus can lower or inactivate some immune responses and sig nificantly upreg ulate others. Similarly to Lyme borrelia, it is very sophisticated in modulating immune responses to infection. During early stages, it shuts down sig nificant parts of a healthy immune response which allows the virus to spread and infect widely diverg ent parts of the body more easily . (As an example, during infection it is common for very low levels of ly mphocy tes to be present in the body , something called ly mphocy topenia. Houttuynia is very good at correcting this as well as27 being a specific antiviral for this org anism.) L ater on in the infection, it enhances immune action, creating more inflammation. (I nhibitors for the org anisms' actions on the immune sy stem is covered later in the article.) Some people have immune responses that do in fact quite easily stop the infection, others, apparently very healthy do not. No one knows why . (Reductionists continually fall back on GENETI CS! which they use about the same way that our ancestors used \"the g ods did it\" or \"it's an imbalance in the humors.\" The truth is they don't know.) Some people have immune responses that do in fact quite easily stop the infection, others, apparently very healthy do not. No one knows why . CD147 and Cyclophilin A The virus has also been found to attach itself to the CD147 receptor that is present on many cells in the body . CD147 is also known as to secrete a rang e of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) - themselves a source of inflammation and cellular breakdown. CD147 is reg arded as a novel modulator of inflammatory and immune disorders and its disreg ulation has been linked to the pathog enesis of such thing s as asthma, lung inflammation, hepatitis, my ocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and, importantly , neuroinflammatory diseases - most of which have occurred with Covid-19 infections. CD147 receptors are found on olfactory and brain neurons, red blood cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, leukocy tes, monocy tes, ly mphocy tes, neutrophils, and platelets. I t is highly upreg ulated on activated immune cells, neutrophils, T and B -lymphocy tes, monocy tes, macrophag es, and dendritic cells. W hile the virus can use this receptor to g ain entry to cells (and28 does do so), it appears that a more important aspect is the affinity of cy clophilin A (Cy PA) for CD147 receptors. Damag ed epithelial and endothelial cells and macrophag es tend to upreg ulate and release CyPA and Cy PA has been found to stimulate CD147 surface ex pression on cells. Cy PA has been shown to strong ly facilitate viral replication, including that of SARS-CoV-1. Cy PA, when released from cells, strong ly binds to the upreg ulated CD147 receptors. B y attaching itself to the CD147 ex pressed on the surface of cells and simply waiting , the virus g ains access to the Cy PA which, when released from damag ed endothelial and epithelial cells, seeks out CD147 to bind with. W hen it does, the virus can utiliz e the Cy PA to facilitate its reproduction. Viral load then increases substantially . The cy clophilin inhibitor cy closporin A has been found to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. ( Magnolia officinalis contains mag noloside A which has also been found to inhibit Cy PA. I t is a traditional Chinese herb used to treat, among other thing s, lung infections and inflammation.) As well, anti-CD147 antibodies tend to inhibit the virus from attaching to host cells or using that receptor to g ain entry into them. ( Scutellaria baicalensis accomplishes this as well, in part, by downreg ulating CD147 ex pression.) B locking CD147/Cy PA interactions during in vivo studies of induced acute lung inflammation by the use of anti-CD147 mAb has led to a 50% reduction of neutrophils in within the lung tissues and airway s accompanied by a similar decrease in tissue damag e (Zhu, et al, 2014). CyPA is a potent proinflamm atory molecule. The more that is released from damag ed cells, the more inflammation that occurs in the sy stem. The binding of Cy PA to CD147 activates MAPK pathway s, stimulates leukocy te recruitment and MMP-9 ex pression29 throug h ERK and NF -kB pathway s, all of which play a role during Covid-19 infections. (Among other actions, Polygonum cuspitadum strong ly downreg ulates MMP-9.) Cy PA also induces the production of numerous cy tokines, e.g ., IL-1\u00e2, IL-6, and I L-8 in macrophag es and monocy tes and promotes the proliferation and mig ration of VSMC. I t enhances platelet adhesion and thrombus J NK, and p38 MAPK, ag ain, all of which play a role in Covid-19 infections. Inflammatory Cytokines Once the virus enters the body it initiates a rapid process of replication which causes massive endothelial and epithelial death (apoptosis) and, because of the endothelial cell damag e, vascular e. This trig (as they say) pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (known hereafter as just plain old cy tokines). These include TNF -a, IL-1\u00e2, IL-6, IL- 8, VEGF , MCP-1, among others. The viral infection of macrophag es and ly mphocy tes can result as well in a ty pe of apoptosis or cell death called py roptosis which is by its nature hig hly inflammatory when it occurs. The virus doesn't g enerally reproduce in white blood cells but it does actively interfere with their ability to fig ht off the infection. (See the section on smoking , later in the article.) In addition to attaching to and infecting ACE2 receptors, the virus can also downreg ulate ACE2 and induce the shedding of \"cataly tically active ACE2 ectodomain\" - as they say. What this does is initiate the loss of ACE2 function in the lung s which g enerally results in acute lung injury . This loss of ACE2 function often causes dy sfunction of the renin-ang iotensin (RAS) system in the body . RAS is intimately involved in modulating a number of sy stems in the body30 needed for health. As soon as ACE2 reduction or loss occurs, g eneral inflammation in the body increases and vascular walls become more permeable. I n the lung s, loss of ACE2 results in more edema, leaking blood vessels, neutrophil accumulation, and diminished lung function. Protecting and streng thening ACE2 receptors is, I think, essential. Herbs that block viral attachment to ACE-2 ACE-2 upreg ulators) will increase the presence of ACE-2 and help protect the lung s from injury : Crataegus spp and Pueraria lobata are specific for this. (This is part of the reason Crataegus , i.e. hawthorn, is g ood for heart health, it upreg ulates ACE2 by down reg ulating ACE, thus increasing ACE2 receptors in the heart, thus supporting heart health and vitality .) Note: A number of people have ex pressed concern about upreg ulating and streng thening ACE2 since the virus attaches to that receptor. W ouldn't it be better, they say, to just inhibit ACE2 in the body completely ? Why don't we just g et rid of ACE2 entirely ? Then we won't g et infected. W on't upreg ulating and streng thening ACE2 lead to more attachment points and more infection? Well, no, it's not that simple. F or one thing there are some 4 trillion cells in the human body , a sig nificant number of which have ACE2 receptors on them - including fat cells. The more fat y ou have the more ACE2. (Needless to say , Americans have a lot of ACE2 receptors.) Getting rid of ACE2 receptors is simply not possible, which is a g ood thing since they are essential for the body to remain healthy . Without them we die. Really really fast. Secondly and importantly , herbs are not drugs . Nor are they even raw drugs , which some31 people erroneously call them. They are plants, which are, at root, only one thing : ecolog ical modulators - both of larg e systems like the Earth and smaller ones like our bodies. They act to move sy stems, irrespective of siz e, back to health, to re-establish homeody namis - what some people, incorrectly call homeostasis (there are no static states in nature only dynamic ones). And plants are ex tremely good at their job which they have refined over several hundred million y ears or so.) Pharmaceuticals, which are a century old or so, are sing le molecules that force a chang e in the body of one sort or another. (They come out of a medical sy stem whose approach to disease is based on cut, kill, or force - and now perhaps, to some ex tent, reprog ram.) They don't usually perform multiple actions. Herbs often contain hundreds of compounds that act synergistically . Pueraria lobata (kudz u) does not simply upreg ulate ACE2. I t is more accurate to think of its actions with ACE2 as performing a modulatory and reg ulatory function as part of a much wider rang e of actions in the body (such as downreg ulating overactive cy tokines like TNF - a and I L-1\u00e2 and supporting the health and maturation of dendritic cells). I t is not a sing le-action stimulant that forces ACE2 ex pression, nor is it a straig ht suppressant, depressing ACE. You can compare apples and telephone poles, it just doesn't make any sense when y ou do. To continue . . . the increase of TNF -a and I L-1\u00e2 in the sy stem stimulates the \"shedding \" of ACE2 which results in less membrane-bound ACE2 on the body 's cells. This is a pervasive occurrence in the body ; the more inflammation, the more shedding which occurs. No matter the organ, when this shedding occurs, org an function decreases. (Plants that can inhibit TNF a plant but useful in this infection for a variety of reasons; I cells (DCs), both mature and immature. I t doesn't kill them (as far as I know) but merely stops them from maturing and stimulating an effective adaptive immune response. DCs ex ist abundantly just under the epithelium lay ers in the lung tissue. The cy tokine upreg ulation that infection causes makes the endothelium much more porous, allowing the virus to penetrate and infect the DCs. Upreg ulated I L-6 and I L-8 from epithelial and endothelial cells concentrate around the immature DCs and strong ly inhibit their maturation and the priming ability that mature DCs have for the g eneration of active T cells. This inhibits the production of active T cells allowing the spreading of the infection. Stimulating DC maturation ( Cordyceps spp, Pueraria lobata ), prevent this. Disreg ulation of the brain ACE2 and RAS sy stem is intimately related to poorer cardiac function as well as dy sregulated hy pothalamic function, blood pressure, and autonomic sy stem function. (This is a contributing element to the wide rang e of neurolog ical effects that are being seen.) Not to g et into it too deeply , ACE2 (i.e., ang iotensin converting enzyme 2) antag onizes the actions of ang iotensin I I (Ang II). Ang II is involved in modulating immune function. W hen not controlled by the presence and action of ACE2 it contributes to g eneral and autoimmune inflammation, hy pertension, org an pertrophy , the of endothelial progenitor cells which are necessary for vascular repair, and promotes org an damag e and fibrosis33 in the body . The less ACE2, the more those effects occur. ACE2 is very important to healthy functioning . ACE2 is powerfully affected by the virus, so the use of ACE2 protectants and modulators that normaliz e function is, I think, crucial. The ex tensive cy tokine release in the body causes an ong oing inflammation which can attack most org ans eventually leading to org an damag e and collapse. I nterfering with the generation of the cy tokines, which can be accomplished throug h a variety of herbal interventions, can substantially help the course of infection. F or ex ample, some researchers have found that simply reducing IL-6 will reduce inflammation, making the infection less acute, and enabling long term resolution. That is why the arthritis drug tociliz umab, which inhibits I L-6, has been found of use in treating acute Covid-19 infections. IL-6 and I L-8 are two of the more important cy tokines to inhibit as part of Covid-19 treatment. I L-6 to note: melatonin has g ood application in this disease, not only as an anti-inflammatory but also because, among other thing s, it helps reduce anxiety and promote sleep. The Heart As mentioned earlier, the virus does infect cardiac cells via their ACE2 receptors and thus damag es heart tissues, including its muscle tissue. Some of the people so affected have no respiratory symptoms at all and present at the hospital solely with cardiac problems such as sudden heart attack. Perhaps ten percent of those infected with Covid-19 suffer cardiac34 complications. Permanent heart damag e occurs in a small percentag e of those. During cardiac infection the initial manifestation is \"an increase in hig h-sensitivity cardiac troponin 1 (hs-cTnl) levels\" (Z heng , et al, 2020). As the damag e spreads median creatine kinase levels rise to double the levels of those without cardiac infection. I n a more perfect world every one infected with this virus would be tested for those elevated cardiac biomarkers. Herbal interventions are very specific for preventing this kind of damag e during infection. The primary herb for this is Salvia miltiorrhiza . It is sig nificantly more effective if combined in a one to one ratio with Pueraria lobata (Wu, et al, 2007). A combination of Paeonia suffruticosa and Salvia miltiorrhiza has also been found to be effective (L i, et al, 2016). Salvia miltiorrhiza is a truly important medicinal in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. I t has a long history of use in China for the treatment of sy stemic disease, including reversing or treating adverse impacts in most org ans of the body including the heart. I t is effective for inhibiting increases in troponin and creatine kinase - ag ain, not a suppressor but as a modulator of function. The herb promotes blood circulation, inhibits platelet ag gregation, enic, strong ly the kidney s, is a potent cytokine adaptog en - reducing any cytokine levels that are too hig h, increasing any levels that are too low - another way to think of it is as an immune-response adaptog en. It is strong ly anti- inflammatory , Golg i structures, is integ rity in mucosa-infected cells, is hig hly protective of the spleen - enhancing its immune functions, and has shown remarkable effectiveness in the treatment of lung disease. I n short, a truly world class systemic modulator for inflammatory diseases of any sort. The world's best herbal monog raph (on any herb) is the three volume (1800 pag es total) compilation by Xijun Yan (editor) on this35 herb: Dan Shen ( Salvia miltiorrhiza) in Medicine (Spring er, 2015). I t covers every possible use of the herb and looks at both historical use, its outcomes in clinical trials, and in laboratory study . It makes any other herbal monog raph in ex istence look paltry and rather shame-faced in comparison. Scutellarin and baicalin from Scutellaria baicalensis are also particularly effective in treating and preventing heart damag e from this org anism. Scutellarin prevents the increase of cardiac troponin (by correcting or preventing the underly ing damag e). B aicalin inactivates creatine kinase. Specifically the herb has a broad rang e of cardiovascular actions including vasodilation, protection cardiac remodeling , and is antiarrhy thmia. I t is also a strong systemic antiviral herb and very specific for this organism. I t has a long use in China for treatment of blood circulatory problems and cerebral insufficiency . (Quercetin and Polygonum cuspidatum One final thing : L-Malic acid has been found to be ex tremely low in the infected; levels become prog ressively lower as severity increases. L -Malic acid is an essential amino acid in the body when the immune sy stem is strug gling with any type of sy stemic inflammation. This amino acid is rapidly consumed during inflammatory states in order to provide energ y and materials for the proliferation of and phag ocytosis capacities of immune cells. Supplementing L-Malic acid is strong ly suggested, especially during more serious infections. A Brief Com ment on Sm oking and Covid-19 Despite a g reat many media articles early in the pandemic that insisted that smokers who36 contracted the new coronavirus would suffer worse outcomes than nonsmokers, such has not been the case. (I nitiate hair pulling by prohibitionists.) As L ippi and Henry (2020) comment: \"I n conclusion, the results of this preliminary meta-analy sis based on Chinese patients sug gest that active smoking does not apparently seem to be sig nificantly associated with enhanced risk of progressing towards severe disease in COVI D-19.\" Some researchers are speculating that since smoking reduces macrophag e activity it interferes with the sy stemic inflammatory processes the virus initiates. As Yang and Chen (2018) note . . . A study by Chen et al demonstrated that in smoker's alveolar macrophages, there is IL-6, IL-8 and reduced TLR-2 and TLR4 signaling as a result of impaired activation of NF- KB. These are in fact some of the most active of the cy tokines during Covid-19 infection which explains why smokers g enerally have a better outcome than non-smokers. Other researchers speculate that because nicotine has definite effects on the RAS/ACE system (modulating its actions) that that is the reason for smokers' better outcomes during infection. As well, nicotine actually prevents acute lung injury in animal ARDS models and has immune modulating actions. (To stop the run on nicotine patches the F rench g overnment prohibited the sale of over the counter patches until the pandemic subsides. Nevertheless at least one hospital in the EU issued nicotine patches to all its medical workers. . . . alway s fun to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice or, in this case, a deeper fear.) 37 Post Coronavirus Syndrom e There has not been much in the literature on this as y et but many people who have recovered are reporting continual problems despite being free of active infection. The main sy mptoms in post- infection sy ndrome that I have read and heard about are: unremitting extreme fatig ue; breathing difficulties (breathlessness episodes and poorer ox ygenation); continual mucus buildup in and/or severe scarring in the lung s; kidney problems including the need for dialy sis; possible sterility problems from testicle infection; continual elevated liver enz ymes and slow-developing liver damag e; continuing GI tract disturbance ongoing diarrhea, cramping , abdominal discomfort; various deg rees and ty pes damag e (muscle damag e, i.e. cardiomy opathy , with attendant poorer heart cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, palpitations, with attendant fatig ue, shortness of breath, reduced ability to do phy sical activity ); a sort of relapsing fever sy ndrome in which periodic bouts of fever, chills, and weakness recur, often with periods of feeling fine in between; neurolog ical problems similar to that in L yme disease: brain fog , difficulty thinking , poor memory , difficulty in focusing attention, poor concentration, confusion, diz ziness, recurrent headaches, numbness, ting ling, burning sensations, severe ong oing anxiety and/or panic attacks - and possibly , intermittent strokes. Some people with severe strokes during infection have lost the ability speak or lost partial bodily control. I t is projected that as many as 20% of those infected will ex perience long term cog nitive problems. Recovery from mild infections may take weeks, or months, or y ears. Many of those who were asy mptomatic suddenly find themselves developing symptoms of post coronavirus infection. Nearly 60% of the asy mptomatic show what is called \"g round-g lass\" opacities in their38 lungs, a sig n of possible permanent lung damag e. One third of those diag nosed with and who recovered from SARS or MERS suffered permanent lung damag e . . . something that is apparently occurring with SARS-CoV-2 as well. There is speculation that the long -term effects of this latter infection mig ht be worse. Those first two diseases most often infected only one lung, this one infects both. A larg er and more complete understanding of the rang e of post-infection sy mptoms will undoubtedly occur as time prog resses. I include an ex tended protocol with sug gestions for treating many of these post-coronavirus problems after the main protocol itself. And y es, herbal protocols can help, sometimes sig nificantly , as they have for people infected with the L yme- group of microorg anisms. Herbal Interventions Here is the rationale underly ing my suggested protocols: My approach in the treatment of sy stemic inflammatory infections has alway s been to find plants that will counteract the actions of the org anism involved - in this instance, SARS- CoV-2 - then to cross-correlate those with each other so as to find the plants that are active in the most categ ories that will inhibit the infection and its cy tokine cascades, which also have effectiveness in the sy mptoms the disease cases, and which also have a long historical record of use for treating such conditions. To find these I extensively research hundreds, sometimes thousands, of scientific and research journals and articles, then I look at both historical and contemporary use which also involves researching a great many sources. The herbs chosen also have to be relatively easy to find. 39 NOTE: As I always say, the herbs I suggest are not the only ones that can help during a Covid-19 infection; there are scores which will do so, many of which are listed in this article. However, that being said, I would strongly suggest that Salvia miltiorrhiz a NOT be be eliminated from the protocol under any circumstances ( unless you absolutely cannot fine a source for it) . In my opinion, given its effects in counteracting so many of the actions and impacts the virus has, it is crucial to successful treatment of this pathogen. As you can tell from the list of herbs that will affect various aspects of the virus and its infection and inflammation strateg y, there are a number that are active in multiple areas, such as Andrographis, Houtuyynia , and Polygonum cuspidatum . It is possible to mix and match to create your own protocols. Personally , I would not remove Isatis, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Scutellaria baicalensis, or Pueraria lobata. I feel they are just too important in treating this infection. Please note: The initial SARS-CoV-2 protocol I originally outlined will still work, this one is just more specifically focused due to the research that has been done since the pandemic beg an. If you are using that older protocol, I would definitely add a separate formulation made of equal parts Isatis and Houttuynia tinctures to use during active infection: one tsp 3-6x daily depending on the severity of the infection. Also note: At this point, I don't have the time to g o into all the herb/drug interactions that can occur with the herbs included in the sug gested protocol. Please be aware that most, if not all, of40 the contraindications and herb/drug interactions are listed in one or more of my medical herbals, all findable on Amaz on, used or new, or at the library (if it is a g ood one). Pharmaceuticals, while ex tremely useful for many thing s, are at root tox ic molecules, ecolog ically disruptive, not easily biodeg radable, and quite often possess deleterious side effects. They quite often don't share well with others, this includes herbal medicines as well as other pharmaceuticals. You will need to check y our pharmaceutical medications and correlate with the herbs for any potential use problems (my books and g oogle scholar are the best sources, reg ular g oogle if y ou must). As well I am not g oing to go into contraindications here for these herbs (ag ain, they are in the books). As an ex ample: I F you are already on anticoag ulants, well, then y ou probably don't need lumbrokinase. Many herbs and pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in preg nancy . And so on. Finding the Herbs: Some herbal companies are making up these blends, y ou will just have to look around or ask. Because several (insert strong expletive) herb companies utiliz ed my name (without authoriz ation) and quoted some of my comments on treating coronaviruses with herbs in order to increase their sales, the F DA and F TC beg an making house calls on them . . . to their dismay . So, despite a senior white house official touting unproven remedies (injecting or drinking bleach? ) that are seriously dang erous, the g overnment has made looking at herbal companies who make claims a priority . Thus companies who are making up these blends have become, let us say , shy. The blends are out there, y ou just mig ht have to ask if it is not listed on the website. IF you cannot find the protocols pre-blended, y ou can blend them y ourself. J ust buy the individual herbal tinctures and mix them tog ether. (I f I say three parts of one, buy three ounces, if41 I say one part of another herb, buy one ounce, then blend them tog ether in that ratio). You can generally find any thing you need on the internet. Try amaz on, g oogle shopping , ebay , and etsy . Etsy is home to a g ood number of small herb companies which are selling herbal tinctures y ou will not find any where else. I highly suggest EarthAshram and Reverence B otanicals as a start. Note: I absolutely believe that avoiding the use of tinctures will NOT be beneficial with this infection. I do not have an alternative protocol for those who wish to avoid alcohol intake. General Approach to Treatm ent: Overall, in my opinion, the most effective herbal approach to SARS-CoV-2 would address three different situations: 1) reducing chance of infection; 2) treatment of active infections; 3) treating post-coronavirus sy ndrome. Here are my suggestions: Reducing Chance of Infection Besides all the endlessly cited (and now tiresome) admonitions about hand washing , masks, and self-isolation (and repeated ad nauseum by too many medical practitioners of various sorts), actively supporting a strong immune sy stem is the best place to beg in. Secondly , I think the daily intake of a sy stemic anti-inflammatory , an anti-coag ulant, and L -malic acid will help the sy stem be prepared if an active infection does occur. Thus: Pre-inf ection Im mune F (2 parts), Cordyceps part), part), part). daily . System ic anti-inf lammatory : The best I know of is a formulation of Mangifera indica standardiz ed to 60% mang iferin. I ts anti-inflammatory actions are very specific for the kinds of42 inflammation seen in damag ed lung s and other org ans. There are a g reat many very good studies on mang iferin and its actions in various org ans for the treatment of sy stemic inflammation (see google scholar). The only good source in the United States is Green Drag on B otanicals in Vermont. Dosag e: 1-3 capsules 3x daily . Lum brokinase : 1 capsule am and 1 capsule pm. L-malic acid : 600 mg daily . Treatm ent of Active Inf ections: What is needed are plants that have the following actions: 1) Plants specifically antiviral for SARS-CoV g roup of viruses (the strong est found so far are Scutellaria baicalensis (root - a potent (extremely potent), and the B ay Laurel ( Laurus nobilis ). Lonicera japonica antivirals for coronaviruses as a g roup. 2) ACE2 interventions. A) Protect ACE2 by blocking viral attachment. Specific protect ACE-2 ex pression, increase its activity (esp in the ag ed), and lower Ang -2. Herbs specific for this are Pueria lobata, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Ginkgo biloba . (in contrast to ACE-2 upreg ulators) to increase the presence of ACE-2 and help protect the lung s from injury : Crataegus spp and Pueraria lobata are specific. Rem ember: These are not drug s, they are modulators and they do many other thing s43 besides this. 3) Modulate cy tokine responses in g eneral ( Salvia miltorrhiza - a cy tokine adaptog en) and in specific: plants that can a plant but useful in this infection for a variety of reasons; I heart, kidney s, brain from damag e. Note: the herbs already suggested will accomplish this for most of the org ans without adding anything else. There will be additional suggestions for them in the ex tended protocol for treatment of post coronavirus treatment. However: one note on the kidneys: during active infection, to protect the kidney s, reg ular consumption of a strong nettle infusion and a tincture of nettle ( Urtica dioica ) seed is hig hly recommended. (Note: for y ears I was suspicious of occasional claims I heard about nettles being able to heal kidney damag e. However, my partner J ulie McI ntyre has been sug gesting it for some time and has reported sig nificant healing of damag ed kidney s, in one instance so much so that44 dialy sis was avoided.) To make: add 1-2 ounces of dried nettle leaf to a quart mason jar. Add hot water, let steep overnig ht, strain and drink throug hout the nex t day . (Some people think the used herb can be used ag ain at least one more time.) Do this every day. As well, take 1/4 tsp nettle seed tincture 3x daily , every day. During active infection, continual use of standardiz ed Mangifera indica at a hig her dose, a hig her dose of lumbrokinase (or nattokinase), and L -malic acid are all indicated to help protect the org ans. The use of an both a nebuliz er and a steam inhalant is strong ly suggested for infection in the lung s as well as the use of plants that can stimulate ly mph drainag e from that org an. Details follow. Active Inf ection P rotocol This is to be taken at the first sig ns of infection. I t is composed of three tincture formulations and some sug gested supplements. Note: This should be continued for two weeks after the cessation of sy mptoms otherwise the sy mptoms may recur. Please note: there are a few sug gestions for treating infection in specific org ans as well which will follow the initial formulations. 1) Antiviral formulation: Scutellaria baicalensis (3 parts), Dosag e: 1 tsp 3x day at onset, if infection becomes acute (i.e., more intense) 1 tsp 6x day. The more serious the infection, the hig her the dose. 2) Immune formulation: Cordyceps (3 parts), Angelica senensis (2 parts), Rhodiola (1 part), Astragalus (1 part). Dosag e: Same as number one. 4) Urtica dioica (i.e. nettle) infusion daily (make as outlined above) plus 1/4 tsp of nettle seed tincture 3x daily . (This is g ood for y ou for many reasons but with this infection it will help your kidney s stay healthier than they would without it. I t may , under some circumstances, help prevent or allow recovery from dialy sis.) 4) Standardiz ed Mangifera indica capsules: three 200 mg capsules 3x daily (Green Drag on B otanicals brand). 5) Lumbrokinase (or nattokinase): 1-2 capsules 2-3x daily (and please use an ox imeter to check blood ox ygen levels daily ) 6) acid: one 600mg capsule 3x daily . Probiotic: one capsule daily During Active Lung Inf ection: Besides the g eneral protocol, I suggest three thing s to treat infected lung s: 1) B ay laurel ( Laurus nobilis ) essential oil as a steam inhalant. 2) The use of a nebuliz er as outlined below. 3) Mucinex table, 2x daily . A. Bay laurel essential oil. This essential oil is strong ly antiviral for SARS viruses, it can be used as an adjunct to kill the org anism in the lung s. Note: This is to be a very strong essential oil. You can add it to the nebuliz er, as outlined below, but I have found it far too strong for that. To weaken it I sucked some up in a g lass46 dropper, then squirted it back into the essential oil bottle, then I merely sucked up some of the nebuliz er liquid itself and squirted the whole thing back in the nebuliz er. This picked up enoug h of the essential oil still in the g lass dropper to make it just about tolerable. Bay laurel essential oil as inhalant steam: 1-2 drops in a pot of boiling water on the stove. Turn stove off (please don't set the towel on fire), remove from stove top, cover head and pot with towel, and breathe in for awhile. (More than 2 drops will probably be too strong .) People doing this have reported g ood success with reducing the impact of the infection on the lungs. (And no, they probably won't let y ou do this in the hospital or a nursing home.) B. Nebulizer: 1) The use of a nebuliz er will help a lot. These are available inex pensively throug h Amaz on.com. All of them seem to work fine, I use a L eader brand, not sure it is the best but it works okay for me. The nebuliz er cups that comes with these machines are not g enerally very good. You will need to g et a different kind. 2. The nebuliz er cup. Respironics is the brand I use. You can g et them on the internet but not from the company that makes them without a prescription - which I find idiotic. They make two kinds (also idiotic). One is very cheap and is listed as disposable (don't g et), the other is noted as re-usable. Get the re-usable one. Just wash it out after use with very hot water and soap. The reusable one will stand up to essential oils if washed well after use. Mine last for a very long time, months. The disposable ones will beg in to deg rade from the essential oils within a few day s and y ou will start inhaling microparticles of plastic. Very much not a good idea. 3. You will also need: Saline solution for nebuliz ers. I use modudose saline solution for47 inhalation sold by Amaz on, 5 ml each, 100 to a box , $16.50. One 5 ml container per session. 4. Also needed: Effervescent g lutathione capsules. Glutathione is a potent antiox ident, normally present in the surfactant liquid in the lung s. People with severe lung infections and disease tend to have low levels of all antiox idants including glutathione. This will help reduce the inflammation in the lung s. I dissolve a sing le capsule in the 5 ml saline solution I have already put in the nebuliz er cup. (I t will fiz z and foam when y ou first put it in the liquid . . . after you have finally gotten the capsule apart that is.) I think Thernaturals, Reduced L -glutathione plus, enhanced absorption, ultra purity grade is the best one to use. I t costs $37.00 for 100 capsules. This will last a bit over three months. 4. Essential oils. These are pretty important. I put these in the nebuliz er cup in sing le drop doses the very last thing . I suggest the use of 1-2 drops of peppermint and 1-2 drops of eucaly ptus. The peppermint is strong ly anti-spasmodic (helping coug hing); both of the essential oils will help thin and liquify mucus and help it move up and out of the lung s, thus enhancing breathing and ox ygen ex chang e. C. Mucinex tablet (which is a 600 mg guaifenesin, ex tended release tablet). This will, along with the rest of the nebuliz er protocol, thin and help move mucus up and out of the lung s. Dosag e: one tablet am, one tablet pm. (There are also non-ex tended release forms by other companies, they all work fine.) To P rotect the K idneys Again, nettle infusion daily along with nettle seed tincture.48 GI Tract Exacerbations To help with the sy mptoms of GI tract infection, e.g ., the cramping and diarrhea. I have found the following to be helpful. For cramping : Viburnum prunifolium and other related species, aka cramp bark. Dosag e: 30 to 90 drops to 6x daily . This can take a few day s to kick in but it does help eventually . And/or: peppermint - either capsules that include essential oil or those really tiny coffee mints that are incredibly strong . . .just swallow 3-4 of ) root. to two ounces of the root in two quarts of water. B ring to boil, simmer until liquid is reduced to half. Cool and then consume during the day . Repeat every day until diarrhea is under control. Note: This should also help control any bleeding that is occurring . Please do not buy blackberry root tea bag s, they are useless. Do not try to substitute raspberry . You can alway s find blackberry root on etsy via the internet. Also: Ailanthus altissima (tree of heaven) is also g ood for a number of problems that occur during Covid-19 infections, including diarrhea. I t is the inner bark (that is, the white bark that peels off easily which is located just under the very thin g reen outer bark). This is an invasive botanical throug hout the US and much of the EU and thus pretty easy to find. Other actions of the herb: bronchial dilator, antiinflammatory (esp for the lung s), antifibrotic (esp in the lungs), anti-asthmatic, strong antiox ident, antimy cotic, antimalarial. Note: of g oldenseal or any of the other berberine-containing plants may be of use; they can sometimes initiate strong healing of the GI tract. 49 Extended P rotocol f or Various Sym ptom s Including P ost Coronavirus Syndrom e 1.0 F atigue A. For chronic, add: 1) Eleutherococcus tincture, 1:5 formulation as a tonic, \u00bd tsp 3-6x day. (Note: if it is severe or acute onset use the 1:1 or 2:1 formulation made by HerbPharm and some others, pulse every ten day s. When it becomes less severe, convert to the 1:5 formulation.) 2) Chronic fatig ue formula, see section 1.1: 1/4 cup of the powder, blended in juice or water in morning and ag ain just before bed. 3) D-ribose, capsules to 3400 mg morning and noonish or 1 scoop of powder am and noonish. B. For adrenal fatig tincture, 1/4-1/2 tsp 3x daily (must be held in mouth for one minute then swallowed, do not put in water), and/or . . . 2) Glycyrrhiza (licorice) tincture, 3x daily (not ex ceed nigra . 3) every day and/or . . . 50 4) 10-20 mg 2x 3) D-ribose, capsules to 3400 mg morning and noonish or 1 scoop of powder am and noonish. 4) L-arginine, 1000 mg 3x day. 5) Also of use: L -carnitine (500 mg 3x day), 1.1 Chronic f atigue f ormula This is very specific for reversing chronic fatig ue, especially if it is chronic. Note: all the herbs must be powdered . (To find herbs: Amaz on, g To find preblended: google search) To make: 1) Take two parts (for ex ample, 4 ounces) each of: . 2) One part each (for ex ample, 2 ounces) each of : chlorella, burdock root, ashwag andha, eleutherococcus, bladderwrack, and dried wheat g rass juice. 3) Blend them well in a very large bowl. Dosage: 1) I normally take 1/4 cup of the powder, blended in a blender in water or juice in51 the morning and evening before bed during severe episodes, only one in evening before bed to maintain. The dose can be adjusted up or down as necessary . 2.0 Lungs A: General: 1) Continue with nebuliz er protocol, this will help clear mucus and help breathing and ox ygen intake. 2) To enhance ox ygen ex chang e/blood ox ygen: Lysichiton root tincture. Dosag e: as desired or needed - normally I use for myself around 30 drops as needed or desired. Note: I have not used the eastern variety and I am not sure it will do the same thing . B. With shortness of breath: 1) Liquid chlorophy ll, 1 tbl in 20 oz water, once day , and/or . . . (any ), fresh or decocted leaf tincture, to 30 drops as needed. Note: non-decocted tincture may cause nausea in some sensitive individuals, most people experience no nausea. Ex tended use may cause watery diarrhea. 2) Lobelia inflata , fresh leaf tinture (dried is very inferior), 5-20 drops as needed.52 Or: dried seed tincture, 3-10 drops as needed. Note: the dried leaf is far more nausea inducing than the fresh leaf or seed, I would not use it. F or some people the plant is a strong emetic, I , however, have not found it so. Note: this can also help move mucus up and out of the lung s. D. Chronic B ronchitis 1) TCM formulation: Si Ni Tang (prepared licorice), 4 capsules 3x daily . Note: Best if used with ephedra (and y es, I still sometimes order it from China irrespective of what the F DA thinks I should do; it's a g ood herb but those meth heads ruined it for the rest of us.) E. Fibrosis (scarring ): A. To inhibit, reduce, or repair 1) tinture formulation, equal s, general A.

D. Ulceration/damag e to bowel wall and epithelia: 1) Fresh juice of piece of g reen cabbag e the siz e of a medium carrot (the core of the protocol - lowers inflammation, heals ulceration/mucosa), 4 fresh plantain leaves (if y ou can find them - look in the y ard, the plant really does help heal the mucosa and lower inflammation), one medium beet, 4 stalks celery , 3 carrots. Daily in am and just before bed. 2) The chronic fatig ue formula (see 1.1) will help heal the bowel wall as well as lower bowel inflammation and help normaliz e cytokines. 3) Althoug h most herbalists no long er recommend it, I still use and am a big fan66 of comfrey root powder for healing bowel ulceration, mucosa, inflammation. (The reason most people are skittish about the herb is due to concerns about the py rroliz idine alkaloids, PA, in the plant; I don't consider these a problem for short term use and have never seen neg ative impacts from them in 35 y ears of practice when used short term). I add one tablespoon to the chronic fatigue blend or else simply use 1 tbl comfrey root powder, 1 tbl licorice powder, 1 tbl marshmallow root powder. L imited intake to 30 day s. (If you have concerns about PA impacts on the liver, take with standardiz ed milk thistle seed as dosed under liver, 4.0.) I have never found anything better for healing damag e to the intestinal tract, even in cases where surg eons were prepared to remove larg e sections of the stomach due to ulceration. 12.0 K idneys A. To repair or e: 1) Urtica dioica (nettles): add 1-2 ounces of dried nettle leaf to a quart mason jar. Add hot water, let steep overnig ht, strain and drink throug hout the nex t day .
