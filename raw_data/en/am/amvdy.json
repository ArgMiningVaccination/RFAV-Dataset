From the story: \"Pregnant women tend to be sicker than women who are not pregnant when they get COVID. They have a higher risk of needing mechanical ventilations, being on a respirator, and a higher risk of death,\" said Dr. Kenneth Baker, Chief of Obstetrics at St. Peter's Hospital. He says self-reported data from thousands of pregnant women who got the vaccine shows no increased risk of miscarriage or other health issues. The new guidance officially moves the CDC away from its previous neutral stance on whether immunization is safe for pregnant people.
