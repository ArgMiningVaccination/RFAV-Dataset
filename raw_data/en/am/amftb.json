This allows the proper healing and adaptation for the body. When your spine becomes misaligned, it can cause neural dysfunction and stress to the body, leading to poor coordinated immune system responses. Chiropractic adjustments at Klein Chiropractic are a wonderful holistic and drug free treatment approach that can benefit the immune system by helping boost the coordinated responses of both the nervous system and immune system. If you are suffering from a subluxation (a misalignment of the spine that causes compression and irritation of the nerve pathways) all of your organs may be affected as a result. Chiropractors such as Dr. Daniel B. Klein are some of the best and most well trained doctors to identify whether you may be suffering from a subluxation. Subluxations are just one example of physical nerve stress that can affect the nervous system and lead to reduced immune function and increased vulnerability to many different diseases. In 1975, Dr. Ronald Pero, Ph.D., chief of cancer prevention research at New York's Preventative Medicine Institute, ran a study that measured 107 patients receiving long-term Chiropractic Care. These patients receiving treatment from their Doctor of Chiropractic showed a 200% greater immune aptitude than individuals who had never received Chiropractic care. But that's not all! These Chiropractic patients also showed a 400% better immune competence than people with cancer or other chronic and serious diseases. Dr. Pero concluded that, 'Chiropractic may optimize whatever genetic abilities you have so that you can fully resist serious disease...I have never seen a group other than this show a 200% increase over normal patients'. If you are looking to increase your immune system, it's time to visit Dr. Daniel B. Klein at Klein Chiropractic today! Even if you feel you may be fine, a simple adjustment by Dr. Daniel B.
