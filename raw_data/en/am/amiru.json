Chiropractor Waukee IA Advanced Chiropractic and Acupuncture How Chiropractic Care Can Help Many individuals in Waukee believe chiropractic care can do little more than relieve pain in the neck and back regions. However, chiropractic was developed to treat a much wider range of conditions than just back or neck pain. In fact, the first spinal realignment performed by D.D. Palmer, the founder of chiropractic, aimed to restore the hearing function of a man who had been deaf. After an adjustment that relieved the inflammation of neural pathways in the man's body, he could hear once again! After making miracles reality, D.D. Palmer sought to bring chiropractic's healing properties to the masses. Chiropractic works by making carefully placed adjustments to realign your spine. These adjustments allow the muscle tissues to properly support the spine and vital neurological processes that occur within it. When the spine is able to function without interference, the body is better able to facilitate healing, thereby relieving pain and restoring health in a variety of ways. Training of a Chiropractor Patients regularly underestimate the amount of training and education chiropractors must undergo before fully allowed to practice. In fact, chiropractors have among the most rigorous coursework required in the medical field. The amount of schooling required is on par with that of physicians. Once chiropractic students make their way through the basic medical coursework in their undergraduate studies, they must be accepted and graduate from a 4-year chiropractic college. Throughout their four years at a highly-specialized chiropractic college, their knowledge is constantly being built and tested. Our chiropractic team is ready to meet with you to discuss your needs.
