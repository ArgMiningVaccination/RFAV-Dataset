Aim of the Work: To assess the efficacy of Acupuncture compared with Homeopathy and with the usualconservative treatment (analgesics and physiotherapy) in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Patients and Methods: Seventy-fivepatients who had had chronic pain for at least 6 months due to osteoarthritis of the knee (American College of Rheumatology[ACR] criteria and Kellgren-Lawrence score of 2), all continue on their conservative therapy remained unchanged all-throughthe study. They were divided into three groups; Group I (Acupuncture group): Included 25 patients who were subjected toacupuncture at the standardized acu-point stimulation treatment without electrical stimulation. Sessions were done twice weeklyfrom base line visit to week six. Group II (Homeopathy group): Included 25 patients who were given oral doses of homeopathicremedies that were commonly used for the treatment of osteoarthritis (Arnica Montana, Ruta graveolans and Rhustoxicodendron). Group III (Control group): Included 25 patients who continued only on their pre-study medications .Painintensity on visual analog scale (VAS), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score and the Western Ontario andMcMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score were recorded for each patient before the beginning of treatment,during each visit and at the end of the sessions. The results were statistically analyzed. Results: Pain has improved statisticallyon both VAS and pain subscale of the WOMAC in group I. Also, the number of tender points decreased significantly and therewas significant decrease in the number of patients receiving analgesics for pain control at the end of the study (p<0.05). Inaddition, a statistically significant improvement in knee function was detected (p<0.05) on the total WOMAC score for kneeosteoarthritis and both the function and stiffness subscales of the WOMAC, in addition a statistically significant decrease in kneeswelling (knee circumference) was detected in this group, as well as the patient quality of life assessed by the HAQ score incomparison to the control group. There was a statistically significant improvement in the total WOMAC score, both VAS andpain subscale of the WOMAC, number of tender points in group II. Moreover, a significant decrease in the number of patientsreceiving analgesics for pain control was reported in this group (p<0.05).However, the decrease in knee swelling assessed by theknee circumference was statistically insignificant in this group. In addition, we found that the improvement of pain and functionwas statistically significant (p<0.05) in comparison to the control group (group III). Conclusions: Both Acupuncture andHomeopathy were effective in reducing pain and improving function of the knee but acupuncture was significantly moreeffective than homeopathy. Moreover, Acupuncture significantly decreased the knee circumference while homeopathy did notdecrease it significantly.", "sitename": "Egyptian Journal of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology", "date": "2014-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Document Type : Original Article Authors 1 Department of Internal Medicine - Rheumatology Division, Ain Shams University; Egypt. 2 Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Ain Shams University; Egypt. 3 Department of Complementary Medicine, National Research Center; Egypt Abstract Keywords "}
