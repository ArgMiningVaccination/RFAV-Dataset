But did you know there's a test that can detect lung cancer early, when it's most treatable? Using low-dose computed tomography (CT) imaging, doctors can now identify evidence of lung cancer well before symptoms appear. \"This screening is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer,\" says Dr. Mohsen Davoudi, UC Irvine Health pulmonologist. UC Irvine Health is offering free screenings to current and ex-smokers who meet certain high-risk criteria. The test takes just minutes. Results and a plan of care are available the same day. Call 844-UCI-LUNG (844-824-5864).

But today he's back on his feet and working out regularly thanks to leading-edge surgery immediately after the accident. On the Road to Recovery Our team of spinal experts won't let a devastating injury slow Barajas down The next day, he excised more bone from the back of Barajas' spine and anchored the cage in place with metal rods and screws. Both surgeries required tremendous surgical skill and precision. Barajas was treated for other injuries, too\u2014a broken right arm, fractured ankle and mangled right toe. The neurosurgical and neurocritical care team did everything possible to aid his recovery, even maintaining artificially high blood pressure to improve blood flow to the spinal cord. Heavily sedated for two weeks, Barajas has no memory of the surgery. But he does remember beginning physical therapy at UC Irvine Health. \"My right leg was in a brace and my right arm in a sling,\" he says. \"It was the hardest work I've ever done.\" After three weeks at UC Irvine Health, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital, where he continued to regain the use of his arms and legs. The hard work and intensive medical care paid off. In January 2013, six months after the accident, Barajas took his first steps. \"Just standing up was a shock,\" he says. \"I'd forgotten how different the world looks when you're upright.\"He left the rehabilitation hospital in March using only a walker. By October, he was driving and working at a gym part time. In August 2014, two years after the accident, Barajas returned to college with a new career in mind. \"I want to help people when they're at their most vulnerable,\" he says. \"I can do that best as a doctor specializing in rehabilitation medicine.\" Yanni describes Barajas' recovery as \"truly spectacular.\" Barajas credits Yanni: \"I'm truly blessed that he had the expertise to put me back together,\" he says. \"I'm blessed beyond belief.\" To learn more about UC Irvine Health neurosurgical spine services, visit ucirvinehealth.org/spineRuben Barajas remembers the accident in snapshots: Riding his motorcycle to class at Cal State Fullerton. An inattentive driver veering into his lane. Lying on the freeway, unable to move or breathe. Finally, paramedics giving him a lifesaving rush of oxygen. \"That first taste of air after struggling to breathe was absolutely beautiful,\" he says. He also remembers the ambulance ride to UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, his anxious family, neurological tests and learning at age 25 he might never walk again. His neurosurgeon, Dr. Daniel Yanni, explains: \"Ruben had two shattered vertebrae in his neck\u2014a severe injury that paralyzed his arms and legs. His chances of regaining movement were small, but we tried to ensure the best possible outcome by treating him quickly and aggressively.\" That night, Yanni removed the bone fragments that were compressing Barajas' spinal cord, replacing the broken bones with a metal cage, plate and screws. ucirvinehealth.org | 364 years old Athletic coach Brain cancer survivorWilliam Norris Two amazing, high-tech advances helped brain cancer patient William Norris return in record time to the work he loves best\u2014training young athletes.You can tell William Norris has always been an athlete. At 64, he has the slender build and body awareness of a lifelong runner and sports trainer. So when something didn't feel right during a training session in the summer of 2014, he paid attention. \"Everything I do involves coordination, rhythm and technique, and I noticed the rhythm on my left side was off,\" he explains. Fearing a stroke, his family took him to UC Irvine Medical Center, where doctors discovered a brain tumor. \"Tests showed that the growth was very rapid and needed to be removed immediately,\" explains Dr. Daniela Bota, a neuro-oncologist and medical co-director of the UC Irvine Health Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program. \"But the growth was buried deep within the brain so it would be difficult to reach without damaging tissue that controlled vital functions such as movement and speech.\" Soon after Norris was diagnosed, the UC Irvine Health neurosurgical team of Dr. Jefferson Chen and Dr. Frank Hsu removed the tumor. They were assisted by BrainPath\u00ae\u2014a device that fewer than 160 doctors nationwide are trained to use. The new device allows surgeons to maneuver safely through the delicate folds and fibers of the brain, displacing rather than cutting through tissue, much as a boat hull pushes water aside. This reduces the potential of damage to normal tissue. For Norris, the results were remarkable. He was released from the hospital just eight days after surgery. Three weeks later, he participated in a 5K walk with his family. \"It was good!\" he says.One month later, the long-time coach returned to UC Irvine Health for another revolutionary procedure\u2014 a single radiation treatment from a powerful new image-guided system called TrueBeam STx. The first of its kind in Orange County, this amazing machine delivers radiation therapy to patients in record time with unequaled power and precision. Instead of 10 to 15 treatments over two to three weeks\u2014the traditional time frame for radiation therapy\u2014Norris needed only one 10-minute session. \"During a single visit using TrueBeam technology, we can achieve the same results as we do with longer duration radiotherapy,\" says Dr. Nilam Ramsinghani, chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology. So accurate is the machine that it targets tumors within 1 millimeter\u2014the thickness of a sheet of paper. Several months after his operation, Norris continues to improve each day. He has some weakness and coordination problems on his left side, but doctors say those will eventually disappear. Meanwhile, he continues to exercise and to train young athletes\u2014the two great passions in his life, besides his family. \"Working out and training kids\u2014that's who I am,\" he says. \"I'm doing well, really well.\" To view a video about William Norris' treatment and recovery from brain cancer, visit ucirvinehealth.org/williamGoing the Distance Against Brain Cancer Leading-edge neurosurgery and radiation put lifelong runner back on track A Safer, Quicker, More Accurate Way to Destroy Tumors At the UC Irvine Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, almost no tumor is out of reach. The new TrueBeam STx radiotherapy system allows doctors to target the smallest and most hidden cancer\u2014all the while protecting normal tissue. \"We can do in minutes what it once took hours to complete, without the need for patients to have a metal frame bolted to their heads to keep them absolutely still, \" explains radiation oncologist Dr. Nilam Ramsinghani. \"The machine even compensates for coughing and breathing so these movements don't affect treatment. Our goal is to provide the highest quality radiotherapy in the safest way. There's no room for compromise.\" ucirvinehealth.org | 5 Primary Care Where Good Health Begins If you think you only need to see a doctor when you're sick, think again. Having a primary care physician you visit regularly is one of the smartest things you can do for your health. And now, UC Irvine Health is in even more locations so that you can connect with a primary care doctor in a community close to where you live or work. Our new primary care centers in Orange and Tustin opened in November, staffed by highly experienced physicians in the UC Irvine Health Medical Group. Your primary care doctor plays an important role in your health, partnering with you on preventive care while keeping a sharp eye out for signs of any serious health problems. \"The idea is to prevent or catch smaller problems before they become big ones,\" says Dr. Sajee Lekawa, an internal medicine specialist and medical director of the UC Irvine Health Medical Group. \"When I know my patients well, it's easier to pick up on any health changes that need attention.\" Best of all, when a referral is needed, the renowned specialists at UC Irvine Health\u2014 more than 500 of them\u2014are available to you and your family. \"When you're a patient and know you can connect with world-class specialists and hospital care, it puts you at ease, \" says Lekawa. \" And I know my patients will be getting the best care when I refer.\" That connection helped draw Lekawa to UC Irvine Health in the first place. \"Our medical group has a great vision for patient care . It's innov ative, inclusive and patient-centered,\" she says. The new primary care centers, which offer family and internal medicine, along with on-site laboratory services for quick turnaround of test results, are part of that vision.

The former finance professional had just placed first in her age category\u2014 for the fifth time\u2014in the Camp Pendleton Mud Run. But her life changed dramatically a week later when she learned she had ovarian cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes and other organs. \"You never think it could happen to you,\" she says. \"We had to move fast,\" says Ginsberg's surgeon, gynecological oncology specialist Dr. Robert Bristow. Together with vascular and urologic surgeons, he meticulously removed every visible trace of cancer during a 12-hour operation. Ginsberg began chemotherapy a few days later. Today, she's cancer-free and running again. Grateful for her expert care, she and her husband Philip recently donated more than $26,000 to support Bristow's ovarian cancer research. \"He saved my life,\" Ginsberg says. \"I want other women to have that same chance.\" Ovarian and other gynecologic cancers are challenging to treat because they often go undetected until the disease has spread. \"Finding the right care can literally be a lifesaver,\" says Bristow. Studies show that survival rates increase when experienced gynecological oncologists provide treatment. The UC Irvine Health gynecologic cancer team treats all types of female reproductive cancers, including ovarian, cervical, endometrial, uterine, vaginal and vulvar diseases. \"We combine our clinical and research expertise to create an individual treatment plan for each patient,\" says Bristow. \"Our goal is to maximize a woman's chances for survival, as well as her quality of life.\" Here, you'll find treatments not available elsewhere, like fertility-preserving therapies, minimally invasive and robot-assisted surgery and HIPEC (hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy). A unique treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, HIPEC delivers heated chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity to destroy any microscopic cancer cells left behind after surgery. UC Irvine Health also offers the only high-risk ovarian cancer screening and survivorship program in collaboration with the Queen of Hearts Foundation. As part of the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014one of only 41 National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers in the country\u2014UC Irvine Health physicians lead clinical trials that give patients access to new therapies before they're available elsewhere. If you're interested in supporting physicians who are pursuing lifesaving treatment options for gynecologic cancers, contact Gloria Crockett at gcrocket@uci.edu or 714-456-3750.

Symptoms are often painful and distressing, including severe stomach cramps, rectal bleeding and frequent diarrhea, sometimes requiring up to 15 trips to the bathroom each day. \"Many patients are teens and young adults,\" says Dr. Nimisha Parekh, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at UC Irvine Health. \"For young people, it's especially hard to cope with IBD.\" Parekh is one of only a few fellowship-trained IBD specialists in the country.If you have IBD, working with a team of specialists to customize your treatment is essential. This includes experts in both the physical and emotional aspects of the disease. The UC Irvine Health Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program combines the expertise of doctors from many specialties, including gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, radiology and pathology. Working together, they provide a definitive diagnosis and the newest medical and surgical treatments, including access to clinical trials. The team also includes specialized nurses, nutritionists and social workers, all of whom are sensitive to the social and emotional challenges posed by IBD. \"This is an exciting time in the field of inflammatory bowel disease, as there are many new medications available and more in the pipeline,\" says Parekh. \"With individualized management plans, patients with this chronic condition do very well.\"Meet and learn from others with IBD.
