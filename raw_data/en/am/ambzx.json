Defendant has represented that certa in doTERRA essential oil and supplement products (\"doTERRA Products \") are effective in preventing and treating Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"). 7. Defendant was one of se veral presenters at a January 12, 2022 Zoom webinar titled \"The Path Forward: Protocols for the Current Climate\" that included approximately 500 participants. The we binar was organized and promoted by doTERRA distributors who currently or previously worked as health-care practitioners, and the registration link for the webinar was distributed on publicly accessible social media accounts. Duri ng this webinar, Defendant introduced herself as a board-certified pediatrici an and made the following statements: a) \"Now we're going to go into our first topic, which is COVID prevention basics and it really encompasses nutrition. That is the foundation of your health. And LLV [Lifelong Vitality Pack] from doTERRA is amazing. It provides 12 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. It's totally antioxidant. It is comprehensive and bioavaila ble, meaning that your body absorbs it well. And so those three bottles are foundational. And then on top of that, we recommend the PB Assist for gut health and then the TerraZyme also for gut health because gut is 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 4 of 15 Page ID #:4 so important. Much of your immune system is located in your gut. And on top of that, On Guard, of course, in fact, everybody please find your favorite immune oil that you have around and use it. Use it frequently. Use it a ll three ways. So my favorites are On Guard and oregano, actu ally, and I will put a drop of each into a little shot glass of water if I have any sore throat and I will gargle and I will swallow a nd that takes care of so much of the beginning of a sore throat. And what's great about this Healthy Habits Kit is On Guard is in there. Oregano isn't, you can add it. But in addition to that, you have frankincense, which is highly anti-inflammatory and so good for your immune system. And the other thing that I love is the On Guard Chewables because that has extra vitamin C and D on top of what you w ould get through the LLV and it has zinc and beta glucan as well.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"COVID PREVENTION BASICS\" was disp layed. The slide included a depiction of the doTERRA Hea lthy Habits Kit and listed the $195 price. The Kit includes do TERRA Balance, tangerine, lavender, frankincense, and On Guard oils; this is the pediatri c prevention/support for COVID. And, again, it starts at nutrition. And I like this slide because 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 5 of 15 Page ID #:5 this is the order in which you wa nt to give these supplements because they progressively taste better. And if you know kids, right, it's all about the taste, oka y? So first, the IOmega can taste a little fishy, so, so good for the immune system, though, and good for the brain. I mix it with orange juice. My kids don't get juice usually, so when they ge t something with juice, they're like excited and it tastes good. So I mix it with orange juice, a teaspoon. And then do that twice a day. The A to Z Chewables are great. Two a day is the recommended dose. And then the On Guard Chewab le Tablets, it's recommended dose three a day. But if your ch ild has COVID, definitely six a day is the way that I would go. And then PB Assist is amazing. It tastes like candy, right? But it has no sugar in it. And that is a great one to take a lot of because you really want good immune health, even up to four a day is what I would recommend. Now, Immune Honey is awesome for kids, but we don't want to use any honey for a child that is less than one because of the risk for botulism. So for that ch ild, if you want to help with the cough, then you would make a mo lasses. So for greater than one year of age, I do give essential oils to my kids, just a little bit, though. And the safest ones, I would have to say, are frankincense and lemon. And also for sinus cups, frankincense and lemon are great because sometimes the Breathe oil is just a little too strong, that menthol component is a little too strong for them. So frankincense and le mon are great for respiratory 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 6 of 15 Page ID #:6 oils. You can mix it with coconut oil, rub it on the chest, rub it on the spine, on the feet, diffuse it as well. It's very effective. And something that I love to do for kids instead of giving pharmaceuticals or over-the-counter s for congestion is I love to give them baths, even like severa l a day, even three a day, and just warm baths helps to decr ease the congestion, and then when they come out of the bath , their pores are opened up, the perfect time to do a diluted essential oil, like frankincense or lemon on their skin and the body absorbs it very well.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"PEDIATRIC PREVENTION/SUPPORT BASICS\" was displayed. The slide included de pictions of and prices for various doTERRA Products, incl uding A-Z Chewables, IQ Mega, On Guard Chewables, PB Assist Jr, frankincense oil, and lemon oil.] c) \"Okay, yes, and then the SOC [Symphony of the Cells] for kids is awesome and it's such a wonderful way to bond with them, too. And just the really simple basic one will do, frankincense, tea tree, Aromatouch and peppermint. Remember always to dilute, though, because the pepper mint can be a little bit strong. And we didn't mention allowing your child to have a little bit of a fever to burn out the virus. Y ou can do that unless they have a risk for febrile seizures, and in that case, you don't want to risk that. But peppermint is a great oil for reducing fever. And actually, the Japanese peppermint that you can get free this 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 7 of 15 Page ID #:7 month has a higher menthol content.

This slide included the text, \"INFLAMMATORY PROTOCOL POST BATH: FRANKINCENSE, TEA TREE, AROMATOUCH, PEPPERMINT, COCONUT OIL.\"] d) \"Oils for a severe sore throat? I like to do a little shot glass of water with a drop of On Guard and gargle and swallow that about three or four times a day. That usually takes care of my sore throat. And if you're brave, you can actually add a drop of oregano and that works really well, too. And there's lots of studies that show that oreg ano is effective against a coronavirus, which is the family that COVID is in. The other thing is you can suck on the On Guard lozenges all day long. That really helps, too. Okay. And as Dr. Lisa mentioned, this is really like a sinus type virus. So doing a lot of the diffusing, the sinus mugs really are helpful. Putting actually DigestZen over your sinuses is very helpful as well. ... So those are just some little tips. Of course, it's symptomatic; you're treating your symptoms, but that's what the drugs do, too. So use your o ils instead and then use them frequently. You also get the immune benefits of it. You'll have side benefits.\" 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 8 of 15 Page ID #:8 8. Defendant has presented at a weekly Zoom webinar series that promotes doTERRA Products, titled \"The Do ctors Are In.\" The webinar has been promoted on publicly accessible social me dia sites as an opportunity to: \"Learn about essential oils from medical & dent al professionals. Ask your essential oil questions & inquire about the ailments you have.\" During the January 27, 2022 \"The Doctors Are In\" webina r, Defendant introduced he rself as a board-certified pediatrician and made the following statements: a) \"The second cool thing about essential oils is that they are effective. So if you can imagin e, those of you who see me on the screen, like this hand is a cell, okay? Every cell has a protective oily membrane that keeps out bacteria, keeps out diseases. And what happens is there's another disease that actually works inside the cell and that's the virus, like the COVID virus. It attaches to our cell and it works inside of our cell, okay? Most antibiotics, which is what we give for bacterial diseases, the antibiotics work outside the cell. They can't go into the cell, okay? But essential oils can penetrate through the cell membrane and work within the ce ll to kill viruses or to change their modulation, the way that they're expressed. So essential oils are very effective because they can get into a cell. On Guard, in particular, is a great oil for this time because it really helps with antivirus. It's a great flu buster.\" b) \"This is a very complicated slid e. I just want to say very quickly that garlic, black pepper oil and tea tree oil actually prevent the binding of the virus to your cells. It's a competitive inhibition at the cell receptor s ite of the spike protein. So 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 9 of 15 Page ID #:9 basically what I'm saying is that when you use those three oils, garlic, peppermint - I mean, black pepper or tea tree, it acts like a guard dog at the surface of your cell. It prevents the virus from binding. And then the other two essential oils I wanted to talk about in the study are lemon and geranium. Remember, where did I say the essential oils work in our cells? Where?... Inside of the cell, right. And one of the ways that lemon and geranium essential oil work inside the cell is that they don't let the virus replicate itself. Pretty cool, right? You've all heard about like mRNA with the shot and everything. Well, lemon and geranium essential oil inhi bit the mRNA transcription of the virus.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide with a diagram that included a depiction of a viru s clearly labeled \"SARS-CoV-2\" was displayed. This slide incl uded the text: \"Several plant products have shown potential in interfering with the activity of ACE2.... For example, the essential oils from... garlic..., Melaleuca...[,] pepper... can potentially latch onto ACE2 and competitively inhibit viral bindi ng and entry... essential oils from geranium and lemon prove to be effective against ACE2 by downregulating its mRNA and protein expressions in epithelial cells.\"] c) \"And then a lot of people lose their sense of smell and taste with the COVID and so here is a protocol to help regain that. You smell clove essential oil th ree times a day, 20 seconds each time; lemon and then rose and then eucalyptus in that order and 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Case 2:23-cv-00063 Document 1 Filed 01/05/23 Page 10 of 15 Page ID #:10 20 seconds each. Do that three times a day, and in 6 to 12 weeks, you should be able to regain your taste - sense of taste and smell.\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"Olfactory Training FOR LOSS OF SMELL\" wa s displayed. This slide included depictions of several different doTERRA essential oil products and included the text: \"Pick 4 oils of contrasting aroma... Smell each one for 20 s econds 3 times a day... Do this for 6-12 weeks... Olfactory cells regenerate every 30 days so give your body time... Loss of tast e, brush with cilantro oil twice a day.\"] d) \"So if you want to take a picture of this, you can. It's a protocol that we made using the doTERRA products for COVID. Okay?\" [Defendant made these statements as a slide titled \"Tips for COVID Prevention\" was displayed. This slide included the text: \"1. Take LLV full dose (4 per bottle, divided into AM and PM)... 2. Diffuse On Guard at night and rub on feet... 3. Apply 2-3 times/day On Gu ard or FLOOT over neck and wrists 4.

Take LLV and take zendocrine complex and/or zendocrine softgels 3 times daily for 2 weeks after shot.\"] e) \"And then here's another picture if you want to take that so in the case that you do get it. Thankf ully, omicron seems to be a little lighter of a strain, but you want to have your oils with you, you want to do early treatment because I do know quite a few deaths and I could have... them just - I haven't treated COVID patients myself in the hospital. I mean, I've done it as an outpatient, but there have - I mean, it's a serious thing. So if you're not feeling well, y ou do need to get treatment. And then I would recommend highly that if you are positive or feel like you are, just do a ton of supplements, a ton of oils, and all the things that we've done here, twice a day.
