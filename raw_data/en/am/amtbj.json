Inve stigators attempting to develop new antibodi es to E. coli and its Shiga toxins have completed their work; the project wi ll now move into Phase I safety studies under the aegis of N IH. An ongoing investigation of the lifecycle and metabolism of cryptosporidium parvum (Cp) identified possible pathways for effective new drug treatments based on the location of 4 enzymes unique to Cp, which causes diarrh eal illness. These projects supported essen tial military missions by advancing our understanding of the transmission and internal mechanisms of a spectrum of pernicious and/or common diseases that may be faced by military personnel at home or abroad. In turn , that understanding opens avenues to better control, diagnosis, and treatment of natural a nd man-made biological threats.

A pr oject investigating the circad ian photoentrainment pathway in a murine model has developed the reagents needed to determine th e chemical content of ganglion ce lls involved in the central circ adian oscillator; the investigators have also completed two promising histochemical pilo t studies. An exploration of electrochemical processes in the amygdala has par tially characterized a mechanism that appears im portant in the formation and consolidation of emotional memory, and thence in the development of neuropsychol ogical disorders resulting from ba ttle experiences, such as depression and PTSD. A study of the effect s of stress on suppression of the immune system identified a specific group of prote ins that are both elevated during stress a nd critical to protecting lymph cells. Two epidem iological investigations , one of Gulf-War dat abases and one of direct responses from active-duty submarine pers onnel, have begun to identify life stressors commonly reported by deployed warfighters. These studies supported essential milit ary missions by increasing our understanding of and ability to manipulate the physiological mechanisms of stress and immunit y, human sleep and seasonal cycles, and neurological changes necessary to short- and long-term memory. In turn, their discoveries should enable wa rfighters to stay awake longer with fewer detriments to performance; lead to bette r strategies for enhancing and preserving me mory and reasoning capabilities under battl e conditions; help understand and ultimately prev ent and treat neurospsychiatric illnesses such as depression and PTSD; and assis t deployed troops and their families to better prepare for a nd contend with common, significant stressors. ($ 0.997 million) (U) Combat Casualty Care: Representative studies include an ongoing investigation of signal transduction that has now identifi ed two antibodies pinpointing the mu opioid receptor in the brain, an e ssential step to understanding th e mechanism of opiate effects on pain relief and neural functioning. A controll ed study of individuals susceptible to ma lignant hyperthermia (MH) has demonstrated that MH-susceptible individuals exhibit slower rates of lactate removal with strenuous ex ercise, which may explain the sudden, sever e symptoms, similar to heat stroke, that su ch individuals can experience under physical stress. A proj ect that explores the resp onse of Schwann cells in neuroregeneration after removal of an axon id entified two optimal sites of re generation. These studies support ed essential military missions by further exploring the mechanism of pain control for an establis hed treatment; providing the grou ndwork for effective treatments to limit nerve damage and encourage re generation; and identifying a po ssible cause of life-threatening complications of the combination of exertion and injury common under heavy battle conditions.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) P103, University Research Initiative (URI). The URI has th ree primary objectives: (1) to support basic research in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines pertinent to maintaining the U.S. military technology superiority; (2) to contribute to the education of scientists and engineers in disciplines critical to defense needs; and (3) to help build and maintain the infrastructure needed to improve the quality of defense resea rch performed at universities. Paralleling these objectives, this project competitively supports programs at universities nationwide in three interrelated cat egories: Research . The main thrust of the URI is multidisciplinary research. Multidisciplinary efforts involve teams of researchers investigat ing high-priority topics that intersect more than one traditional technical discip line; for many complex problems, this multidisciplinary approac h serves to accelerate research progress and expedite transition of results to applicati on. The URI also supports the Presidential Early Career Award s for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), single-investigator research efforts perform ed by outstanding academic scientists and engineers early in th eir independent research careers. Education . The URI promotes graduate education in science and engineer ing for U.S. citizens through the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program. Beginning in FY 2003, the Awards to Stimul ate and Support Undergraduate Research Expe riences (ASSURE) program provides research opportunities for undergraduate st udents in science and engineering fields important to nati onal defense, to encourage them to continue their studies and pursue advanced degrees.

Through the Defense University Research Instrumentation Pr ogram (DURIP), the URI contributes to the university research infrastructure that is essential for the pe rformance of cutting-edge defense research. The DURIP allows researchers to purchas e more costly items of research equipment than typically can be acquired under single-i nvestigator awards. Through FY 2001, the URI also included the URI Support Program (URISP), which broadens the base of academic institutions participating in defense research by involving institutions t hat historically have not received much defense funding. (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: (U) FY2001 Accomplishments: (U) Programmatic accomplishments: Research . The Services and DARPA made 84 new awards as a result of th ree FY 2001 competitions for new multidisciplinary research effor ts. The first competition, resulting in 48 new awards, was for basic research underpinning high-priority technology areas such as: infrared smart and adaptive tructures; visualization of multi-source information; weather effects; self-configuring nano-engin eered coatings; and polymeric, smart skin materials. The second competition was un der the Department of Defense portion of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. As a r esult of that competition, the Services made 16 new awards fo cused on defense-relevant electronics, materials and biotechnology at the nanoscale. The awards are in areas such as machines and motors; energetic mate rials; electronic and magnetic structures; quantum computing; carbon nanotubes; and deformation, fatigue, and fracture of interfacial materials. The third co mpetition was for an initiative in critical infrastructure protection. Following that competiti on, the Services made 20 new awards focused on information assu rance and high-confidence adaptable software, including novel network architectures, networ k surveillance and software protection, high-confidence embedd ed systems, mobile codes, distributed computing, dynamic network management, and softwa re quality assurance. Multidisciplinary and PECASE programs begun in prior years are continuing, with new competitive awards under the PECASE program. ($194.068 million) Education . As a result of the FY 2001 competition under the National Defe nse Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship program, 285 n ew graduate fellowships were awarded for study leading to advanced degrees in science and engineering fields of importance to national defe nse. Another competition, part of the FY 2001 initiative in critical infrastructure protec tion, led to 12 postdoctoral fe llowship awards.

FY 2001 competitions resulted in more than 240 new awards fo r research instrumentation under the DURIP program and National Nanotechnology Initiative. Efforts begun in prior years under the URI Support Program were completed. ($54.742 million) (U) Selected technical accomplishments: Researchers at Arizona State University, working with researchers from the University of Illinois, the University of Notre Dame , and the University of California at Berkeley found a way to increase metal-oxide sem iconductor (MOS) device lifetimes, by substituting deuterium for hydrogen to reduce rates at which damage is caused by electron collisions with hydrogen atoms in the MOS material. Hydrogen atoms are added to MOS materia ls to eliminate holes that otherwise trap conduction electrons and disrupt device opera tion. Damage results when electrons, accelerated by the elect ric field in a device, collide with and ionize the hydrogen atoms. Previously, it was assumed th at this damage was caused primarily by a relatively small num ber of \"hot\" electrons, electrons accelerated by the field to an energy high enough to ionize the hydrogen. By measuring effects of electron bombardme nt of MOS material, the researchers surprisingly found that much of the damage was due to a cumulative effect of collisions by a larger number of lower energy electrons. Using computer simulations of the quantum mechanics of device material s, the researchers were able to attribute the result to the ele ctrons progressively exciting the hydrogen to higher energy levels, ultimately culminating in ionization. The researchers discovered through simulation and experiment that they could reduce damage rates 100-fold, and correspondingly increase device lif etimes, by adding deuterium (a heavy hydrogen isotope) to the MOS material, rather than hydrogen. Increases in device lifetimes are greatest in u ltrasmall devices but still significant in larger devices, parti cularly devices used at high frequencies (where deuterium substitution yi elds either a longer lifetime at a give n operating frequency or higher frequency op eration with the same lifetime as hydrogen). The computer simulation techniques and deuteriu m processing technology have been transferred to major semiconduc tor device manufacturers, which will result in longer-lived a nd higher frequency devices for military applications. UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 1 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INITIATIVE PE 0601103D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Researchers at Northwestern University extended their dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) technique to biological molec ules and coupled it with their successful binding of DNA to nanoparticles, opening up new possibilities for nanoassembly and for detection of chemical a nd biological agents. The DPN method uses an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip coated w ith an \"ink\" to write lines on a substrate that are as small as 15 nanometers wide and less than 5 nanometers apart. A detailed understanding of the trans port of \"ink\" molecules through the fluid meniscus formed betwee n the AFM tip and the surface enabled the researchers to deposit biological molecules su ch as collagen fibers, proteins, and single-strand DNA. The ability to write with single-strand DNA, with linewidths of less than 50 nanometers, is especially important because: (1) the DNA selectively binds t o complementary DNA strands; (2) the researchers developed a method to bind complement ary DNA strands to nanoparticles; and (3) that enables them t o use DNA patterns written on a substrate to attach nanoparticles in precise locations as bu ilding blocks for assembling complex, three-dimensional struct ures of nanometer dimensions. This nano-fabrication technique has importa nt applications in defense-relevant ar eas such as molecular electronics and compact power sources. In another application, the researchers and the Army tested a portable device using single-strand DNA bound to gold nanoparticles to detec t genetic markers for anthrax at levels lower than one part per billion, up to 100 times bette r sensitivity than current methods; the method is faster and le ss expensive than existing DNA-based detection methods because it avoids using bulky polymer ase chain reaction techniques to amplify and detect the bioage nt. Yale University scientists used atom inte rferometry for the first time to detect gradients in gravitational forces, which may h elp answer a long-standing military need for remote standoff detection of underground stru ctures such as tunnels and bunkers. With sufficient resolution, sensitivity, and noise immunity, gravity gradiometers can detect minute variations in gravitational fields caused by underground voids. Gravity gradio meters using atom interferometry inherently can resolve small-scale features due to the short wavelengths of the matter waves (approximately 10,0 00 times shorter than visible light). To get higher sensitivity, the Yale researchers used an atom interferometer with atoms cooled to low temperatures usin g techniques developed for Bose-Einstein condensation. This method for getting a beam with laser-like coherence (i.e., a small spread in atomic velocitie s that translates into a narrow range of wavelengths) improved the sensitivity of their interferometer relative to previ ous atom interferometers that used unco oled beams and passed them through slits to narrow the spread of atomic velocities (thereby reducing beam intensity). The resulting sensitivity is ten ti mes higher than conventional gravity gradiometers. Immunity to noise results from the gravity gradiometer's use of two adjacent and parallel atomic beams; that helps the device discriminate against noise from vibrations, which is critical for airborne applications, and othe r environmental factors (since the factors affect the two beams equally, the interferometer detects no resulting phase difference betw een the beams that would otherwise interfere with small s ignals from slight gradients in gravity). The atomic beam gradiometer also has significantly enhanced long-term stability. The resulting performance may allo w, for the first time, detection from low flying aircraft at altitudes up to 500 feet of tunnels and bunkers with 5-meter diameters. The researchers are working with the Department of Defense on a field demonstration of the technique. Calculations suggest that sensors based on atomic interferome try have the potential for increased sensitivity that could allow det ection of structures from higher altitudes.

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This program element funds basic research aimed at devel oping fundamental scientific knowle dge to support future DOD high- energy-laser (HEL) systems. HEL weapons sy stems have many potential a dvantages, including speed-of -light time-to-target, high precision, nearly unlimited magazine depth, low cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements because of no need for stocks of munitions or warheads. As a result, HELs have the potential to perform a wide va riety of military missions, including some tha t are impossible, or nearly so, for conventional weapons. These incl ude interception of ballistic mi ssiles in boost phase, defeat of high- speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and the ultra-precision negati on of targets in urban environments with no collateral damage. Research conducted under this program element develops the technology necessary to enable these and other H EL missions. (U) This program element is part of an overall DOD initiativ e in HEL science and technology being conducted by the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). The goals of this HEL JTO funded research are to provide the technology to make HEL systems more effective and also to make them lighter, smaller, cheaper, and more eas ily supportable on the battlefi eld. In general, efforts funded under this program element are chosen for their potential to have major impact on multiple HEL systems and on multiple Service missions. As a result of this focus and of close coordination with the military departments and defense agencies, this program element complements other DOD HEL programs that are directed at more specific Service and agency needs.

Over the long term, solid state lasers, because they run on electricit y, promise to greatly simplify logistics re quirements. Achieving this promise, how ever, requires that cost, power, and efficiency barr iers be breached. To enable these develo pments, research area s of interest inclu de laser materials with large fluorescence lifetim e and cross-section and the ability to operate at high temperatures, athermal la ser gain media, modular and scalable architect ures for laser power scaling, means of in creasing efficiency to in excess of 20%, operation in harsh environments, and corrections fo r thermally induced distor tions in gain media.

This research will examine the sc ientific concerns involved in developing and producing low-cost , manufacturable modules in the 100 Watt to ki lowatt range and in developing methods to combine modules to achieve the weapons power levels. The focu s on affordability could lead to drastic reductions in acquisitio n cost for future HEL systems. Areas of interest include laser materials and devices , nonlinear optical phenomena at high power levels, reliable and low-cost design techniques, and integrated optics and beam/pulse forming. (U) Fundamental research in modeling, design, and simulation of beam-control systems for military HEL applications. This research will examine the scientific concerns associated w ith atmospheric beam control, to include characterization effort s in aerial, battlefield, and maritime-like environm ents.

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) The MFEL program seeks to develop advanced, laser-based appli cations for military medicine and electronic materials researc h. Free electron lasers (FELs) provide unique pulse features and tunable wavelength characteristics that are unavailable in other laser devices. Thus, FELs broaden the experimental options for the development of new laser-based medical technologies. (U) The majority of this program is focused on developing advan ced procedures for rapid diagnosis and treatment of battlefield- related medical problems. Specific applic ations under investigation include soft ti ssue repair, hard tissu e surgery, therapies for thermal and chemical burns, warfighter visi on correction, and enhanced medical imaging. Laser applications will be clinically tested in unique program medical centers, leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approva l. There is high potential dual use fo r civilian medicine. Thus far, more than 30 clinical procedures have been developed in several medical specialties, including ophthalmology, orthopedics, thermal and chemical burn repair, and neurosurgery. Res ponsibility for the management and funding of this program is planned for transfer to the Natio nal Institutes of Health (NIH) beginning in FY 2003. (U) A small part of this program is focused on electronic materi als research. In this researc h, the high energy FEL beam is ex ploited for improved processing applications including more effectiv e microstructure, surface cleaning and modification of transport properties of microelectronic substrates.

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) This R&D program is a cooperati ve, jointly funded effort be tween DoD and DOE to pursue new and innovative warhead, explosive, and fuze technologies in order to bring about major improvements in non-nuclear munitions. This program supports th e development and exploration of new munitions concepts and t echnology preceding system engineering development. Through our funding arrangement with DOE, DoD resources are matched. More importantly, this rela tively small DoD contribution effectively taps the annual billion-dollar DOE RDT&E investment by accessing th e specialized skills, scientif ic equipment, facilities and computational tools not available in DoD. (U) The effort exploits the extensive and highly developed technology ba se resident in the Nationa l Laboratories relevant to achieving the goal of developing capable, cost-effective conventi onal munitions, and leverages Do D investments with matching DO E investments. The current program supports 38 projects in warhead technology, energetic materials, advanced initiation and fuze development, munitions lifecycle technology, and computer simulati on. A specific Service laboratory sponsors each of these pro jects. The program is administered and reviewed by a Joint Technical Advisory Committee co mposed of members from the Army, Navy, Air Force, OSD, and DOE. Projects are pe er-reviewed semi-annually by DoD Service Labor atory/Technical Center personnel in orde r to monitor technical excellence a nd ensure that the technologies under development address priority DoD needs. The program is integrated with Service efforts through the Project Reliance Weapons Panel and par ticipation in the Defense Technology Area Pla n for Conventional Weapons. The program is reviewed unde r the Technology Area Review and Assessment process.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED COST (In Millions) FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Cost to Complete Total Cost Total Cost and Title: P225 DoD/DOE Munitions (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2001 Accomplishments: (U) Fuzing is a key element in every Department munition sy stem and advanced initiation is an enabling technology for the nex t generation of warheads. It supports the development of advanced aimable warheads, target-adaptable warheads, and survivable hi gh- velocity hard target penetrators. This program continues to provide improved compone nt options and new architectures for use i n advanced electronic safing, arming and firing systems. The object ive is to provide a set of ch aracterized, qualified, generic components (and suppliers) and to demonstrat e their use in prototype de signs. In FY1997 an effort was initiated to reduce the size and cost of ESADs by a factor of 10 over currently fielded technology. Utilizing newly developed and qualified all-commercial components, a low-energy prototype ESAD was de monstrated last year that represents a f actor of 10 reduction in size and a facto r of 4 reduction in cost. While this technology en ables significant improvement in weapon de sign and capability, cost remains a barri er to utilization in low-cost, mass-produ ced munitions. An analysis of the cost driver s shows that we are close to the limits with t he current component designs and architectures. Theref ore, the focus of the component effort wa s shifted last year to exploit recent adva nces in microelectronics, micro-electromechanical systems, micro-lasers and optical initiation. These new technologies offer opportunit ies for increased operational capability from micro firing systems along with a further or der-of-magnitude decrease in size and reduced cost. In FY01 a significant test milestone in the effort to engineer an optically charged fireset wa s achieved by initiating a high explosive using a multilayer nanostructure cap acitor and a high voltage photocell. Efforts continued on component shock hardening and UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Joint DoD/DOE Munitions PE 0603225D8Z UNCLASSIFIED packaging in support of Service initiatives in high-velocity penetrators. The accelerometer to be used in new G-hardened fuzes was characterized in two axes in FY 2001 with one observed anomaly that is currently un der investigation. Towards miniaturizing fu ze systems using nano-technology, early progress has been made in the use of photolithography to deposit 0.5-mil lines and spaces needed for a microtransformer fireset application. Similarl y, a nanostructure dielectric f ilm deposition method for further miniaturization of firesets was demonstrat ed in FY 2001. The computerized knowledge ba se initiated last year to preserve and transition the advanced initiation technology base developed under this program is now operational and transition to the DoD ha s begun. This classified tool will ensure experience retention in archives and support governmen t laboratories and contractors. The two knowledge bases distributed this year contain expertise associat ed with firing circuits and sl apper detonators.

Both agencies desire high explosives wit h increased or tailored performance and decr eased sensitivity, and recent ac complishments have benefited both agencies. Like adv anced initiation, improved energetic materials are enabling technology for the next generation of weapon sy stems that will be safer, smaller and more lethal. Under this program a combination of evoluti onary and novel technologies are un der development. Conventional chemistry has been used to develop more powerful, less sensitive explosives. Nano-structured and engineered materials are bein g explored to increase energy density and ener gy on target by factors of three or more. Higher risk efforts are also underway to explore the possibility of metastable High Energy De nsity Materials (HEDM). Using conventi onal chemistry, a number of new candidate molecules have been synthesized, characteri zed and formulated. The development of ne w materials is based on theoretical molecu lar design. The structure, performance and sens itivity of new molecules are predicted computationally, th en synthesis is attempted . The focus is in two areas: molecules with significantly increased en ergy over current materials and ve ry insensitive materials with reasonable energies. As reported last year, another new explosiv e under development is LLM-105. It is dense, thermally stable and very insensitive. With 30% more energy than TNT it has possible detonator and booster applications and is an alternative to TA TB in special purpose weapons such as hard targ et penetrators that have to survive high shock loading. The synthesis, scale-up, and characterization of this material have been completed and its use as insensi tive booster material for Navy weapons applications is now being evaluated. Efforts to crystallize th e pure form of a newly synthesized energetic material with predicted energy greater than CL- 20, LLM-121 continued in FY 2001. Two other very fast burning materials, BTATz and DHT, ha ve been successfully synthesized and are under evaluation as enhanced performan ce gun and rocket propellant ingredients . Metastable Intermolecular Composites (MIC) developed under this program were the first successful examples of nano-structured energetic ma terials with significantly enhan ced performance. They demonstrated that ta ilored, ultra-fine reactant particles could dramatically increase the energy release rat e of thermite-like materials and provide twice the total energy of high explosives. The first applica tion of this technology is for lead-free percussion primers for small arms ammunition, and this program is now in engineering development under SERDP funding. The current focus is on the optimization of this material for other weapons applications via better diagnostic and measurement meth ods. A new bulk process for manufactur ing nano-structured energetic materials using so l-gel chemistry has been developed with the promise of precise control of material homoge neity, properties, and geometry. Samples of this material were manufactured this year for testing and evaluation in suppor t of reactive warheads that better couple ener gy to the target and applications that requir e very high thermal loading. Extended solid HEDMs are also under development. This work uses intense pre ssure and temperature to force elements into highly energetic bonding states that can be recovered to ambient conditions.

These materials are expecte d to be highly energetic, but characterizing them, a nd particularly verifying the energy conten t, has been difficult due to the microsc opic quantities of material available. This y ear, the energy content of laboratory produced high energy density material was prelimi narily measured. A special press was installed fo r production of milligram sample sizes, whic h can then be characterized more accurat ely using standard and improved techniques. The creation of the thermo chemical code Cheetah represents a major accomplishment of th is program. The code predicts the performa nce of energetic materials including high e xplosives, propellants and pyrotechnics and reduces the number of tests necessary to develop a new material. Cheetah 3.0 was re leased this year to DoD, DOE and DoD contractor users. This version includes new equations of state resulting in greatly enhanced st ability and accuracy of the cod e. A major effort is also underway to develop a suite of codes for use in predicting the re sponse of energetic materials in weapon s ystems subjected to thermal and mechanical insult. The objective is to reduce the number and cost of the current go/no-go insensitive munitions test protocols required to qualify a new system fo r military use and to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms and safety margins. As reported last year, a collabor ative effort with the Navy was in itiated to experimentally ass ess and validate codes for use in predicting the re sponse of weapon systems including the viol ence of reaction in cookoff accidents. Quantitative data on cookoff violence have been generated by both the Navy in small-scale experiments and by DOE in the scaled thermal explosion experiments. Data on both HMX based explosiv es and PBX-109 have been obtain ed for use in establishing the accuracy and range of validity of the predic tive models. The measured properties were us ed this year to successfully predict th e time to explosion in cookoff tests performed by the Navy. In order to preserve and transition th e energetic materials technology generated under this program, two explosives databases have been distributed to government labor atories and contractor s. One database, HEAT1, contains over 3,000 chemical structur es, and is a compilation of measured heats of formation for a wide range of organic molecules of interest to researchers in the w eapons community. A second database is APEX, A Pure Ex plosives Database. This database contains over 500 energe tic materials of different molecu lar structure to guide the synt hesis of new materials and ens ure the retention of important characterization data.

Over the last four years a new concept for hard targe t weapons, the Monolithic Ballasted Penetrator, has been developed for high-velocity delivery that significa ntly increases penetr ation into concrete and payload volume. A 350# penetrator of this de sign will be able to duplicate the penetration capability of our current 5000# class penetrators. Testing was complete d this year with a 2/3-scale prototype launched at 3360 fps into an oblique, laye red target that is characteristic of cut-and-cover buried structur es. The weapon successfully penetr ated a total of 16 feet of con crete interspersed with layers of so il and void. The penetrator maintained a stable trajectory and survived with no indication of de formation or cracking. A patent was awarded on the penetrator design, and it has be en selected for use in the TACMS penetrator Demonstra tion ACTD. An ongoing problem in hard target re search has been that differences are obser ved in the predictions from the various penetrator design codes used by the commun ity. Global parameters such as penetratio n depth are tending to converge, but differe nces in important details such as the maximum deceleration and trajec tory remain. The results can be contradictory predictions abou t penetrator survival or weapon effectiveness at conditions near th e design envelope. To address this issue an experimental test- bed program was initiated in FY 2000 to collect high-quality data on well-char acterized targets for use in code comparisons and val idation. A comprehensive series of penetrat ion tests into concrete was completed this year that is expected to resolve questions about t he effect of target strength, nose shape, penetrator sc ale, and penetrator velocity. Results have been distributed to the S&T community f or use in benchmarking and validating the current design tools. New munitions applications su ch as kinetic energy projectile sabots, wa rhead cases, lightweight gun barrels, and artillery projectiles place several stringent demands on composite material performance. D uring FY2001, failure characterization of both thermoset and thermoplas tic unidirectional composites u nder multiaxial stress states w as completed. This achievement enables analysis, evaluation, and de sign of stronger, lighter, thre e-dimensional, composite compon ents for advanced munitions. Metallography, mechan ical property, and chemical and processing tests indicated last year that an Air Force identified low alloy steel had good potential as a low-cost replacement for current ul tra-high-strength steels being postulated for future high-velocity penetrators. This was corr oborated in subsequent studies and in FY 2001 a commercial manufacturer entered into a n agreement with government researchers to pu rsue industrial scale development of this steel for penetrating weapons applications . In an alternative approach to hard target defeat, work continued on developing the concept of using a multiple shaped charge array as a precursor warhead to increase the penetrati on into concrete of a follow-through penetr ator. Last year, te sts conducted at Chin a Lake verified the hypothesis that jet in teractions can augment structural damage. Th is year, additional test s were completed agains t full- scale concrete targets, which demonstrated a large, but unoptimized, hole using warhead dimensions relevant to the Navy's SLAM- ER program.

To evaluate the acc uracy of the current materials models, an experi mental Ta liner test-bed program was undert aken. In this study, Ta EFP liners have b een fabricated to a generic design by four diffe rent process routes resulting in four we ll-characterized microstructures. The resu lting liners are currently being loaded with high explosive and will be fired early in FY 2002 in order to soft catch the slugs and compare them to the shapes predicted by the advanced material models. ($ 3.830 million) (U) DoD and DOE efforts toward muniti ons lifecycle technologies including stockpile aging, surveillance, demilitarization and disposal are coordinated under the auspices of this program. As the focus for demilita rization and disposal in DoD turns from open- burn and open-detonation to resource recycl e and recovery, altern ative technologies are required to turn waste materials into u seful products. Last year, a process was demonstrated that utili zes waste Explosive D available from demilitarization operations to form picramide, the starting material for synt hesis of the insensitive explosive TATB, a high value product for both the DoD and DOE . Since the existing inventory of Explosive D will be consumed by demilitarization activities in a ma tter of years, the focus of this project has shifted to include TNT as a r ecyclable material. Scale up of the TNT in clusive picramide to TATB process from 1kg to 10 kg in support of a Navy manufacturing technol ogy program is underway and will be comp leted by the end of FY 2002. The potentia l for cutting explosives both bare and encased in steel has been demonstrated using a femtosecond laser. Unlike conventional cut ting lasers that melt and vaporize material, the femtosecond laser abla tes material with no evidence of heating. It offers unique c apabilities for use in munitions demilitarization and manufacture. A dedi cated femtosecond laser has been built in conjunction with a smal l blast chamber for use in scoping experiments. Several experiments we re performed to determine cutting depths in different explosives and work continued towards an FY 2003 full scale, live munition de monstration of the laser cutti ng technology in a 10-kg explosive tank. To provide automated remote capability for munition demilitar ization activities, a robotic workcell for disassembling 155-mm projectiles was designed and assembled. High- level software was written for remote disassembly of artillery shells to expose t he submunition layers for handling and safing. This year, the capability to disassemble the M483A1 rounds containing 88 bomblets w as successfully demonstrated. Age-related degr adation of materials within high value weapon systems is studied in order to unders tand and predict changes in munition safety, perf ormance, and reliability during long term storage. Predictive models for materials and system aging are under development with a focus on solder interconnect reliability, co rrosion of electronics with an emphasis o n plastic encapsulated microcircuits, the agi ng of propellants, and the aging and fracture of adhesive joints. In the solder rel iability task, physical models were exercised on se veral applications in an effort to validate its output against test ve hicle experiments.

($ 2.460 million) (U) FY 2002 Plans: (U) Improvement of electronic safing, arming and firing systems will co ntinue with a focus on miniaturization, cost reduction and shock survivability for hard target penetrators. The developm ent of a micro firing system will continue with a design goal of a further factor of 10 reduction in size over the r ecently demonstrated low-energy systems (a nd a factor of 100 over currently fielded technology). Activities will include component development and evaluation, improved system integration, and demonstration of manufacturing technologies. In support of a viable fuze indust rial base, work will commence w ith Raymond Engineering and other suppliers on improving the manufacturing proces s for chip detonators and characterizing their performance. The miniature fires et project will focus work on the development of the solid dielectr ic break down switch. This will utilize much of the same nanol ayer technology demonstrated in this year's multila yer capacitor milestone completion. An adva ntage of this approach is the use of lower voltage trigger circuits, thus sm aller size, while maintaining reliability of ope ration. As low voltage fuze architectures are developed, it is anticipated that the ability to physic ally move or block fire train elements (e.g. micro energetic materials) will be a p rimary feature of out-of-line systems. In support of thes e architectures, the ability to integrate micro energetic materi als with MEMS device s will become a crucial technology. Accordingly, in FY 2002 processes to pr eferentially load or coat simp le MEMS structures with film energetic materials will be investigated. The testing program in itiated last year to evaluate the long-term performance and re liability of chip slappers in realistic military environments will be co ntinued. Toward the program goal of demonstrating a prototype ES AD in a high-velocity penetrator in FY 2003, charac terization of detonators, cap acitors, switches, etc. in shock environments for app lication to hard target munitions will be completed. Design issues cau sing current oscillations in multipoint detonator arrays utilizin g low- energy chip slapper detonators will be resolved and improved desi gn principals will be developed. Preparations will commence f or the large multipoint array demonstrations scheduled for FY 2003 and transition of the technology to DoD contractors will begin. Support and development of the knowledge base tool for preservation of advanced ini tiation technology will be continued with an expanded scope to include other fireset components beyond detona tors.

Concern from the DoD 2000 Weapons TARA regarding the need to maintain weapon lethality as weapon and platform size decrease will continue to be addressed in efforts to synthesize, characterize and sc ale-up new energetic materials with increas ed or tailored performance and decreased sensit ivity. The development and characterizatio n of new insensitive and new high-energy, h igh power materials will continue with synthe sis based on theoretical molecular design. Efforts to crystallize the new high energy molecule, LLM-121, in its pure form will continue. Efforts spons ored under this program will continue to exploit opportunities in nano-energetics by developing nano-structured and engineered energetic ma terials, including sol-gel de rived materials, and eval uating their effectiveness and utility for warhead applications. With the completion of th e LLM-105 synthesis and scale-up work, effor ts will focus on formulation for evaluation and even tual qualification as a Navy booster materi al. The creation of new HEDMs will conti nue, along with the development and implementation of accurate techni ques for determining crystal stru cture and energy content of th e newly synthesized materials. With the installation of a special press in FY 2001 designed to produce sample sizes of 100mm3, t he feasibility of bulk synthesis on CO-derived and nitrogen HEDMs will be demonstrated and initial measurements of their energy content with larger sample sizes will be completed. The synthe sis of additional extended solid HEDMs will also be explored. W ith the release of Cheetah 3.0, the emphasis in Cheetah development will turn towards implementing more sophisticated kinetic model s into the code that account for differences in explosive micros tructure including explosive part icle morphology and towards gene rating more accurate equations of state for det onation products. To support this work, a ne w impulsive stimulated light scattering spectrometer will be used to conduct measurements in a diamond a nvil cell to monitor the onset of chemical reactivity at extrem e conditions with great accuracy. Efforts to develop and validate computational tool s for predicting munition system response to operational threat and accident environments will continue. The firs t generation of simulation tools for munitions response to accident environments will be exercised against test data to validate th e codes and expand their ability to predict weapon system perfor mance and response in accident situations.

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U)Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) systems improve the capabi lities of our armed forces by en abling them to make better use of the information provided by such military sensor systems as rada r, laser, infrared (IR), hypers pectral, identification friend o r foe (IFF), and electronic signal measurement (ESM). ATR enhances the co mbat capabilities of our forces by increasing the lethality and survivability of our weapon syst ems and decreasing the time required to acquire and identify potential targets. ATR technology reduces our risk of fratricide by augmenti ng combat identification systems to improve our ability to distinguish between friend , foe, or neutral forces under high stress conditions . ATR technology provides significant worklo ad reduction for the intelligence force s by aiding the image analyst to exploit imagery rapidly and accurate ly. In an era of decreasing military manpower, improved ATR wi ll enable our forces to handle an ever increas ing load of sensory information in the comp lex situations to be encountered in the m ilitary missions of the future. ATR capabilities are becoming essential to the Warfighter, as the Serv ices pursue `network-centric` co ncepts for exploiting sensor imagery and information acquired through larg e arrays of sensors at all eche lons. Probability of target detection, recognition, and identification can be siginifcantly increased wh ile significantly reducing fals e alarm rates by exploiting mul ti-sensor fusion concepts for ATR algorithms. UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE October 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Automatic Target Recognition PE 0603232D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) Increasing ATR operational effectiven ess requires research and development to enhance sensors and algorithmic image processing. Additionally, improved, more efficient procedures must be developed for measuring and demonstrating ATR effectiveness. This is very important as the utility of ATR is highly dependent on the quality of the information provided by t he sensor system(s) and the ability to process that information effectivel y to provide reliable decisions with operationally acceptable f alse alarm rates. Service and Agency ATR efforts have concentrated on algor ithm development for conducting post-processing comparison and decision making which exploit improved digital computational capab ility. This program will focus on determining effectiveness of ATR, establishing benchmark metrics, and conducting and collecti ng single and multi-sensor data for potential reuse in Service and Agency algorithm development and objective evaluation. Consistent with the 1997 report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on ATR, this program will establish standard tests and procedures to provide an `honest broker` assessment of current leading candidate ATR's, as well as emerging ATR t echnology for the next generation of ATR systems. (U) The ATR program funds the in tegration and demonstration of advanced techno logy for field experimentation and assessment. The result of the ATR program efforts is the integration of th e demonstrated technological capab ilities and the capability to a ssess algorithms and various technologies. This leads to greatly improved unde rstanding of the Joint Warf ighting utility when assess ed in realistic operational contexts. The Milita ry Services provide air, land, and nava l technological superi ority, respectively, an d ACTDs rapidly prototype and transition technologica l solutions to specific threat scenarios. This program provides timely resources and flexibility to horizontally inte grate technology solutions across Se rvices and Agencies and identify new and emerging ATR syste ms with confidence so that this critical technology can be fielded more quickly.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE October 2001 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E/Defense-Wide/BA 3 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Automatic Target Recognition PE 0603232D8Z UNCLASSIFIED COST (In Millions) FY 2001 FY 2003 FY 2004 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 Cost to Complete Total Cost Total Cost P232 ATR (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS (U) FY 2001 Accomplishments: (U) Robustness of selected ATR's was assessed over a wider rang e of challenging operating conditions using innovative applicat ions of real, hybrid and synthetic imagery. The first DoD-wide \"Problem Sets\" were crea ted for government/industry/academia evaluat performance in a benchmarking ex ercise conducted/led by AFRL. This effort provided the basis for the creation of a D0D-wide standard procedure for the devel opment and use of expanded Problem Sets fo r SAR, EO/IR, LADAR, and Hyperspectral sensor/ATR evaluations. The Problem Sets a nd DoD standards for submission, review, approva l, and use of Problem Sets have been posted on the Virtual Distribute d Laboratory (VDL) website and distributed to the government and industry community. The application of such multi-sensor synthetic imagery in High Level Architecture (HLA) simulations was assessed as a technique to determine ATR effectiveness dynamically. In the hyperspectral area, an end-to-end performance mode l, incorporating sensor and processor models, was validated. The end-to -end model was used to conduct performan ce and subsystem trade off analyses between hyperspectral sensors and their ATR's. Serv ice models developed to predict ATR perfor mance were refined to include evolving hi gh fidelity multi-mode sensors. An initial assessment of sensor fusion for ATR was conducted by th e services reported at a DoD-wi de technology review. This will pave the way for further work in refining network-centr ic sensing and ATR processing using sensor fusion algorithms and advanced architectures for information fusi on to reduce false alarms and increase situational awareness.

Efforts will be initiated in address the dete ction and discrimination of unde rwater UXO. (U) FY SERDP will continue to aggres sively pursue technologies to address the Service's high priority environmental issu es. The sustainability of our training and test ing ranges as well as our in stallation infrastructure is a key focus area. The envi ronmental issues surrounding our bases are both numerous and varied. The impacts of live fire training includes not only the UXO issue, but also the contamination of the soil and ground water with explos ives, as well as the impact of noise from munitions on threaten ed and endangered species. Threatened and endange red species are also impacted by range ma nagement activities and the potential loss of habitat. Air emissions from both live fire training and military platforms (aircraft, ships and tanks, etc) contribute to regi onal air pollution and are becoming an issue in non-attainment areas. All of these issues are exacerbated by the encroachment of urban and suburban development upon our installations. SERDP will continue a comprehensive research agenda to address th ese issues. Research in all five thrust areas contribute to t he solutions. Cleanup projects address the remediation of energetic s in soil and groundwater. Comp liance projects develop method s to measure and control air emissions as well as determine the fate a nd effect of explosives in the environment. Conservation proj ects determine the impact of military operations on threatened and endangered species and develop methods and protocols for managing our natural and cultural resources. The development of \"gre en\" munitions and weapon systems that will not impact on the environment as well as low-emissions power sources are core objectives of pollution prevention. And finall y, the increased emp hasis on UXO detection, discrimination an d remediation will continue.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT: (U) In May 1998 the Secretary of Defense appointed Commander-in- Chief, United States Joint Forces Command (formerly the US Atla ntic Command), as the Defense Department's Executive Agent fo r Joint Experimentation. Subsequently, the Department realigned resources to suppor t the Joint Forces Command's new role. In FY 1999 funds from this Program Element were redirected to support the initial stand-up of Joint Forces Command' s Joint Experimentation Directorate. Funding for joint experiments was transferred to Joint Forces Command through the Navy. Funding to support the J oint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) concept development, the Information Technology Backplane (ITB), and Technology Feeder Support (TFS) for joint e xperimentation was retained in this PE. Program Element 0603727N was established to provide Joint Forces Command with its own funding source in FY 2000. (U) The Joint Warfighting PE supports three related activities: the JAWP, the ITB, and TFS for Joint Experimentation. While th ese activities strongly support Joint Forces Command's joint experimentation efforts, a sep arate program element has been retained since the activities support other organizations in addition to Joint Forces Command, and they require a degree of independence from Joint Forces Command to function as envisioned . (U) The JAWP was established by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), with the support of the Vice Chairman of the Joi nt Chiefs, to serve as a catalyst for innovation and change. This program's focus is on assisting in the formulation and assessment of advanced concept s and capabilities, plus identifying enabling technologies and integration options for the De partment. These concepts drive changes in the doctrine, or ganization, training and education, materiel, leadership and facilities (DOTMLF) of the Services. Th e JAWP serves a key role in identifying, exploring and evaluat ing breakthrough warfighting capabilities. It builds on the lessons learned from earlier Servi ce experiments that have underscored the importance of having a firm conceptual basis upon which to build experiments. The JAWP concentrates on joint, vice Se rvice-unique, revolutionary concep ts. In identifying and elabor ating innovative joint concepts and capabilities, and associated enabling technologies, the JAWP w ill not only take into account Service efforts, but those of CINCs and Defense agencies as well. The JAWP promotes integration, conducts experiments and assi sts in implementation. The JAWP's work complements and su pports the activities of Joint Forces Command, the Joint Staff and the OSD. It provides an independent source for formulating advan ced concept candidates for joint experimentation.

The JAWP Analytical Project Office (JAWP-APO), a jointly man ned activity established by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, consists of military personnel from the four Services. The civilians provide a level and qual ity of expertise not generally available in the Department of Defense. The active duty milita ry members provide a current operational perspective to concepts under investigation and serve as a vital link to ongoing relevant activities in the Services. (U) The ITB provides an advanced network infrastructure that extends commercial capabilities to provide capabilities needed to meet JV2020 needs. Information Superiority is a key JV2020 building block and the ITB provides the means to experiment with the digital transmissi on capabilities that will be available in five years. The ITB is not a new physical netw ork. It is a virtual network that capitalizes on existing physical networks such as the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), the Defense Information System s Agency (DISA) - Defense Adva nced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA) Leading Edge Services Network (DISN-LES), the Defense Research and Engin eering Network (DREN), and the experimental Advanced Technology Demonstration Network (ATDnet). The ITB has many users from sites served by existing networks, but the funding included in this PE is the in cremental funding needed to support joint experimentation. For example, this PE provides the circuit costs to extend the ITB from the experimentation sit e to the nearest point on the backplane (where no other network exists), and only the \"extra\" backplane costs generated by the Joint Warfighting Experiments. Since joint experiments are very dependent on advanced distributed si mulation, or on limited, live, command post exercises that are being driven by simulat ions, a robust network is needed to interconnect the various sites. These simulations press the state of the art in networking capability, including that of re quiring high-bandwidth, low-latency Type-I encryption bandwidth-intensive app lications such as video telec onferencing and high definition television. (U) The third effort supported by this PE is TFS for join t experiments. There are many Technology Demonstrations (TDs), Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs), and Advanced Concep t Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) that can provide advanced technologies to support joint experiments. For example, the Joint Staff has prepared 72 desired operati onal capabilities based on JV2020 concepts and 21st Century Challen ges. For each Challenge, the Joint Staff has prepared roadmaps that provide opportunities to assess each Challenge. The road map for the battlefield awarene ss challenge shows 42 ACTDs that have the potential to demonstrate some aspect of a d esired operational capability supporting battlefield awareness. This effort provides technology managers the resources to expand the scope of a test or demonstration to collect data for the joint staff or JFCOM, thereby leveraging t he OSD and Service ACTD investment. The Technology Feeder Support effort is also bei ng used to initiate a Red Team Pilot Project (DoD Adaptive Red Te am - DART) for Joint Forces Command. The DART will participate in Joint Forces Command Concep t Development and Experimentati on to provide an independent assessment that will ensure that product quality stays high and credible. This sour ce of funding, which is separate from other Joint Forces Experim entation funding, will provide the necessary independence.

Building on its FY 98 thr ough FY 00 experiences, JAWP focused on enh ancing joint operational- level command and control, ISR integration, and joint force application. To help evolve Joint Forces Command's Rapid Decisive Operations concept and support DARPA's and the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) development e ffort, JAWP planned, developed pa rtnerships, coordinated, and i nitiated the Future Joint Force I Experiment, investigating innovative command and control a pplications, integration of theater and tactical ISR efforts, and employment of robust air and ground robotic sensor suites using wargames, constructive modeling, and human-in-the-loop simulation. This effort is a partner ship that engaged the Army and Air National Guard, the UK, Canada, the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, the Army's Mounted Maneuver Battle Lab (MMBL), IDA, RAND, and DARPA. This extensive partnering effort recognizes that transformation requi res a common perspective on challenges and solutions, including the perspectives of allies. In support of the Joint Staff, JAWP develope d a definition and operational framework for effects-based operations and developed a draft joint operational concept for dominant maneuver. Included in all of JAWP's work are vulnera bility assessments using \"Red Teaming\" techniques that identify w eaknesses and help avoid surprises. In support of OSD and the Joint Staff, JAWP complete d development of a DoD Roadmap for Urban Operations. JAWP's ou treach efforts have engaged: Israel and the UK in effects-b ased planning and operations; all NATO partners in urban warfare concept development; th e UK, Australia, and Canada in joint concept development and experimentati on; and Germany and Singapore in possible fu ture participation in joint experimentat ion. In support of Joint Forces Command, JAWP planned, coordinated, and in itiated cooperation with the Warrior Prep Ce nter at Ramstein, Germany to support conc ept development efforts with the Multinational Interoperability Council na tions\u2014Britain, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia. Finally, JAWP supported the Secretary of Defense's Transformation Panel with briefings and con cept papers that resulted in recommendations included in the current Defense Plannin g Guidance. ($4.500 Million) (U) The ITB support for wide-area network connectivity for join t warfighting experimentation continued, as did the ongoing task of transitioning emerging technology from advanced research network testbeds. Specifica lly, Unified Vision 01 was supported and executed, while assistan ce was given to design Millennium Challenge 02. The Future Combat System (FCS) seri es of experiments linking JFCOM with the MMBL at Ft. Knox was supp orted using the DREN. Initial implementation of secure (Kerberized) network management protocols (SNMPv3) across selected ITB sites was demonstrated. Development and evaluation of advanced security/information assurance devices and tools, su ch as ATM and host-based layered firewall technologies, was beg un in the lab.

The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Advanced Systems and Concepts), in coordination with JFCOM and the Joint Staff, assisted in determining which ACTDs, ATDs, and /or Technology Demonstrations best support JFCOM's experi mentation events. Funding was provided to the selected technology managers to suppo rt a joint experiment. Funding was provided for efforts such as system integration, and logistics and test support. Pl anning and preparations continu ed for incorporation of as many technology demonstrations as possible into the primary FY 2002 joint experiment, MILLENIUM CHALLENGE 2002. Initial funding was provided to the (DART) which evaluated the major joint experiment of 2001 (Unifi ed Vision 01) and prepared to observe and critique MILLENNIUM C HALLENGE 2002. ($1.638 million) (U) FY 2002 Plans: (U) The JAWP will continue its Future Joint Force Experiment, bu ilding toward FY 04 completion of the Rapid Decisive Operations (RDO) series of human-in- the-loop simulation experiments. The effort will incorporate in sights from JAWP's Future Joint Force I experiment and Joint Fo rces Command's Unified Vision 01 experiment to build the foundations for a beyond 2010 forcib le entry operations capability addressing a broad range of poten tial contingency environments. The experiment will leverage the results of past JAWP and JFCOM experiments to exploit networked ISR capabilities as an integrated tool of warfare; refine joint command and control organization; integrat e manned and unmanned capabilities for reconna issance and combat applications; and ex plore innovative ways to overcome opponents' protective measures. Opportunities will be identif ied to leverage and integrat e Service, allied, and other agency programs. Through workshops and limited objective experiments, JAWP will also help integrate the inde pendent joint command and control initiative s of PACOM, CENTCOM, JFCOM, and Service command and control capabilities to help attain the Secretary's objective of establishing a more standardize d and responsive joint command and control structure worldwide. Data co llection and independent analysis will be conducted and used to produce reports and pa pers intended to inform the OSD, Joint Staff and the Joint Forces Command leadership of experiment ation results and to inform transformation choices. Vulnerabi lity assessments and \"Red Teaming\" will be conducted to improve the validity and robustness of experimentation. The JAWP will help identify and exploit opportunities facilitating the early transition of new concepts and technol ogies to operational capabilities.

The first effort reflected agreement by the Departments of Defense a nd Veterans' Affairs to support research on PTSD, which has been found to a ffect personnel while still on active duty or afte r they leave milita ry service. Th is research focuses on PTSD among women, addressing symptoms and h ealth outcomes, etiology and c ontributing factors, effective preventive measures, and possible treatments. A research protocol involv ing two types of interventions has been approved and i s being implemented. The second research effort focused on \"Occupational Lung Diseas e/Review of Biopsies\" as provided by Congress. This study is addressing the exte nt to which lung diseases, especially sa rcoidosis, may have been misdiagnosed among Navy personnel and to evaluate the relations hip between sarcoidosis and ot her lung diseases and service aboard Navy ships. In F Y 2001, the project established an Independent External Scientific Advisory Committee with nationally-recognized members and a Public Policy Advisory Committee with community advocates. C onsensus on central questions to be addressed and scientific approach were established.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : The Department of Defense (DoD) recognizes the need to rapidly develop and fiel d new technological capabilities, and to explore new and innovative operational and organizational con cepts associated with those capabilities. Such advances ar e critical to the objective of supporting the Chairman's Joint Vision 2020 . Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs) are low-to-moderate risk vehicles for pursuing those objectives. ACTDs are capability demonstrati on and evaluation programs in which the deve lopment and employme nt of technology a nd innovative, operational concepts by the military user are the prim ary focus. The demonstrations typically involve a material de velopment organization that develops the mature technology applications, and a warfighting sponsor that assesses the military utility. In addition to stimulating innovation, ACTDs offer three other significant opportunities. They provide experienced co mbat commanders with an opportunity to de velop operational con cepts and operational requirements to fully exploit the technologies provided. They allow th e users an opportunity to assess the milita ry utility of the pr oposed capability prior to a major acquisition commitment. They also provide military Services with a mechanism for co mpressing acquisition cycle time, significantly improving their resp onse to priority operational needs. As such, ACTDs are a key element of the DoD acquisition reform process. They do not substitute for formal DoD acquisit ion procedures, but can speed effective operational employment of technologies which are verifi ed by combatant commands to ha ve demonstrated military utility . Since FY 1999, ACTDs have been an integral part of the Joint Experimentation pro cess under U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM). The Deputy Under Secr etary of Defense (Advance Systems and Concepts) (DUSD (AS&C)) works closely with JFCOM to prepare its annual Campaign Plans in order to insure ACTDs int egrate technology and develop new concepts of operation to fully leverage with and integrate into future joint experiments. ACTDs continue to fill a critical and unique role in addressing joint warfighting requirements. In many cases, ACTDs focus attention on capabilities required by joint commanders t hat cannot be satisfied by the acquisition investment of a single military service. (U) Ideally, the Military Departme nts and Defense Agencies provide most of the funding (80-85 percent) for ACTDs. This encoura ges Service/Agency commitment to the ACTD. Funding from this program element is used: 1) to support actual demonstrations and experimental emplo yment; 2) to provide hardware to demonstrate military utility; and 3) to fund tran sition, interim capability operations and support for up to two ye ars after the operational UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) Date: February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense-wide/BA 3 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE ADVANCED CONCEPT TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATIONS PE 0603750D8Z UNCLASSIFIED demonstration phase of the ACTD. This two-year phase provides th e Service, Agency, and operators with adequate time to continu e to address the issues of supportability, maintainability and trai ning identified by the ACTD. (U) Since program commencement in 1994, DUSD(AS&C) has initiated 99 unclassified ACTDs. Thirty-two of these have been complet ed as of the end of Fiscal Year 2001, resulting in 72 distin ct products which have evolved as follows : (a) six entered engineering, and manufact uring development; (b) sixteen have transitioned to acquisition; (c) twenty-seven have integrat ed with current operational software systems, such as Global C ommand and Control System (GCCS) and Global Combat Support System (GCSS); and (d) twenty-thr ee hardware-based solutions have previously been or currently are operationally deployed. Over twenty ACTDs were used during Operation Allied Force, some of whic h are still actively empl oyed in peacekeeping operations. Subsequently, greater than thirty ACTDs are deployed, or are preparing for deploymen t/accelerated development, in support of Operations Endur ing Freedom and Noble Eagle, as well as for Homeland Security operations. (U) Both the Science and Technology (S&T) and the warfighter communities submit candidate ACTDs for an annual review cycle. Th e candidates proposed by the S&T community reflect t echnological opportunities enabled by recently demonstrated technology. The candidates proposed by the warfighter community (Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Unified Commanders in Chief (CINCs) and military Service and agency operational organi zations) respond to a deficiency in military capability or to an emerging military need. For each candi date, it is necessary to confirm that the pro posed concept is based on technology that is sufficiently mature for rapid exploitation, and that the capability addresses a priority military need. Candidates are organized into the Joint Vision 2020 operational concepts of Dominant Maneuve r, Precision Engagement, Full Dimensional Protection and Focused Logistics. (U) The maturity of the technology associated with the proposed capability is assessed by the DUSD (AS&C), with assistance of senio r members of the Science and Technology community (known as the Breakfast Club). The Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) establishes the priority of the ACTD candidates by military need. The principal management tools for the ACTD are the Implementation Directive and Management Plan. Each approved ACTD will be described in these top-level documents which provide details of the demonstration/evaluation, the main objectives, appr oach, critical events, measures of success, transition options, participants, schedule, and funding. Review of the candidates for FY 2002 ACTDs began in February 2001. Eighteen ACTD candidates were recommended and prioritized by the JROC. Based on fundi ng availability, fifteen ACTD programs were subsequentl y selected to begin. Funding for new FY 2002 ACTDs is approximately $35 million. (U) The typical timeline of one-to-four years for the operational de monstration phase of an ACTD is compressed compared to norm al acquisition timelines for fielding an operational capability. These shorter schedules are made possible because ACTDs incorporate mature or nearly m ature technology and, therefore, forgo time-consuming technology de velopment and technical risk re duction activities. At the end of the ACTD, the user sponsor is able to determine if the capability provided by the ACTD t echnology has sufficient utility to warrant procurement. If there are significant shortcoming s, their options are to either pursue an advanced technology demonstration to improve performance, or not pursue the technology any further at this time. In cases where the operational user is satisfied the prototype has significant utility, the prototype can be retained as an interim capability. The Department the n moves quickly to enter the formal acquisition process to acquire needed quantities or, if sufficient, to make fully operational those residual assets already pro duced as demonstration prototypes.

This includes in-depth review by the ACTD operational sponsors, usually the CINCs (such as United States Joint Forces Command ( JFCOM)). Twelve ACTDs were completed in Fiscal Year 2001. Th e Unattended Ground Sensors and the Miniature Air-Launched Decoy each transitioned to ac quisition. Ten ACTD software products were integrated within operational systems, su ch as Link-16 installation at the Combined Air Operation Center supporting Operation Allied Force. Also, eight hardware-based products were operationally deployed to Operations Allied Force and Southern Watch, as well as Enduring Freedom, Noble Eagle and for Homeland Security. Some AC TD products remained in theater as part of Kosovo peacekeeping operations. Thirty pe rcent of all ACTDs participated in Operations Enduring Freedom and Noble Eagle, as well as Homeland Security operations. For example, Rapid Terra in Visualization ACTD sensors proved invaluable to the Federal Em ergency Management Agency, providing detailed, airborne data at the World Trade Cent er. Fifteen new ACTDs were started in FY 2001 (see specific accomplishments below): Active Network Intrusion Defens e, Adaptive Battlespace Awareness , Advanced Tactical Laser, Advanced Technology Ordnance Surveillance, Area Cruise Missile Defense, Coalition Comb at Identification, Coalition Theater Logi stics, Coastal Area Protection System, Hunter Standoff Killer Team, Joint Area Clear ance, Loitering Electronic Warfare Killer, Network-Centric Coll aborative Targeting, Personnel Recovery Extraction Survivability Aided by Smart Sensors, Tactical Missile System - Penetrator and Theater Integrated Planning System.

The MSRCs are respons ible for as large a fracti on of DoD`s S&T and DT&E computational workload as feasible. These MSRCs provide extensive capabilities to address user requirements for hardware, software, and programming environments. A limited set of smaller shared resource centers, Di stributed Centers (DCs), augment the MSRCs to form the total HPCMP computational capability. Di stributed Centers address criti cal HPC requirements that cannot be met at MSRCs, such as rea l- time, and near real-time computing requirements, and leverage significant HPC and mission expertise located at these remote sit es. The MSRCs and DCs are currently interconnect ed with all S&T and DT&E user sites vi a the Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN). Additionally, th e Software Application Support In itiative develops critical co mmon DoD applications programs that run efficiently on advanced HPC syst ems through the Common HPC Software Support In itiative (CHSSI). In addition to CHSSI, software activities build technology transiti on activities with academic institutions, train users, and build collaborative thr ough Programming Environment and Training (PET). Also technology is being developed to protect high value HPC application codes through a Software Protection effort. (U) True modernization of DoD`s HPC capability and fulfillment of the program's vision and goals requires an on-going program strategy that addresses all aspect s of HPC. While advancing the level of hardwa re performance is critical to success, the high er objective is to enable better scientific research, test and evaluation environments , and technology development for superior we apons, warfighting and related support systems.

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office ha s corporate-level responsibility for the cooperation and synerg ism of modeling and simulation (M&S) activities within the Department of Defense. M&S has demonstrated the capabili ty to revolutionize the way in which the Department makes decisions and c onducts its operations. Working as a system of systems, M&S can support a full range of applications (e.g. joint training, doctrine development, formulation and assessmen t of operational plans, mission rehearsal, fo rce structuring and the acquisition of new system s). To ensure effective and efficient us e of M&S, the Department has developed a strategy fostering interope rability and re-use, embodied in the Department of Defense Modeli ng and Simulation Master Plan, whic h serves as the basis for execution of this program. The major element of the strategy is development of a common technical fram ework (CTF) for M&S consisting of three component s: the High Level Architectu re; Functional Descriptions of the Mission Space (FDMS); and Data Standardization. Supporting these is a broad range of shared common services which include environmental representati ons; human and organizational behavioral repr esentation; verification, validation and accr editation of simulations; a modeling and simulation resource repository; a modeling a nd simulation information analysis center; and outreach and educ ation initiatives t o ensure standardized and timely implementation of the plan. All aspects of these efforts are fo cused on the Warfighters of toda y and tomorrow through a rigorous and ongoing proce ss of capturing and addressing Warfighting cu stomer needs and requirements. As a result of this effort, the Department will be able to lead, integrate and leverage M&S technologies for the Warfighter and thus improve readiness, enhance mission rehearsal, optimize investme nt decisions, and achieve cost-effective acquisitions.UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 3 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Joint Wargaming Simulation Management Office PE 0603832D8Z UNCLASSIFIED COST FY2004 FY2005 FY2006 FY2007Cost (U) The High Level Architecture (HLA) for simu lation program implemented software enhanc ements to Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) 1.3 Next Generation (NG), current version, based on testing with the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS) program and Millennium Challenge 2002 (MC02).

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT U) This program element funds High Energy Laser (HEL) adva nced technology development aimed at translating technology solutions for broadly defined military problems into demonstrat ed performance pay-offs, increased capabilities, increased supportability, or increased affordability. HEL weapons systems have many potential advantages , including speed-of-light time- to- target, high precision, nearly unlimited magazi ne depth, low cost per kill, and reduced logistics requirements because of no ne ed for stocks of munitions or warheads. As a result, HELs have the potential to perform a wide variety of military missions, includin g some that are impossible, or nearly so, for conventional weapons. These include interception of ballistic missiles in boost phase, defeat of high-speed, maneuvering anti-ship and anti-air craft missiles, and the ultra-precision ne gation of targets in urban environments with no collateral damage. Research conducted under this program element develops and demonstrates the technology necessary to enable these and other HEL missions. (U) This program element is part of an overall DOD initiativ e in HEL science and technology being conducted by the HEL Joint Technology Office (JTO). The goals of this HEL JTO-funded research are to provide the technology to make HEL systems more effective and also to make them lighter, smaller, cheaper, and more eas ily supportable on the battlefi eld. In general, efforts funded under this program element are chosen for their potential to have major impact on multiple HEL systems and on multiple Service missions. As a result of this focus and of close coordination with the military departments and defense agencies, this program element complements other DOD HEL programs that are directed at more specific Service and agency needs.

(U) FY 2002 Plans: (U) Pursuant to Congressional direction the DOD is developing a co mprehensive, prioritized invest ment plan for HEL science and technology. This investment plan is being developed by the HEL JTO, in coordination with the military departments and the defe nse agencies. The plan, which will be completed by the end of FY01, will form the basis for the work to be conducted under this pr ogram element in FY02 and beyond, as well as the work to be conducted unde r companion basic-research and applied-research elements. Although the plan is not yet completed, the broad outlines of plan are becoming clear. Efforts to be included in the HEL advan ced technology development funded by this program element will largely involve the extension or combination of particularly success ful efforts funded under the HEL applied research program in FY01. It is anticipated that efforts under this program element will include one or more of the following: Solid-state-laser demonstration. Assemble successful pieces from individual applie d-research projects (e.g., reliable pump dio de lasers, diode-laser drivers, thin -disk amplifiers, phase-conjugate mirrors, mist cooling) into a demonstration sub-system scala ble to weapons power levels.

Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT (U) The U.S. nuclear deterrent posture is the most visible and critical element of U.S. military capabilities used to deter ag gression and coercion. Therefore, nuclear weapons receive special consideration within the Office of the Secretary of Defense because o f this political and military importance and because of the destructive power of a nuclear w eapon and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act. Consequently, senior level OSD officials give the highes t attention and priority to nuclear weap ons issues. The Nuclear Matters Program provides the capability to conduct technical assessments and to develop policy recommendations the for Assistant to Secr etary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemi cal and Biological Defense Programs (ATSD (NCB)), the Under Secretary of Defense fo r Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L) and the Secretary of Defense on complex and vital national issues. The implementation of Quadrenni al Defense Review (QDR) and th e Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) recommendations necessitate in-depth assessments to support our national Strategic Policy of nuc lear deterrence and for the res olution of issues pertaining to the sustainment of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary to the S ecretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters executes th is program element in collaboration and in coordination with the National Security Co uncil, Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint St aff, the Military Services, U.S. Strategic Command, U.S Europea n Command, the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear S ecurity Administration, the Congre ss, and with NATO, and Allied governments to provide guidance for - and overs ight of - a wide variety of nuclear we apons activities. For these responsibilit ies, the Nuclear Matters program provides an alysis and assessments of issues associated with the stockpile size and composition, safety, reliability, security, use contro l, survivability, transportation, command and cont rol, maintenance, storage, emergency respons e, and enduring stockpile sustainability.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification . This program is a budget activity level 4 ba sed on the concept/technology development activities ongoing within the program. The purpose of this program is to develop physical security equipment (PSE) systems for all DoD co mponents, to include Force Protection. This program supports the protection of tactical and nuclear weapons systems, DoD personnel and DoD faciliti es. Funding for critical RDT&E security improvements within service channels fluctuated widely over the years and prompted the FY89 Congression ally directed consolidation of the Services and former Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) / Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) PSE RDT &E funds into this single OSD controlled program element. The funds are used to provide PSE RDT&E for individual Service and Joint PSE r equirements. The PSE program is organized so that an ongoing DoD-coordinated Join t Action Group, consisting of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defens e Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) representatives monitors, directs and prioritizes potential and existing PSE programs. With few except ions, each Service sponsors RDT&E efforts for technologi es and programs that have multi-service applica tion. The funds are also used to evaluate exploratory development of Physical Security Equipment. This program elem ent supports the Army's advanced engineering development of Inter ior and Exterior Detection, Security Lighting, Security Barriers and Security Di splay Units. In a like manner, the program element also support s the Air Force's PSE RDT&E effort in the areas of Exterior Detection/Surveillance, En try Control, Delay/Denial, Tactical Systems and Airborne Intrus ion.

This program is a budget activity level 4 ba sed on the concept/technology development activities ongoing within the program. This PE was established in respons e to Congressional guidance to consolidate DoD robotic programs on unmanned ground systems and related robotic technologies in order to incr ease focus of the Services' robotic programs on operational req uirements. The program will demonstrate maturity of robotics tec hnologies for their applicati on to the formal acquisition process of land systems and subsystems. Emphasis is on the development of robotic t echnologies that: are amenable to multi-service applications; provide capability in high hazard environments; provide improved battlefield efficiency using supervised autonomous operational capability ; reduce or enhance force manpower and suppor t; and are affordable. This PE consolidates the DoD robotics program for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) into two activitie s: (1) advancement of UGV c oncepts into Advanced Development (AD) acquisition programs and (2) the enha ncement and exploitation of critical robotic technologies for pr esent and future UGV acquisition requirements. Cate gories under this PE are: (1) the Basic Une xploded Ordnance System (BUGS) - a Joint Service EOD effort to locate and dispose of surface unexpl oded ordnance; (2) the Robotics for Agile Combat Support (RACS) - a USAF effort to advance the robotic state- of-the-art capability for counter-t errorism and force protection t echnologies. RACS platforms in clude the following: All-purp ose Remote Transport System (ARTS), Autonomous Mobility Research and Development System (AMRADS), and the Au tomated Ordnance Excavator (AOE). This technology has been applied to formerly used defense sites a nd active range clearance for cleanup/disposal. (3) Joint Service EOD Robotics consolidates all EOD robotic activities under one program line to include the BUGS pr ogram, improvements to fielded EOD robotic systems and exploration of a smaller man-portable EOD robotic system. (4) The Mobility Enhancements program is a research and development program aimed at improving the mobility of small, man portabl e unmanned vehicle systems in support of ur ban warfare, engineer ing, physical secur ity/force protection missions. (5) The Family of Tactical Unmanned Vehicles (FTUV) is a joint Army/Marine Corps effort to provide commanders a fami ly of reconnaissance, surveillance and target acqui sition UGV's that are properly sized to opera te in a variety of tactical situation s. Requirements are emerging for small and medium unmanned systems that improve warfi ghters' situational awareness in scout, mechanized and infantr y operations in urban terrain. The success and lessons learned from FTUV has led to the decision to create two separate program lines: MPRS a nd Gladiator. (6) Man Portable Robotic Systems (MPRS) - is an effort to develop smaller (10-40 lb. Class) UGV's to conduct operation in urban terrain and tunnel reconnaissance. Gladiator is an effort to develop a light (< 1000 lbs) unmanned system for the USMC to conduct surveillance, reconnaissance and other selected missions. The Office of Naval Re search will provide FY 2002 funding for Glad iator to conduct concept development and explore existing technology. The JRP will seek Gladiator f unding in the out years. (7) The Joint Architecture for Unmanned Ground Systems (JAU GS) is an approach to standardizing software co mponent interfaces and component behaviors of all anticipated DoD unmanned systems.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification. CALS is an international core strategy to share integrated digital product data through a set of standards to achieve efficiencies i n business and operational mission areas. DoD's overarching goal in CALS is to develop a s eamless defense enterprise in which the knowledge products of t he acquisition process are immediately and rapidly accessible to all au thorized users while maintaining near i mmediate currency and quality of information . This desired state is referred to as the \"Integrated Data Environment (IDE)\". The ID E (immediate access to quality inform ation) drives many defense-w ide and functional- specific reforms and business process improvements. The rapid shar ing of information is an implied requisite of Integrated Pro duct and Process Teams, a fundamental process for implemen ting concurrent engineer ing and streamlining project manageme nt. Digitized information frees l ogistics support and operator personnel from the burden of cumbersome document or file formats for information processing or presentation - enabling new methods for the performance of maintenance and training tasks based on interactive electronic technologies. This program element is to (1) ass ess and transition evolving automation technologies into the CALS strategy; (2) develop, main tain and apply to weapon system program office operations an e xecutable business model for the application of CALS and related technologies; (3) integr ate technical and functional requirements into a Shared Informa tion Framework of the standards, protocols, procedures, and netw ork management conventions required to achieve compatible implementation of the IDE t hroughout the international defense enterprise.

Recent coalition operations, exercises and experiments have revealed the incr easing complexity and difficulty of prosecuting multi-national air, land, and sea campaigns. Interope rability gaps between partners have retarded mission efficien cy and jeopardized force protection. The complexity of the coa lition battlefield makes it necessary to work cooperatively with our likely coalition par tners to solve interoperability gaps in C3I, logistics and weapon systems as well as to improve coalition training capabilities. This program leverages foreign and other U.S. investment in ongoing projects so as to add a co alition capability that otherwise would not have existed. Both U.S. and foreign-unique t echnologies and research may be applied to improve the end product. Coalition Warfare funds (no more than 50% of total project cost) and foreign contributions (50% or more) are added to planned or existing U.S.-only projects so as to add a coalition capability that would not have otherwise existed. Candidate projects are nominated by the CI NCs (through their CINC Inter operability Program Offices), Services, OSD, or potentia lly, foreign governmental sources. OSD performs a down-select of projects based on programmatic executability, the scope of the coalition problem being approached, the potential to spread the benefits to multiple theaters, among other factors.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This program funds ongoing system level engineering of the existing Link 16 system for joint interoperability and the development of the next generation Link 16 system, the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS). System level engineering responsibilities include Link 16 spectrum issues and Link 16 joint enhancements. Spectrum issues include system engineering, testing, maintaining necessary equipment, performing DoD internal and external coordination and platform integration/certification required to coexist and operate in the Air Radio Navigation Safety frequency band. Joint enhancements planned for Link 16 include Dynamic Network Management (DNM), Time Slot Reallocation (TSR), Gateways, Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) Toolset, Relative Navigation, Link 16 Weapons Applications and improvements to Link 16 Track Quality, Time Slot Synchronization, Target Correlation/Decorrelation, Geodetic Data Registration, Common Time Reference, and Combat ID. MIDS is a joint and international cooperative program involving U.S., France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Designed for tactical combat applications and environments, MIDS will provide a highly jam-resistant, secure digital (voice and data) information distribution system, enabling rapid integrated communications, navigation, and identification among tactical and command and control warfare elements. The MIDS-Low Volume Terminal (LVT) will make Link 16 more affordable for a larger population of U.S. platforms and systems and will be interoperable with previously developed and produced Link 16 equipment, JTIDS Class 1 and 2. Affordability is being achieved through the implementation of open and commercial architecture standards and parts that will allow the tailoring of production configurations to the minimum needs of different U.S. platforms and missions. This program funds the U.S. cost share of MIDS development, fabrication, and test of EMD terminals and terminal level pre-operational support for U.S. platforms which are implementing MIDS. This program is funded under BA-5, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, because it encompasses engineering and manufacturing development of new end-items prior to production approval decision.

Acquisition Strategy USD(AT&L) approved the FY00 procurement of MIDS terminals based on the favorable LRIP DAB review on 27 April 2000. The approval included procurement of 70 MIDS terminals and associated spares and an additional 11 terminals for emergent lab and test requirements. This decision is consistent with the Acquisition Strategy Report (ASR) approved by USD(AT&L) in November 1999. The FY00 MIDS LRIP terminals were equitably split between the two US-led contracts. FY01 and out-year quantities will be competitively procured. USD(AT&L) has directed that after completion of the US-led and European-led MIDS terminal production qualification efforts, the production requirements of all MIDS participants will be combined and competed among the US and European qualified MIDS manufacturers. For LRIP Lot 2, an OIPT was held on 10 August 01. The OIPT approved a two phased LRIP buy and recommended to USD (AT&L) to proceed with the acquisition of MIDS terminals without a formal DAB. The first phase was approved for 59 terminals and spares in September 2001. The second phase is for 60 terminals and emerging requirements. The second phase occurred in November 2001 after USD(ATL) reviewed DOT&E's assessment.

(U) MISSION DESCRIPTION AND BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION: The mission of the FCT program is to test and evaluate forei gn non-developmental items (NDI) id entified by the CINCs and Servic es in order to avoid costly and time-consuming U.S. new start acquisition programs. The FCT program is Congressionally mandated in Title 10, USC, Section 2350a. FCT tests and evaluates conventional defense equipment, munitions, and technologies manufact ured and developed by major allies of the United States and other friendly foreign countries to determine th e ability of such equipment, munitions, and technologies to s atisfy United States military requirements or to correct operational deficiencies. While the testing of NDI and items in the late state of the deve lopment process are preferred, the testing of equipment, munitions, and technologies may be conducted to determine pr ocurement alternatives. FCT p rojects are nominated by the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) each year and submitted to Congress for approval prior to expenditure of funds. This Research Category 6.5 is assigned and identified in this descriptive summary in accordan ce with existing DoD policy.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT : Under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, DoD funds approximately $550 million annually in mission-oriented R&D projects at small tec hnology companies. The goal of the program is to stimulate the development of new technologies to improve U.S. military and economic capabilities. In recent years the DoD has implemented improvements in its SBIR Program as well as a plan for the ra pid transition of SBIR technologies into DoD acquisition programs. These improvements were developed by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the SBIR program managers for the military departemnt s and Defense agencies in response to Section 818, Public Law 105-261 a nd the Small Business Research and Development Acts of 1992 an d 2000. Execution of these improvements continue as an integral part of the DoD SBIR Program. The purpose of these Congressional initiatives is to increase significantly the program's effectiveness in discovering and dev eloping new technologies that are successfully commercialized in defense mark ets and/or the private sector. DoD has implemented these init iatives, recognizing that the commercialization of SBIR technology is a primary means by which SBIRtechnologiesimprove the capabilityof military systems and the productivity of the U.S. economy. PE 0605790D8Z is the only source of funds for the coordination a nd evaluation of the component SBIR programs within DoD, because the 1992 SBIR Act provided that \"a Federal agency shall not use any of its SBIR budget...for the purpose of funding adm inistrative costs of the program.\" PE 0605790D8Z funds central elements of SBIR program coordination and evaluation that are required by l aw, including: Monitoring the degree to which SBIR technologies are commercialized in military and private sector markets (in response to Sect ion 818 of P.L. 105-261) based on performance-based metrics for DoD's SBIR program.

MISSION DESCRIPTION a 1992, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security Countermeasures, DASD (CI&SCM), requirement for an interoperable DoD CI automation System. The system's goal is to eliminate duplication and inefficiencies by ensuring connectivity between, and within, DoD's CI elements at all leve ls. It requires quality, availability, timeliness and horizontal sharing of counterintelligence information in the basic areas of CI Collection, Investigations, Operations, Functiona l Services, Analysis and Production as well as metrics. The Defense Counterintelligence Information System (DCIIS) Requirements Oversight Office identifies requirements. The DCIIS was place d in a sub-set of the Migration Defense Intelligence Threat Data System (MDITDS) under the control of DIA. DIA was responsible for the development of the system and DCIIS was responsible for the requirements and the infrastructure build. DCIIS accomplished the infrastructure build and initiated life-cycle support through the Services. DCIIS ended its associa tion with MDITDS during October 2000 when MDITDS failed to deliver an acceptable software product. DCIIS subsequently established a Joint Program Office during December 2000 and is curr ently organizing a software acquisition strategy in compliance with DoD Directive 5000.1, DoD Regulation 5000.2-R, and DoD Directive 5200.28 unencumbered by MDITDS or the anti quated technology originally selected by the DIA MDITDS Program Manager. The Mission Need for a DCIIS automated system has been revalidated by the CI Community, the DCIIS program op erational requirements document is in final staffing and a proof of concept was delivered based on an analysis of alternatives (AOA) and a Booze Allen Study. The D CIIS Program will reach milestone B during 2nd quarter FY2002. (U) PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND PLANS: The DCIIS Program has placed a robust infrastructure in place in the Military Services. This infrastructure wi ll host an automated system that will provide the CI Community with quality, availability, timeliness and horizontal sharing of counterintelligence information in the basic areas of CI Collection, CI Investigations, CI Operations, CI Functional Services, CI Analysis and Production and CI Metrics. An acquisition effort is underway to develop the software system wi th CI tools featuring interoperability, scalability, portability and security in compliance with the current DoD 5000 series. (U) The development approach for each year taken by DCIIS will enable it to take advantage of related future Analysis and Prod uction CI tool development efforts for Defense.

MISSION DESCRIPTION AND BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION: The Joint Counterintelligence Assessment Group (JCAG) is tasked with developing and implementing an analysis center to support the protection of critical technology in the government. This activity responds to Deputy Secretary of Defense guidance to develop and operate such a capability to protect DoD critical technology programs from threats posed by foreign intelligence activities, foreign information operations, terrorist, and other clandestine or covert threats. The JCAG mission includes evolving analytic processes and techniques to take advantage of leading technologies, and produce horizontal critical technology profiles and risk assessments. These profiles and assessments provide the necessary information for the government to understand the extent to which critical technology may be exposed or unprotected, with information to support decisions on how to improve protection both within and across programs. Delays in establishing a capability to conduct horizontal analysis will directly impact/delay the government's ability to quantify the extent to which technology or informati on is at risk, and properly size responses or programs to mitigate this risk. By leveraging from the latest technologies, analyst s will exploit massive databases with dynamic retrieval, analysis, and presentation tools for decision-makers to visualize the threats, vulnerabilities, and solution sets to the DoD critical technology protection mission. OSD/C3I has asked for an acceleration of the program based on the current world situation and the security threat to national assets. The JCAG budget across the FYDP falls short of adequate funding for a collection and analysis activity of necessary depth for an effective program. An accelerated near-term capability will require increased funding in order to develop a revised and automated analytic approach with the depth of data necessary to produce near-term meaningful products. Further reductions in the budget will severely limit the program's ability to reach a minimum threshold of conducting analysis and developing horizontal information products useful to the decision process of protecting critical technology and US interests.FY 2001 Accomplishments: Established the initial Initial Operational Capability (I2OC) site. I2OC provides a capability to exploit the JCAG tools and data in a classified operational environment, identifying JCAG system design and operational problems and solutions before IOC, respond to dynamic, real world tasking, and produce technology protection products. Consolidated the Beta sites into a single Technology/Operations Beta site to assess, integrate, and test the applicability of technologies in conducting analysis to support the protection of critical technology; evolve analytic processes, procedures, an d products by assessing these technologies in an operational environment; and implement Spiral Development process of hardware and software automation tools and capacity to support both JCAG and C3I initiatives. FY 2002 Program: Completes the design and build out of the IOC site. Establishes JCAG IOC. Planned products include Horizontal Critical Technology Profiles, Horizontal Risk Assessments, and Tailored Information Products. Establishes JCAG Full Operational Capability (FOC). FOC will add a spiral development effort to insert new technologies, capabilities, and data sources into the JCAG Automated Information System (AIS) to provide refinement of JCAG products. Continues Technology/Operations Beta site activities to provide the capability to assess, integrate, and test the applicabili ty of commercial and government technologies that support the JCAG mission, and provide to the analysts the ability to evaluate potential analytical tools and evolve analytical processes. - Classified Platform Harvest initiative supports sensitive data acquisition and conversion activity in areas such as Blue Weapons data and UNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, DEFENSE-WIDE, Budget Activity 7 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Program Element (PE) Name and No. C3I INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS Cost 28.400 26.800 A.

(U) A. Mission Descriptio n and Budget Item Justification (U) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENT The Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative (COSSI) uses commercial tec hnology to increase the reliability and red uce the operations and support costs of legacy weapon systems. As systems age, O&S cost s increase. In addition, older technology often tends to be less reliable than newer tec hnology. COSSI uses technology in sertions to lower O&S cost s and increase reliability. COSSI also promotes the use of open system standards allowi ng DoD to take advantage of commercial technology cycles and modernize equipment faster. Adapting commercial technologies for use in military equipment typically requires non-recurring engineering, testing and qualification. CO SSI provides the funds for this engineerin g and testing. If th e testing is successf ul and the cost savings validated, the items are purchased as retrofits. All COSSI projects must have an endorsement by a military custom er and be linked to an existing military system. Project proposals must incl ude a plan for transitioning from prototype development t o production.

The electronic propell er control system f or the C- 130 is a spin-off of a similar COSSI projec t for the P-3 started in FY 2000. The project is modifying the propeller control sy stem currently used on ATR 42 and ATR 72 regional civil aircraft for use on the C-130. An electronic propeller control and electron ic valve housing will replace the mechanical valve housing and synchr ophaser. The project is expect ed to reduce propeller mainten ance costs from approximately $19/flight hour to approximately $2/flight hour. The advanced symbol generator project is a follow-on to a previous COSSI project that developed activ e matrix electroluminescent flat panel disp lays for Army aviator night vision goggle s. The project is replacing the current signal data converter (SDC) with a new one that is smaller, lighter, and less expensive to buy and maintain. The new SDC will be almost $10,000 less expensive to buy than the one being replaced. The propeller deicing project is developing a propeller mounted generator si milar to the one designed for the Beech 1900D civil aircraft. The new design elimin ates the carbon brushes currently used to transfer electrical power to the propellers. Having a generator mounted directly on the p ropeller will eliminate the need to clean the propeller and replace the brus hes every 50 flight hours. Maintenance costs will be reduce d by UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 7 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Commercial O&S Savings Initiative PE 0604805D8Z UNCLASSIFIED approximately $5 million/year. The new signal processor for the F-16 Fire Control Radar will increase reliability by more than 60 percent. COSSI funds are supporting the flight testing needed to qualify the processor. ($ 9.541 Million) (U) FY 2002 Plans Six projects will be initiated in FY 2002. Digital Electronic Warfare (EW) Receiver for the F-22 ($12.000 million) Recent technological advances have permitted analog based EW components to be converted to digital electr onics. Digital receivers are expected to reduce supportability costs and increase combat perf ormance. This project will co mplete the requisite systems soft ware development, design, and test of a digita l receiver and two associated modules fo r the F-22. Electronic Characterization and Diagnostics (ECAD) of Wiring in Ai rcraft and Submarines ($3.000 million) DoD spends a considerable amount of time, money and effort maintaining the wiring and cables in aircraft and submarines. Often, wiring and cable failures can only be detected thr ough a process of elimination as main tenance personnel troubleshoot a system failure. In some cases, electroni c components are remove d and tested when in fact the failure is due to faulty wiring and not the component itself. This project will modify a technology or iginally developed for the nuclear power industry and apply it to dete rmine the condition of wiring in military systems. Synthetic Instrumentation for Automated Test Systems ($3.320 million) Automated test equipment (ATE) used by the military is often based on 1980s technology and is comprised of a collection of individual in struments with unique interfac es. Because ATE was developed in the 1980s, it is experiencing widespread obsolescence problems. Recent commercial technology allows for the development of synthetic instruments that can be configured in real time to perform various test f unctions. Signals are converted into digit al representations which are then analyzed us ing high speed digital signal processing techniques. As a result, a single \"syntheti c\" instrument can replace numerous single function instruments th ereby reducing the logistics foot print and solving obsolescence problems. Health and Usage Monitoring System for U.S. Army Special Forces' Aircraft ($1.215 million) This project will install a Health and Usage Monitoring System Processo r Module on the U.S. Army Speci al Forces fleet of MH-47D and MH 47E helicopters. The module will provide the capability to pe rform embedded diagnostics including rotor tr ack and balance, performance monitorin g, exceedance detection, and vibration monitori ng. This on board capability w ill significantly reduce the labor and test flight ho urs needed for rotor track and balance. Other benefits include a reduction in scheduled and unsched uled maintenance actions, an ex pected reduction in accidents, and accurate tracking of aircraft usage of flight hours from HUMS data instead of pilot logs. Integra ted Malaria Augmentation Package ($2.000 million) Malaria constitutes a serious infectious di sease threat in many parts of the world. UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 7 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Commercial O&S Savings Initiative PE 0604805D8Z UNCLASSIFIED Some U.S. forces contracted malaria dur ing Operation Restore Hope (Somalia) and Operation Uphold Democracy (Haiti). The current method for diagnosing malaria involves microscopic examin ation of a blood sample and does not lend itself to rapid in-t heater diagnosis. This project will modify an ex isting commercial malaria test and treatmen t kit for field use and perform the testin g needed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approva l. Although the kit is cu rrently available outside the U.S., FDA approval for sa les within the U.S. is required before it can be used by our military personnel. The kit uses test strips instead of microscopic e xamination and can be deployed in the field. Suppor t for the Modernization of the STANDAR D Missile Common Guidance System ($1.200 million) The STANDARD Missile (SM) is the principa l surface ship defense weapon for the Na vy. There are several variants of the SM and each one has its own guidance system. This project w ill support the development of a co mmon, high reliability guidance system that can be used on all variants. Six unique plates wi ll be replaced by two common plates based on an open commercial standard, resulting in a higher reliability guidance system. Many of the obsolescence problems currently being experienced wil l also be eliminated. ($22.735 million) (U) FY 2003 Plans: (U) As in the past, DoD will issue a call fo r projects in February, with project propo sals due in May. The proposals will be evaluated and the best ones sele cted for the funding available. Based on previous experience, proposals are expected to perta in to upgrading electronics and computers. Some FY 2003 funds will be used to perform flight testi ng of the C-130 electronic propell er control developed with FY 2001 funds ($1.900 million) and to comple te the Health and Usage Monitoring System for U.S. Army Special Forces' Aircraft started in FY 2002 ($1.721 million) and the STANDARD Missile Common Guid ance System started in FY 2002 UNCLASSIFIED RDT&E BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFI CATION SHEET (R-2 Exhibit) DATE February 2002 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY RDT&E, Defense Wide/BA 7 R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE Commercial O&S Savings Initiative PE 0604805D8Z UNCLASSIFIED (U) B.
