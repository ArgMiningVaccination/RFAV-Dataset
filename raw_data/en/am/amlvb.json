CAM products may include dietary supplements, herbal products, and special teas. Taking anticancer drugs and CAM together may cause adverse outcomes. When dietary supplements, herbs, or other forms of CAM are taken with an anticancer drug, there is a risk they will change the way the cancer drug works. They may change how the cancer drugs are absorbed, distributed in the body, and excreted, causing effects that are not expected. Specific enzymes and factors help drugs work in the body. The cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes play a major role in the metabolism of many cancer drugs. The transport protein, P-glycoprotein, is another factor involved in how cancer drugs work in the body. If a dietary supplement impacts a cytochrome P450 enzyme or P-glycoprotein, the cancer drug will not work like it should and the patient will not receive the full benefits of the drug. Research on dietary supplements and cancer drugs is limited, but there is evidence for adverse effects and reactions. This summary covers some of those possible effects between foods or dietary supplements and cancer drugs. Antioxidants Questions and Answers About Antioxidants What are antioxidants? Antioxidants are natural or man-made substances found in foods and dietary supplements that protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals (unstable molecules made by oxidation during normal metabolism). Free radicals may play a part in cancer, heart disease, stroke, and other diseases of aging. Some common dietary antioxidants include the following: - Vitamin C (ascorbate). - Vitamin E. - Flavonoids (such as soy isoflavones, green tea catechins). - Beta-carotene. - Glutathione. How are antioxidants given or taken? Antioxidants found in fruits, vegetables, and dietary supplements are taken by mouth. Have any laboratory or animal studies been done on antioxidants and drug interactions? For information on laboratory and animal studies done using antioxidants, see the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Cancer Therapy Interactions With Foods and Dietary Supplements. Have any studies been done on antioxidants and drug interactions in people with cancer? One study looked at antioxidant dietary supplement use before and after diagnosis in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. This study found an increased risk of death and a reduced chance of staying cancer free when antioxidant dietary supplements were used during chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Another study found similar results for people with breast cancer who used antioxidant dietary supplements before and during chemotherapy. Clinical trials of people with head and neck cancer who took vitamin E supplements looked at a compound in the supplements known as alpha-tocopherol. Researchers studied alpha-tocopherol to see if it decreased adverse effects from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although some clinical trials reported that alpha-tocopherol may reduce damage to the body caused by radiation therapy, other clinical trials found there was a higher risk of cancer coming back. Have any side effects or risks been reported from antioxidants? Antioxidant dietary supplements that are taken while being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may reduce the chance of staying cancer free. Some patients take antioxidants because they think the supplement will protect and repair healthy cells damaged by cancer drugs. There is not enough evidence on antioxidant supplements to know if they are safe and effective as a complementary therapy when taken with standard cancer treatment. Are antioxidants approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? FDA has not approved the use of antioxidants as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. Antioxidants are available in the United States in food products and dietary supplements. FDA does not approve dietary supplements as safe or effective. The company that makes the dietary supplements is responsible for making sure that they are safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. The way that supplements are made is not regulated by FDA, so all batches and brands of antioxidant supplements may not be the same. Herbs Questions and Answers About Ginseng What is ginseng?

About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish. PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about cancer therapy interactions with foods and dietary supplements in people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board. Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website.

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u2014also called integrative medicine\u2014includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment\u2014not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: - What side effects can be expected? - What are the risks related to this therapy? - What benefits can be expected from this therapy? - Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? - Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? - Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? - If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? - Will the therapy be covered by health insurance? To Learn More About CAM National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public. |NCCIH Clearinghouse| |Post Office info@nccih.nih.gov| |Website: https://nccih.nih.gov| CAM on PubMed NCCIH and the NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) jointly developed CAM on PubMed, a free and easy-to-use search tool for finding CAM-related journal citations. As a subset of the NLM's PubMed bibliographic database, CAM on PubMed features more than 230,000 references and abstracts for CAM-related articles from scientific journals. This database also provides links to the websites of over 1,800 journals, allowing users to view full-text articles. (A subscription or other fee may be required to access full-text articles.) Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine The NCI Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) coordinates the activities of the NCI in the area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
