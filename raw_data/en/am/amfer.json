The article is divided i nto methods I strongly recommend, methods that are used less often, and methods that are definitely not recommended because we find them harmful or not effective. Warning: No claims are made for any procedures described here. Nor are these procedure s intended as treatments or prescriptions for any dis ease or condition. The following is presented for educa tional purposes only. However, many people find detoxification procedures very effective and safe w hen used as described here. THE PHILOSOPHY OF DETOXIFICATION Since ancient times, human beings figured out that the accumulation of certain toxins in the body is one cause of disease. Modern allopathic medical ca re acknowledges this in some cases, such as the accumulation of bacteria, viruses, toxic metals and some chemical poisoning. However, they have forgotten or ignored the concept in most other case s. In fact, the remedies they prescribe are often quit e toxic, causing \"side effects\", thousands of lawsuit s, and wasting billions of dollars of the people's money, as well as shortening their lives in many cases. As humanity improves its understanding of the body and how to treat it, detoxification will once again take its place as a major important method for heal ing and rejuvenating the human frame. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 1 of 34NUTRITIONAL BALANCING SCIENCE AND DETOXIFICATION Nutritional balancing science combines a lot of ancient wisdom with modern biochemical and physiological science. Detoxification is a major f ocus of this science. It goes about removing ALL the toxic metals, all toxic chemicals, and all biological tox ins such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeasts and parasi tes in about 17 ways at once, in a coordinated and unique manner. It does this by not focusing on the toxins , but rather focusing on improving the balance, the vital ity and the nutrition and energy of the host. Methods that are used to improve the host include enhancing the activity of the eliminative organs, increasing the vitality or adaptive energy level, balancing the major mineral ratios and levels, bala ncing the oxidation rate, balancing yin and yang forces in the body, and about a dozen others. When this is done consistently in a systematic way, the metals and chemicals are usually removed from the body safely and gently without upsetting t he balance of the body chemistry. This subject is explored in more depth in other articles on this we bsite, and in the textbooks, Nutritional Balancing And Hair Mineral Analysis , and Sauna Therapy . DETOXIFICATION PROCEDURES I STRONGLY RECOMMEND SAUNA THERAPY Sauna therapy is one of the finest ways to remove toxic metals, toxic chemicals, chronic infections a nd other blockages in the body. Infrared sauna therap y, in particular, is highly effective for detoxification. Types of saunas. Three common types of saunas exist. The traditional sauna is a room with a heater. These are found at health clubs and spas. This is the least effective sauna for healing, in o ur opinion. However, it is used in some detoxification http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 2 of 34programs, such as the Hubbard program, with excellent success. The far infrared sauna came into use about 45 years ago. It penetrates the skin, which adds another dimension to the sauna experience and appears to enhance detoxification. However, these saunas, if they are truly far infrared, emit damagi ng electromagnetic radiation to some extent. Also, th e frequencies are not the best, in our view. We are not happy with most of these that we test. Therefore, we don't recommend the far infrared or FIR sauna very much at this time. The near infrared lamp sauna uses infrared heat lamps as the heat source. It also penetrates the deepest of all the saunas and does n ot emit any harmful electromagnetic fields. It is the best sauna we have found, in general. How Often. One may use a sauna once a month for pleasure. However, for therapy one must use th e sauna at least weekly. For best results, use the s auna each day, once or twice daily. If one is very debilitated, be su re to begin with once or twice a week, and only for 10 or 15 minutes maximum. As you feel comfortable in the sauna, you may increase the time and the frequency of use. Work up to daily use as one is ab le. When beginning, many people overdo the sauna, either the amount of time inside, or the frequency of sauna sessions. Always start slowly, even if you believe you are in superb physical condition. Many people do n ot sweat easily. Instead, their bodies can overheat i f one starts with an hour session, for example. ALWAYS LEAVE ANY SAUNA IF YOU FEEL VERY FAINT, DIZZY OR SICK. This does not mean the sauna is harmful for you. It often just m eans you are not used to it and your body needs to adapt slowly to sweating and removing toxins through the skin and elsewhere. Over time, you will get used to t he heat and the body will sweat better. In a few weeks to a few http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 3 of 34months, as the body acclimates and is more able to regulate its temperature, sweating becomes easie r. Also, the more one relaxes, the more one will sweat . Time of day for saunas . The more relaxed you are, the more benefit you will derive from a sauna session. If possible, enter the sauna either first thing in the morning, as soon as you arise, or last thing at night before retiring for the night. These are the times of the day when most people are relaxed a maximum amount. Before a Sauna Session. Avoid heavy meals two hours before a sauna session. Avoid alcohol or other intoxicating substances. Drink eight ounces of water before entering a sauna. Spring or distilled water is highly recommended. Add sea salt and two tablespoons daily of kelp to your diet to help replace any minerals lost through sweating. Some people cannot take kelp. I f it makes you jittery, use less or use another general mineral preparation. Remove metal jewelry before enter ing the sauna, as it may become very hot. Do not put any o ils on your skin before a sauna, as they also may becom e very hot, especially in an infrared type of sauna. Preheating. Before entering a hot air sauna, preheat to 150\u00b0 F or so. If you are using a near infrared or far infrared sauna, enter as soon as on e turns it on and you wil warm up with the sauna. For a more intense experience, pr eheat infrared saunas to about 90-100\u00b0 F. Do not operate at above 120 F. for a near infrared lamp sauna or abou t 140 F. for a far infrared sauna. During a Sauna Session. Light clothing may be worn in a traditional sauna. Usually , it is best not to wear clothing in an infrared sauna for best penetra tion of the infrared rays. It is acceptable, however, i f a bathing suit is required. Use a small towel to wipe off the sweat. Sit on another towel. Have a third towel on the floor t o avoid slipping. Talking or working are not recommended while in a sauna. Meditate or relax. To enhance the effects of a sauna session, visualize absorbing the heat and energy. Deep, slow http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 4 of 34breathing and good posture are very helpful. Sound therapy such as listening to low tones is als o excellent. Aromatherapy is also very effective duri ng a sauna session. Rotating in a lamp sauna. If one's sauna uses infrared heat lamps that are all on one wall, one n eeds to rotate 90 degrees every few minutes or so to hea t the body evenly. Sit on a stool or a chair without a back. Face the bulbs, then turn to the side, and t hen turn around to so your back is facing the lamps. Also, be sure to avoid touching t he hot bulbs. Keeping your eyes open and even looking at the bulbs is okay, according to the manufacturer. However, I do not recommend staring at them. Also, do not allow water, a towel or clothing touch the hot bulbs. One will not get a tan in an infrared sauna, though the skin may redden for an h our afterwards. Finishing Up. How long one remains inside a sauna depends on one's health condition. Most peop le do well with 20-50 minutes in a sauna. We do not recommend more than an hour at a time. When finished, take a shower to r inse off the toxins that are excreted during the sauna bath. If this is not possible, then towel off with a damp or dry towel. We do not recommend a cold plunge or cold shower after a sauna. However, a warm or tepid shower is probably better than a very hot shower. Avoid using soap if possible, as you should be quite clean after sweating. Use shampoo and conditioner only if needed. Most contain chemicals toxic to the body. Also skip most oils, lotions an d creams. These also contain chemicals that may clog the pores. Use only the most natural skin care products to enhance the effects of the sauna. Use a skin brush or loofa to remo ve more toxins. Brush all over, even your face and hair if you desire. Painful at first, it soon feels wonderful. Skin brushing enhances the cleansing effect. Drink eight ounces of water durin g or after a sauna session. If you sweat profusely, you may drink http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 5 of 34more. Finally, sit or lie down for at least 10 minutes after your sauna session. These simple step s allow the body to reap the full benefit of the saun a experience. Keeping safe in saunas. Saunas have at least a one thousand-year history of remarkable safety. In fact, the native Americans where I live told me the Indian sweat lodge has been in use for 40,000 years ! However, today many people may us e saunas who have chronic illnesses that may affect t heir ability to tolerate the sauna's heat. In our exper ience with those with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, joint replacements and many other condit ions, the sauna appears to be very safe. Here are a few signs, however, that indicate that one should leave the sauna soon: 1. The body temperature should no t increase more than four degrees. 2.The pulse should not increase m ore than 50% of the resting pulse. 3. Sweating should not stop sudde nly. 4. Some faintness and feeling of fatigue or weakness is normal during or after a sauna session. However, if you feel very faint, end the sauna sess ion and lay down for at least 10 minutes. Healing Reactions. Healing reactions are temporary symptoms that occur as toxic substances are eliminated and chronic infections heal. Sympto ms vary from mild odors, tastes or rashes to periods o f fatigue, bowel changes, aches, pains or headaches. Many people have chronic infectio ns, often treated with antibiotics that killed most of the ba cteria but did not eliminate bad tissue and all the organi sms. These may flare up as they are healed due to repeat ed sauna use. Almost all healing flare-ups or p urification reaction symptoms are benign, though they are often vigorous. See other articles on this website for d etails about healing crises, as they are sometimes called. If in doubt, always consult a knowledgeable practition er who is familiar with healing reactions and with sau na therapy. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 6 of 34Emotional healing reactions may also occur. For example, memories of past traumas may arise consciously or in dreams as they come up to be resolved. Temporary anxiety or other emotional sta tes may occur. These usually pass within a few hours t o a few days. Some are directly related to the elimination of toxic substances from the body. Others are associated with other types of emotional and physic al clearing that can occur with the use of near infrar ed saunas, in particular. Supervision. Saunas are safe for most people providing one follows the rules here described. Al ways move slowly and carefully in and around a sauna. Accidents can occur due to slippery surfaces. Supervision is always best, espec ially if one has a health condition. If debilitated or very heat - sensitive, begin with less time in a sauna. The presence of an attendant or friend is also most hel pful. Consult a health professional if one has any serious health condition. Those who have used LSD o r other psychotropic drugs require an attendant close by, as removal of drugs from tissue storage sites may cause flashbacks or even full-blown LSD trips. Pregnant women and children under five should avoid saunas. Young children must be accompanied by an adult. Continue prescribed medication while taking saunas unless directed otherwise by the prescribing physician. For Acute Infections. If one has an acute infection with fever or other acute symptoms, more frequent, shorter sauna sessions are better until t he infection subsides. Most people can use the sauna 15 minutes about 5 times a day during infections. Always check with someone knowled geable if you are unsure about sauna use, although in gene ral saunas are quite safe.

From Lynn: \"I just had my first coffee enema. UNBELIEVABLE. Just after the first session, I felt a sense of fresh air all over and my breathing was deeper. A constant pressure that I felt on my back at the location of the liver got immediate relief. Th e racing thoughts was replaced with a quiet mind. I felt re laxed and a sense of peacefulness. I hadn't sang in mont hs; but I suddenly found myself singing. Doc, I felt s o good that I wanted to have a second session immediately and had to restrain myself. I hope it is not addic tive because now you couldn't pay me to stop. It is qui te effective!! The only thing is I am obviously very seriously dehydrated because a lot of it doesn't co me out.\" Why in the world would someone use coffee in an enema? That is the question I asked when my health practitioner suggested I do coffee enemas. Yet when I got over my initial resistance, I quickly no ticed the many benefits of coffee enemas. I did them dai ly for over 15 years and I credit, to some degree, the recovery of my health and that of many others. I have recommended coffee enemas to over ten thousand patients. Many have told me how wonderful they are. Several said coffee enemas sav ed their lives. Indeed, they are most hel pful for many types of conditions. The procedure is also inexpensive and can be done at home without special equipment. History of the Coffee Enema. Enemas are an ancient form of hydrotherapy. They have been used for thousands of years for mechanically cleansing the colon. This is proven in the Dead Sea Scrolls. To read about this interesting use of enemas, read Coffee Enemas on this site. Enemas and colonic irrigation wer e used routinely in hospitals. Coffee enemas were http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 8 of 34mentioned in older editions of the Merck Manual , a handbook for medical physicians. They were later popularized by Max Gerson, MD, author of A Cancer Therapy - Results of 50 Cases . Dr. Gerson pioneered nutritional therapy for cancer and other diseases with excellent results. His therapy combined coffee enemas with a special diet, juices and other supplements. The enemas were an integral part of the therapy. Benefits. The major benefit of the coffee enema, according to Dr. Gerson, is to enhance the eliminat ion of toxins through the liver. Indeed, endoscopic st udies confirm that the coffee enema increases bile output . To test this idea, a patient was given a coffee enema while an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera on the end to view the intestine) monitored the entrance to the common bile duct. Within minutes o f administering the enema, bile flow increased. Increased bile flow also alkalini zes the small intestine and promotes improved digestion. Coffee also acts as an astringent in the large intestine, helping clean the colon walls. A common contributor to ill healt h is the production and absorption of toxins within the smal l and large intestines. If food is not digested properly , sugars ferment and protein putrefies or rots. Both proces ses generate toxic chemicals, which are then absorbed i nto the liver. The coffee enema enhances digesti on by increasing bile flow and removes toxins in the larg e intestine so they will not be absorbed. Most peopl e with health complaints suffer from impaired digesti on and excessive production of toxic substances in the intestines. Coffee enemas are particularly he lpful for slow oxidizers. Their liver activity is more slugg ish and digestion is usually impaired. Fast oxidizers may have more difficulty retaining the enema. The procedure described below is really a coffee implant rather than an enema, because it involves only two to three cups of water. Using mo re water than this may make the enema more difficult t o http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 9 of 34retain for some individuals and is not really needed in most cases. If you wish, however, the use of a quart of water, and making sure the water reaches most of th e large intestine, is more helpful for cleansing the colon of accumulated waste material. If one suspects sev ere bowel toxicity or in cases of serious illness, quar t enemas are preferable, at least to start with. How Often And How Long? I usually suggest one enema per day to assist detoxification or to enhance liver activity. Two enemas daily may be ta ken during a healing reaction if needed. For those who are very ill, several a day may be best for at least se veral months. (Dr. Gerson, by the way, used six coffee enemas daily for cancer patients.) For best results, a program of c offee enemas should be carried on for at least a month. T hey should not be needed for more than two to five year s, although many people have continued to take them fo r a number of years without problems. The best time to take the enema i s after a normal bowel movement. One will get a slight rush from the caffeine, but it is not like drinking coff ee, which I do not recommend. Coffee enemas taken in the evening may interfere with sleep. If performed properly, coffee imp lants do not cause habituation, constipation or any rectal probl ems. In over 28 years of practice, I have rarely seen significant problems from coffee enemas if they are done properly, according to the instructions below. The exception is if there are sig nificant hemorrhoids, rectal fissures or other rectal proble ms. In these cases, extra care is needed in inserting t he enema tip. Some people with hemorrhoids find enemas irritating and cannot do them. This is one of the few contraindications for coffee enemas. While enemas may seem uncomfortable, many clients report the procedure is so helpful they soon forget the inconvenience. Step 1. Materials http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 10 of 34* Buy a 2-quart enema bag with a clamp. This is sol d at drug stores. The enema/douche bag combination is easier to use because you can close the top. * For the easiest coffee enemas, buy the coffee fro m S.A. Wilson. Here is the link: www.sawilsons.com . You can any brand of regular coffee - regular grind or flaked, non-instant and not decaffeinated, but some people have trouble retaining the coffee and the S. A. Wilson coffee works much better for them. Organica lly grown coffee is best, though any coffee will do. Organic coffee is available at natural food stores. Store opened coffee containers in the freezer for maximum freshness. The S.A. Wilson coffee advertised speci ally for coffee enemas is great, but not necessary. Step 2. Preparation of coffee There are three methods. The first two are a little better, but any of these will work. 1) The boil method. * Place 2 to 3 cups of purified water and one-half to two tablespoons of coffee in a saucepan and bring to a boil (or use a coffee maker to percolate the coff ee quickly). NOTE: The first time you do a coffee enema, use only 1 teaspoon , NOT TABLESPOON, of coffee. This is critical because some people are sensitive to caffeine and will feel very jittery on more coffee. After a few enemas, you will see how much coffee you can tolerate comfortably. Ideally, incr ease to two tablespoons per enema. * Let it boil 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and allow it to cool. One or two ice cubes may be added to speed the cooling process. You may make a larger quantit y and use it for several enemas. Tricks to speed up cooling the boiled coffee. 1) Boil only a little of the water with the coffe e. Once it has boiled, add the rest of the water to th e coffee mixture to cool the entire amount down to bo dy temperature. 2) Pour the coffee mixture back a nd forth several times through the air from one container to http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 11 of 34another, even from the enema bag back into a cool pot. This will also cool it much faster. NOTE: Body temperature feels hot when you place your finger in it. If the water is too h ot or too cold, retaining the enema will be more difficult. * Only when the mixture is about body temperature, strain the liquid through a fine strainer or coffee filter paper into a clean enema bag. Screw on the top of the enema bag. The enema is now ready. 2) Using a coffeemaker. This is more convenient for some people than the method above. The coffee does not come out quite as strong, so yo u may be able to use a little more coffee. Simply pl ace the water and ground coffee as above, but use a cof fee maker. To cool the coffee after it perco lates, you may leave it in the cup for a few minutes, or start with only half a cup of water and add a room temperature water to the coffee after it is percolated. 3) The non-boil method. This is not quite as powerful but may be used if time is very important: * Place 1 cup of ground coffee in a container with 2 cups of water. Stir the mixture thoroughly and allo w it to soak overnight. * In the morning, filter the liquid through coffee filter paper or a fine strainer. Place in a jar for storag e in the refrigerator. * To prepare an enema, pour 2 cups of purified wate r into the enema bag. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the coffee liquid from the jar. Step 3. Preparing to take the enema * Have a bowel movement before doing the enema. This is important, as otherwise you will not be abl e to retain the enema in most cases and there could be a mess on the floor! To have a bowel movement, the best method is to drink many glasses of spring or distilled water beforehand. You may also have something to eat or even use a laxative like prunes if needed. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 12 of 34 If you have not had a bowel movem ent, take a plain water enema first, before the coffee enema. This will usually clean out the bowel quickly and effectively. * Be sure the plastic hose is pushed or fastened we ll onto the enema bag and the thin enema tip is attach ed to the other end. * Remove any air from the enema tube the following way. Grasp but do not close the clamp on the hose. Place the tip in the sink. Hold up the enema bag a bove the tip until the water begins to flow out. Then cl ose the clamp. This expels any air in the tube. * Lubricate the enema tip with a small amount of so ap or oil. (Too much lubrication will cause the tip to fall out of the rectum, creating a mess!). Step 4. Taking the enema * The position preferred by most people is lying on one's back on a towel, on the bathroom floor or in the bathtub. * With the clamp closed, place the enema bag on the floor next to you, or hang the bag about one foot a bove your abdomen. * Insert the tip gently and slowly. Move it around until it goes all the way in. * Open the clamp and hold the enema bag about one foot above the abdomen. The water may take a few seconds to begin flowing. If the water does not fl ow, you may gently squeeze the bag. If you develop a cramp, close the hose clamp, turn from side to side and take a few deep breaths. The cramp will usually pas s quickly. * When all the liquid is inside, the bag will becom e flat. Close the clamp. You can leave the tube inserted, o r remove it slowly. * RETAIN THE ENEMA FOR 15 MINUTES (less time is okay, but not quite as effective). See below if yo u have difficulties with this. You may remain lying on th e floor. Use the time to read a book, meditate, etc. Some people are able to get up and go lie on a towel in bed, instead of on the floor. Walking around the house with the coffee inside is not recommended. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 13 of 34 A small number of people are unab le to retain even a cup of water for the required 15 minu tes. One can start with less coffee or less water in the se cases. There seems to be no harm if one wishes to retain the enema longer than 15 minutes. Step 5. Finishing up * After 15 minutes or so, go to the toilet and empt y out the water. It is okay if some water remains inside. If water remains inside often, you are dehydrated. * Wash the enema bag and tube thoroughly with soap and water. * if you feel out of sorts or a little bloated afte r the enema, rub the top of the toes of both feet, but particularly the left foot. You can also rub the e ntire foot, especially any part that is tender. This wil l often balance out the body's energies after a coffee rete ntion enema. Hints regarding enemas: * Remember, you will do best if you have a bowel movement before doing the coffee enema. * If intestinal gas is a problem, some exercise bef ore the enema may eliminate the gas. * It is not essential but is helpful if the water f ills the entire colon. You can assist by first lying on your right side for 5 minutes, then on your back for 5 minutes , and then on your left side for 5 minutes. * If water will not flow around the entire colon, y ou may gently massage your abdomen. Some people attach a 30-inch colon tube to the tip of the enema tube, an d insert the tube so the water will reach the right s ide of the colon. * If the enema makes you jittery, reduce the amount of coffee. * The enema may lower your blood sugar. If so, eat something just before or after taking the enema. * If you have trouble holding the enema, here are suggestions. 1) Be patient. Practice makes perfect. 2) The water may be too hot or too cold. Be sure the http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 14 of 34water temperature is comfortable. 3) It may help to place a small pillow or rolled up towel under your buttocks so the water flows down hill in to your colon. 4) If trouble continues, try reducing the amount of coffee or add 2 tablespoons of blackstrap molasses to the water. For more information, read the ar ticle on this site entitled Coffee Enemas . COLONIC IRRIGATION OR COLON HYDROTHERAPY This superb hydrotherapy treatment can greatly assist detoxification and general health as well. I prefer the coffee enemas only because they can be done at home at lower cost. Also, the coffee has many heal ing benefits. However, colonic irrigation with a skill ed attendant is a wonderful therapy, and some colon hydro-therapists will even add coffee at the end if one requests it. Colon hydrotherapy is safe, powerful and very comfortable for most people, even the elderly and i ll. Sessions with a professional usually cost $50.00 or a little more, are quite painless, and take about an hour. A series of colonics is always best. Most people n eed a dozen sessions to really remove layers of impacte d fecal material, parasites, yeast colonies and other imbalances in the large intestine. Some colon therapists add oxygen or coffee to the irrigation w ater and this seems to be is fine, as well. If one prefers, it is possible to buy a home coloni c machine or unit. Some are very costly and must be plumbed into the home. Others are simple units tha t fit over a toilet seat. One such unit is called the Co lema board. However, one must be trained in its use for it to be as effective as a colonic treatment with a nurse or other professional. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 15 of 34JUICING Juicing is a popular method to rejuvenate the body. We always recommend 10-12 ounces of carrot juice daily for all adults, and less for children d epending on their size and weight. You may add some greens such as spinach or Swiss chard leaves, or other vegetables to the carrot juice, but the carrots are important as a source of bioavailable calcium. Do not add fruit to this juice, please, unless you must ad d a bit for a child to drink it. More than 10-12 ounces is not needed for most people, and has too much sugar for many people and is extremely yin in Chinese terminology. Yin means cold, raw and broken apart. Another helpful type o f juice is wheat grass juice, about 1 to 2 ounces dai ly for an adult and less for children. This is the only w heat product we suggest at all. We don't usually recommend other juices, although other vegetable juices may be helpful for specific ailments, at times, and are fine once in a while. Avoid most all fruit juices, as they are to o sweet and too yin for most people. Some doctors suggest much more juicing. To read more about why we do not, read the articles on this site entitled Raw Foods and Juices and Yin and Yang Healing . SULFUR-CONTAINING AMINO ACIDS These include the amino acids taurine, methionine, homocysteine and cysteine. They are among the most important of the amino acids, for wh ich reason I include them here. Their main purpose is to help with the flexibility of connective tissue, and they are also absolutely essential for detoxification in the liver and elsewhere. Glutathione synthesis require s them, and some say that cysteine is the rate-limiti ng step in the production of glutathione. Also, authorities say that mercury irreversibly bin d to sulfyhdryl groups, which involve cysteine. One must http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 16 of 34replenish the sulfur-containing amino acids in order to replenish the glutathione. Sources. They are found naturally in a wide range of foods, notably garlic, onions, scallions, green onions, meats, eggs, some well-cooked beans and some seeds such as sesame. A few vegetables are rich in sulfu r, such as the cabbage family (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts), and the radish fam ily of vegetables. However, these are not quite as rich i n sulfur as onions, scallions and garlic, along with the meats and eggs. The sulfur is usually more abundan t and in a more usable form in animal tissues. Isolated supplements. Sulfur-containing amino acids are also sold as isolated supplements such as L- taurine, acid and others. Some herbs also contain t hem such as bugleweed, yellow dock and some others. They tend to have a yellowish color, as this is the color of sulfur. These amino acids may also be a part of most chelation drugs (EDTA, DMPS and others) and other chelating substances such as chlorella and cilantro. Among the protein powders, whey protein contains some sulfur, as does egg protein powder if it contains egg yolk, which most does not. However, w e prefer not to use protein powders as they are not needed and have other problems that are discussed later in this paper under the heading of cleansing diets. All are chelators. Sulfur-containing amino acids are mild chelators. This means they can bind with metals in the body such as copper, lead and a few others. I consider the pure amino acids much safer than other chelators, and they are used, at times, in nutritional balancing programs for short periods of time, usually to reduce copper. They are not used for lo ng periods of time because they can remove some vital minerals, as can all chelators such as Page 17 of 34DMSA and all others. We never use most chelators for this reason, as they are not needed a nd are almost always harmful to the delicate balancing of body chemistry. Used for a four lows pattern. L-Taurine is the only sulfur-containing amino acid used regularly in nutritional balancing programs, and this is only wh en a four lows pattern is present. I am not sure why, b ut L- taurine works excellently in this situation. To le arn more, read the article entitled, Taurine on this website. A serious problem with vegetarian and especially vegan diets. I definitely recommend meat and eggs to assist detoxification in the liver. We find that most vegetarians, while not ingesting some tox ic metals found in meats and fish, also cannot remove toxic metals as well because they are low in the su lfur- containing amino acids. The sulfur also is require d for other functions such as tendon and ligament health. ALGINATES AND PERHAPS MODIFIED CITRUS PECTIN These products mainly bind toxic metals in the intestines, preventing their absorption in the inte stines. The metals then pass harmless out of the body. We like these products and particularly recommend kelp as an excellent source of alginates. Modified citrus pectin also seems to have other unusual properties, of which I am not prepared to explain. It is used in natural cancer therapy and proponents claim it can be very helpful to rebuild the intestinal tract, perhaps by detoxifying it in some way. THE GENITAL BATH This simple procedure, borrowed from the hydrotherapy literature, is often effective for all eviating vaginal, bladder, uterine and even prostate difficu lties. Bladder and vaginal infections in women often respo http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 18 of 34very well to this procedure. Men can use it as well for urinary and penile difficulties. The genital bath is probably effe ctive because the cold water causes a reaction that great ly enhances the blood flow to this area. This in turn assists the healing process. The procedure is as follows: * Sit on the side of a bathtub facing into the bath tub. Alternatively, sit on a stool placed in the bathtu b. One can wear a shirt or sweater, as the water will be directed only at the genital area. * Splash cold water on the genital area only, using a wash rag or a flexible shower attachment. * Continue the procedure for 10 minutes, and repeat it three or more times per day. * The genital bath can be repeated for as long as necessary with no ill effects. HERBAL POULTICES This is an ancient therapy. There are many kinds of herbal packs and poultices. Overall, these are very good. Some are potato poultices, onion poultices, mustard poultices and others. We don't use them, a s a rule, because they are a lot of trouble and we don' t find them necessary. DETOXIFICATION PROCEDURES I RECOMMEND MUCH LESS OFTEN THE CASTOR OIL PACK This procedure was recommended often by Mr. Edgar Cayce. We don't use them much because they are less powerful than the methods above in most cases. However, they appear to assist lymph circulation over the area where they are placed, in particular the stomach, liver or other parts of the abdomen. They are also very relaxing for some peop le and they are completely safe as far as know. Two common ways to do castor oil packs are: 1. The Daytime Method. Pour pure castor oil onto http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 19 of 34a piece of flannel or other absorbent cloth that is about 1 foot long by 1 foot wide. The cloth should be saturated and damp all over, but not dripping with the oil. Castor oil can be bought at many drug stores. Some outlets sell organic castor oil, but this is n ot needed in most cases. Place the pack directly on your s kin, over your abdomen, or liver (upper right side of the abdomen) or wherever desired. Fold the cloth over once if it is too large. Cover the pack completely with a large plastic bag lying flat. Then place a heating pad on top of the plastic bag. The plastic bag is ther e simply to keep the oil from soiling the heating pad . Turn on the heating pad to its highest setting and relax in bed or on a couch with the pack for about 2 or m ore hours. To clean up, turn off the heating pad and put it away. Remove the plastic bag and then remov e the pack from your abdomen or wherever it is. Wipe off the oil on your skin with a clean rag or paper towe l. Place the castor oil pack in a glass or plastic jar . Screw on the top of the jar to keep the oil moist. The p ack can be reused many times without adding more oil, unles s it is getting dried out. 2. Overnight method. Create a castor oil pack as described above. When you are ready for bed, place the pack on your abdomen, usually, or elsewhere, perhaps. Cover the pack with a plastic bag, as abo ve. Now wrap an Ace bandage around yo ur waist and around the pack as tightly as you can comfortably stand it. This is to hold the pack aga inst your skin during the night. Go to bed with the pa ck strapped on. In the morning, remove the Ace bandag e, remove the pack, wipe off the area and store the ca stor oil pack as described in method #1 above. THE LIVER-GALL BLADDER FLUSH The liver-gall bladder flush is a non-surgical method to help remove gallstones and basically is a simple way to empty the gallbladder non -surgically. In http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 20 of 34some cases, it can avoid the need for gallbladder surgery, though I do not recommend it specifically for this purpose. A much better way to avoid gallbladd er and other surgeries is a complete nutritional balan cing program to restore the normal activity of the liver and gall bladder. A liver flush or two may help at the beginning of a nutritional program or if one is hav ing gall bladder problems. I am not aware of complicat ions or damage from this procedure, although occasionall y someone remains nauseated for several days or more. While there are many variants, here is a procedure that I am familiar with and trust: 1) For 6 days, eat well, take your nutritional supplements and take 90 drops (30 drops three times a day) of phosphoric acid daily. You can purchase phosphoric acid drops inexpensively from www.tuberose.com or 877-988-2376 or 352-797-8000 in Florida. Their website is a bit hard to navigat e - click on \"Natural Health Store\" at the top of the page, a nd from there click on \"Health Maintenance Supplements \" to find \"Phos-drops\". Instead of phosphoric acid drops, some doctors tell patients to drink as much apple juice as possi ble. However, this is much too sugary and I don't recommend it at all. Also take about 200 mg of magnesi um (chelate, citrate or other quality product) three t imes a day, one tablet with each meal. The phosphoric aci d and magnesium may help to soften gallstones and can help dilate the bile ducts. 2) At noon on the sixth day, eat a normal lunch with supplements, phosphoric acid drops and magnesium. Two hours after lunch, do a 1-quart cof fee enema using 2 tablespoons of coffee, along with 2 tablespoons or 1/4 cup of Epsom salts in the enema. Retain this enema for 15 minutes. See above for th e coffee enema instructions. 3) At suppertime, have a normal dinner with http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 21 of 34supplements, and be sure to have fat with the dinner, such as 2 tablespoons of butter on vegetabl es or some real whipped cream. 4) At bedtime, do one of the following: a) Take 1/3 cup of olive oil followed by some lemon or other juice if the taste is objectionable. b) Take 1/3 cup of olive oil blended with 1/3 cup of orange, grapefruit or diluted lemon juice. c) Take 4 tablespoons of olive oil followed b y 1 tablespoon of fruit juice every 15 minutes until on e has taken 1/3 cup of olive oil. For nausea. The release of bile causes nausea in a few cases. If nausea occurs during this proce dure, it indicates stimulation of the gall bladder. Fini sh the procedure. If vomiting occurs, just continue and d o not add more than the planned amount of olive oil. 5) Immediately upon finishing the oil, lie down on the right side with the right knee drawn up toward the chin for half an hour. This can assist emptying of the oil out of the stomach. Then go to bed early, if possible. If you feel ill during the night, you ma y take another strong coffee enema with Epsom salts. 6) In the morning, if nauseous try to remain in bed until it passes. Upon arising, take another coffee enema with Epsom salts. If nausea continues after the procedure, eat lightly and skip supplements for a d ay or two. Foot reflexology is also always excellent for nausea. Rub the entire foot from the toes to the h eel and a little up the ankle, and rub both feet. In a ddition, spend more time on the liver and gallbladder area. It is on the right foot, behind the smaller toes, less th an halfway down the foot toward the heel. Also, there is a liver meridian area on both feet, on the top of the foot, between the large toe and the second toe. Please do not repeat the liver-gallbladder flush more than about once every few months or so. Most people have gallstones. This is not a terrible thi ng, and a nutritional balancing program will slowly rebalan ce http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 22 of 34the liver and other organs to stop their formation. If gallbladder pain or discomfort continue after your flush, it may mean that other causes are responsible for the discomfort. The most common is congestion of the liver-gallbladder meridian in acupuncture terms. This is extremely common. This can slowly be worked out using many methods of healing, especially nutritional balancing science. I believe that surgery is rarely a good idea, althoug h today it is not as dangerous as it once was. HERBS FOR DETOXIFICATION Helpful and safe herbs for detoxification are milk thistle, dandelion root, Russian or Spanish black r adish, burdock root, garlic, onion, and perhaps a few othe rs. These are always fine to add to nutritional balanci ng programs. We discourage the ongoing use of other herbs, in most cases. Unfortunately, most herbs are not powerful enough today and many are slightly toxic, as well. Be sure to also avoid herbal chelators such as bugleweed, yellow dock, cilantro extract and chlore lla. These always seem to remove some essential minerals along with the toxic metals. These vital minerals often cannot easily be replaced. See the article on this website entitled Chelation for more about chelation therapy for metal detoxification, and its problems. STEAM BATHS These cause some detoxification and are okay to use once in a while. I don't recommend steam, however, because 1) the temperature is too hot for most people, 2) chemicals from the water will get i nto the body unless the water is distilled or reverse osmosis, and 3) if used at a health club, the steam room may not be clean enough. If you have a steam bath at home and the water in it is distilled or reverse osmosis, this method of detoxification is fine. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 23 of 34 HOT SPRINGS Some springs are quite therapeutic, while others can be slightly toxic. The difficulty is knowing w hich to visit. An occasional visit to a hot spring can be a very relaxing and therapeutic vacation, however. Just t ry to make sure the spring is safe and clean. We don't advise too many hot spring or other baths all the time, however, because the water is y in and this will make the body very yin as well, if do ne too much. Most people's bodies are already too yin. T his is why the dry sauna is preferable in most cases. THE EPSOM SALT BATH This is a simple, relaxing bath. It can help relax tired or tense muscles and release some poiso ns as well. Baths, however, are more yin, so use them only a few times per week, at the very most to rela x. Procedure : As you fill a bathtub, add 3 to 4 pounds of Epsom salts to the bath water. Water sho uld be hot, but not scalding for the most relaxing and effective treatment. Submerge as much of your body, particularly your trunk, in the bath. Stay in the water for 20 to 30 minutes. There is no need to shower off after the bath. You may, in this way, absorb more of the Epsom salt s with their sulfur and magnesium. THE SALT AND SODA BATH This is primarily an alkalinizing and mineralizing bath. It is inexpensive, usually comfortable, alth ough the salt and soda bath can sting the skin a little at first. This bath will remove certain toxins and even help with infection in some cases. This is a more yang bath that can help during a healing reaction, for exampl e. Procedure. As you let the water run into the bath tub, add about 2 pounds of baking soda and 2 pounds of sea salt. Any type of sea salt will do, but do not use regular table salt or salt tablets of the type used in http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 24 of 34water softeners. These are not quite as good. Mix the salt and soda into the water. The bath sho uld be fairly hot for best results. Stay in the water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then let the water out. A shower may be helpful if you feel itchy or sticky from the salt. However, a shower is not required afterwards. HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN C Vitamin C is a powerful chelator, especially of copper and a few other minerals. High doses can be used for detoxification, and it is used in some alc ohol and drug detoxification centers with excellent succ ess. One reason for this is that it also stimulates adre nal activity, which is usually very weak in those who a re using drugs, for example. It is also good for a se vere infection, and perhaps short term in other cases. Longer-term use of high-dose vitamin C, however, is fraught with danger. It is extremely yin in Chi nese medical terms, so it will always unbalance the body . It will also remove some calcium, zinc, manganese and other vital minerals. These cannot just be replace d by adding some minerals to the IV bottle or by taking minerals orally. The body is too complex to just p ull out some minerals and put back a few others later. Although a short series of intravenous or oral vitamin C treatments are fine, continued use always unbalances the body and I have never felt the need to recommend it. DRINKING DISTILLED WATER Distilled water is an excellent chelator and cleane r of the blood. I routinely use it for a month or up to about six months at a time, maximum, when a person begins a nutritional balancing program. At first, it seems to attract to itself more of the toxic metals and toxic chemicals. However, after a few months or rarely up to a year, it begins to remove vital minerals from the body as well. This is the proble m with all chelators. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 25 of 34I find that anyone who has lived on distilled water for more than six to twelve months is depleting the body of vital minerals. This can be a serious prob lem that will occur also with anyone who lives on rever se osmosis water for any length of time. Reverse osmo sis water is even worse, because it does not hydrate th e body as well. Another use of distilled water is during a toxic episode or healing reaction, as it is called. Swit ching from spring water or carbon-filtered tap water and drinking only distilled water for a week or even up to a month often helps one move through the toxic releas e much faster. CLEANSING DIETS These help a few people because they eliminate heavy, junk food, and allergic foods in the diet. They can be used as a quick transition to a better diet and better lifestyle. However, on balance, they are ra rely needed and I find them harmful. Their importance is very overrated. Problems with them are: 1) Deficient in many nutrients. Often they are deficient in protein, essential fatty acids, an d even calories. They are usually deficient in sulfur bec ause they don't include meats and eggs. Sulfur, as explained above, is absolutely needed for liver detoxification. For this reason, they make people more nutritionally deficient and can have a counterprodu ctive effect. 2) They are usually very yin in Chinese terminology. This means they are sugary, cold, wat ery, and broken up (as in the use of powders). This reduces their effectiveness and often it makes them unbalance the body in very subtle ways. 3) They are often poor food combinations, with powders, water and sugars to sweeten them combined. This worsens digestion, even though may improve food allergies somewhat by eliminating some allergic components of the diet. 4) They may contain herbs, spirulina, chlorella, cilantro and other substances that are slightly tox http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 26 of 34even if they are nourishing. 5) They are not needed at all in most cases. For these reasons, use extreme care with cleansing diet s and preferably avoid them. ENERGETIC AND ELECTRICAL DETOXIFICATION METHODS SUCH AS IMT, ERT, HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES, RADIONIC MACHINES AND ELECTRO- ACUPUNCTURE MACHINES These methods all can have definite merit. We do not use them much, however, for the following reaso ns: They require a trained person and are quite dependent upon the skill of the operator of the mac hine or technique. It is hard to know, at times, how s killed your practitioner is. Thus we usually prefer metho ds that can be done inexpensively at home by anyone. While they often give quick symptomatic results, th ey do not seem to have as many \"side benefits\" as do coffee enemas and the near infrared sauna, combined with a proper diet for one's metabolic type and sev eral supplements based on a properly performed and interpreted hair mineral test. Some are quite yin, particularly the use of various electrical machines. While they will cause some improvement, they may slow progress for this reason . They may not cause as much mental or spiritual development. This may be due to the fact that they tend to be extremely yin in Chinese medical terminology, or perhaps they do not remove toxins a t the deeper levels of the body. Another reason may be they do not demand enough change in lifestyle and d iet of the client. Development often requires some eff ort on the part of the client. HOMEOPATHIC DRAINAGE REMEDIES Used properly, these homeopathic remedies definitely have some benefit. We don't use them, however, and the reasons are explained in the http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 27 of 34paragraph above. DETOX FOOT PADS This is an ancient Japanese method of removing toxins through the bottoms of the feet. Small tiss ue paper bags filled with various herbs are placed on the feet, and usually one sleeps with the pads overnigh t. The pads can also be placed elsewhere on the body, such as over the liver or the kidneys. I have less experience with this method. However, I do not think it is all that effective. It is safe, however, as far as I know, and perhaps more researc h will change my view. OZONE SAUNAS (OR REALLY OZONE STEAM CABINETS) This can be an excellent detoxification bath. The ozone adds significant oxygen to the body for the s hort time that one is in the steam cabinet. The steam h elps carry the ozone to the skin. We don't recommend these mainly because they are not as good as near infrared sauna therapy, in most instances. However, adding oxygen to the body is always excellent and helpful. Other simple methods to do this are deep breathing, adding ozone to your drinking water, a bath with a cup or less of 35% hydrogen peroxide, and our favored method of installing an ozonator/ionizer air purifier in your bedroom. Click here for more on this method of oxygenating the body. Some physicians also offer intravenous hydrogen peroxide or intravenous ozone, which can be excelle nt. They are not included in this article because they are not home-based methods of detoxification, but they are helpful. HOT TUBS These will cause some detoxification, especially if heated to more than about 103 F. However, they are not nearly as powerful as a near infrared sauna, co ffee http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 28 of 34enemas and perhaps other methods. Serious problems with hot tubs . 1) You will absorb chemicals from the water. This cannot be avoided, unless one uses only distilled or reverse osmosis water to fill the tub. Carbon-filtered wat er is better than using plain tap water in the tub, but n ot much as it does not remove toxic metals, fluoride a nd some other chemicals. A second problem is that one absorbs some of the chemicals needed to sanitize the tub. This can be avoided, often by skipping the chemicals and instea d using 100-200 ppm of hydrogen peroxide to sanitize the tub. Also, you may need to add a chemical to adjust the pH of the tub. If these cautions are observed, hot tubs can be relaxing and somewhat helpful for detoxification. Otherwise, however, they are quite toxic, especiall y public hot tubs at hotels, exercise clubs and spas. They are often breeding grounds for bacteria, virus , parasites and other micro-organisms, even if the tu b is loaded with chlorine, bromine and other toxic chemicals, which should never touch your skin. Ev en silver cartridges used to sanitize tubs are somewha t toxic, though much less so. However, they also do not kill all the germs that well, either. Remember tha t one will absorb the poisons from the tap water, if this used to fill the tub. A better alternative to a hot tub can be a dip in a hot spring, if this is available. Here the water i s usually flowing, and it is pure spring water with no chemic als added. CLAY OR MUD BATHS, WRAPS OR PACKS. Clay and some muds are powerful detoxifiers and can help with many skin and other types of health conditions, including even cancers. I don't recomm end them, in part because we don't find them necessary, and in part because they can be quite toxic. Clay tends to contain a lot of aluminum, among other toxic met als. Also, they may not be nearly as powerful as the sau na or enemas, although this could depend on the clay http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 29 of 34product that is used. However, for short-term use such as on a vacation at a spa, they are fine. Some can be used longer-t erm, but it is hard to know which are safe. DETOXIFICATION METHODS TO AVOID Exercise to induce sweating. Many people say they do not need to detoxify because they sweat profusely when they run, play tennis or do other common exercise. Sweating with exercise is excelle nt. However, the sympathetic nervous system is activate d during exercise, so the amount of toxin removal is much less. Also, exercise uses up a lot of energy that could be used for detoxification in a sauna or doin g another procedure. For this reason, I do not recommend vigorous exercise, ever, and I do not consider exercise a valid method of detoxification by itself. Chelation therapy. Oral, intravenous, or other types of chelation tend to unbalance the body chemistry severely, removes some vital minerals alo ng with the toxic ones, is toxic for the kidneys, and does not do nearly as good a job as nutritional balancin g. Please avoid chelation, in general. However, it is better than bypass surgery and helpful in a few cas es. This large subject is discussed in more detail in a separate article, entitled Chelation Therapy . Drinking salt water. Salt water will pull a certain amount of toxic substances out of the body by osmosis. However, the long-term effects are questionable, at best, and it doesn't work very wel l. Salt is an unbalanced mineral product and will slowly change the mineral balance of the body. Sal t water has been known to kill, if one drinks enough, by upsetting the mineral balance. Avoid this method completely. Ionic foot baths. These consist of an electrical array, as it is called, that is placed in a small t ub of http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 30 of 34water, in which one places the feet. It can also b e placed in a bath tub that one lies in. While they are excellent to remove some toxins, all ionic foot baths I have reviewed spin the chakr as backwards and damage a person's etheric energy field. It can take more than a year to recover. T his is a subtle problem, and occasional use such as once per month seems to be safe. However, regular use is no t safe, so I cannot suggest their use much at all. I also suspect these machines cause a yin effect upon the body. Alkaline water for drinking. I know of two types of alkaline water systems. Both have similar probl ems. The first type are more popular and are free-standi ng kitchen units. These include the Jupiter, I-Water, Kagen, and others. These devices begin with tap water. The water passes through a carbon filter, which does not remo ve many toxic metals and often does not even remove to o many toxic chemicals because the water must move quickly through the filter. Then the water passes over electrified platinum and titanium plates to alkalinize it. Platinum is a very toxic metal, as is titanium. Then many of the mach ines add a calcium solution or powder to the water to fu rther enhance its alkalinity. I believe this is a prescr iption for disaster in the long run for the following reasons: Carbon-filtered tap water is not a very good base water, since carbon cannot filter out most toxic me tals and many toxic chemicals, no matter what the manufacturers claim. When water passes quickly ove r carbon, not that much is removed. Platinum is too toxic for any human exposure, in my view. While the amount of exposure is small, we ha ve noted that after using the machine for 6 months or so, everyone who uses one is developing a little platin um toxicity, which can be deadly. The amount of plati num absorbed will depend upon one's tap water and one's body chemistry. The more poorly nourished one is, the more platinum one is likely to absorb. Other factors http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 31 of 34such as one's age, vitality, etc. also have an effe ct. The calcium powder is often coral calcium or some other contaminated product that adds more toxic metals. The alkaline water that is produced has a yin effec t on the body that makes one feel better, but is not hel pful for deep healing and spiritual development at all. If you have an alkaline machine, at least do not add the powder, and turn off the alkalinization fea ture if you can, and just use it as a water filter. Prefer ably unplug the unit so there is no chance that the plat inum plates are electrified and leaching more platinum i nto your body. This is better, though your water is st ill passing over platinum, which is perhaps harmful. I have seen terrible problems caused by these machine s when used daily for more than 6 months or so, even though the damage is very subtle at first. I also do not like the advertising for these machines with false claims that most Japanese hospitals and the public in Japan uses them. I do not believe this is true. An even worse type of alkaline water is sold in health food stores and at water stores that sell RO or reverse osmosis water. A calcium solution or powde r, often coral calcium, is added to the reverse osmosi s water to alkalinize it. Problems with this setup a re: Reverse osmosis does not hydrate the body well at a ll and should never be used for daily drinking water b y most people. The calcium solution or powder, especially if it is made from coral calcium, may contain toxic metals. When toxic metals are added to reverse osmosis water, the 'hungry water' seems to take up the meta ls easily and drive them deep into the body cells and the kidneys. Plain spring water, even if it is not very alkaline , nourishes the body with many alkaline-forming minerals. Along with a proper diet of cooked http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 32 of 34vegetables, some animal protein and whole grains, but not wheat, the body will slowly become more alkaline in a natural way. Please do not be fooled by claims that the coral calcium is safe or that every family in Japan uses an alkaline water machin e. Fasting. Unfortunately, fasting for more than two or three days on water alone cannot be recommended. This was formerly an excellent method of healing. However, my experience is that today the bodies are so toxic and so depleted of nutrients, that longer fas ts make one more toxic and more depleted. I have seen this repeatedly in my practice. In fact, I worked as medical director of a fasting spa for several years and placed over 600 people on fasts. Results were disappointing, though most peo ple will lose weight. I also fasted myself, and found that it harmed my health, not helped it. Nutritional balancing science was designed for today's horrendous health challenges and is far saf er than fasting. Fasting was appropriate in years pas t, when most of the classic books about it were writte n. Juice fasts are far safer, but very yin and sugary, and not generally advisable for more than a few day s, at most. A carrot juice fast might work, but is st ill very sugary and yin, so I cannot even recommend that for more than a day or two. Ingesting Bentonite, Azomite, Montmorilliinite, Zeolite or other clay products. This is very popular today. However, we find that none of these are powerful enough to remove deeper layers of toxic metals. Even worse, all of these products must contain aluminum, as all clay does, and often contains othe r toxic metals as well. I believe that the makers of these products are not honest about the contents of the products. I often hear that these products are not toxic, when they are. Just because the aluminum, lead, cadmium, arsenic and other metals are \"in a natural form\" does not mean they are not highly toxic. http://www.drlwilson.com/detox_ ... 1/16/2011 8:48:06 AM Page 33 of 34Although they can remove some toxic metals short-term, please avoid these products.
