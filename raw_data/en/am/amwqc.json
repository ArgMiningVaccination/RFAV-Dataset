Management Policy, Business Environment, Issues to be Addressed, etc. Matters discussed here that are not historical fact reflect the judgment of the Shionogi Group (the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries) as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review. (1) Management policy, management strategy, etc. Management basic policy The Shionogi Group's basic policy is defined as \"striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve. \" For this purpose, the Shionogi Group must create and manufacture better and better medicines, and to spread the word to as many people as possible about these so that they can take advantage of them. To accomplish this, the Shionogi Group believes that the daily improvement of technology by all people at the Shionogi Group will lead to greater benefits for all stakeholders (customers, shareholders, business partners, society, employees, etc.). Vision of what Shionogi wants to achieve by 2030 The Shionogi Group is transforming its business with the vision of \"Building Innovation Platforms to Shape the Future of Healthcare. \" The pharmaceutical business is continually facing challenges for its sustainability because of the expiration of p atents for mainstay products. In addition, the Shionogi Group recognizes that its social mission as a pharmaceutical organization requires it to address the growing concerns about social security costs and the increasing sophistication and diversification of medical needs, and requires it to contribute to the realization of a healthier, sustainable society. the Shionogi Group seeks to address the issues facing patients and society by transforming itself from a drug discovery -based pharmaceutical company tha t mainly provides prescription drugs to a Healthcare as a Service (HaaS) company that provides healthcare services and continuously offers new value to society. To this end, the Shionogi Group must further evolve its strengths as a drug discovery -based pha rmaceutical company based on innovation and advanced expertise, while increasingly catalyzing the formation of new healthcare platforms as an attractive company that is chosen by other comp anies and industries with different strengths. The Shionogi Group will work to realize its new vision by accepting diversity, without fear of change, and by going beyond its conventional concept to transform. Business environment and management strategy The environment surrounding the pharmaceutical industry is rapidly changing, reflecting factors including the growing global population, the increased aging of society due to the low birthrate in high - and middle -income countries, as well as environmental changes, such as climate change, that are occurring on a gl obal scale, the associated changes in the prevalence of certain diseases and healthcare needs, the acceleration of digital transformation, and the diversification of people 's values. In addition, the business environment is becoming increasingly severe wit h pressure to curb drug costs increases in developed countries due to tighter healthcare insurance finances and, in the case of Japan, with the beginning of yearly NHI price revisions for prescription drugs in 2021 . Beyond the effects of these environmenta l changes, the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV -2), which has spread rapidly since the end of 2019, has also brought about major changes in the way drug discovery research and development is conducted a nd how companies approach doing busi ness globally. On the other hand, concerns are present with regard to country risk, including the possibility of stagnated business development and procurement and supply of pharmaceutical raw materials overseas, depending on developments in the Russian in vasion of Ukraine and relevant measures taken elsewhere going forward. In order for companies to respond to social demands in such an environment and still sustainably grow, it is essential for them to elevate their foresi ght for changes in the world throu gh dialogue with stakeholders, reduce business risks, leverage strengths, and consistently generate new business opportunities. The Shionogi Group has formulated the New Medium -Term Business Plan, SHIONOGI Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030), a strategy beginning from FY2020 for achieving greater growth while flexibly addressing new business risks that may occur. This plan is focused on rapidly addressing the challenges of sales growth of new products and expansion of our overseas business, and the accom panying improvement of productivity carried forward from the S HIONOGI Growth Strategy 2020 (SGS2020), and on overcoming the challenge posed by the patent expiration of the Shionogi Group 's HIV products, which is expected to begin around 2028 (HIV Product Patent Cliff). In STS Phase 1, the first five -year plan in STS2030, the entire Group will work as a unified team to vigorously promote business reforms, and under the theme of \"realize transformation toward new growth as a total healthcare company, \" we will pursue R&D and top-line (sales) strategies to create new value and a transformed management foundation strategy to realize value creation. - 9 - (2) Priority business and financial issues to be addressed As stated in \"(1) Management policy, managemen t strategy, etc., \" priority business and financial issues to be addressed are sales growth of new products and expansion of our overseas business and the accompanying improvement of productivity. The Shionogi Group believes it has the capability to create the best drugs in their particular drug classes. However, it has yet to use its advantage to efficiently expand its sales in global markets, including the market in Japan. The three issues listed above are all connecte d in the business flow from drug disco very to sales, and the Shionogi Group recognizes that the degree to which these issues are overcome will greatly affect its ability to achieve growth over the next 10 years. To overcome these issues and achieve its vision for 2030, the Shionogi Group has f ormulated STS2030 as aforementioned, and is working to carry out business activities in accordance with the trifecta of R&D strategy, top -line (sales) strategy, and management foundation strategy as set forth in STS Phase 1. R&D strategy As for its dise ase strategies within R&D, while focusing on infectious and psycho -neurological diseases as its core therapeutic areas, the Shionogi Group is also pursuing other therapeutic areas with high social need, such as cancer. The Shionogi Group is flexibly and boldly adjusting its prioritization of focus projects in accordance with the potential value of discovery and acquisition pipel ines, including those attained through harnessing alliances. To address the global threat of COVID -19, the Shionogi Group is currently giving top priority to research and development of therapeutic drugs and prophylactic vaccines, leveraging its more than six decades of strengths cultivated in the field of infectious diseases. All of the Shionogi Group 's focused pipelines* a re for diseases with strong desires for development of better treatments, and which have the potential to change current disease treatment paradigms. The Shionogi Group will continue to promote research and development within these innovative pipelines and continue to strengthen its response to the HIV product patent cliff. *Core pipeline (Priority projects) Areas Project Details Infectionus disease S-217622 COVID -19 treatment [sivopixant] Refractory chronic cough S-812217 [zuranolone] Depression toumor S-005151 [redasemtide trifluoroacetate] 1. Epidermolysis bullosa 2. Acute stroke 3. Knee osteoarthritis 4. Chronic liver disease 5. Cardiomyopathy Top -line strategy Under the slogan of \"implementing an optimal disease strategy supported by selected partnerships in each area, \" the Shionogi Group is working to strengthen its operations in Japan, the U.S., Europe, and China based on the Shionogi Group 's core therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and psycho -neurological diseases. Under STS2030, the Shionogi Group will dev elop a new position as an HaaS company by providing care across the entire span of each disease 's process, through a variety of approaches, including pre -symptomatic care, prevention, and diagnosis, while continuing to focus on the Shionogi Group 's traditi onal strengths of therapeutic agents as a core solution. The Integrated Disease Care Division overseeing and promoting this disease strategy is establishing a framework for delivering the Shionogi Group 's products, and the information needed for people 's health, to more people globally, to strengthen its business in each area. To accelerate these strategies, in November 2020, the Shionogi Group established two joint venture companies in Shanghai and Hong Kong to serve as the launchpads for our China and Asi a business, in accordance with the Basic Agreement on the Capital Alliance with Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China Ltd. (hereinafter, \"Ping An Group \"). The Shionogi Group will continue to create the future of healthcare by combining Shionogi 's disease insights and R&D know -how with the Ping An Group 's IT, big data collection and AI -based analysis know -how. - 10 - Management foundation strategy In STS Phase 1, dynamic reinforcement of the Shionogi Group 's management foundation is indispensable to ra pidly realize its transformation, focusing on the mechanism of transformation and supporting its human resource growth. Regarding the mechanism of transformation, the Shionogi Group is working to establish more sophisticated decision -making systems support ed by advanced data utilization environments, as well as to create new business processes that facilitate internal/external collaboration in vari ous ways. In addition, the Shionogi Group has established \"Be the best you can be to take on new challenges \" as a new vision for Shionogi 's human resources (S HIONOGI Way), and will implement measures to develop and strengthen employees as the essential driver of Shionogi 's growth and transformation. In order to realize Shionogi 's philosophy and Company Policy of \"striving constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve \" on a global scale, the Shionogi Group aims to achieve sustainable growth by further evolving its strengths as a drug discovery -based pharm aceutical company and through the formation of new healthcare platforms. Shionogi aims to be a global company trusted by all stakeholders, including patients, their families, and healthcare professi onals around the world, thereby contributing to the realiz ation of a sustainable society. (3) Objective indicators for determining achievement status of management goals Eight management indicators have been established for achievement in STS Phase 1. Five management indicators have been established for measuring growth potential: revenue, core operating profit, core operati ng profit margin, overseas sales ratio excluding royalty income, and original pipeline ratio. The Shionogi Group 's goal is to achie ve sales targets for each fiscal year toward FY2024 and to maintain a core operating profit margin of 30% or higher while making suffi cient R&D investments necessary to overcome the HIV product patent cliff. In addition, the overseas ratio (to total net sa les) has been established as an indicator measuring the effectiveness of investments to increase sales revenue overseas, where markets are larger. Furthermore, the Shionogi Group aims to maintain a high original pipeline ratio as a condition for being chos en by other companies and industries with different strengths in the interest of catalyzing the formation of new healthcare platforms. Three indicators have been established for measuring shareholder return from the perspectives of business growth and fina ncial measures: basic earnings per share (EPS), ratio of dividends to equity attributable to owners of parent (DOE), and return on equity attributable to owners of parent (ROE).

Business and Other Risks The Shionogi Group (the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries) is committed to the appropriate management of business risks, including the creation of business opportunities and the avoidance and mi tigation of risks from the perspective of sustainability, as well as to the promotion of an enterprise risk management (hereinafter \"ERM \") system, managing risks across the entire Group as an important mechanism for management strategy and management foundations . The Shionogi Group recognizes risks related to decision - making and business execution, proactively manages these risks, and takes countermeasures against them. In particular, the Co rporate Executive Meeting and the Board of Director s deliberate and decide on important risks that may affect management and their response policies . Based on these response policies, the respective organizations in charge take countermeasures in cooperation with relevant organizations. Furthermore, the Sh ionogi Group promotes sustainability activities with the aim of contributing to the sustainable growth of the Shionogi Group and the sustainability of society. It does this by meeting health and medical needs through its business activities and resolving v arious economic, social, environmental, and other issues. [Risk Management System ] Role i.

Enterprise Risk Management Secretariat The enterprise risk management secretariat consists of the Sustainability Management Department, the General Administration Department, and the Corporate Planning Department. In this function, these departments centrally manage the Shionogi Group 's risk information, formulate ERM promotion activit y plans, monitor the status of responses to important risks identified by the Corporate Executive Meeting, and report these activities and the related monitoring results to the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Meeting. In addition, the functi on remedies activity issues based on feedback from the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Meeting v.

The Shionogi Group is working to mitigate each of these risks through the initiatives described. Matters and risks discussed here that are not historical fact reflect judgments made as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review. (1) Risks related to systems and governments The Pharmaceuticals Business is subject to a range of regulations due to various government policies in each country. As pres sure to curb drug costs increases in developed countries due to tighter health insurance finances, large financial outlays made to combat COVID - 19 may further intensify this pressure. In Japan, the health insurance system is undergoing reforms, with healthcare expenses expected to increase due to the further aging of the population. Beginning in FY2021, National Health Insurance (NHI) price revisions for prescription pharmaceuticals are to be conducted every year. These and other government policy trends may affect performance. In addition, tightening regulations in Japan and overseas related to the development and manuf acture of pharmaceuticals may result in additional costs, non -compliance of products with regulations, or other similar situations, which may affect performance. Furthermore, while there has been a range of regulations and systems added to deal with COVID -19, these may be modified due to future developments in the COVID -19 pandemic or other factors, which may affect performance. While emphasizing the provision of innovative pharmaceuticals and other products at prices acceptable to society and contribu ting to the upkeep of social security, the Shionogi Group is striving to build scientific evidence that demonstrates the value of its innovations, and promotes efforts to appeal to the value of innovations through the activities of industry associations in Japa n and overseas. In addition, the Shionogi Group is constantly seeking to obtain the latest information on reforms to the health insurance system, including the NHI drug price system, and on policy trends related to the research, development, manufacture, s ale, etc. of pharmaceuticals and vaccines, and strives to respond promptly and appropriately to these changes . (2) Risks related to side effects, etc. Although pharmaceuticals are approved and sold after rigorous review by competent authorities around the world, the occurrence of unforeseen side effects after market launch may lead to the suspension of sales or a product recall, which may affect perform ance. The Shionogi Group has established a system and provides annual education to ensure that all employ ees, not just those in charge of drug information, appropriately report any side effect information they may receive. By swiftly evaluating and analyzing the collected information and implementing necessary safety measures, the Shionogi Group strives to mi nimize the spread of unforeseen side effects and minimize harm. Though the Shionogi Group is covered by insurance for indemnity of medical damages from side effects, etc., it does not anticipate a decrease in sales due to the resulting loss of reputation, etc. (3) Risks related to research and development Research and development of pharmaceuticals requires significant investment of management resources and time. In addition, va rious uncertainties exist before a pharmaceutical can be brought to market and its sales can be recorded. Furthermore, research and development of vaccines and therapeutics is proceeding at an extraordinary speed with the aim of resolving the global COVID -19 pandemic, and the speed of pharmaceutical research and development is dramat ically accelerating within the industry. It must also be assumed that there is a risk of damage to corporate value depending on how this is addressed. The Shionogi Group has maintained and improved its R&D productivity, which is class -leading worldwide, by leveraging its strengths in disease areas accumulated over many years and its foundation in small -molecule drug discovery to carry out efficient drug discovery research. During the COVID -19 pandemic, research and development of vaccines and therapeutics h ave proceeded at an unprecedented speed. Though competitors outside Japan were allowed to take the lead, the Shionogi Group is also accelerating research and development by shifting resources significantly and making speedy decisions in consideration of pr iority, leveraging its research infrastructure and drug discovery know -how, collaborating with academia and external institutions, and combining the Shionogi Group 's strengths. The Shionogi Group will further improve R&D productivity by deploying the knowledge gained here across all non -COVID - 19 R&D activities as well. However, to further improve the probability of success in drug discovery, it is necessary to alloc ate management resources appropr iately and to strengthen new drug discovery technologies in drug discovery modalities other than small - molecule, such as middle -molecule and antibody drug discovery. To this end, the Shionogi Group has clarified which drug discovery programs and developmen t compounds it will focus on, in addition to those that are related to COVID -19 (therapeutic drugs, vaccines, etc.), and is concentrating its management resources on these. The Shionogi Group is also focusing on acquiring technologies such as peptide drugs , vaccines, and cell medicine (regenerative medicine) by utilizing alliances with various venture companies and academia. In addition, to reduce risk in clinical development, which requires significant expense, the Shionogi Group enhances development produ ctivity by designing study plans based on data and experience, making rigorous assessments based on study results as appropri ate, - 13 - and making appropriate decisions on whether to proceed with development. Furthermore, the Shionogi Group is working to mitigat e various risks associated with uncertainties by accelerating R&D and maximizing value through in -licensing and out -licensing for compounds, and through utilizing subsidies from governments and other public institutions in various countries. (4) Risks rel ated to dependence on specific products Revenues from product sales of Intuniv and royalty income from Tivicay, Triumeq, and other HIV products accounted for approximately 57% of total revenue ( FY2021 ). In the event that sales of these products decrease or are suspended due to expiration of intellectual property rights (patent rights) and the subsequent launch of generic products, NHI price revisions, the emergenc e of competing products, or other unforeseen circumstances, performance may be affected. In response to these inevitable and/or unforeseen risks in the Pharmaceuticals Business, the Shionogi Group is working to mitigate their impact, exploring measures such as launching new product lineups or revising contracts, based on the latest information on the NHI drug price system, the competitive situation, etc. Whenever there is a discussion with significant impact on business con tinuity, such as a major revision of the NHI drug price system, the Shionogi Group works with industry associations to issue i ts opinions and take other actions to emphasize the importance and value of generating innovation, as described in (1) above. Furthermore, the Shionogi Group will strive to mitigate risks by transforming its business from its traditional orientation on pha rmaceuticals, which is fraught with the above business risks, to one where it can provide a full range of healthcare services, including a vaccine business and p harmaceuticals under new concepts, using digital technologies and other cutting -edge technologi es. (5) Risks related to partnerships with other companies In the research, development, manufacture, and sale of pharmaceuticals, the Shionogi Group collaborates with other companies in various ways, including joint research, joint development, in -licensing and out -licensing of compounds, and joint marketing. If, due to some circumstance, contracts with partners are modified or terminated and the alli ances with these companies are delayed or stagnate, etc., performance may be affected. The Shionogi Group analyzes and evaluates various aspects before deciding whether or not to enter into an alliance. When concluding contracts, the Shionogi Group presume s potential risks and endeavors to deliberate and reach agreements to mitigate these risks, the details of which are stipulated in the contracts. Furthermore, even during an alliance, the Shionogi Group strives to minimize impact on performance by building a strong governance system through various functions and hierarchies with its alliance partners, ascertaining risks in the alliance, having close discussions on solutions, and taking necessary actions. (6) Risks related to the supply chain The Shionogi Group 's mission is to provide a stable supply of pharmaceuticals. However, if the supply chain is disrupted due to various factors such as conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics, or ESG -related issues, the stable supply of pharmaceuticals may be disrupted and patients ' health may be affected. In addition to establishing and periodically reviewing business continuity plan (BCP) items to be supplied on a priority basi s, the Shionogi Group sets its own standards for product inventory levels to be held and sec ures excess inventory, etc., in preparation for the risk of supply disruptions of raw materials and products. Furthermore, for raw materials with high geopolitical risk, the Shionogi Group selects suppliers from multiple countries to ensure stable supply. For items such as cephem antibiotics for which there are limited raw material suppliers, the Shionogi Group is also working to reduce future supply chain risk by establishing a system for the manufacture of active ingredients within Japan. In addition, in accordance with the Shionogi Group Procurement Policy and the Shionogi Group Business Partner Code of Conduct, the Shionogi Group requests that business partners, including suppliers, also conduct activities based on the Shionogi Group 's code of conduct, s triving to mitigate risks throughout the supply chain, including within the Shionogi Group . (7) Risks related to quality The Shionogi Group manufactures products and outsources manufacturing under strict manufacturing and quality controls. However, if a serious quality problem were to occur due to factors such as inadequacies in the manufacturing process, this could lead to a product recall, administrative action, or reduced social credibility, which may significantly affect performance, etc. The Shionogi Group established the Shionogi Group Quality Policy in 2015 and works to ensure product quality through the maintenance of a quality assurance system that complies with laws and regulations and meets global standards and requirements , including those appl ied to Group companies outside Japan. As part of these efforts, the Shionogi Group holds S HIONOGI Global Quality Week to spread the importance of quality to all employees, including those at Group companies. The Shionogi Group also conducts surveys and traveling events based on the results of these surveys in order to promote the fostering of a \"quali ty culture \" at its manufacturing facilities. In the global manufacturing of its products, the Shionogi Group complies with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and the - 14 - International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for H uman Use (ICH) guidelines and other pharmaceutical -related laws and regulations. It has also been inspected, assessed, and approved by competent agencies, such as the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) i n the United States, and the European Medicines Agency. In the event of unforeseen serious quality problems, the Shionogi Group strives to promptly evaluate these and make the best possible decisions to improve product quality and provide customer satisfac tion. (8) Risks related to IT security and information management The Shionogi Group uses various internal and external IT systems and holds a large amount of confidential information, including personal information. In the event of a system crash or sec urity problem such as leakage of personal information due to a willful or negligent act by an employee or contractor, or due to a cyberattack by a malicious third party or a virus infection, business activities, performance, financial position, and credibi lity could be severely affected. In addition, legal damages, such as claims for compensation for damages, and costs related to post -incident measures may be incurred. In order to mitigate these risks, the Shionogi Group has appointed a Chief Information Of ficer (CIO) responsible for overall control of information management and who establishes policies to ensure information protection and information security, a Chief Dat a Officer (CDO) responsible for overall control of the use and management of data and d ocuments, and a Global IT Head responsible for operation of the Shionogi Group 's information technology. The Shionogi Group has also established rules and regulations for information management based on laws, regulations, and guidelines and works to ensure its employees are aware of the importance of information management. With regard to personal information, the Shionogi Group has established the S HIONOGI Global Privacy Policy to ensure that all employees are aware of the importance of personal informatio n and the need to comply with laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal information. In addition, the Shionogi Group is promoting a project to establish an IT business continuity plan (IT -BCP) system to ensure business continuity in the eve nt of a crisis, such as a cyberattack or a large -scale disaster, and is working to improve its IT infrastructure, strengthen its information security infrastructure, and improve the infrastructure 's operations. In addition, the Shionogi Group is taking mea sures to prevent cyberattacks based on an actual attack on a location in Taiwan, including a fundamental review of the Shionogi Group -wide network structure based on a security assessment conducted for the entire Group, including overseas locations. (9) R isks related to securing and cultivating human resources The Shionogi Group strives to secure and develop the diverse human resources necessary to realize its management vision. In addition to environmental changes, such as in hiring and in the growing dem and for ESG management, changes in work styles with an eye to the post-COVID era are leading to changing values about work and changing expertise required. In such an environment, the Shionogi Group requires human resources who are able to treat environmen tal changes as opportunities and accelerate the resolution of social issues, human resources who can bring the Shionogi Group 's transformation to fruition as it seeks sustainable growth as a Healthcare as a Service (HaaS) company, and human resources capab le of logical thinking from a Group -wide perspective and supporting its highly efficient management. If the Shionogi Group is unable to secure and develop sufficient human resources of these kinds, it may not be able to achieve organizational management, w hich may affect the Shionogi Group 's performance in the medium to long term. In order to create new value for society and increase corporate value, the Shionogi Group believes that its most important capital is its employees. In order to achieve its new vi sion for human resources, \"Be the best you can be to take on new challenges \" (SHIONOGI Way), for the achievement of STS2030, the Shionogi Group is creating an environment facilitating human resources seizing opportunities for personal growth, enhancing sup port for self -investment, and providing focused training for managers supporting development. In addition, the Shionogi Group is providing business transformation and value creation training using IT and digital technologies, one element of human resources development programs contributing to becoming an HaaS company, a goal of STS2030, and is striving to strengthen its human resource development by executing a range of measures. Furthermore, the Shionogi Group is also working to develop future members of u pper management through the President 's School held by top management executives and through the practice of corporate management appointing upper management candidates as directors of Group companies. In addit ion, in order to enhance the skills of individ ual employees and promote flexible work styles, the Shionogi Group changed the prescribed number of work hours from 155 to 140 hours, introduced 15 -hour discretionary pay and a system of elective weekends (three -day weekends), and permitted some side work. Through these efforts, the Shionogi Group seeks to secure employe es with diverse experience. (10) Risks related to environment and safety Some substances used or generated in the process of pharmaceutical research, development, manufacturing, etc. may affect the human body and/or ecosystems. If environmental pollution or subsequent harm emerges in the course of the Shionogi Group 's business activities, this could lead to temporary closure of facilities, incurring countermeasure or recovery costs, or legal liabilit y, which may affect the Company 's credibility or perform ance. With regard to the leak of the solvent dichloromethane at the Kanegasaki Plant of Shionogi Pharma Co., Ltd. that occurred in January 2021, the Shionogi Group is working to prevent its spread by collecting it from the - 15 - soil, monitoring its distribution within the site, and preventing its movement. No leakage outside the plant site has been confirmed as of the drafting of this document. The Shionogi Group will continue to conduct monitoring activities and implement appropriate measures to address the ris k of leakage outside the site. In order to mitigate risks related to the environment, health, and safety, a Group -wide management system and management regulations have been established. Here, the Shionogi Group ensures not only legal compliance but has es tablished even more rigorous management standards and targets, formulates and implements countermeasures, and checks the appropriateness of these. The Shionogi Group also requests that suppliers behave in the same manner, striving to mitigate risks through out the supply chain, including within the Shionogi Group . Furthermore, as a pharmaceutical company, Shionogi believes that it is important not only to create innovative pharmaceutical s and strive to resolve social issues, but also to promote initiatives i n line with global frameworks as represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations in the interest of the sustainable potential of the planet. Specific ally, the Shionogi Group is addressing sustainability issues by set ting long -term targets in such areas as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), climate change, and plastic waste management, which it has identified as environmental materiality (important issues). In particular, in the area of climate change, the Shionogi Group has set greenhouse gas reduction targets, which have been approved by the Science Based Targets (SBT), greenhouse gas emission reduction targets that are scientifically consistent with the levels of the Paris Agreement. The Shionogi Group is working toward the complete conversion of electric power to renewable energy sources with the goal of achieving SBT by 2030. Furthermore, during the fiscal year under review, the Shionogi Group endorsed the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and has been working to enhance its resilience through scenario analysis, financial impact calculations, and exploration of countermeasures so as to determine how the risks and opportunities posed by climate change w ill affect the Shiono gi Group 's management. The Shionogi Group will disclose the results of these as appropriate. (11) Risks related to natural disasters and pandemics The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as a sudden major earthquake, climate change -related storm and/or floor, unforeseen incident, or the occurrence of a pandemic, could lead to the closure of business facilities or suspension of plant operations , potentially impeding the supply of products to the market and which may significant ly affect performance. In addition, any damage to research laboratories or clinical trial facilities, etc., may affect the progress of drug discovery research or clinical development. Furthermore, this may affect the provision and collection of safety info rmation. For this reason, the Shionogi Group 's upper management has clarified important operations and formulated a business continuity plan (BCP) for natural disasters and pandemics on a per -organization basis, and has strengthened contingency preparednes s by conducting ongoing drills and periodically reviewing plans. In addition, not only Group plant but also important suppliers are checked f or impact from natural disasters and other environmental and safety issues through environmental, health, and safet y (EHS) audits, etc., and improvements are requested as necessary. (12) Risks related to intellectual property The Shionogi Group 's products generate profits under the protection of intellectual property rights (e.g., patents), but there is a risk that v arious intellectual properties may not be sufficiently protected or that third parties ' intellectual property rights may be infringed. Therefore, the Shionogi Group has established a system to properly manage its owned intellectual property rights so as to prevent damage to them, and the Shionogi Group continuously monitors for infringement of rights by third parties. In its business activities, the Shionogi Group has put in place a system to prevent infringement by conducting infringement prevention survey s and carrying out IP due diligence in in -licensing and out -licensing activities, and takes precautions to prevent infringement of intellectual property rights held by third parties. Through these efforts, the Shionogi Group strives to mitigate risks relat ed to intellectual property. (13) Risks related to litigation In connection with its business activities, the Shionogi Group may be subject to litigation related to pharmaceutical side effects, product liability, labor issues, fair trade, and other issues . Trends in this litigation may affect the Shionogi Group 's credibility or performance. In addition to establishing internal systems necessary to mitigate this risk, the Shionogi Group takes appropriate measures in consultation with attorneys, patent attor neys, and other specialists as appropriate. Major litigation currently pending is as described in \"V. Financial Information, 1. Consolidated Financial Statements, (2) Other s, 2) Significant Legal Actions .\" (14) Risks related to financial markets and foreign exchange trends Fluctuations in the financial and foreign exchange markets that exceed the scope of forecasts could affect management of pens ion assets, increase retirement benefit obligations, affect royalty income from overseas alliance partner, or otherwise affect performance and assets. The Shionogi Group strives to mitigate the risk of an increase in retirement benefit obligations due to a deterioration in the return on - 16 - pension assets by diversifying pension assets in multiple investment produc ts. In addition, the Shionogi Group utilizes derivative transactions to manage foreign currency transactions and foreign currency -denominated monetary receivables and payables against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations. (15) Risks related to compliance In carrying out its business activities, the Shionogi Group is not only subject to various laws and regulations such as pharmaceutical regulations and product liability, but as a member of the pharmaceutical industry with a direct connection to people 's health and lives, the Shionogi Group is required by society to act in accordance with extremely high ethical standards. Therefore, not only violations of laws and regulations, but also behavior that opposes the requirements o f society may lead to a loss or decline in stakeholder trust in the Shionogi Group , which in turn may affect performance. The Shionogi Group recognizes that compliance is always a top priority and is committed to ethical and responsible behavior as per the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct, where it has also stipulated rigorous compliance as one of the values essential to achieving the vision the Shionogi Group seeks to achieve. Shionogi has established the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy, the Compliance Comm ittee, and internal and external reporting desks, and unwaveringly provides messaging about compliance in the President 's quarterly message, strengthening employee awareness of compliance. The Compliance Committee, chaired by the Representative Director, P resident and CEO, meets four times a year to discuss compliance issues and implement necessary education (e.g., prevention of harassment, information leakage, and bribery ) and initiatives. (16) Spread of COVID -19 If restrictions are imposed on business ac tivities due to the spread of COVID -19, raw materials procurement and other supply chain processes could be suspended or stagnate, which may significantly affect the stable supply of pharmaceuticals. In addition, delays in research or clinical trials or re strictions on business activities, such as from the provision of information by medical representatives (MRs), may significantly affect new drug approval applications and launches, market penetration, or t he collection and provision of drug safety and prop er use information. To mitigate these risks, the Shionogi Group is working to develop new work styles necessary to maintain and improve productivity while responding to government and administrative requests, such as limiting work attendance rates to preve nt the spread of infection and establishing an in -house inspection system in production and research units for early detection of close contacts. In addition, information provision activities in the COVID -19 pandemic are handled and modified for structure and content in accordance with guidelines issued by government and administrative agencies. Furthermore, in order to achieve business continuity even in the event of an emergency from the spread of infection and to fulfill its social responsibility as a ph armaceutical company, the Shionogi Group utilizes a business continuity plan (BCP) and places the highest priority on the stable supply of its pharmaceuticals. For details on the impact of the spread of COVID -19 and the Company 's efforts, please refer to \"II. Business Overview, 1. Management Policy, Business Environment, Issues to be Addressed, etc. \" and \"5. Research and Development Activities. \" Beyond the above, there are various other risks associated with the Shionogi Group 's business activities, and those listed here do not represent all the risks for the Shionogi Group . - 17 - 3. Analysis of Financial Position, Operating Results, and Cash Flows by Management The following is a summary of the Shionogi Group 's (the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries) awareness, analysis, and discussion on its operating results, etc. from the management 's perspective. In addition, the Shionogi Group has a single business segment, consisting of the research, development, purchase, manufacture, and sale of prescription drugs and related businesses. Matters discussed here that are not historical f act reflect the judgment of the Shionogi Group as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review. (1) Awareness, analysis, and discussion on operating results, etc. for the consolidated fiscal year under review i. Operating Results a. Financial Position As of March 31, 2022, total assets were \u00a51,150,601 million, an increase of \u00a5151,608 million from a year earlier. Non-current assets were \u00a5491,396 million, an increase of \u00a548,641 million from a year earlier, mainly reflecting an increase in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and an increase in property, plant and equipment due to the construction of vaccine manufacturing facilities . Current assets were \u00a5659,205 million, an increase of \u00a5102,967 millio n compared to a year earlier, mainly as a result of changes in trade receivables and in fixed -term deposits of more than three months and bonds (included in \"Other financial assets \" in current assets). Equity was \u00a5993,285 million, an increase of \u00a5128,734 million from a year earlier. This was due to the recording of profit, payment of cash dividends, a net change in financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and an increase i n exchange differences on translation of foreign operations. Liabilities totaled \u00a5157,316 million, an increase of \u00a522,874 million from a year earlier. Non-current liabilities were \u00a532,920 million, a decrease of \u00a51,341 million from a year earlier. Current liabilities were \u00a5124,396 million, an inc rease of \u00a524,215 million from a year earlier. b. Operating Results For the year ended March 31, 2022 (April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022), operating results were as follows. Millions of yen Year ended March 31, 2022 Year ended March 31, 2021 Change Percentage change (%) Revenue 335,138 297,177 37,960 12.8 Operating profit 110,312 Profit before tax 126,268 143,018 attributable to owners of parent 114,185 111,858 2,326 2.1 * The Company has established \"core operating profit \" as a profit indicator to present ordinary profitability. This has been adopted as the Company 's proprietary earnings management indicator. Core operating profit is an adjusted profit in which non -recurring items (impairment losses, gain on sale of property, plant, and equipment, etc.) are deducted from operating profit. Revenue was \u00a5335.1 billion, a 12.8 percent increased year on year. Domestic sales of prescription drugs were \u00a589.1 billion, a decrease of 5.9 percent, as a result of the launch of a generic version of Cymbalta . On the other hand, revenue from overseas subsidiary sales and exports was \u00a534.4 billion, a 39.5 percent in crease due to growth in sales of cefiderocol in Europe and the United States. Royalty income was \u00a5181.3 billion, a 25.3 percent increase due to the increase in royalty income from the HIV franchise. Operating profit was \u00a5110.3 billion, a 6.1 percent decrea se, as research and development expenses increased due to aggressive investment in COVID -19-related projects . Core operating profit excluding non -recurring items was \u00a5110.6 billion, an increase of 17.7 percent. Profit before tax was \u00a5126.3 billion, an 11.7 percent decrease. Despite the decrease in profit before tax, profit attributable to owners of parent was \u00a5114.2 billion, a 2.1 percent increase . The increase was the result of a refund received in connection with a favorable decision in Shionogi 's complaint for the rescission of tax reassessment by the Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, Shionogi achieved its financial forecast despite the sharp rise in research and deve lopment expenses for COVID -19-related proje cts. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, Shionogi will address challenges left over from previous years and redouble efforts to build Shionogi into a company with more earning power. - 18 - Domestic sales of prescription drugs Domestic sales of prescrip tion drugs decreased 5.9 percent to \u00a589.1 billion as a result of the decrease in sales due to the market entry of a generic version of Cymbalta . The flu season was very mild, like the previous season, but sales of influenza -related products increased \u00a52.8 billion to \u00a53.1 billion, as Shionogi recorded sales revenue from government stockpiles of Rapiacta. Sales of infectious disease drugs, which include influenza -related products, totaled \u00a511.8 billion, a 20.8 percent increase . Sales of Intuniv and Vyvanse were \u00a516.4 billion (a 25.4 percent increase) and \u00a50.8 billion (a 190.7 percent increase), respectively. During the COVID -19 pandemic, restrictions on visits to healthcare facilities by medical representatives (MRs) continued . To deliver product information t o healthcare professionals even in these circumstances, Shionogi improved its ability to communicate in digital environments, and focused on securing meeting opportunities . In addition, Shionogi built a sales IT platform to create an organization in which decisions are made based on data with the aim of increasing productivity per employee. Exports/Overseas subsidiary sales Revenue from overseas subsidiary sales and exports increased 39.5 percent to \u00a534.4 billion. Revenue in the Uni ted States increased 84.5 percent to \u00a513.8 billion as a result of strong sales of cefiderocol*1 and a one -time payment received in connection with the transfer of the sales rights to FORTAMET. Sales of cefiderocol increased 268.7 percent to \u00a56.2 billion. I n Europe, revenue increased 153.7 percent to \u00a55.0 billion on strong sales of cefiderocol . In addition, the Shionogi Group began sales in Italy . The Shionogi Group will drive growth in its European and North American businesses by continuing to expand cefid erocol sales to more countries and by expanding the number of countries adopting the subscription -type reimbursement model*2 . In China, sales in existing generic business decreased amid medical cost control measures by the Chinese government, but revenue i ncreased 1.1 percent to \u00a510.2 billion to the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. *1 Sold under the brand name Fetroja in the United States and Fetcroja in Europe *2 A subscription -type reimbursement model in which the country can receive antibiotics when needed by paying a fixed remuneration to the developing company irrespective of the amount of antibiotics prescription. Royalty income and dividend income from ViiV Sales of the HIV franchise out -licensed to UK -based ViiV Healthcare Ltd. ( \"ViiV \") expan ded, and royalty income from ViiV , excluding upfront payments, increased compared with the previous year . In addition, a settlement was reached in ViiV 's patent infringement litigation against U.S. -based Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( \"Gilead \") in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 . Under the terms of the settlement, Gilead paid ViiV $1.25 billion upfront and will pay ViiV a 3% royalty on future U.S. sales of Biktarvy (fo r reference: $6.09 billion in 2020) and on the bictegravir component of any future bictegravi r-containing products sold in the United States. ViiV paid a portion of the upfront payment to Shionogi, which Shionogi recognized as revenue. Also, Shionogi and ViiV have agreed to a defined annual payment to Shionogi from ViiV in respect of the 3% royalt ies, which Shionogi recorded an amount equivalent to royalty to be received in the future as revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. As a result, royalty income from ViiV increased 41.0 percent from the previous year to \u00a5174.0 billion. Royalty income from Switzerland -based Roche was \u00a540.0 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 as the scale of the seasonal influenza epidemic was extremely small globally, similar to the previous season. Royalty income on Crestor sales from UK -based Astra Zeneca decreased 93.1 percent to \u00a51.2 billion because the amount received decreased starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 under the license agreement. Total royalty, milestone and dividend income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 increased 15.6 percent year -on-year to \u00a5194.2 billion, reflecting the increase in royalty income from the HIV franchise. - 19 - Objective indicators for determining achievement status of management goals As described in \"II.

In the Medium -Term Business Plan, SHIONOGI Transformation Strategy 2030 (STS2030), which was updated in June 2020, the Shionogi Group set a target of 4.0% or higher in dividends on equity, which it aims to increase steadily in accordance with corporate value growth.

Corporate Governance, etc. (1) Overview of corporate governance i. Basic policy on corporate governance Based on the Shionogi Group 's Company Policy, its management philosophy, the Shionogi Group recognizes that its social mission is not only to supply useful and safe pharmaceuticals, but also to contribute to the improvement of health and healthcare for people around the world by prov iding various health care services that meet customer needs, thereby contributing to the realization of a high quality of life. Based on the Shionogi Group 's firm belief that pursuing thorough compliance and fulfilling this mission will lead to sustainable enhancement of corporate value, the Shionogi Group will take necessary measures to continue addressing changes in the business environment and practice transparent and honest management through constructive dialogue with its stakeholders. ii. Company ins titutions, etc. In order to promote the execution of duties founded in appropriate management judgment, the Board of Directors fulfills its m onitoring function duties, deliberating mainly on important business execution matters in addition to matters perta ining to the management foundation, such as the Company 's management philosophy and business plans. Here, it utilizes the management experience and expertise of the outside directors and outside auditors. As a result, the Company has established a system w hereby each organization associated with business execution is able to ascertain the progress of said execution with regard to matters on which manage ment decisions have been made, and reports to the Corporate Executive Meeting and the Board of Directors i n a timely manner. The Company has elected to adopt a system with a board of corporate auditors so as to determine whether these duties are carried out smoo thly and in a legally compliant manner, in conjunction with the supervisory function of the Board of Directors, the audit function of the auditors, and the operational audit function of internal audits. In addition, the Company separates management and business execution i nto the Board of Directors, which supervises management and makes decisions based o n medium - to long -term management plans, and the business execution framework, which is led by executive officers who execute business operations through swift and flexible d ecision - making. The auditing system consists of the Board of Corporate Auditors, w hich supervises management and audits business execution, and the Accounting Auditor, each of which fulfills its roles and responsibilities from an independent standpoint. For the purpose of strengthening this system, in order to further strengthen the supervisory function in regard to business execution by directors and to further enhance transparency of management, the Company appointed two outside directors at the Annual Genera l Meeting of Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31 , 2009 and increased the number of outside directors by one at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012. Currently, there are five directors, two of whom ar e women. By having more than half of its five directors a s outside directors, the Company maintains a system promoting fairer and more efficient management. All three outside directors are independent appointments who recognize the Company 's corporate responsibility, and they are contributing to highly transpare nt management. The Board of Directors meets once a month in principle to make decisions on important matters affecting management and to sup ervise the execution of business operations. Furthermore, the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Adv isory Committee, consisting of a majority of outside directors, have been established as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors. The Nomination Advisory Committee, chaired by Director Ando and consisting of Directors Ozaki, Takatsuki, Teshirogi and Corp orate Auditor Fujiwara, held one meeting in FY2021. Discussions focused on topics such as the appointment of executive office rs from perspectives like promoting research activities, balancing the expertise of the Board of Directors, including outside di rectors, and strengthening management support divisions. In addition, through proposals and reports at Board of Directors meetings and rou ndtable meetings with executive officers, a position newly created in FY2021, the Company creates opportunities for outsi de officers to interact with division heads and heads of key organizations to confirm the status of their human resources. The Compensation Advisory Committee, chaired by Director Ozaki and consisting of Directors Ando, Takatsuki, Teshirogi, and Corporate Auditor Okamoto, held two meetings in FY2021. Discussions focused on topics such as the performance evaluation of directors and executive officers for FY2020, performance indicators for FY2021, and the executive compensation system. The Company has introduced an executive officer system to support dynamic and flexible business operations, enabling the Shionogi Group to respond rapidly to drastic changes in the operating environment. It has also established the Corporate Executive Meet ing as a body to discuss business execution. It is composed of directors, standing members of the Board of Corporate Auditors, and the corporate officers responsible for business execution, and it meets every week in principle. The Corporate Executive Meet ing thoroughly deliberates on matters related to the execution of duties as well as important management matters. The business execution framework consists of nine divisions: the Pharmaceutical Research Division and Drug Development and Regulatory Science Division responsible for research and development, the CMC R&D Division responsible for production technology development, the Pharmaceutical Commercial Division responsible for transmission of pharmaceutical information, the Integrate d Disease Care Divisi on responsible for collecting and analyzing healthcare -related information and maximizing product and corporate value, the Global Business Division responsible for strategically promoting global business, the Corporate Strategy Division managed - 44 - and control led by the Corporate Strategy Committee which is a deliberating body for making decisions on business execution, the Administration Division supporting corporate activities from the aspects of people, organizations, and laws and regulations, and the DX Promotion Division building platforms leveraging data with IT and digital technologies and seeking to generate healthcare soluti ons. It also consists of the quality assurance organization responsible for items manufactured and sold. The Corporate Executive Me eting fully deliberates business execution, and the Board of Directors makes decisions on matters that affect management. To ensure that the directors and each organization in the Company conduct their duties in a legally compliant and appropriate manner, the Company has established systems to enable members of the Board of Corporate Auditors and the Internal Control Department (13 members as of June 24, 2022), to carry out audits and exchange opinions with the representative director to take necessary me asures. The Board of Corporate Auditors consists of two standing members and three outside auditors. The members of the Board of Corp orate Auditors attend meetings of key management bodies, such as the Board of Directors and the Corporate Executive Meeting, providing their opinions as necessary. Also, in accordance with corporate auditing standards, members of the Board of Corporate Auditor s conduct business and accounting audits to verify the legality and validity of the duties carried out by the directors a nd corporate officers responsible for business execution. They also receive reports from the Accounting Auditor on the content of accounting audits and exchange opinions. In the same manner, the Company receives regular reports from the Internal Control De partment on the content of internal audits and exchanges opinions with the department, among other actions. iii. Internal control system, status, etc. The Company 's basic policy regarding internal control systems is as follows, and it works to ensure the establishment of an internal control system in accordance with this policy. [Basic Policy for Construction and Operation of Internal Control System ] The Company will promote transparent and honest management by ensuring that all of its officers and employ ees share the Basic Policy, which expresses its management philosophy and values, and perform their duties in a compliant fashion. To make their performance of these duties more effective, we will construct and operate a system to ensure proper business op erations, as described below. 1. Systems for ensuring that the performance of director duties conforms to laws and regulations and to the Articles of Incor poration The Shionogi Group constantly promotes transparent and appropriate management in order to m eet societal expectations from the standpoints of its four stakeholder groups: customers, society, shareholders, and employees. To this end, we will permeate our corporate raison d 'etre by thoroughly adhering to the Shionogi Basic Policy, which serves as t he Company 's management philosophy, and the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct, which defines the way officers and employees should act. In addition, with respect to corporate ethics, we emphasize behavior that no member of society could be ashamed of. Here , the Compliance Committee, under the supervision of the representative director, will formulate and promote various measures to fu rther enhance compliance with laws and regulations and ensure ethical behavior in business activities. In addition, we will main tain an unwavering stance against anti -social forces and sever all ties with them without offering any room for manipulation, in accordance with the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct. Our corporate governance system is founded in the institutional design of a company with a board of corporate auditors and includes the Board of Directors, comprised of a majority of outside directors. In this system, we make big -picture management decisions based on the objective viewpoints called for by our shareholders and oth er stakeholders. The Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee have also been established as voluntary bodies. We will practice our Basic Views and Guidelines on Corporate Governance, established to realize the best possible cor porate governance, with the aim of achieving sustainable growth of the Shionogi Group and improving our corporate value over the medium - to long -term. In the execution of duties, we will promote their fairness, swiftness, and decisiveness by establishing a process for tracking decision -making, progress, and results from approval by an organizational head to resolution by the Board of Directors and verifying actual status, thus ensuring transparency and traceability. The Board of Directors, in order to fulfill its function as a monitoring board, makes decisions on important management matters based on a multifaceted management determination in accordance with the rules of the Board of Directors, ascertaining the sta tus of and supervising the execution of duties in a timely manner to prevent violations of laws, regulations, and the Articles of Incorporation. If a director discovers a violation of laws, regulations, or the Articles of Incorporation by another director, they shall im mediately report it to th e corporate auditors and the Board of Directors, and corrective actions will be taken. Outside directors are independent appointments who recognize the Company 's corporate responsibility, contributing to highly transparent management with their expertise. In order to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, the representative director promotes the construction and operation of internal controls over financial reporting and appropriately evaluates and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls. - 45 - Corporate auditors audit the execution of director duties, with directors cooperating with these audits. 2. Frameworks for storing and managing information in relation to the execution of director duties The Company has established an informati on security system for the execution of director duties supporting electromagnetic records, electronic signatures, etc., and, as appropriate for the storage media, appropriately and securely stores and manage minutes of Board of Directors meetings, Corpora te Executive Meeting meetings, and Compliance Committee meetings, as well as information on decisions by the representative director, etc. Here, the Company maintains compliance with deadlines stipulated by laws, regulations, e tc., and ensures that said in formation is viewable. 3. Regulations and other systems for managing the risk of loss The Shionogi Group will appropriately manage business risks from the perspective of sustainability, including the utilization of positive risks (business opportunities) and the avoidance and mitigation of negative risks. Our Enterprise Risk Management system, which oversees the entire Group 's risks, including risks of crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, terrorism, and cyberattacks, is an important mechanism for m anagement strategy and management foundations. Under this system, the Company and Group companies recognize risks associated with decision -making and business execution, and proactively manage and take countermeasures against these risks. The enterprise ri sk management secretariat presents the annual risk management plan to the Corporate Executive Meeting and the Board of Directors at the beginning of each fiscal year for approval, monitors the status of the plan 's actions, etc., and reports the results at the end of the fiscal year. Progress reports are also made as needed, and activities are promoted for further identification of issues and making improvements based on feedback. Regarding crisis risk management, we have constructed a comprehensive manageme nt system, including a business continuity plan and founded in our rules on crisis management, and will promote management that focuses on respect for human life, considerat ion for local communities and contributions, and control of corporate value damage. In the event of a crisis, we will deal with it and overcome it promptly. In addition, the Shionogi Group promotes sustainability activities for contributing to the sustainability of society and the sustainable growth of the Shionogi Group by solving vario us social issues in the areas of economy, society, and the environment through its business activities and responding to medical needs. The Internal Control Department (internal auditing unit) is responsible for independent verification of various internal risk controls. 4. Systems to ensure the efficient execution of director duties The Company has introduced an executive officer system to clarify the roles of management execution and supervision, as well as to support dynamic and flexible business operat ions. Important matters related to the execution of duties are fully discussed at regular (weekly) meetings of the Corporate Executive Meeting, and decisions are made by the Board of Directors based on the deliberat ions of these meetings. Resolutions of th e Board of Directors and matters deliberated by the Corporate Executive Meeting are promptly communicated to the heads of relevant departments responsible for business execution, and procedures are implemented to ensure the smooth executi on of duties by th e right personnel within the scope of their authority and responsibility in accordance with rules on authority and on the division of duties. At the Company, we always assume that business risks are present in the execution of duties, viewing positive risk s (offensive risks and business opportunities) and negative risks (defensive risks) as a single entity and setting decision -making criteria based on business risk levels, being careful to not miss opportunities. 5. Systems for ensuring that the performance of employee duties conforms to laws and regulations and to the Articles of Incorporation Led by the Compliance Committee, the Shionogi Group promotes a range of measures to better ensure that it is in compliance wi th laws and regulations and th at it engages in ethical behavior in its business activities, in accordance with the Shionogi Group Compliance Policy. The General Administration Department hosts the Compliance Committee 's secretariat, which conducts compliance and harassment education, a nd supports risk management for compliance and harassment in each business execution unit. In addition, in order to verify the effectiveness of internal control systems, the Internal Control Department works to stren gthen internal audits and monitoring. In addition, the internal reporting desk is fully utilized to prevent misconduct before it happens, and to rapidly detect any incidences and prevent their recurrence. 6. Systems for ensuring the propriety of business operations in the corporate group (the C ompany and its Group companies) In order to enhance the corporate value of the entire Shionogi Group and fulfill its social responsibility, the Company and i ts Group companies conduct activities to inform their members about the Company 's Basic Policy and the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct. - 46 - Directors receive reports from Group companies on the status of business execution, and appropriately manage and cultivate Gr oup companies in accordance with the Rules for Management of Shionogi Group Companies, so as to realize the Company 's Basic Policy, the Shionogi Group Code of Conduct, management plans, etc. At each Group company, appropriate and efficient business operations are promoted by managing businesses in accordance with t he above. With r espect to the execution of business operations at each Group company, business units such as the Drug Research Division and Pharmaceutical Commercial Division, as well as administrative units such as the General Administration Department and Finance & Acco unting Department, manage and support appropriate business operations, while the General Administration Department provides an overall administrative role for the Shionogi Group . In addition, the Internal Control Department uses internal audits to confirm that each Group companies is conducting operations in an appropriate and effective way. Members from the Finance & Accounting Department and Internal Control Department are dispat ched as auditors to audit Group companies. 7. Matters related to employees r equested by members of the Board of Corporate Auditors to assist in their duties (assistant employees) and matters related to the independence of these assistant employees from directors Assistant employees shall be assigned if they are deemed necessary an d requested by Board of Corporate Auditors members. In the event that employees are assigned to assist the duties of Board of Corporate Auditors members, a system shall be provi ded to ensure their independence from directors.

(hereinafter the \"Company \") is a public company incorporated in Japan . The Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Shionogi Group \") engages in research, development, purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and other operat ions associated with the prescription drug business. 2. Basis of Preparation (1) Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Shionogi Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( \"IFRS \") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ( \"IASB \"). As the Company meets the requirements of a \"Specified Company applying Designated International Fin ancial Reporting Standards \" pursuant to Article 1 -2 of the \"Regulation on Terminology, Forms, and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements \" (Ministry of Finance Order No. 28 of 1976) , it has adopted the provision of Article 93 of said regul ation . The consolidated financial statements of the Shionogi Group were approved on June 23, 2022 by Isao Teshirogi, Representative Director and President and CEO. (2) Basis of Measurement The Shionogi Group 's consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial instruments measured at fair value, etc. as described in Note \"3. Significant Accounting Policies. \" (3) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency The Shionogi Group 's consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the functional currency of the Company . All financial information presented in Japanese yen has been rounded down to the nearest million. (4) Significant Accounti ng Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions The preparation of the Shionogi Group 's consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities . Actual results could differ from these estimations due to uncertainties of these estimations and assumptions . In addition, these estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuous basis . The effects of these revisions to account ing estimates and assumptions are recognized in the accounting period in which the estimates and assumptions are revised and in any future accounting periods affected by the revision. Significant items on which management makes its estimates and judgments are as follows: Impairment of non -financial assets (See Note \"3. Significant Accounting Policies (5) Property, Plant and Equipment, (6) Goodwill, (7) Intangible Assets, (10) Impairment of Non -Financial Assets, \" Note \"11. Property, Plant and Equipment, \" Note \"12. Goodwill, \" and Note \"13. Intangible Assets \"). In calculating the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill, and other asset s, assumptions are made regarding sales forecasts in the business plan and discount rates and the likelihood of regulatory approval for pre -launch products , etc. These estimations could be affected by changes in future economic conditions and if the recoverable amount decreases, impairment loss could be recorded. Fair value o f unlisted shares (ViiV Healthcare Ltd.) (See Note \"3. Significant Accounting Policies \" (17) Financial Instruments, Note \"17. Other Financial Assets, \" and Note \"30. Financial Instruments \"). The fair value of the shares of ViiV Healthcare Ltd, an unlisted company engaged in the development, manufactur ing and marketing of anti -HIV drugs , was calculated using valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data, such as future cash flows and discount rate s. The significant assumptions used in the fair value measurement are the sales growth rate of products, the profit ratio and the discount rate . Among them , the sales growth rate and profit ratio are affected by sales trends for competing products and the company 's development and marketing strategies , whereas the discount rate is affected by market interest rates and other market conditions, which may affect total assets and equity . Impact of COVID -19 An expanded of COVID -19 pandemic could result in delays of business activities such as production, sales, and research and development . It is difficult to predict when the pandemic is to be fully controlled and contained . At present, the impact on business activities is minor, and the Shionogi Group assumes that COVID -19 pandemic will have a limited impact on accounting estimates - 72 - such as impairment tests of goodwill, etc . Changes in these assumptions could significantly affect amounts in the consolidated financial statements. (5) New or Amended Accountin g Standards and Interpretations Not Yet Adopted None of the standards and interpretations that have been newly established or revised by the approval date of the consolidate d financial statements have a significant impact on the Shionogi Group . (6) Change s in Presentation Method (Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) \"Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment \" presented separately under \"Net cash used in investing activities \" for the fiscal year ended March 31, 202 1 is presented within \"Other \" for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 , since its its materiality has decreased. The consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation method. As a res ult, 45 million presented in \"Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment \" under \"Net cash used in investing activities \" in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 has been reclassified as \"Other. \" 3. Significant Accounting Policies The Shionogi Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated. (1) Basis of Co nsolidation 1) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Shionogi Group . The Shionogi Group is considered to control an entity that is an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee and has an ability to affect those returns through power over the investee. The financial statements of subsid iaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Shionogi Group obtains control of a subsidiary until the date when it loses control of the subsidiary. The financial statements of subsidiaries with different reporting dates ar e prepared provisionally as of the consolidated reporting date . Changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions . Any difference between the adjustment to non -controlling interests and the fair value of consideration transferred or received, is recognized directly in equity as equity attributable to owners of parent. All intragroup balances, transactions, and unrealized gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 2) Joint Ventures A joint venture is an entity in which two or more parties, including the Shionogi Group , share contractually -agreed control over economic activities, and where strategic financial and op erating decisions related to that activity require the consent of all parties sharing control. Investments in joint ventures held by the Shionogi Group are accounted for by the equity method. 3) Business Combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of the acquiree are measured in principle at the fair value at t he acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the conside ration transferred in a business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer 's previously -held equity interest in the acquiree, over the acquisition -date fair value of the identifiable net as sets acquired . The consideration transferred in a business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition -date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree, and th e equity interests issued by the acquirer. Non-controlling interests are initially measured either at fair value or at the non -controlling interests ' proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree 's identifiable net assets on a transaction -by-transaction basis. Acquisition -related costs incurred in connection with business combinations, such as finder 's fees and advisory fees are recognized as expenses in the period they are incurred. In addition, any additional acquisition of non -controlling interests after the Shionogi Group obtains the control of a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction, for which no goodwill is recognized. - 73 - (2) Foreign Currency Translations 1) Foreign Currency Transactions Foreign currency transactions are tr anslated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the spot rates of exchange at the end of each reporting period . Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates in effe ct on the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from the translation or settlement are recognized in profit or loss . However, exchange differences arising from financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehens ive income and cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income. 2) Translation of Foreign Operations Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rates of exchange at the end of each reporting period , and income and expenses are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or rates that approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions . Exchange differences a rising from translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On the disposal of the interest in a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences on translation of forei gn operations is reclassified to profit or loss. (3) Revenue The Shionogi Group recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for a good or service to a customer using the five -step approach below, except for interest and dividend income, etc. as defi ned in IFRS 9. Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognize revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied In addition, in terms of a promise to grant a license as a separate performance obligation, the Shionogi Group considers whether the nature of the promise in granting the lic ense to a customer is to provide the customer with either of the following benefits in determining whether the transfer to the customer occurs at a point in time or over time: 1) A right to access the Shionogi Group 's intellectual property as it exists throughout the license period; or 2) A right to use the Shionogi Group 's intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted. If the Shionogi Group determines that the nature of its promise to transfer the license is to provide the customer with a right to access the Shionogi Group 's intellectual property as it exists throughout the license period, the Shionogi Group accounts for the promise to grant the license as the performance obl igation satisfied over time. If the Shionogi Group determines that the nature of its promise to transfer the license is to provide the customer with a right to use the Shionogi Group 's intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the li cense is granted , the Shionogi Group accounts for the promise to grant the license as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time . Notwithstanding the above, revenue in the form of sales -based or usage -based royalties is recognized when (or as) t he later of following events occurs: 1) The subsequent sale or usage occurs; and 2) The performance obligation to which some or all of the sales -based or usage -based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). - 74 - (4) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of current taxes and deferred taxes. 1) Current Taxes Current tax is measured at the expected amount to be paid to or received from the tax authorities, applying the tax rates and tax laws and regulations that have been enacted o r substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period . Current tax recognized in profit or loss does not include taxes arising from items directly recognized in other comprehensive income or equity and taxes arising from business combinations. 2) Deferred Taxes Deferred taxes are calculated based on the temporary differences determined by comparing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes with the tax base at the end of the reporting period . Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, unused tax credits and tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized . Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences . However, deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from the following temporary differences are not recognized: Temporary differences arising from the ini tial recognition of goodwill; Temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss) at the time of the transaction; Deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangeme nts, when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or it is not probab le that there will not be taxable profits against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized; or Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements , when the Shionog i Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the periods in w hich the temporary differences are expected to reverse based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when the Shionogi Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income ta xes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity. (5) Property , Plant and Equipment The Shionogi Group uses the cost model to measure property, plant and equipment after recognition . Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisit ion cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses . Acquisition cost includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition and asset dismantlement, removal, and restoration co sts. Property, plant and equipment other than land and co nstruction in progress are depreciated using the straight -line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. The estimated useful lives of major items of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Buildings and structures 2 to 60 years Machinery and vehicles 2 to 17 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and revised if necessary. (6) Goodwill Goodwill is stated at acquisition cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually regardless of any indication of impairment, and when ever there is an indication of impairment. (7) Intangible Assets The Shionogi Group uses the cost model to measure intang ible assets after recognition . Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at acquisition cost . Acquisition cost of intangible assets acquired in a business - 75 - combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Internally generated development expenditures are recognized as intangible assets only when they satisfy all criteria for rec ognizing them as assets . However, internally generated de velopment expenditures incurred before the acquisition of marketing and manufacturing approval, such as clinical trial costs, etc., are recognized as expenses when incurred as they do not satisfy capitalization criteria due to uncertainties related to length and other factors in development. Product or technology in -license agreements, and products or research and development rights acquired through business combinations which are still in the research and development phase and have not yet received marketi ng approval from regulatory authorities (regulatory approval) are recognized as in -process research and development and are included in \"Intangible assets associated with products. \" Expenditures associated with acquired in -process research and development are capitalized only when they are expected to bring future economic benefits to the Shionogi Group and are identifiable . These include upfront payments to third parties and mileston e payments when the milestone is achieved. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized by the straight -line method over their estimated useful lives from the date when they are available for their intended use. The estimated useful lives of major intangible assets are as follows: Intangible assets associated with products 8-15 years Software 5 years Amortization methods, residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and revised as necessary. Intangible assets not yet available for u se are not amortized, and are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication of impairment. (8) Leases 1) Identifying leases At the inception of a contract, the Shionogi Group assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is a lease, or contains a lease, if it conveys the right to use an identified asset for a period of time in exchan ge for consideration. 2) As lessee The Shionogi Group recognizes the right -of-use asset and lease liability at the commence ment date of the lease . For short -term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the Shionogi Group has elected to recognize the lease payments as an expense over the lease term using the straight -line method or other systematic bas is. Right -of-use assets are measured using the cost model and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right -of-use asset is calculated based on the assumption that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the Shio nogi Group depreciates the right -of-use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset . Otherwise, the Shionogi Group depreciates the right -of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the use ful life of the right -of-use asset or the end of the lease term. At the commencement date, the Shionogi Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date . In subsequent periods, the Shionogi Group reduces the carrying amount of the lease liability to reflect the interest on the lease liability and lease payments made. 3) As lessor The Shionogi Group classifies leases as operating leases if they do not transfer substantially all the risks and reward s incidental to ownership of the underlying assets. Lease payments from operating leases are recognized as revenue using the straight -line method or other systematic basis. (9) Investment Property Investment property is held to earn rentals or capital appreciation or both . Investment property is measured similarly to property, plant and equipment. (10) Impairment of Non -Financial Assets For non -financial assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets, the Shionogi Group assesses whether there is any indication that - 76 - an asset or cash -generating unit may be impaired . If any indication of impairment exists, the Shionogi Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or cash -generating unit and tests for impairment. Goodwill and intangibl e assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually regardless of any indication of impairment . In addition, the Shionogi Group tests for impairment when any indication of impairment exists. The recoverable amount is determined a t the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal, or its value in use . In determining value in use, estimated future cash flows from the asset or cash -generating unit are discounted to their present value using a pre -tax discount rate that reflects th e time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the asset or cash -generating unit, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the difference is recognized as an impa irment loss in profit or loss. An asset or a cash -generating unit other than goodwill, for which impairment losses were recognized in prior years, is assessed for any indication that the impairment loss may have reversed . If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash - generating unit is estimated . If the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset or cash -generating unit, the impairment loss is reversed up to the carrying amount less depreciation that would have b een determined if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years, and is recognized in profit or loss . Impairment loss is not reversed for goodwill. (11) Inventories Inventories consist primarily of finished products and merchandise, work in progre ss, and raw materials and supplies. Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition cost and net realizable value . The acquisition cost of inventories is determined using the weighted -average cost formula and includes raw materials, direct labor and other direct costs, and related manufacturing overhead costs . Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs required fo r sales. (12) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short -term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of change in valu e and due within three months from the date of acquisition. (13) Equity 1) Ordinary Shares Proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares by the Company are recognized in share capital and capital surplus . Transaction costs (post -tax) directly attributabl e to the issuance of ordinary shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. 2) Treasury Shares When the Company acquires treasury shares, direct acquisition cost (post -tax) is recognized as a deduction from equity. When the Company sells treasury shar es, the consideration received is recognized as an increase in equity. (14) Employee Benefits 1) Post-employment Benefits (i) Defined Benefit Plans The present value of defined benefit plan obligations and related current service cost and past service cost are calculated for each individual plan using the projected unit credit method . The discount rate is determined with reference to the market yields on high - quality corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period corresponding to the expecte d future benefit payment date . The net defined benefit liabilities or assets are calculated by deducting the fair value of the plan assets from the present value of the def ined benefit obligations . When a defined benefit plan has a surplus, the net defined benefit asset is limited to the asset ceiling, which is the present value of future economic benefits available in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Remeasu rements of defined benefit plans are recognized in full in oth er comprehensive income and immediately transferred to retained earnings in the period in which they are recognized. (ii) Defined Contribution Plans The costs for defined contribution plans are recognized as expenses when the employees render the related service. 2) Short -term Employee Benefits Short -term employee benefits are recognized as expenses when the associated services are rendered by employees at undiscounted - 77 - amounts . Bonuses and expenses for paid absences are recognized as liabilities for the e xpected benefit payment when the Shionogi Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay for employee benefits and a reliable estimate is available for the obli gation. (15) Share -based Remuneration The Shionogi Group has implemented a share option plan and a restricted share -based remuneration plan as equity -settled share -based payment plans. No share options have been granted through the share option plans since 2018, and all share options granted had already vested before the date of transition to IFRS . The Shionogi Group does not retrospectively apply IFRS 2 \"Share -based Payments \" to equity instruments that vested before the date of transition to IFRS under the exemption of IFRS 1 \"First-time Adoption of Internation al Financial Reporting Standards. \" The restricted share -based remuneration plan is recognized as an expense over the period from the grant date to vesting, and the same amount is recognized as an increase in equity . The fair value of restricted share -based remuneration is measured with reference to the fair value of the Company 's ordinary shares on the grant date. In addition, the Shionogi Group has implemented a cash -settled share -based payment plan linked to share price. The Shionogi Group recognizes the fair value of cash -settled share -based payments in liabilities and recognizes any changes in fair value in profit or loss until the date of settlement. (16) Government Grants Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is rea sonable assurance that the Shionogi Group will comply with the conditions attached to them and receive the grants. Government grants related to assets are recognized as deferred income and are systematically recognized in profit or loss ove r the estimated useful lives of the assets. Government grants related to income are systematically recognized in profit or loss over the periods in which the Shionogi Group recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate. (17) Financial Instruments 1) Non-derivative Financial Assets (i) Initial Recognition and Measurement Trade receivables included in financial assets are recognized on the date when they are incurred . All other financial assets are initially recognized on the date the Shionogi Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument . At initial recognition, financial assets are classified into financial assets measured at amortized cost or financial assets measured at fair value. This classification is carried out as follows, depending on whether the financial asset is a debt instrume nt or an equity instrument. (a) Financial Assets Classified into Debt Instruments Debt instruments are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met: the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In addition, debt instruments are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met: the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting c ontractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Debt instruments not he ld in one of the two business models above are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. (b) Financial Assets Classified into Equity Instruments In principle, equity instruments are classified as financial assets measur ed at fair value through profit or loss. However, on initial recognition, an equity instrument that is not held for trad ing is permitted to be classified individually as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In principle, financial assets are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. - 78 - However, trade receivables that do not include a significant financing component are measured at the transaction price. In addition, transaction costs for financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are expensed as incurred and recorded in profit or loss. (ii) Subsequent Measurement (a) Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost These assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method . Interest is recognized in profit or loss as \"Finance income. \" The amortized cost is reduced if impairment loss is necessary to be recognized. (b) Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. For equity instruments the Shionogi Group has elected to measure at fair value through other comprehensive income, subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, and cumulative gain or loss is transferred to retained earnings when the financial asset is derecognized . Dividends from these financial assets are recognized in profit or loss as \"Finance income. \" In addition, for debt instruments classified as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, change in fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income until derecognition or a change in classification, excluding impair ment losses (or reversals) and foreign exchange gains or losses . Upon derecogniti on of the financial assets, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss . For assets other than the above, changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. (iii) Impairment Financial assets measured at amortized cost and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income included in debt instruments are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine if the credit risk of the assets has increa sed signi ficantly since initial recognition . The Shionogi Group recognizes the following amounts as allowance for doubtful accounts, depending on whether there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. (a) Credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition --An amount equal to the 12 -month expected credit losses (b) Credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition --An amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses Notwithstanding the above, allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables and lease receivables is always recognized in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition . Expected credit loss is calculated as the present v alue of the difference between the contractual cash flows the Shionogi Group should receive and the cash flows the Shionogi Group expects to receive. Provision for allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized in profit or loss . If an event occurs that re duces the allowance for doubtful accounts , the reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized in profit or loss. (iv) Derecognition The Shionogi Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset e xpire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. 2) Non -derivative Financial Liabilities (i) Initial Recognition and Measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at i nitial recognition, as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss . Financial liabilities are initially recognized on the transaction date when the Shionogi Group becomes p arty to contractual provisions of the financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value . However, directly attributable transaction costs are deducted from the fair value of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. (ii) Subsequent Measurement Financial liabilities are subsequently measured after initial recognition according to their classification, as follows: (a) Financial Liabilities Measured at Amortized Cost - 79 - These liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized co st using the effective interest method. Amortization under the effective interest method and gains and losses on derecognition are recognized in profit or loss as \"Finance costs \" or \"Finance income. \" (b) Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value throug h Profit or Loss These liabilities are subsequently measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. (iii) Derecognition The Shionogi Group derecognizes a financial liability when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled, or expires. 3) Derivatives and Hedge Accounting The Shionogi Group hedges risks arising from exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates using derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the contract inception date and are subsequently measured at fair value . In principle, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in profit or loss. However, the Shionogi Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges . The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated is recognized in other comprehensive income if qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are met . The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in pro fit or loss. Gain or loss related to hedging instruments previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecasted transactions subsequently result in the recognition of a non -financial asset or a non -financial liability, the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized as an adjustment to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability. 4) Financia l guarantee contracts A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the guarantor to compensate the guarantee for losses incurred by the guarantee for failure of specific debtors to make payments when due according to the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. These financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value as of the time of the initial contract signing. After this initial recognition, they are measured at the higher of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts or the amount of initial re cognition less accumulated revenue recognized, except for those measured at fair value. - 80 - 4.

Revenue (1) Breakdown of Revenue The breakdown of revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 is as follows: Millions of yen Year ended March 31, 2021 Year ended March 31, 2022 Prescription drugs in Japan 94,684 89,127 Exports and overseas subsidiaries 24,645 297,177 335,138 \"Revenue \" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss is revenue recognized from contracts with customers . Revenue recognized from other sources is included in \"Other income, \" described in Note \"7. Other Income and Other Expenses, \" and \"Finance income, \" described in Note \"8. Finance Income and Finance Costs. \" In addition, the Shionogi Group omits disclosure of segment information as described in Note \"4. Segment Information. \" Group revenue comprises the following . Revenue from prescription drugs in Japan includes prescription drug sales in Japan and compensation associated with co -promotion agreements . Revenue from exports and overseas subsidiaries includes income from export transactions, sales and royalty income r ecognized by overseas subsidiaries . Revenue from contract manufacturing includes income associated with contract manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) . Revenue from sales of over -the-counter drugs includes sales revenue and royalty incom e from over -the-counter drugs of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries . Royalty income includes royalty income recognized by the Company and domestic subsidiaries. Other revenue includes sales of diagnostics and revenue recognized by domestic subsidiar ies. In prescription drug and over -the-counter drug sales in Japan and overseas, revenue from sales within the same country is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer, unless otherwise specified by contract, while revenue from export sales is recognized at the point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is when the customer is deemed to obtain control over t he product based on terms and conditions of trade, etc . Consideration for the transaction is generally received w ithin three months after the satisfaction of the performance obligation. Some transactions involve variable consideration in the form of rebates to customers based on the sales volume of related pro ducts to promote sales of Group products . However, signifi cant reversals of cumulative revenue recognized will generally not occur since the Shionogi Group can reasonably estimate rebates payable to customers . Therefore, the Shionogi Group has determined that its estimates of variable consideration are not constr ained. In addition, the Shionogi Group sells products for which the customer has a right of return . The Shionogi Group calculates expected returns for these products based on the estimated rate of return, deducts this amount from sales revenue, and recognizes a re fund liability in the same amount . Furthermore, since the Shionogi Group 's products are difficult to resell du e to their nature, the Shionogi Group does not recognize an asset for its right to recover products from customers on settling the refund liability. For contract API manufacturing, the Shionogi Group generally determines that its performance obligation is satisfied when the customer takes delivery of the API and recognizes revenue at that time . Consideration for the transaction is generally received within two months after the satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Shionogi Group out-licenses the use of intellectual property such as patents the Shionogi Group owns to the counterparties of - 82 - licensing contracts . The Shionogi Group considers the performance obligation of these contracts to be satisfied at a point in time, as it does not plan to undert ake any activities that significantly affect the intellectual property provided under the contract . The Shionogi Group recognizes revenue at the point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied by granting the license to the licensee. Consideration for out -licensing consists mainly of upfront payments when an agreement is concluded; milestone payments when the prescribed research and development, sales and other milestones are achieved; and royalties based on sales or sales volume . Rece ipt of consideration is generally within two months after the requisite conditions have been satisfied. The Shionogi Group receives the milestone payments, included in the consideration for out -licensing, if a pre -determined milestone is achieved. As the a chievement of specified milestones is uncertain, however, the amount of consideration to which the Shionogi Group will be entitled is variable . The Shionogi Group estimates entitlement to consideration that includes a variable component, and only includes it in the transaction price and recognizes it as revenue when the uncertainty regarding the variable consideration is subsequ ently resolved to the extent that it is highly probable that a material reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur . As the receipt of milestone payments is contingent on the decisions and actions of the licensee, and uncertainties may not have been resolve d for a long term, there is a possibility that a significant reversal of revenue occurs when uncertainties are resolv ed. As a result, variable consideration estimates are constrained in licensing transactions that involve the receipt of milestone payments. However, revenue in the form of sales -based or usage -based royalties is recognized at the later of when (1) the subs equent sale or usage occurs, or (2) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales -based or usage -based royalty has been allocated is satisfied (in whole or in part). The Shionogi Group has elected not to adjust significant financing compone nts, at contract inception, if a period between when the Shionogi Group provides its products or services to customers and when the customers pay for the products or services is expected to be one year or less. In addition, the Shionogi Group does not sell products with warranties or similar rights. (2) Contract Balances Contract balances are as follows: Millions of yen Receivables arising from contracts with customers Contract liabilities Notes receivable Accounts receivable Total As of April 1, 2020 459 79,417 79,877 452 As of March 31, 2021 869 77,249 As 122,594 123,015 1,142 The Shionogi Group had no contract assets as of March 31, 2021 and 2022.

These were arising from milestone payments fulfilled and receivable when the pre -determined milestones were achieved by the Shionogi Group in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 and royalties included as a componen t of consideration for the performance obligation at the time of granting a license. (3) Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations The Shionogi Group applies the practical expedient under IFRS 15, Paragraph 121 and does not disclose information regarding remaining performance obligations with an initial expected period of one year or less. The Shionogi Group has no material transactions with the original expected contract duration exceedin g one year. (4) Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer No assets were recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer as of March 31, 2021 and 2022 .

Under these agreements, the Shionogi Group is obliged to make milestone payments upon the achievement of agreed objectives or when certain conditions are met as defined in the agreements. The amounts shown in the table above represent the maximum payments to be made when all milestones are achieve d, but impact of discount and other risks are not considered .

If a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, the contract is considered to be or contain a lease, and the Shionogi Group recognizes a right -of-use asset and lease liability at the commencement date of the lease . However, for short -term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the Shionogi Group expenses lease payments over the lease term using the straight -line method. Some lease contracts mainly related to real estate include the option to extend or cancel the lease to give the Shionogi Group flexibility in managing floor space and personnel. The Shionogi Group makes decisions to exercise the contractual option to extend a lease after comprehensively considering the - 99 - operational necessity of the leased asset, difficulties in obtaining an alternative asset, and the conditions for exercising the op tion, and determining that it is necessary to exercise the option . The extended lease term as a result of exercising the option, and the lease payments during that term, are generally the same as or closely approximate the original lease term and payments. In addition, the Shionogi Group makes decisions to exercise the contractual option to terminate a lease in a manner similar to its decisions concerning the contractual option to extend a lease. The Shionogi Group annually reassesses the possibility of exe rcise of both the option to extend a lease and the option to cancel a lease at the end of each reporting period . The financial impact of this reassessment was immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

Contributions are calculated to enable the financial balance between expected future benefit expenses and expected returns on plan assets at a rate determined on the ba sis of expected interest rates, expected mortality rates, expected withdrawal rates, and the calculation of expected expenses for other required benefits . Also, contributions are recalculated every five years . In addition, an additional contribution is requi red if the reserve fund for benefits is less than the minimum reserve criteria. Plan assets are legally independent from the Shionogi Group . The asset management trustee is responsible for the plan assets, has a fiduciary obligation to pension plan members , and has fund management obligations that include diversified investment . Conflicts of interest are prohibited. Plan assets are managed to secure the necessary total returns over the long -term within acceptable risk levels to ensure payments of pension b enefits in the future . The acceptable risk level in the return rate on the plan assets is derived from a detailed study considering the mid - to long -term trends and the changes in income such as contributions and payments . Based on policies and studies, af ter consideration of issues such as the expected rate of return and risks, the asset management trustee formulates a basic asset mix which aims at an optimal portfolio on a long -term basis with the selection of appropriate investment assets.

The Company has also implemented a cash -settled share -based payment linked to the Company 's share price f or corporate officers who reside overseas. (1) Share Option Plan The Company issued share acquisition rights in the form of share options to directors and corporate officers as incentives fo r them to enhance corporate value and improve medium - to long -term business performance because they share with shareholders of the Company both the benefits of share price appreciation and the risk of share price declines . The Company replaced the share options plan with a restricted share -based remuneration plan in 201 8 and did not issue share options during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 .

The plan has no vesting conditions. During the exercise period, recipients can only exercise granted share acquisition rights at one time within 10 days from the date directors lose their position, the date corporate officers retire or their employment contracts wi th the Company terminate. The number of shares to be issued per share acquisition rights is 100 shares . However, when the Company conducts its ordinary shares split (including gratis allotment of ordinary shares of the Company) or a reverse stock split, th e number of granted shares will be adjusted according to a specified formula. - 112 - (b) Movement of the number of share options and their weighted average exercise prices is as follows: Year ended March 31, 2021 Year ended March 31, 2022 Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price (Yen) Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price (Yen) Outstanding at the beginning of the year 1,861 1 1,008 1 Granted - - - - Exercised (853) 1 - - Forfeited or expired - - - - Outstanding at the end of the year 1,008 1 1,008 1 Exercisable at the end of the year 1,008 1 1,008 1 Note: The weighted average share price on the exercise date of share options exercised during the reporting period was \u00a56,226 for the year ended March 31, 2021 .

(c) Measurement of Fair Value of Share Options Granted during the Reporting Period No share options were granted during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022. (2) Restricted Share -based Remuneration Plan The Company has implemented a restricted share -based remuneration plan, granting incentives to directors other than outside directors and to corporate officers of the Company (col lectively, eligible officers) with the aim of achieving medium - to long -term performance targets and participating in shareholder value. (a) Outline of Restricted Share -based Remuneration Plans This plan consists of \"Long -term share -based remuneration, \" which is conditional on eligible officers remaining in the Company for a specified period of time as a director or corporate officer not concurrently serving as a director, and \"Medium -term performance - linked share -based remuneration ,\" which is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions aimed at improving the corporate value of the Company over the medium to long term in addition to the vesting condition described above. Eligible officers make contributions in kind, with a ll the monetary compensation receivables awarded by the Company, and in turn receive ordinary shares in the Company that are newly issued or disposed of from treasury. In addition, when issuing or disposing of the Company 's ordinary shares under this plan, it is conditional on the agreement on allotment of restricted shares between the Company and the eligible officers, which includes the following items 1) to 4) and so on. 1) The transfer, pledge or other disposal of shares to a third -party is prohibited for a specified period of time. 2) Under certain circumstances, the Company will acquire all or part of the restricted shares without payment of consideration. 3) Eligible officer has held any of the positions of director or corporate officer who does not concurrent ly serve as director throughout the restriction period. 4) As for the \"Medium -term performance -linked share -based remuneration, \" adding to the condition of 3) above, the Company shall lift the transfer restriction for vested shares of which the number is determined based on the level of achievement of the performance conditions, originally set by the Board of Directors meeting, suc h as Return on Equity (ROE), etc., at the end of the restriction period . The transfer restriction period is 30 years for \"Long -term share -based remuneration \" for which the primary objective is to allow eligible officers to participate in shareholder value, and 3 years for \"Medium -term performance -linked share -based remuneration \" for which the primary objective is to incentivize eligible officers to achieve the performance targets of medium -term management plans. The transfer restrictions are lifted immedia tely when a director, or corporate officer who does not concurrently serve as director, steps down or retires due to the expiration of their term of office, compulsory retirement or any other legitimate reasons. - 113 - (b) Shares Granted during the Reporting Pe riod and Fair Value Year ended March 31, 2021 Year ended March 31, 2022 Grant date July 22, 2020 July 21, 2021 Shares granted: Long -term share -based remuneration 14,200 shares 14,200 shares Medium -term share -based remuneration 9,000 shares 11,500 shares Fair value at grant date \u00a57,087 \u00a55,518 (3) Share -based Remuneration Expenses The breakdown of share -based remuneration expenses is as follows: Millions of yen Year ended March 31, 2021 Year ended March 31, 2022 Equity -settled 265 144 Cash -settled 7 5 Total 272 149 Note: Cash -settled share -based remuneration pays the difference between exercise price and share price on the date of exercise in cash to corporate officers who reside overseas . During the exercise period, the corporate officer can only exercise at one time, up to 10 days subsequent to the day afte r the retirement of the corporate officer. The carrying amount of liabilities arising from cash -settled remuneration plans were \u00a541 million and \u00a547 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. 27Trade Payables The breakdown of trade payables is as follows: Millions of yen As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 Trade payables 9,902 16,372 28Government Grants Government grants related to assets recognized as deferred income included in \"Other non -current liabilities \" in the consolidated statement of financial position are as follows: Millions of yen As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 Other non -current liabilities 282 262 Government grants related to assets are mainly received for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. No outstanding conditions or other contingencies are associated with these above government grants. Government grants related to income are mainly related to R&D activities . The amounts of \u00a51,158 million and \u00a514,304 million were deducted from R&D expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. - 114 - 29Other Liabilities The breakdown of other liabilities is as follows: Millions of yen As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 Accrued bonuses 8,093 8,466 Accrued paid absences 2,765 2,736 Refund liabilities 884 expenses 37,481 65,078 30Financial Instruments (1) Capital Management The fundamental principles of the Shionogi Group 's capital risk management are to build and retain a steady financial base for the purpose of maintaining soundness and efficiency of operations and achieving sustainable growth. According to these principles, the Shionogi Group conducts business investment, profit distribution such as dividends, and repayment of borrowings based on steady operating cash flows through the d evelopment and sales of competitive products. The Shionogi Group uses the following primary indicators for capital management: Year ended March 31, 2021 Year ended March 31, 2022 Return on equity attributable to owners of parent (ROE) 13.9% 12.5% Ratio of equity attributable to owners of parent to total assets 84.7% 84.8% Ratio of fair value of equity attributable to owners of parent to total assets 179.6 % 197.3 % (2) Financial Risk Management The Shionogi Group is exposed to financial risks incl uding credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, and market price fluctuation risk, etc. in the course of conducting its business activities, and manages risks based on its policy to avoid or mitigate th ese risks . In addition, the Shionogi Group obtains necessary funding primarily through bank borrowings and bond issuance based on its business plan for its main business, the production and sales of pharmaceuticals . Temporary surplus funds are managed through the investment in lower -risk financial assets . Derivatives are utilized for mitigating the risks described in latter part of this note, and not utilized for speculative purpose. (3) Credit Risk Notes and accounts receivable included in trade receivables are exposed to the credit risk of customers . In accordance with the internal procedures determined by the Company, the Finance & Accounting Department and related departments of the Company periodically monitor the conditions of major customers, manage the collection due dates and balances for each customer and try to identify credit risk of customers with worsening financial conditions at the early stage and mitigate the risk . Consolidated subsidiaries perform the similar credit risk management in accordance with the internal rules of the Company . The amount of trade receivables due from the largest customers comprises 51.8% and 67.9% as of March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Derivative transactions are also exposed to the credit risk of counterparty . The Company enters into derivative transactions with only financial institutions with high credit ratings to mitigate the counterparty risk. - 115 - The Shionogi Group 's maximum exposure to credit risk as of March 31, 2021 and 2022 is represented by the carrying amount after impairment of financial assets exposed to credit risk shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. The maximum exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts is the amount of guarantee obligation as described in \"33. Contingent Liabilities. \" 1) Recognition and Measurement of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Shionogi Group calculates the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables, lease receivables and other financial assets . A financial asset is treated as credit -impai red if terms and conditions for repayment stipulated by contract cannot be fulfilled . (i) Trade Receivables and Lease Receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, and is estimated based on past credit loss experience for similar assets. (ii) Other Financial Assets Allowance for doubtful accounts is generally recognized at an amount equal to the 12 -month expected credit losses, and is estimated based on past credit loss e xperience for similar assets. However, in principle, credit risk is considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition if repayment is ov erdue more than 30 days, and allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses . Allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the recoverability of each individual asset. All financial assets with particular collection risk due to extended default or insolvency or legal and formal bankruptcy pr oceedings on the part of the debtor are treated as credit -impaired financial assets . The allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for the entire period and is estimated based on the recoverability of each individual asset. For any amount that is clearly unrecoverable in the future, the carrying amount of the financial asset is directly reduced, a nd the corresponding amount of allowance for doubtful accounts is also reversed. 2) Movement of Allowan ce for Doubtful Accounts The movement of allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 is as follows: (i) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on Trade Receivables and Lease Receivables Millions of yen Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on Trade Receivables and Lease Receivables Credit Unimpaired Credit Impaired Total As of April 1, 2020 (71) (0) (72) Increases during the period (71) - (71) Decreases during the period (Utilized) - 0 0 Decreases during the period (Reversed) 71 - 71 As of March 31, 2021 (71) - (71) Increases during the period (50) - (50) Decreases during the period (Utilized) - - - Decreases during the period (Reversed) 71 - 71 As of March 31, 2022 (50) - (50) (ii) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Other Financial Assets and Financial Guarantee Contracts Disclosure of allowance for doubtful accounts for other financial assets and financial guarantee contracts is omitted because they are not material. In the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, no significant increases or decreases occurred in the gross carrying amount of any a ssets - 116 - that could affect the changes in allowance for doubtful accounts. (4) Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Shionogi Group will be unable to fulfill repayment obligations for financial liabilities due . The Company manages liquidity risk by having the Finance & Accounting Department prepare and update a timely cash flow plan based on reports from business units. Major financial liabilities by contractual maturities are as follows: (i) As of March 31, 2021 Millions of yen Carrying Amount Contractual Cash Flow Within 1 Year After 1 Year but Not More than 2 Years After 2 Year but Not More than 3 Years After 3 Year but Not More than 4 Years After 4 Year but Not More than 5 Years More than 5 Years Non-derivative financial liabilities: Other financial liabilities 20,611 20,611 4,268 Trade payables 9,902 9,902 9,902 - 7,988 7,988 3,379 2,811 3,646 815 538 498 4,352 (ii) As of March 31, 2022 Millions of yen Carrying Amount Contractual Cash Flow Within 1 Year After 1 Year but Not More than 2 Years After 2 Year but Not More than 3 Years After 3 Year but Not More than 4 Years After 4 Year but Not More than 5 Years More than 5 Years Non-derivative financial liabilities: Other financial liabilities 23,007 23,007 4,465 Trade payables 16,372 16,372 16,372 - Lease liabilities 6,675 6,675 2,945 2,559 553 522 94 - Derivative liabilities 2,935 722 522 94 4,707 The cash flows included in the maturity analysis are not expected to occur significantly earlier or in significantly differen t amounts. Financial guarantee contracts are not included above. The f inancial guarantee contracts are subject to payment obligations based on their performance claims. The maximum amount based on performance claims is the amount of the guarantee obligation s as stated in Note \"33. Contingent Liabilities. \" - 117 - (5) Market Risk 1) Foreign Exchange Risk The Shionogi Group operates internationally, and therefore has trade receivables and payables, forecasted transactions, and loans receivable and long -term loans to Group companies denominated in foreign currencies that are exposed to the risks arising from changes in foreig n exchange rates . The Company hedges trade receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency option contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange fluctuations identi fied by currency. (i) Exposure to Currency Risk Exposure to currency risk (net) is as follows . The amount of currency risk hedged with derivative transactions is excluded. As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 USD (thousands of USD) 134,255 42,814 EUR (thousands of EUR) 6,865 32,607 CNY 166,345 84,542 (ii) Foreign Exchange Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis for financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies held as of the end of each fiscal year shows the impact from a \u00a51.00 appreciation on profit before income taxes . This sensitivity analysis assumes that all other assumptions are held constant. Millions of yen As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 USD (134) (42) EUR (6) (32) CNY (110) (331) GBP (36) (422) TWD (166) (84) 2) Market Price Fluctuation Risk The Shionogi Group holds bonds and the equity instruments of business partners, and is therefore exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. The Shionogi Group manages the fair value and financial status of issuers (business partners) on a regular basis, and continuou sly reviews the status of equity holdings. - 118 - (6) Fair Values of Financial Instruments 1) Comparison between Fair Value and Carrying Amount Millions of yen As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Financial instruments measured at amortized cost: Debt securities (non -current) 8,559 8,981 4,613 4,914 The fair value of debt securities (non -current) is mainly determined by quoted market price or price offered by financial institutions. The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities other than the above approximates carrying amount. 2) Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is classified as follows: Level 1: Fair value measured at quoted market prices in an active market without adjustment; Level 2: Fair value measured at directly or indirectly observable prices other than the quoted prices included in Level 1; Level 3: Fair value measured using valuation techniques that include unobservable inputs Transfers between levels are recognized on the date when the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurr ed. (i) As o f March 31, 2021 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial Assets Financial assets measured at amortized costs: Debt securities (non -current) 8,428 - 553 8,981 Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss: Other 142 - 1,924 2,067 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: Shares and investments 43,061 - 161,229 216,142 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss: Derivative liabilities - 6,014 - 6,014 Contingent consideration - - 720 720 Total - 6,014 720 6,734 - 119 - (ii) As of March 31, 2022 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial Assets Financial assets measured at amortized costs: Debt securities (non -current) 4,302 - 612 4,914 Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss: Other - - 3,176 3,176 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: Shares and investments 38,148 - 193,720 240,658 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss: Derivative liabilities - 4,636 - 4,636 Contingent consideration 794 794 Total - 4,636 794 5,430 Notes: 1. Level 1 financial assets include interest -bearing government bonds and listed shares. 2. Level 2 financial liabilities are derivative financial liabilities such as forward foreign exchange contracts. Fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are calculated based on the prices offered by financial institutions. 3. Level 3 financial assets are mainly unlisted shares and investments . Fair values of these assets are calculated using valuation techniques based on net asset value, discounted future cash flows or other valuation techniques . Fair value is calculated after a responsible pers on(s) determines the valuation technique that can appropriately reflect the risk, characteristics, and nature of the asset in accordance with the relevant internal regulations or using an external valuation expert . Unobservable inputs such as future cash f lows and discount rates, etc. are used to measure fair value . The weighted -average cost of capital is utilized to measure fair value based on discounted future cash flows; it was 7.2% to 12.4% for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 7.0% to 7.2% for the year ended March 31, 2022 . Fair value decreases or increases when the weighted -average cost of capital increases or decreases. The effects on fair value as of March 31, 202 1 and 202 2 when the weighted -average cost of capital is increased or decreased by 1% are as follows: Millions of yen Weighted -average Cost of Capital +1% -1% As of March 31, (4,413) 4,869 As of March 31, 2022 (4,988) 5,149 4. The contingent consideration represents milestone payment s based on the status of research and development at the acquired company, etc., and its fair value is calculated in consideration of the possibility of success of the research and development and the time value of money . Fair value increases when research and development, a significant non -observable input, has a greater likelihood of succe ss. - 120 - 3) Reconciliation of Level 3 Financial Instruments at the Beginning and End of the Report ing Period A reconciliation of fair value at the beginning and end of the reporting period of financial instruments classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy is as follows: Millions of yen Year ended March 31, 2021 Year ended March 31, 2022 Balance at beginning of period 151,390 163,955 Total gain or loss: Profit (loss) (47) 132 Other comprehensive income 10,515 31,063 Purchases 506 2,508 Sales (9) (0) Transfers from Level 3 (299) - Other 1,900 (64) Balance at end of period 163,9 55 197,595 Changes in unrealized gains and losses recognized in profit or loss for assets held at the end of reporting period (47) 132 Notes: 1. Net gain or loss included in total gain or loss is included in \"Finance income \" and \"Finance costs \" in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 2. Other comprehensive income included in total gain or loss is included in \"Net change in fair value of equity instruments designated as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income \" and \"Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations \". 3. Transfers from Level 3 are due to the listing of the shares held. (7) Derivatives and Hedge Accounting The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts, currency option contracts and interest rate option contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk associated with monetary claims and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The maximum period for which cash flow fluctuations due to foreign exchange fluctuation risk are hedged is approximately 14 months. Regarding derivative transactions, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and currency option contracts w ithin the normal scope of transactions in accordance with internal procedur es. The Finance & Accounting Department conducts the transactions, and regularly reports results to the Board of Directors meeting to manage transaction information . Consolidated subsidiaries do not engage in derivative transactions. When applying hedge ac counting, in principle, the Company confirms the existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, through qualitative assessment of whether significant terms and conditions of the hedged ite m match or conform closel y to those of the hedging instrument, in order to ensure that the hedged item and the hedging instrument have an economic relationship in which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument . The Company performs highly effective hedging, and therefore generally expects that no significant ineffective portion should arise. In addition, the Company sets an appropriate hedging ra tio in light of the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item and the risk management strategy. - 121 - 1) Effect of Hedge Accounting on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Significant derivatives designated as hedging instruments as of March 31, 2021 and 2022 are as follows: (i) As of March 31, 2021 Hedged Risk Hedging Instrument Contract Amount (Total) Expected Rate (Average) Carrying Amount (Millions of yen) Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuation Risk Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: GBP sell/JPY buy 6,014 (ii) As of March 31, 2022 Hedged Risk Hedging Instrument Contract Amount (Total) Expected Rate (Average) Carrying Amount (Millions of yen) Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuation Risk Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: GBP sell/JPY buy GBP 7 80,000 thousand JPY 153.40/GBP - 4,394 Total - 4,394 - 122 - Derivative liabilities are included in \"Other financial liabilities \" in the consolidated statement of financial position. \"Effective portion of cash flow hedges \" related to ongoing hedging as of March 31, 2021 and 2022 is as follows: Millions of yen Hedged Risk As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2022 Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuation Risk (2,741) (1,718) Information on changes in fair value of hedged items and hedging instruments used as the basis for recognition of the ineffective portion of hedges has been omitted because the amounts of the ineffective portion of hedges recognized in profit or loss for the year s ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 were not material. 2) Effect of Hedge Accounting on the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income The effects of applying hedge accounting on profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 are as follows . The amounts of the ineffective portion of hedges recognized in profit or loss for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 were not material.

English Translation Independent Auditor 's Reports on the Audit of Financial Statements and the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting NOTE TO READERS: The following is an English translation of the Independent Auditor 's Report filed under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. This report is presented merely as supplemental information. June 23, 2022 The Board of Directors Shionogi & Co., Ltd. Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC Osaka , Japan Yuka Hayashi Designated Engagement Partner Certified Public Accountant Yasuhiro Kozaki Designated Engagement Partner Certified Public Accountant <The Audit of the Financial Statements> Opinion Pursuant to Article 193 -2, paragraph 1 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Shionogi & Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries ( the Shionogi Group ), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of March 31, 2022, and the consolidated s tatements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all mate rial respects, the consolidated financial position of the Shionogi Group as of March 31, 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as provided for in Article 93 of the Ordinance on Terminology, Forms, and Preparation Methods of Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Jap an. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor 's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report . We are independent of the Shionogi Group in accordance with the ethical req uirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements . We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consoli dated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming the auditor 's opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Fair value measurement of unliste d shares (ViiV Healthcare Ltd.) Description of Key Audit Matter Auditor 's Response As described in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has recorded the shares of ViiV Healthcare Ltd. (hereinafter \"ViiV \"), an unlisted company engaged in the development, manufacturing and marketing of anti -HIV drugs, in the amount of \u00a5186,184 million, which are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. As described in Notes 2 and 30 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the fair value of ViiV shares is measured using valuation tec hniques based on discounted future cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the fair value measurement are the sales growth rate of products, the profit ratio and the discount rate. The fair value measurement for financial assets using valuation techniques based on discounted future cash flows is complex and management 's judgment is required as there is uncertainty in each assumption mentioned above. The sales growth rate and profit ratio are affected by the sales trends of competing products and t he company 's development and marketing strategies. The discount rate is affected by market interest rates and other market conditions. Therefore, we determined this matter to be a key audit matter. In order to evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value measurement of ViiV shares, we performed the following audit procedures among others: We involved a valuation expert from our network firm to verify the valuation techniques of fair value measurem ent related to financial assets. Regarding the sales growth rate of each product, we conducted an evaluation by discussing with management the sales trends of each product until and after patent expiration, based on the sales trends of competing products and the Company 's sales strategy, and by considering actual results. Regarding the profit ratio, we conducted an evaluation by discussing future profit ratio projections with management in light of projected future development and marketing costs, and by considering actual results. Regarding the discount rate and the outcome of fair value measurement, we conducted an evaluation by comparing calculations used by the management with the estimates made by the valuation expert from our network firm using a vailable external data. The sensitivity analysis was performed on the discount rate, which is a highly sensitive assumption to the fair value calculation results, to assess its impact on fair value. Other Information The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Securities Report that contains audited consolidated and non - consolidated financial statements but does not include the consolidated and non -consolidated financial statements and our audit reports thereon. Management is responsible for preparation and disclosure of the other information . The Corporate Auditors and Board of Corporate Auditors is responsible for overseeing the Shionogi Group 's reporting process of the other information. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other informatio n and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed , we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management, the Corporate Auditors and Board of Corporate Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the pre paration of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Shionogi Group 's ability to continue as a going concern and disclosing, as required by IFRSs, matters related to going concern. The Corporate Auditors and Board of Corporate Auditors is responsible for overseeing the Shionogi Group 's financial reporting process. Auditor 's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor 's report that includes our opinion . Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate t o provi de a basis for our opinion. Consider internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for our risk assessments, while the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial statements is n ot expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Shionogi Group 's internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosur es made by management. Conclude on the appr opriateness of management 's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Shionogi Group 's ability to con tinue as a going concern . If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor 's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion . Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor 's report . However, future events or conditions may cause the Shionogi Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structu re and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation in accordance with IFRSs. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities withi n the Shionogi Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements . We are responsible for the direction, supervis ion and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Corporate Auditors and Board of Corporate Auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Corporate Auditors and Board of Corporate Auditors with a statement that we have complied with the ethical require ments regarding independence that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable , related safeguards.

Matters relating to the basic framework for internal control over financial reporting Isao Teshirogi , Representative Director and President of the Company, is responsible for designing and operating effective internal control over financial reporting of the Shionogi Group (the Company and its affiliates) and has designed and operated internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the basic framework for internal control set forth in \"On the Revision of the Standards and Practice Standards for Management Assessment and Audit concerning Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Council Opinio ns)\" published by the Business Accounting Council. The internal control is designed to achieve its objectives to the extent reasonable through the effective function and combin ation of its basic elements. Therefore, there is a possibility that misstatement s may not be completely prevented or detected by internal control over financial reporting . 2. Matters relating to the scope of assessment, the basis date of assessment and the assessment procedures The assessment of internal control over financial reporting was performed as of March 31, 2022, which is the final day of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 . The assessment was performed in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over f inancial reporting generally accepted in Japan. In conducting this assessment, we evaluated internal controls which may have a material effect on financial reporting overall on a consolidation basis ( \"entity -level controls \") and based on the results of this assessment, we selected business processes to be tested. We analyzed these selected business processes, identified key controls that may have a material impact on the reliability of our financial reporting, and assessed the design and operation of the se key controls. These procedures have allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls. We determined the necessary scope for assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its consoli dated subsidiaries from t he perspective of the materiality that may affect the reliability of financial reporting. The materiality that may affect the reliability of the financial reporting is determined taking into account the materiality of quantitative and qualitative impacts. In light of the results of assessment of entity -level internal controls, which covered the Company and 13 consolidated subsidiaries, we reasonably determined the scope of assessment of internal controls over business processes. Note that 35 consolidated su bsidiaries are not included in the scope of assessment of entity -level internal controls because they are considered to be immaterial in terms of quantitative and qualitative impacts . Regarding the scope of assessment of internal control over business proc esses, we accumulated business locations to be tested in descending order of revenue (after elimination of intercompany transactions) for the fiscal year ended March 31,2021 , and the one location whose combined consolidated revenue reached two thirds of th e total amount on a consolidation basis was selected as a \"significant business location. \" We included in the scope of assessment, at the selected significant business location, business processes leading to revenue, accounts receivable - trade, and invent ories as significant accounts that may have a material impact on the business objectives of the Shionogi Group . Further, not only for selected significant business locations, but also for all the business locations , we also selected for testing, as busi ness processes having greater materiality, business processes relating to (i) greater likelihood of material misstatements and/or (ii) significant accounts involving estimates or forecasts and/or (iii) a business or operation dealing with high -risk transac tions, taking into account their impact on the financial reporting. 3. Matters relating to the results of the assessment As a result of the assessment described above, as of the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 , we concluded that the Shionogi Group 's internal control over financial reporting was effectively maintained. 4.
