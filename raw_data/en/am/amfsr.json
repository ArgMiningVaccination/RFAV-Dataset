Medical professionals across many disciplines utilize some of these modalities, others only NDs receive as part of their education. Bastyr ND residents from [Bastyr Unviersity Clinic](http://bastyrclinic.org/?__hstc=46213176.cbb943f37054ccbce32ae213b0fa4f83.1666133541877.1666299448575.1666306887278.4&__hssc=46213176.1.1666306887278&__hsfp=1953794833) and [Bastyr Center for Natural Health](http://bastyrcenter.org/?__hstc=46213176.cbb943f37054ccbce32ae213b0fa4f83.1666133541877.1666299448575.1666306887278.4&__hssc=46213176.1.1666306887278&__hsfp=1953794833) shared how they utilize different modalities to treat their unique patients. If you schedule an appointment with a naturopathic doctor, your treatment plan may include suggestions from the following modalities: Nutrition Naturopathic doctors utilize food, enzymes, vitamins and minerals to optimize the body's healing process. \"I specialize in working with patients that have various dermatological issues. Upon investigation, many skin conditions actually start from the gut. Working from the inside out by using food and nutrition as a focal point for healing, we not only strengthen the gut, but have success with clearing skin concerns for good. My personal favorite tip is incorporating healthy fats with every meal.\" - Rubaina Dang, ND \"I love utilizing intravenous nutrient infusions to help quickly replete nutrient status in my patients suffering from malnutrition secondary to chronic gastrointestinal issues. Expediting nutrient replenishment through IV infusions can really help elicit moments of 'spark' in my patients to pave the way for small habit changes that snowball into long term healing.\" - Brandilyn Binstock, ND Physical Medicine Treatment techniques and exercises that help the body recover from injuries and strengthen the immune system. \"My passion is primary care, and as such, I utilize a wide variety of modalities to serve the patient in front of me. My favorite modality is the one that best serves that patient in the moment, although my go-tos are definitely food, movement, botanical medicine, and mind-body interventions. There is something magical about being able to discover the modality (and apply it with naturopathic principles) that will aid a patient in their journey toward health as they define it.\" - Logan Rost, ND Counseling/Behavioral medicine Recognizing behavioral, cultural, cognitive and emotional factors affecting the patients' health. \"I love doing Gender Affirming Care as a naturopathic physician because I get to use all of my training to create patient-centered care that focuses on the whole person. I believe everyone deserves access to the care they need, whether that is botanical medicine, pharmaceutical prescriptions, or advice around nutrition and mental health.\" - Mel Hobart-Beaumari, ND Homeopathy A gentle non-toxic therapy that uses natural substances to stimulate the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself. \"I enjoy helping patients suffering from hormonal complaints. With botanical medicine and homeopathy, I am able to find individualized combinations to best fit the patients' needs. This has been known to support symptoms of PMS, menstrual cramps and hot flashes in many patients.\" - Heather Rilling, ND Botanical Medicine Therapeutic use of [medicinal plants](https://dctest6-bastyredu1.pantheonsite.io/noindex/tabs/experience-bastyr-gardens) to treat or prevent disease. \"One of my favorite tools to offer patients is botanical medicine. Herbs can help patients with many conditions, but I especially love using them for patients with symptoms related to chronic stress. Herbs can help people manage anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, and even elevated blood pressure. Sometimes herbs are used because they act similarly to pharmaceutical medications and other times herbs help restore balance to systems that need help. I love seeing patients develop a relationship with the herbs they are using. Sometimes patients will start to grow an herb in their garden or begin to recognize medicinal plants on walks and that connection with nature can really help return balance to overtaxed systems.\" - Ruth Christie, ND These are only five of the most common modalities that Naturopathic doctors utilize. NDs (depending on the region) can also prescribe medications if needed. However, in keeping in mind one of the 6 naturopathic principles - First do no harm - Naturopathic doctors utilize the most natural, least expensive and least toxic therapies first. "}
