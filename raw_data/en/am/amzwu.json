Allergy and immune d iseases (immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases) are among the fastest growing chronic conditions in Austr alia. 2. Almost 20% of the Australian population has an allergic disease and this prevalence is increasing. 3. Hospital admissions for anaphylaxis (severe life threatening allergic reaction ) have increased 4 fold in the last 20 years. 4. Food -induced anaphylaxis has doubled in the last 10 years and 10% of infants now have an immediate food allergy. 5. Immunodeficiency diseases are serious, potentially life threatening conditions that are increasing in number and complexity. 6. Delay in diagnosis of immuno deficiency disease leads to poor health outcomes and premature de ath. 7. Autoimmune diseases affect 5% of Australians and are more common than cancer or heart disease. 8. There are over 100 different autoimmune diseases that affect Australians and lead to significant disability. 9. There is a l ack of public awareness about the impact and appropriate management of allergy and immune diseases. 10. Access to care is difficu lt, even in metropolitan areas, due to the high number of patients and low number of appropriately trained health care professionals , resulting in long waiting times to see a specialist. WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS? 1. Allergy and immune d isease should be recognised as one of the most important c hronic disease groups and a National H ealth Priority Area in Australia, which will: Enable projects relating to these diseases to be eligible to apply for grants specific for chronic diseases and N ational Health Priority Areas . Improve management and preventio n strategies for these diseases. 2. Development of a national allergy and immune diseases model of care which will address: Improve d access to care and accurate diagnosis for patients with allergic and immune diseases . Access to affordab le and cost -effective therapies. ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 3 What is ASCIA? The Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) is a not -for-profit professional medical organisation, comprised predominantly of clinical immunology and allergy medical specialists . These specialists manage patients with allergy and immune diseases. The ASCIA membership also includes other medical practitioners, scientists and allied health professionals (mainly nurses and dietitians) who work in the areas of allergy and immunology. The mission of ASCIA is to advance the science and practice of clinical immunology and allergy, by promoting education and the highest standard of ethical medical practice. ASCIA has provided a range of education resources for physicians and patients since 1999, followed soon after by several position statements, guidelines and action plans. In recent years, ASCIA commenced developing online and face to face training in response to a growing need for accurate and consistent information. ASCIA consults the ASCIA membership and key stakeholder organisations to ensure all resources devel oped are evidence based and appropriate to meet the needs of the end -user. To date: ASCIA e -training courses have been accessed by over 100,000 participants across Australia. ASCIA anaphylaxis training for schools and childcare has been provided as fac e to face training to school and childcare staff in Western Australia and New South Wales. ASCIA anaphylaxis training for health professionals has been provided as face to face training to pharmacists, general practitioners, nurses and paediatricians in most regions in Australia. ASCIA allergic rhinitis, immunotherapy and food allergy training courses have also bee n provided to pharmacists, general practitioners, nurses, paediatricians and dietitians across Australia. For more detailed information about ASCIA resources including training resources, please refer to the supplementary document \" ASCIA Education Report \". As a non -government organisation, ASCIA's educational activities are dependent on members donating their unpaid time for resource development, funding derived from membership fees, small educational grants from some state governments for specific projects and unrestricted educational grants from industry (providers of unrestricted educational grants have no input into resource content or development). ASCIA does not currently receive any funding from the federal Australian government. For ASCIA to be ab le to maintain existing resources and continue to develop urgently needed new resources, government (both state and federal) support is required. Priority Actions SHORT TERM Interim funding to sustain ASCIA education initiatives, particularly e -training . These resources provide a valuable education service and are unable to be maintained by ASCIA without further funding. Funding for a n oral food allergen challenge database. This database would enable to collection of oral food challenge data nationally and enable greater standardisation of protocol s and research across centres. Funding for an immunodeficiency database to replace the superceded ASCIA primary immunodeficiency database . The new database needs to include both primary and secondary immunod eficiency diseases. MEDIUM TO LONG TERM The development of a Model of Care for Allergy and Immune Diseases to provide a framework for best practice management in Australia . ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 4 Overview of Allergy and Immune Diseases Allergy and Immune Diseases are all immune system disorders and encompass allergic, immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases. They are increasing in prevalence and complexity, and are a mounting public health issue in Australia. Refer to Appendix C for more detailed information e xplaining these diseases. Allergic diseases occur when a person's immune system reacts to substances that are normally harmless. These substances are known as allergens and can be found in foods, airborne particles such as dust mite or pollens , insect venoms and medications. Immunodeficiency diseases are either inherited (e.g. primary i mmun odeficiency diseases) or acquired (e.g. secondary immunodefici ency diseases ) conditions in which the immune system does not function correctly to protect against microbes , leading to increased risk of potentially life threatening infections and cancers . Autoimmune diseases are a broad range of related diseases in which a person's immune system produces an inappropriate, detrimental response against its own cells, leading to damage to healthy tissue. ALLERGIC DISEASES Allergies are the fastest growing chronic diseases in Australia and include food/insect/drug allergies (including life threatening reactions call anaphylaxis) , asthma, allergic rhinitis (hay fever ) and eczema. 4.1 million Australia ns (19.6% of the population) have at least one alle rgic dis ease1. Allergic disease s most common ly present in children and adoles cents2 and often persist into adulthood. 10% of Australian infants have proven food allergy3, one of the highest incidences internationally. Hospital admissions for anaphylaxis have increased 4 -fold in the last 20 years4. Drug-induced anaphylaxis deaths have increased 300% over the last decade in Australia5. 18% of Australians have allergic rhinitis1 with significant impact on quality of life6. Patients with allergic rhinitis are three times more likely to have a sthma and more than 80% of allergic as thmatics have allergic rhinitis7. It is predicted that by 2050 the number of patien ts affected by allergic diseases in Australia will increase by 70% to 7.7 million1. IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISEASES The prevalence of primary i mmunodeficiency diseases (PID) is estimated to be 1 in 12008. These are serious, potentially life -threatening conditions in which the immune sy stem functions poorly , leading to multiple infecti ons, chronic ill health and increased risk of cancer . These may be inherited or acquir ed later in life . Secondary immune deficiency is increasing as a result of medical trea tment for other diseases9, underlying diseases (e.g. cancers ) and poor nutrition in at risk populations . AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES Autoimmune diseases currently affe ct 5% of Australians10. There are over 100 different autoimmune diseases. Some common autoimmune diseases include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue disorders, multiple sclerosis and coeliac disease. The prevalence of autoimmune diseases is estimated to be gre ater than heart disease or cancer11. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DISEASES Allergy and immune diseases have a significant cost to t he individual and the community: In 2005, the total financial cost of allergic diseases alone was estimated to be approximately AU$30 billion (ASCIA Access Economic Report 2007) , comprising $1.1 billion in direct health system expenditure , $7.1 billion due to lost productivity and $21.3 billion due to lost wellbeing (disability and premature death) . In per capita term s, this amounts to a total cost of approximately $7,400 per person with allergies per annum . ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 5 Recognition as a Prioritised Chronic Disease Group Allergy and immune diseases should be recognised as a prioritised chronic disease group as they align completely with the c riteria used by the National Chronic Disease Strategy12 as exemplified below: Diseases Criteria Allergic Autoimmune Immunodeficiency Have complex and multiple causes Genetic and environmental factors . Early feeding/exposures . Multiple mechanisms . Researchers have identified over 100 different autoimmune diseases and suspect at least 40 additional diseases of having an autoimmune basis . Primary immunodeficiencies are a heterogeneous group of genetically inher ited diseases affecting immune systems that increase risk of infection, autoimmunity, and cancer, with > 150 types described. Usually have a gradual onset, although they can have sudden onset and acute stages Allergic rhinitis and eczema can have a gradual onset and can worsen with time. Anaphylaxis or non -anaphylactic allergic reactions and asthma usually have a sudden onset of symptoms but the risk of accidental exposure and relapse is chronic . Chronic autoimmune diseases have a highly variable pattern but usually develop gradually and progress to acute or chronic illness and disability . Some patients will have a long history of increasing problems whereas others may present with sudden onset of life threatening infections. Occur across the lifecycle, although they become more prevalent with older age Food allergies and eczema are more common in children but insect and drug allergy , asthma and allergic rhinitis are more common in older individuals . Asthma occurs at all ages . Many occur across the lifecycle, particularly systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis . Immunodeficiency disea ses present in very severe form in infancy or may present with recurrent infections in later childhood or adult life. Repeated infections often lead to chronic organ disease. Can compromise quality of life (QOL) through physical limitations and disability The effect of eczema on quality of life in children has been rated more significant than childhood diabetes. Eczema and food allergy can also impact on growth, development and QOL. In adulthoo d conditions such as allergic rhinitis and eczema can impact significantly on a person's ability to work. These diseases can compromise QOL through inability to work, chronic affliction, co -morbid mental illnesses, particularly depression and anxiety, and disruption of social and family structures due to the tendency to afflict women of childbearing age . Patients will often develop poor nutrition, chronic lung disease and require frequent hospital admissions which can seriously impact on their QOL. Complications from delay in diagnosis can impact on QOL and result in significant disability. Are long term and persistent, leading to gradual deterioration of health With the exception of some food allergies (e.g. egg, milk, wheat) , most of these disorders are long term and persistent, and can significantly compromise QOL . Most of these disorders are long term and persistent, and can significantly compromise QOL . Immune deficiencies lead to lifelong health problems resulting in increasingly poor health and decreased life expectancy. Complications from delay in diagnos is can impact on QOL and result in significant disability. While usually not immediately life threatening, they are the most common and leading cause of premature mortality Some can be immediately life threatening (e.g. anaphylaxis, the most severe form of allergic reaction) . Autoimmune diseases are among the 10 leading causes of death for women in every age group up to 64 years of age. All ages are affected, with onset from childhood to late adulthood . If treated insufficiently, can result in premature death (e.g. primary immunodeficiency diseases) particularly with delayed diagnosis. ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 6 Model of Care for Allergy and Immune Diseases CURRENT ISSUES Timely access to appropriate care for allergy and immune diseases improves outcomes and quality of life (QOL) , whilst delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment may lead to permanent complications such as chronic damage to lungs and other body organs or premature death in those with immune deficiency. A combination of population growth, increasing incidence of allergic and immune disease, an ageing workforce and limited training places for new specialists have led to longer waiting lists in specialist immunology/allergy services. A Model of Care for allergy and immune diseases is required as a matt er of urgency. However, be fore this can be developed, it is essential that there is formal recognition of allergy an d immune diseases as a prioritised chronic disease group and a National Health Priority Area . OBJECTIVES OF PROPOSED MODEL OF CARE FOR ALLERGY AND IMMUNE DISEASES Provide a national framework for best practice management (care and prevention) in Australia . Assist in long term planning of resources to ensure sustainability of appropriate and effective strategies to improve patient outcom es and quality of life for those with allergy and immune diseases. Focus on a number of key areas that are based on the National Chronic Disease Action Areas (National Health Priority Action Council 2006) including: - Prevention and promotion; - Early detec tion and intervention - Integration and continuity of care; and - Self management. Outcome measures need to be developed to evaluate the cost -effectiveness of a Model of Care for allergy and immune diseases, including process (e.g. education programs) and improvement of patient outcomes. This ideally will include the development of databases for specific conditions (e.g. anaphylaxis , immunodeficiency) and specialised procedures (e.g. oral food allergen challenges to confirm or exclude food allergy). WHAT WILL A MODEL OF CARE FOR ALLERGY AND IMMUNE DISEASES SUPPORT? Access to early and accurate diagnosis based on best practice evidence and expert opinion inc luding timely access to clinical immunology/allergy specialist services and ensuring that peopl e with allergy and immune diseases receive the right care, at the right time, by the right team, in the right place ; Access to affordable and cost -effective therapy including novel therapies; Community and medical educat ion with a ccess to health promotion and prevention programs for patients, carers and health professionals ; A consumer -centred approach, the main focus being the improvement of QOL ; Monitor ing of population trends in risk factors for allergy and immune diseases ; Local research to develop interventional strategies to reduce the bur den of disease in the community ; Future planning in terms of workforce and resources to ensure sustainability ; A public health approach including s trategies to reduce d isease development , manifestation and complications through primary , secondary and tertiary prevention ; and Improved s ervice provision for all allergic conditions , primary immunodeficiency diseases; secondary immunodeficiencies ( not HIV) and autoimmune diseases . Refer to Appendix E for more detailed information. ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 7 APPENDIX A: Allergy and Immune Diseases Allergic diseases Food , insect and medication allerg ies Latex allergy Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) Eczema Hypereosinophilia syndromes Allergic rhinitis swellings) Asthma Eosinophilic oesophagitis Non-allergic adverse food reactions (food intolerance) Immunodeficiency diseases Primary immune deficiency diseases include conditions such as various antibody deficiencies , severe T -cell disorders, combined immune deficiencies and rare specific immune conditions (e.g. Hereditary Angioedema ). Secondary immune deficiency is increasing as a result of medical treatment for other diseases9, underlying diseases (e.g. cancers) and poor nutrition in at risk populations . Autoimmune diseases Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Sjogren's Addison's disease Rheumatoid arthritis Chronic active hepatitis Crohn's disease Multiple sclerosis Systemic sclerosis Myasthenia gravis Diabetes type Uveitis Ulcerative colitis Vitiligo disorder Mastocytosis ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 8 APPENDIX B: Prevalence Data Allergy and immune d iseases affect approximately 1 in 3 Australians. Allergic and autoimmune disease s are increasing in prevalence. The table below indicates the current prevalence of common allergy and immune diseases. Disease Prevalence Allergy - Anaphylaxis 3-60/100,000 patient years4 - Food allergy 10% of children < 1 year3 4-8% of children < 5 years13 ~2% of - Insect allergy ~ 3%15 - Drug allergy ~1-2%16 - Latex allergy ~ 1% and higher in occupational exposure1 - Upper airway allergy ~15%17 - Asthma ~10%18 Allergic and non-immunologic diseases of the nose and eyes - Allergic rhinitis and non -allergic rhinitis ~ 18%19 - Nasal ~10%20 - Chronic sinusitis ~7%17 Allergic Primary immunodeficiencies 1:120011 Secondary immunodeficiencies No data available. Prevalence will continue to increase due to increased use of biological agents and other medical treatments , highlighting the importance of a database. ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 9 APPENDIX C: Disease Overviews Allergic rhinitis (hay fever) Allergic rhinitis, often known as hay fever affects around 1 in 5 people in Australia and New Zealand. It can affect children and adults. Individuals often self -treat allergic rhinitis and many sufferers and doctors and under -estimate its impact on day to day living. Allergic rhinitis in some indi viduals may lead to impaired concentration, impaired sleep, and reduced w ork, school or sporting performance . Medications used in allergic rhinitis can be expensive, and although allergen immunotherapy is available as a therapy, this is not subsidis ed in Australia. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of allergic reaction , usually occurring within 2 hours of exposure to the triggering agent. Food anaphylaxis presentations, particularly in children, to the hospital emergency department have doubled over the last 10 years, although death from anaphylaxis remains rare. This rise of food allergy has already had a significant impact on the food industry and in schools, where te achers are frequently requested or mandated to be educated in the management of allergic reactions. Insect venom anaphylaxis has decreased but drug related anaphylaxis and deaths from such events have increased in hospitals. It is likely in the next two decades rates of adult nut/shellfish anaphylax is will rise, given children with these current allergies are unlikely to outgrow these particular food allergies. Atopic dermatitis (eczema) Atopic dermatitis known as eczema) occurs in around 20% of infants1, and its prevalence is increasing world wide. It is a chronic condition, with no cure. Eczema can profoundly affect the quality of life of patients and their families. It can lead to sleep deprivation, mood changes, impaired psychological functioning at work and school, embarrassment, social is olation and restriction of daily activities. The impairment of quality of life caused by eczema has been shown to be greater than other common conditions, such as asthma and diabetes (1). The financial cost to the individual and family can be significant. Autoimmune Diseases Autoimmune diseases , affecting approximately 5% of individuals, are a broad range of related diseases in which a person's immune system produces an inappropriate response against its own cells, tissues and/or organ s, resulting in damag e. There are over 100 different autoimmune diseases. As a group, autoimmune diseases are the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrialised world, surpassed only by cancer and heart disease21. Drug Allergy Allergic reactions to a large number of medicines can occur. Reactions to pain killers or arthritis tablets and antibiotics are the most common, but reactions have been described to many other medicines. Severity may range from m ild rashes through to potentially life -threateni ng anaphylaxis. The inability to accurately diagnose drug allergy may result in the need to use more expensive medication. Food Allergy and Associated Syndromes IgE mediated immediate food allergy is most commonly caused by 9 foods (cow's milk, egg, pean ut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, sesame, fish and shellfish). Many of these foods are ubiq uitou s in the Western diet and difficult to avoid. Reac tions range from mild to severe (anaphylaxis). There is currently no cure , although food desensitisation (immunotherapy) trials are in progress. Non IgE mediated food allergy can result in a heterogeneous number of disorders, and can lead to poor growth, food restrictions, and abnormal eating behaviors. Management can be complex, involve a number of health professionals and frequent, invasive investigations. Rates of non-IgE mediated food allergie s such as eosinophilic esophagitis, is rising in Australia22. ASCIA Allergy and Immune Diseases in Australia (AIDA) Report 10 Immunodeficiency diseases Primary immunodeficiency (PID) diseases are a group of potentially serious disorders in which inherited defects in the immune system lead to increased infections. There are currently more than 250 PID diseases23 with new disorders being described regularl y. Certain severe PID diseases become apparent early in life, with only a short asymptomatic period after birth. Without an effective intervention, many result in irreversible complications and death before the end of the first year of life. Secondary im munodeficiency diseases are more frequent than primary immune deficiencies. Secondary immunodeficiency diseases are due to problems of the immune system that are not genetic and are caused by external factors (e.g. severe malnutrition, immunosuppressive m edication, chemotherapy) . Secondary immunodeficiency diseases lead to an increased incidence of infection, malignancy or autoimmune disease, simila r to primary immunodeficiency11.
