Respondents who shared the type of emotional challengesthey face referred often todepression. Research hasshown that depression is themost common emotion felt bythose who are on dialysis. When someone is confrontedwith having CKD, there maybe many losses \u2014 health, fami- ly roles, work, income, socialoutlets. If losses occur , it isnatural to grieve, which can involve depression. Anxietyand anger or frustration arealso emotions individuals mayfeel. There is no \"right way\" to feel when you have CKD, aswe cannot help how we feel.However, it is what we doabout what we feel that canmake a big difference in our lives. Your Own Kind of Faith Spirituality is what gets many of you through the tough times. It takes manyforms, depending on one's faith, and caninclude prayer, meditation, belief in a high-er power and/or attending aplace of worship such as achurch, temple or mosque.One person shared, \"I real-ized there was just somuch I could do...so Iturned it over to the Lordand let Him handle it.\" Reach Out For Support Support from family and friends is also very impor - tant; one respondent described it as a that expressing feelings\u2014and not keepingthem \"bottled up\" \u2014to family and friends was helpful. One individual suggested surrounding yourselfwith those who love and support you whenyou feel down. Simply enjoying family helpslift another respondent's emotions. Oneman said that not only is his family a sup-port for him, but he is a major figure intheir lives. Knowing how much theyneed him keeps him going. Continued on page 3 HOWDO YOU COPE WITH THE MENT AL HEALTH CHALLENGES related to having chronic kidney disease (CKD)? That was the question we asked this quarter and you shared\u2014a lot! This is obviously aquestion to which many of our readers could relate.AGREAT DEAL OF TIME AND MONEY are devoted to physical health, both for theprevention and treatment of illness, in our society. In com-parison, very little attention is given to our mental or emo- tional health. There is a cycli-cal effect between physical and mental health. Research has shown that our mentalhealth can affect our physical well-being. For example, there is much evidence that depres-sion may play a part in the development of cardiac dis- ease. W e also know that our emotional state may make existing physical problems worse. Also, when we live with physical problems, especiallythose that are chronic, it is very natural and normal toreact with changes, at leasttemporarily, in our emo - tional state. Most of us will experi- ence some type of emotional problem, such as depressionor anxiety, at some point in our lives. Yet, all too often, wewill attempt to continue on with our lives, ignoring how we feel emotionally . There are many reasons for this. Some may believe there is a stigma attached to having emotionalproblems, feeling that others may think they are weak or less than capable. For others,there may be a lack of infor-mation as to where to turn for help. It is not always easy to askfor help, yet I strongly believe it ismuch harder to deal with our depres-sion, anxiety or anger alone. If we ignore our emo-tional pain, it not only can take its toll on our physical well-being but it can alsoimpact our relationships, activ- ities and practically all other aspects of our lives. It is our hope with this issue that you will realize you arenot alone if you find yourselfexperiencing emotional prob- lems. W e also want you to be aware of the various optionsavailable to help you face them. Know that you do notneed to suffer in silence and there is help available. Lastly, it is almost that time of year again when the Family Focus Editorial Board will be appointed for 2006 and we will be convening to plan next year's issues. As always, wewant our information to be rel- evant and timely. We urge you to share with us your ideas forfuture newspaper topics. Here's to an emotionally healthy summer!

Opinions expressed in this newspaper do not necessarily represent the position of the National Kidney Foundation.FROM THE EDIT OR Karren King IIIn the last issue of Family Focus the number of dialysis centers offering nocturnal home hemodialysis was quoted as \"approximately 50\" in one article and \"81\" in another. The actual number variesdepending on the source. For more information on home hemodialysis go to www.medicare.gov and click on \"Compare Dialysis Facilities\" or www .homedialysiscentral.orgCorrections: IISome readers felt that the article \"A New Look at Home Dialysis: A Psychosocial Perspective\" in the last issue of Family Focus unfairly criti - cized dialysis technicians' training. The authors did not intend their com-ments to put into question technicians' training. The authors' goal was toencourage people with chronic kidney disease to believe they could do their own dialysis at home if they received training similar to what new techni- cians learn. The authors believe that if more individuals were urged to takeon an active role in their care and did dialysis at home, they and clinicswould both benefit. ON JUL Y 25, 2005, People Like Us repre - sentative Alice McCall, along with National Kidney Foundation (NKF) staff, presented the United States (U.S.) Department ofHealth and Human Services SecretaryMichael Leavitt with a proclamation offi - cially thanking the U.S. government forproviding dialysis and other life-savingtherapies to countless people for more than30 years through the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program. This moving ceremony to thank the government followed the kick-off of People Like Us, the NKF's patient empowerment initiative, held inthe Nation's Capitol in early May. More than 100 people with chronickidney disease (CKD), transplant recipients, living organ donors,donor families and loved ones gathered from around the country tolearn how to become their own best advocates through training work- shops and public policy briefings. Interactive and role-playing exercis-es prepared participants to become proactive advocates and effective spokespeople. At a special reception on Capitol Hill, People Like Us mingled with members of the Congressional Kidney Caucus, and some participants met with their Congressional representatives. Plans for ongoing People Like Us activities are underway as we con- tinue to build what we hope will become the largest, strongest andmost effective patient advocacy group in the country.

Several individuals mentioned thatbeing employed helps them feel more posi - tive emotionally. Many of you said doing something you care about and giving to oth-ers are important ways of dealing withdepression. Several are involved in advoca-cy groups for those with CKD or other ill-nesses, and some share with others whatthey can do to prevent CKD or about theneed for organ donation. Another personhas been active in his children's school andathletic activities. One member of theNational Kidney Foundation's Patient andFamily Council Executive Committeeshared how good it feels to simply con-tribute and feel a part of something.Whatever form volunteer activities take,the constant theme is \"giving back.\" Oneindividual shared her belief that doingsomething to feel productive is the key toliving with CKD. Enjoyable activities, suchas gardening or reading, are helpful toanother person because it takes her mindoff of her concerns. Take Care of Yourself Taking care of themselves helps some cope better with the challenges of CKD. Manystressed the importance of exercise, follow-ing a healthy diet and taking medications as prescribed. Another person shared herbelief that beingproactive with yourcare is important andthat includes not only educating yourselfabout all aspects of CKD but also puttingwhat is learned into practice. Educationallows you to take more control over yourtreatment and engage in self-care activitiesand both education and involvement withcare were identified as beneficial. Get Professional Help Seeking professional help, either individu- ally or in a group, was identified as useful.One individual suggested that a mentalhealth specialist in each dialysis centerwould be helpful, and it is important topoint out that the dialysis social worker isjust that person! In addition, it wasstressed that talking to others who aregoing through what you are experiencingcan be a great help. Also mentioned wasthe importance of sharing your feelingswith your doctors to allow them to deter-mine if medication for depression or anxi-ety could be beneficial for you. Have a Positive Attitude Lastly , the importance of keeping a positive attitude was mentioned many times.Several suggested taking life one day at atime, doing what you can and trying not todwell on issues that you can do nothingabout. A woman shared that she begins every morning with thinking how thankful she is to have another day, rather thanthinking \"another day to have to live withCKD.\" She stressed that choosing to makethe most of every day was a daily choice.Others echoed her sentiments by writing \"Ichoose to live my life to the fullest!\" and \"Ichoose to get up each day and have a goodattitude....You have to find the positive inlife and focus on the good things.\" Theneed to be flexible and willing to adjust wasstressed. One person believes it is impor-tant to not only set goals for your life butalso take the time to appreciate it when thegoal is reached. Another shared that ithelps to view dialysis like \"cleaning yourteeth, something you just have to do!\" Awoman who has another illness in additionto CKD shared that she had determinedthe purpose of her life was in the living ofevery day and doing it with grace. One gen-tleman summed it up by sharing, \"I do notlive for dialysis. I use dialysis to live.\" There is no doubt that life with CKD can present great challenges, and with it feel-ings such as sadness and anxiety. Yet, asone individual pointed out, it can also bevery rewarding, as it can help you discoverwhat is really important in your life. Here's wishing you that reward.

During dialysis at my first unit, Inever saw Family Focus. I trans - ferred to my current center in August 2004. I began reading Family Focus and really enjoyed the issue. Family Focus has given me so many things to be thankful for. It has answered so many of my ques-tions and yet it gave me so muchinformation on issues of concern.This is a well-informed newspaper . I am very grateful for Family Focus because it advises, updates, informs, teaches and stimulates the reader. Volume 2, \"Fun and Fabulous Foods for Your Dialysis Friends\" andVolume 3, \"Finding Kidney Disease Early\" were excellent. They coveredso many areas and were very helpfulto me on activities, hobbies, travel-ing, school, employment, kidneycamps, exercise and dining out. Theissues have enriched my life, and I plan to follow some of the ideas.Thank you for Family Focus . I look forward to reading each issue. Sincerely, Billy Carmon Dear Family Focus : I am the wife of a person who has not one but two transplants, a kid - ney and a pancreas. My reason for writing this letter is because I would like to do something with what my family has been through. I also wantto say my husband was given the greatest gift that so many people do not even think about. The last issue of Family Focus hit home for me about wanting to become involved in being an advo- cate. Can you please send me infor - mation on becoming a seriousadvocate? This is something I feel good about. Thank you. Judy Klingensmithletters tothe editor Dear Mrs. Klingensmith: I am glad that the Family Focus issue on advocacy inspired you to become involved. That was our goal! I would suggest that anexcellent place would be to contact your local National Kidney Foundation affiliate and offer your services. If you do not know how to reachthem, you may contact the NKF national office for information (800-622-9010) or visit the Web site, www.kidney.org Another avenue would be to contact the hospital where your spouse received his transplant and offer to be available to others whose spouses are awaitinga transplant. Thank you for writing and for your concern for others. Sincerely, Karren King, MSW , ACSW, LCSW Editor -in-Chief Family Focus 4 FAMILY FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3 YOUR DIAL YSIS CENTER IF YOU LISTEN TO PEO- PLE TALKING ABOUT DIALYSIS, what do they talkabout? They talk about clinical things like adequate dialysis,calcium and phosphorus man- agement and hemoglobin levels. As a dialysis communi-ty, we have come a long way in improving the care of people with kidney failure. Until thelast few years, however, a very important part of dialysis care\u2014the \"emotional health\" of the dialysis clinic itself\u2014has been overlooked. The emotional health of the dialysis clinic is the attitude (positive or negative) that peo- ple in the dialysis clinic havetowards each other. Think about your dialysis clinic \u2014is it emotionally healthy or emo- tionally sick? Does your dialy- sis clinic have positive \"vibes\"(feelings) or negative vibes? Do you and your dialysis staff trust and respect each other? Can you discuss problems openly and honestly? Or do people in your clinic walk around on \"tiptoe\" worryingthat something they say or do could make someone mad? Keeping a dialysis clinic emo- tionally healthy takes a lot of hard work on everyone's part.Everyone in the dialysis clinic \u2014staff and people coming in for treatment\u2014has a responsi-bility to do their part. It is a two way street \u2014you, as the customer, have the right to betreated with respect and digni- ty by the dialysis staff, and the dialysis staff has the right tobe treated with respect anddignity by you, the customer . Dialysis clinics can be very emotionally charged places.There are a number of reasonswhy this is so and all of thesereasons apply to dialysis staff,as well as to people on dialysis.Sometimes we get so wrappedup in our own lives that we donot consider the emotions andfeelings of the other people inthe dialysis clinic. Or , if we arestressed, worried or not feeling well, we do not always put ourbest foot forward. To add to that, because we spend so much time around the samepeople, we often treat each other too casually, possibly with less respect. Over time,\"little things\" that are said or done which might not usually bother us turn into \"bigthings,\" especially if they are repeated time after time. Small disagreements, person - ality conflicts, hurt feelings or misunderstandings can turn into anger or suspicion, caus- ing us to strike out at the people around us. You may find that having a chronic medical problem, like chronic kidney disease (CKD)makes it even harder for you to stay emotionally balanced. CKD may change your life\u2014what you eat and drink, how much energy you have, what type of work and/or hobbies youdo and many other things. Treatments and travel timetake up a lot of your time if you go to an outpatient hemodialysis clinic. Besides the time commitment, many peoplesay they feel they are \"putting their lives in someone else' s hands\" during dialysis. Trying to consider other peo - ple's feelings and emotions isone of the keys to an emotion - ally balanced dialysis clinic.Unfortunately, during periodswhen we are having a hardtime keeping our emotions andfeelings balanced, it is difficultto consider other people' s feel- ings and emotions. This is truewhether you are a personreceiving treatment, a familymember or friend or dialysisstaff member . The good newsis there are a lot of little things you can do to show con-sideration to people at the clin- ic that do not take a lot of effort or energy . Over time, these little things can have a big impact on the emotional health of your dialysis clinic. Here are some suggestions you can try in your clinic: 1. REMEMBER the \"golden rule\"\u2014treat other peoplethe way you would like to be treated. 2. TRY to find the good in people. 3. TRY to find the good in situ- ations, even when there does not seem to be any . 4. APPRECIATE people who care and who try to do the right thing. 5. TELL people \"Good morn- ing\" or \"Good afternoon.\" 6. GIVE people compliments\u2014 everyone likes to be appreci- ated! 7. BE patient with people, especially new dialysis staff in your clinic. A friend ofmine likes to take new dial - ysis staff \"under his wing.\" He volunteers to let new staff cannulate his access sohe can teach them cannula- tion from the patient' s point of view. (He also ends up with staff members he knows will do a good jobcannulating his access). 8.THANK dialysis staff who encourage you to ask questions. 9.IF YOU DO NOT LIKE what someone is doing, point out the actions, but do not criti- cize him or her personally . 10.WHEN THERE IS a disagreement: Try to look at both sides of the story.Do not talk about people behind their backs. Talkto the person with whom you have a disagreement. Do not ignore or make light of other people' s feelings. Offer possible solutions to problems. 1 1.FINALLY, AFTER YOU READ this article, do your clinic a favor and pass it on. Share it with your peers atthe clinic and with your dialysis team. Remember: It takes everyone working together to keep your dialysis clinic emotionallyhealthy!Is Your Dialysis Unit Emotionally Healthy? By Bobbie Knotek, RN, BSN, CNN Teamwork will make your unit emotionally healthy. Over the last few years in the United States, conflict and violence in all medicalsettings have become more and more of an issue. In an effort to decrease conflict indialysis and transplant clin- ics, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, theESRD Networks, kidney professional organizations and the dialysis corporationscame together to develop a staff training program known as DPC or DialysisPatient-Provider Conflict Resolution Initiative. DPC was \"launched\" across the U.S. during the summer of 2005. Social workers andclinic managers in every dialysis unit across the country were asked to traintheir staff using posters, pocket cards and videos provided by the ESRDNetworks. If your clinic is participating in this groundbreaking staff education program, cheerthem on!Decreasing Dialysis Patient-Provider Conflict FAMILY FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3 5MEDICAL CORNER MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DIALYSIS have the same signs and symp-toms of emotional problems as people without chronic kidneydisease (CKD). In addition, the stress of dialysis and the feel - ing of loss of control over one's life, not to mention the physi- cal effects of CKD, can put a strain on most people and maylead to depression, difficulty sleeping, anxiety and other mental health challenges.Depression and anxiety are very common for people on dialysis just as they are in thegeneral population. When psy- chological counseling and other measures such as a completemedical review including possi- ble medication side effects are not enough, drug treatmentmay be necessary. This article will review the major types of drugs that are used to treatemotional problems and will provide information about individual drugs in each drug class specifically for people on dialysis. It is important to remember that mental health treatment is very individual and is best started in a discussion withyour kidney doctor about your symptoms and the risks and benefits of any treatment.Occasionally, a formal psychi- atric evaluation may be neces - sary. People on dialysis usuallytake a number of medicines, which may either interfere with or add to the effects ofother prescription drugs you are taking. Another important point for individuals on dialy-sis is the fact that non-pre-scription treatments such assupplements, vitamins andherbs may interact with pre-scribed medicines. Your doctorneeds to know if you are tak - ing any of these to avoid badside effects and assure theability of your medicines towork well.DRUGS FOR DEPRESSION Not all people with depres- sion needmedica- tion, since manybecome depressed only for a short period because of whatis happening in their lives at the time. This type of depres- sion is called reactive depres - sion and may go away over time. Longer periods of depres- sion, however, can improvewith medication. Most antide- pressive medications cines that fight depression) aremetabolized in the liver beforethey leave the body and there- fore dialysis seems to have lit- tle effect on how they work ortheir safety. The most popular group of drugs used to fight depression is the selective serotonin reup- take inhibitor (SSRI) group ofdrugs. The first of its kind of this type of drug is fluoxetine (Prozac\u00ae). Other drugs of drugs should be started at smalldoses. Positive results areoften seen about three to sixweeks after starting the drug.Side effects may include sexualdysfunction, such as the inabil - ity to reach orgasm or having alower sex drive, nightmares,nausea and headache. amitriptyline andimipramine (Elavil\u00aeand Tofranil\u00ae). These older medicines begin to work very slowly, may cause heart prob-lems and generally do not work as well as SSRIs. However , they cost less and are available as generics (med- icines that are off patent and made by more than one drugcompany). Many people still use them for the treatment of depression. If these older med- icines are stopped, they shouldbe stopped slowly under a doc-tor's supervision to avoid the risk of depression coming back and the risk of seizures (convulsions). There are other medicines called atypical antidepres- sants. They are called atypical because they work differentlythan SSRIs. An example of an atypical antidepressant is nefazodone (Serzone\u00ae). This is a cousin of trazodone and can help people with depression sleep better. They can also beused safely by people on dialy - sis. Another atypical antide - pressant drug used more oftenin the treatment of depression for individuals on dialysis is buproprion (W ellbutrin\u00ae). It can also be used to help people stop smoking. A sustained- release form of the medication (which means small amounts of the medicine are releasedinto the body over a period of time) can be taken once a day . Dialysis treatments do notaffect the ability of buproprion to do its job in treating depres - sion. Its main drawback is thatit raises the possibility of hav- ing a seizure and probably should not be used by peoplewho have a history of seizuresor who are on antiseizure medications.ANXIETY Anxiety is relatively common inpeople on dialysis. Drugs in thebenzodiazepine class of drugs such as alprazolam (Xanax\u00ae) and diazepam (Valium\u00ae) are commonly used. While these drugs do not build up in indi- viduals with CKD and are notlost during the dialysis proce- dure, they have increased effects in some people on dialy-sis, particularly those with problems in the nervous sys- tem such as previous strokesor brain atherosclerosis. These may include excessive seda- tion, confusion and, rarely,seizures. Another member of this class is clonazepam (Klonopin\u00ae), sometimes used to treat restless leg syndrome in people on dialysis. If these drugs are taken for a long time, they should not be stopped quickly; instead, likethe antidepressants described above, they should be stopped gradually under a doctor'sguidance to avoid withdrawal symptoms. New benzodi-azepines may cause drug dependence; thus, they are best used for short-term prob - lems. These should be avoidedin people with alcohol and drug prob- lems. DRUGS FOR OTHER ILLNESSES Drugs given for other mental health diagnoses such as schizophrenia, obses - sive-compulsive disorder(OCD) or bipolar disorder in general can be given safely to people on dialysis. Lithium, a drug used to treat bipolar disorder (also known asmanic depression) is monitored by measuring the level of the drug in your blood. While some of the medication is lostDrug Treatment for Emotional Problems for Individuals on Dialysis By William M. Bennett, MD Sometimes medication is necessary in treating emotional problems. Read on for the facts. Continued on page 6 6 FAMILY FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3KE EPING FIT MANY PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY DISEASE FIND IT HARD to give up habits that may be harmful to their health.However , there are some people who make major changes in their lifestyle, despite feelingsof low energy and sadness that may go along with dialysis ses- sions. These changes mayinclude stopping smoking, eating better or getting help from an exercise specialist toimprove physical conditioning. Some people make changes on their own without the help ofanother person and others get support from a friend, family member or health care professional. So what triggers change? What motivates people? Why are some people more ready to change than others? These arenot easy questions to answer. Clinical psychologists such as Dr. James Prochaska from theUniversity of Rhode Island andDr. William Miller from the University of New Mexico havebeen studying human behavior for the past 30 years in an effort to find some answers. Dr. Prochaska' s research has shown that when it comes to behavior change, people have different levels of motivation tochange, which he calls the Stages of Change. People might be in one of five stages of readi- ness to change, ranging fromnot wanting to change in the future to having taken action and stayed with the changes forat least six months. Here are the Stages of Change described by Dr . Prochaska: People who reach the point of taking action may fall off track and relapse back into one of the earlier stages. However,that is not to say that all is lost and the person cannot take action again in the future. For example, it has beenshown that a smoker will typi- cally quit seven times before eventually quitting for good. Dr. Prochaska suggests that it is helpful to know which stageof change a person is in before trying to help him or her change some aspect of his orher lifestyle. Efforts to help people change tend to fail when the strategies that are used to help do not match theperson's stage of readiness to change. For example, in the earlier stages of change(Stages 1-2), it is a good idea to help the person take a closer look at his or her lifestyle inan effort to get him or her to think about some of the not sogood things about the behav- ior. Whereas in the later stages of change (Stages 3-5),it may be better to help the person set goals and devel - op the skills necessary to put aplan into action. At some point we have all felt the frustration of being on the receiving end of someone try - ing to convince us to changesome aspect of our behavior, and the harder they try to per - suade us, the less interestedwe become. Dr. Miller's research has shown that in health care, providers will often give advice in an effort to get patients to changeharmful behaviors. This can easily lead to conflict and may result in resistance, par - ticularly when we are unsure about changing our behavior. Consequently, when it comes to behavior change, it is cru - cial that you communicate your feelings to help the health care provider understand your point of view . To achieve this, it is usually more effective to take part in the conversation rather than letting someone order you to try something new. Forexample, before starting an exercise program, share your concerns about your physicaland emotional limitations as well as your strengths and your feelings about some of the sacri - fices you will have to make. This discussion will help your health care provider understandwhere you are in the change process, giving you a better chance of moving closer to theday where you will be ready, willing and able to change your behavior and start to feel better. Robert Scales, Ph.D. is an experienced trainer in motiva- tional counseling and teachesworkshops to help health care professionals improve their communication skills with patients .Are You Ready, Willing and Able to Live a Healthy Lifestyle? By Robert Scales, PhD Making big changes does not happen overnight. through the dialysis treatment, it still does a good job of treating bipolar disorder in people on dialysis. The drug level test should be done before a dialysis session. While lithium has badeffects on the kidneys when taken over many years, this is not a concern for people on dialy- sis. However, too much lithium in the blood canbe dangerous to dialysis patients also because itaccumulates and can cause seizures and braindamage. You should discuss this with yourphysician if you are taking lithium. All individuals who are taking any medicines for depression and other mental health problemsshould have regularly scheduled appointmentswith their doctor to discuss ongoing care andtreatment. Any changes in medication, amount ofmedication and its effect on blood pressure or other medicines used in your treatment should be carefully followed by your doctor. SUMMAR Y Depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses can be safely treated in people on dialysis. When starting treatment, the individual should review all of the medications he or she is taking withhis or her nephrologist, including prescribed and over-the-counter drugs, to make sure there are no bad effects between the medicines. The ruleof thumb is \"go low and go slow.\" You should tell your doctor about new symptoms as soon as you notice them. W ith care, most emotional problems can be treated successfully . William M.

I need to increase thenumber of binders I take: three after each meal and two after each snack. Is that it?\" Does this sound familiar? Month after month, you are counseled by your dietitian toachieve lab results within the desirable ranges. Due to the limitations of the kidney diet,you may find it difficult, or even depressing, to follow such a diet. \"Sometimes I just want togive up eating. By the time I figure out something to eat, I am not even hungry anymore,\"commented one person on dialy- sis. \"Or I want to eat everythingin my kitchen to rebel against the diet!\" she added. Dealing with the complexities of the kidney diet and otherlifestyle changes may contribute to feelings of hopelessness, pes- simism, sadness and other symptoms of depression, which can make you apathetic andless likely to care for your own physical needs. Depression is not a weakness or a character flaw; it, too, is a medical illness. Depression can affect your ability to sleep, workand get along with others. People who are depressed may find daily tasks such as mealplanning, shopping, food prepa- ration and even eating to be a big struggle. As a result of poor eating due to depression, you may lose weight, have a lowprotein (albumin) level, or, insome cases, you may overeatand have unplanned or unwant - ed weight gain. Psychological counseling and sometimes antidepressant med-ications can be helpful in treat - ing depression. Medication cangive relatively quick symptomrelief for some individuals andcounseling helps one learn moreeffective ways to deal with life' s problems. Ask your social work- er to refer you to a mentalhealth professional if you feel you need help with depression. In the past few years, there has been much interest in the use of herbs to treat depression. St. John's Wort (hypericum perfora-tum) is becoming popular in the United States as an alternative to prescription medication totreat depression. In general, the use of herbs to treat depression or other medical condi-tions can be dan- gerous and is not advised for peo - ple with CKD. Specifically,research hasshown that St. John's Wort may interact with anti- rejection drugs, maybe a source of hidden potas- sium[1] and may also interfere with iron absorption and causegastrointestinal irritation[2]. The use of any type of herbal or over-the-counter depression\"remedy\" should always be dis- cussed with your nephrologist (kidney doctor) and other mem - bers of your health care team. If you think you might be depressed over your diet, talk to your dietitian about how youare feeling. T ogether you can develop ideas about how to help you stay positive about yourdiet. These could include: ISetting short-term goals for your lab values . Perhaps the idea of eating more protein, eating lesspotassium and phosphorus and drinking less fluid is overwhelming. W ork with your health care team todecide where to prioritize. It may be easier for you to choose one lab value that isnot within goal range and take steps to improve it.

The goal of these investiga- tions is to provide information that will help to improve the treatment and outlook forthose on dialysis who suffer from depression. Estimates of depression among people on hemodialysis range from 25 percent in some cen-ters to 100 percent in other centers.[1,2] Research has also shown that depression is asso-ciated with increased risk of death and hospitalization among individuals on hemo- dialysis [1,3,4] No large sur-veys have been conducted on the prevalence of depression in people on peritoneal dialysis. This study aims to determine whether a cogni-tive-behavioral interventionadministered to small groupsof individuals on dialysiswould make a difference intheir emotional health. Theproject team headed by JessicaCabness, DSW, assistant pro-fessor at Johnstone, LCSW, who has consulted on the research. The study duplicates earlierNational Kidney Foundation- funded research by Johnstone, which provided data in supportof the current study. \"We know that end of stage renal disease is a life-altering condition and,under the circumstances, it is normal for people to experience situational depression which, ifleft untreated, is potentially dangerous,\" says Dr. Cabness. At USF Dialysis Center in Tampa, 23 people from eachshift participated in the study.The intervention, designed byStephanie Johnstone for a pre - vious NKF-funded researchproject, lasts for six weeks with the individuals meeting weekly in a structured module.The intervention involves them talking about their hopes and fears in the safety and privacyof a small group of people fac- ing similar issues. The aim is for individuals with chronickidney disease to learn new ways to regain control over their lives. After giving informed consent, they were given several short questionnaires including a depression screen for medicalpatients, a widely used health outcomes survey and a screenmeasuring social support.Some information was collect-ed to see if there were any dif - ferences by age, gender,ethnicity or length of time ondialysis. Cabness reports that\"preliminary findings look verypromising and suggest empiri-cal evidence of the effective-ness of nephrology social workintervention in dialysis centers.\" The project team is hopeful that social work inter- ventions with people on hemodialysis will ultimatelydemonstrate a clear relation- ship between what social workers do in dialysis centers,lower rates of hospital read- mission and higher quality of life for those on dialysis.Before the project ends in September 2005, Cabness hopes to recruit a second cen - ter for comparative research. \"We're hoping that more social workers will replicate the study\u2014the more data we have, the better we are able to draw conclusions about the general- izability of the study,\" Cabnesssays. The study will be pub - lished in the Journal of Nephrology Social Work by 2006. DIALYSIS SOCIAL WORK- ERS AIM TO MAXIMIZETHE FUNCTIONING andwell-being of people onhemodialysis. However , with the growth of dialysis facili- ties and increasing socialwork caseloads, many social workers find themselves in the role of financial counselor and transportation/travelexpert, leaving them less time to function in their intended role of providing psychologicalcounseling and emotional support to individuals on dial - ysis and their families. The purpose of this research project, conducted by Amy Freeman, LMSW, and Laura Root, LCSW , of Saint Alphonsus Nephrology Centerin Boise, Idaho, is to examine the relationship between six psychosocial risk factors and level of depression in people new to hemodialysis. The sixpsychosocial risk factors are: gender, age, level of educa- tion, ethnicity, possession ofmedical insurance and amount of time individuals knew they would bestarting dialy- sis prior to their first treat-ment. The study period began in July 2004 and ended June 2005. The study included approximately 60 partici- pants. In order to gather thenecessary information, the researchers used two ques-tionnaires with each person. One questionnaire contained information including ques-tions about the six psychoso- cial risk factors. The other questionnaire used was theBeck Depression Inventory- Fast Screen for medical patients to measure depres- sion level. The final results ofthis research study are expected to be published in the Journal of Nephrology Social Work in April 2006. \"We hope to use the results of this research to assist inpromptly identifying which people who are new to hemodialysis to be at higherrisk for depression,\" says Root.

Onthe other hand, when mental health problems arise, we often ignore them despite howthese problems can directlyimpact the medical challengesof CKD and dialysis. You do not need to be a social worker or psychologist or even spend much time with people like me who have CKD to understandhow widely depression and other emotional problems can occur with chronic illnessessuch as CKD. Although having CKD does not mean a person will be unable to work, it is a reality thatCKD often magnifies the fear of losing a job and income source. In addition, we canhave a loss of self-worth and feelings of anger surface as the question \"Why me?\" arises. W e often have less energy to tack-le issues that would normallynot seem so difficult. Wherenormally we have had self-confidence about the future,suddenly it feels like we havelost control over large parts ofour daily lives. I have feltthese feelings. The effects of CKD are not always obvious to others.Although I may be having a terrible day in terms ofenergy, pain and uremia side effects, there is no sign on my forehead that tellseveryone how I feel. I did not want to always com- plain, especially at my job.While my family was gener- ally supportive and sympa- thetic, they had needs oftheir own and I was embar- rassed to lean too heavily on them. Recognizing all theseconflicting feelings, it is not surprising that individuals with CKD and their familiesmay benefit from professional help when dealing with emotional and socialproblems. This is partic- ularly true during the first months of dialysiswhen new experiences, demands and fears come from all directions. Unfortunately, people who experience depres- sion or other mental health challenges oftenstruggle along and deny the need for help even though many valuablesupport resources are available\u2014all they needto do is ask for the help. Perhaps individuals have difficulty seeing how emotional problems interferewith getting back on track. It is also likely most of us are afraid to share our deepest thoughts and feelings with family and outsiders to avoidthe vulnerability created bysuch openness. Like most, Iwas reluctant to discuss mydarkest thoughts with friendsor family members. Who wouldwant to expose such unaccept - able thinking? It took severalyears before I could evenadmit help was needed.Finally, I recognized I couldnot rebuild my past sense ofself-confidence without help, and the desire to move aheadbecame stronger than a ten- dency to stand still. Relief came when I discovered thebenefit of being able to express my fears with a trained profes- sional without worry of beingjudged or lectured! Knowing the relief I felt, my hope is that others will become con-scious of their emotional prob- lems and act more quickly to get help than I did. Often, the hardest first step is speaking with someone whocan show you the way to find help. First, we often question whether life can get better . Second, trying to change our way of thinking and being open about our inner thoughtsis not easy. My message for fel- low patients and families is that it is okay to openly admitthat you need help coping with emotional problems. After all, CKD is a tough burden! Oneexcellent place for advice on where to find help is right in your dialysis unit with thesocial workers and the nephrologists. Social workers are generally able to provide the professional counselingand support you need to help you get started on addressingyour emotional concerns. In some cases, the social worker may refer you to a mentalhealth professional in your community. Fortunately, Medicare and many otherinsurance programs may pay for professional counseling. Be sure to check with your insur-ance provider in advance. While mental health profes- sionals cannot create instantsolutions for your problems, my experiences showed methat working with them in an open and sincere manner helped me to find ways of cop - ing, allowing me to move on to a better quality of life. Sure, it can be painful to expose per-sonal doubts and fears that we try to deny . The first step begins the healing process.Surprisingly, as you begin each step, the process of healing becomes easier as your lifebegins to take on more mean- ing. Your family, too, can share in that healing and optimism. It Is Okay To Ask For Help By David Jones David Jones Support is available from the social worker at your dialysis unit. IT IS EASY TO WATCH THE CLOCK when you are wait- ing for something to happen.When it comes to waiting for a transplant, it is a calendar thatis ticking away the months and not a clock with minutes or hours! The months and yearsmay go by, and it feels as if the waiting will never end. How can you be patient when the wait is so long? Waiting times for a kidney transplant average betweenthree and five years depending on your blood type and antibody level. Yet enduring the wait and being called for a transplant may not mean the final wait is over. You may be called to thetransplant center for a possible transplant, then sent home if the kidney is found not to besuitable for transplant or does not match you. And sometimesthe kidney does not work right away and you may need to con- tinue dialysis while waiting for the transplanted kidney tobegin to work. Waiting for something you want so badly is always hard and often emotion- ally draining. You may even wonder if transplantation isworth all of this. Gary Costly from Santa Rosa, California received a livingrelated kidney transplant in1989 from his brother . The transplant lasted untilFebruary 2000 when it faileddue to reoccurrence of the origi - nal disease that had affectedGary's kidneys. His first trans-plant had required that he waitonly a few months for his broth- er to donate a kidney. The wait for the second transplant was very different from his firsttransplant experience. He found himself waiting his turn for a transplant in a long line of others who were in need of a kidney . He knew how good he could feel with a successful transplant, whichmade the wait even harder. After the firstmonths on the wait-ing list, though, herealized he must con- tinue with his life and not put everything on hold while waiting for another trans-plant. He continued to plan vacations with his family and work as a chemist while await - ing the call from the transplantcenter. \"The one thing I tried to do while on dialysis was lead as normal a life as possible and not let kidney failure or dialysisconsume me. But, knowing the call could come at any time brought a little anxiety to themix. When I was called to the hospital for a transplant and then sent home after being told the kidney was going to go to another person, I was extremelydisappointed. That was short lived, though, as I soon began to feel happy for the person whoreceived the kidney. As I reflect-ed on the process I realized thatgetting called for a possibletransplant, even though I endedup without it, meant I must becloser to actually getting atransplant!\" About two months later, Gary received another call from thetransplant center and was suc-cessfully transplanted. \"My family is happy, and I am elat- ed,\" says Gary. \"The biggest challenge for me while I wasawaiting a transplant was keep- ing a positive attitude.\" Besides waiting, it can also be difficult watching others leave the dialysis unit when they arecalled for a transplant while you continue to wait. Althoughyou are happy for them, you most likely will find it hard to keep from asking yourself, \"When am I going to get mychance for a kidney transplant?\" Waiting time varies for individ-uals due to the degree of diffi - culty in matching. Some may have a high antibody level (per-cent reactive antibody level, commonly referred to as PRA). Although some new therapies can remove these antibodies,the waiting time is generally longer due to difficulty finding a compatible match. There are sources for support while waiting. One will be yourtransplant center staff. Call them to check on your status. Make sure you are active on the list and that there is nothing more they or you need to do to keep your status active. Checkfor local support groups. Talking with others who are also waiting or who haveendured the wait can be helpful both to you and your family.

Waiting for a T ransplant is full of ideas and insights from transplant recipients across the country on how to keep \"livinglife\" while waiting for a trans- plant. The goal while waiting is to stay as mentally and physi- cally healthyas possible so that when thewait is finally over you will enhance yourchances for a successful transplant.

FAMILY FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3 11 SPOTLIGHT ON MEDICARE MANY PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) and their family members wonderabout Medicare coverage for health care. If you have kidneyfailure and receive Medicare because of your ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease), you areentitled to the full range of coverage allowed under Medicare Parts A (hospitalcare) and B (outpatient care). It is important to know that Medicare helps not just withpayment for your physical health needs, such as dialysis treatment or transplantation,but also for some of the costs for mental health care. Takingcare of your mental health needs is an important part of adjusting to life with CKD. Aswith most Medicare coverage, there are certain deductibles and co-payments, in addition to the monthly premium forPart B benefits. Medicare covers mental health care given by a doctor or a qualified mental health profes-sional, such as licensed social workers, physicians and psy- chologists. Before a patientgets treatment, he or she should ask the doctor , psychologist, social worker orother health professional if he or she accepts Medicare pay- ment (sometimes referred to asMedicare \"assignment\"). Medicare assignment means that the doctor or professionaldelivering the care has a certi- fied Medicare provider number and has agreed to accept theamount that Medicare reim- burses for that particular service. Medicare requires an annual deductible of $100.00 for out- patient mental health care.This means that you have to pay $100.00 of your mental health care expenses beforeMedicare starts to pay. Once you have paid $100.00 under Part B during a calendar yearfor this particular service, Medicare pays the rest of its coordinated portion. Once the deductible is met, Medicare covers 50 percent of the Medicare-approved amount forthe mental health professional. Either the patient, Medicaid or another source of insurance pays the remaining cost. If an individual wishes to use theservices of a doctor or mental health professional who does not accept Medicare assign - ment, then the costs are likely to be more. Check with your supplemental health insuranceplan to find out about mental health coverage with that plan. For mental health carein a general hospital or psychi- atric hospital, Medicare pays for services in the same waythat it pays for all other inpa-tient hospital care. If an indi- vidual with kidney failurereceives mental health care in a psychiatric hospital, there is a lifetime limit of 190 days of inpatient care covered byMedicare. In any type of hospi- tal, the patient pays the same co-payments and deductiblesas with all other hospital services. Consider mental health treat- ment as a natural part of an overall healthy adjustment tothe increased emotional demands of dialysis or trans-plantation. Medicare can help you by sharing the costs, as described above. For more information or help in findingmental health resources in your community, consult yourdialysis or transplant social worker.

Continued from page 8 12 FAMILY FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3YOUR CHILD AND YOU WHY IS PARENT AL MENTAL HEALTH IMPORT ANT? While many parents make the job look easy, taking care of a child with kidney problems is actually very demanding. It takes dozens of hours each month to go to doctor's appointments, supervise medical care and take in infor- mation. It is very important for parents to stay in touch withthe amount of stress they are feeling and to take steps to lower their stress before it getstoo high. For parents to take the best care of their child, they first need to make surethat their own mental health needs are being met. WHA T IS MENTAL HEALTH? Mental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. Mental health is astate of well-being in which an individual is aware of his or her own abilities and can man-age the stresses that comealong with life. Getting andkeeping good mental health, like good physical health, takes attention and work. MONIT ORING S TRESS TAKES PRACTICE Unfortunately, no one has invented a device that can tell you if your stress is dangerous - ly high. Sometimes we recog- nize stress only when there are negative consequences. Somewarning signs of high stress levels include: more trouble than usual making decisions;difficulty managing anger; less patience with family, friendsand health care providers; increased trouble with time management; sadness over lit - tle disappointments; changesin sleeping habits, such asinsomnia (trouble fallingasleep or staying asleep) or toomuch sleeping; and changes ineating habits (eating too muchor too little). PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF S TRESS High levels of stress that last for many weeks and/or monthscan lead to serious physical health issues including heart,stomach, bowel and/or bladder problems. Mental health prob- lems such as depression andanxiety with panic attacks can also be caused by high stress. High parental stress can alsocause more stress in children. HOW TO LOWER YOUR STRESS LEVELS Develop a support system of people who can help you. Although it is sometimes hard to ask others for help, manypeople find great joy in helping others. Make a list of the kind of things people in your sup- port system could do to helpyou so that when someone asks, you will be ready with ananswer. If people do not ask about how they can be support - ive, let them know! Get enough sleep. You need to feel rested to be able to dealwith parenting challenges. Work out a bedtime routine that allows you to have sometime to \"put to rest\" the day's finished and unfinished tasks before you physically get into bed. Take time for yourself. Do something for yourself eachday that is unrelated to whatyour child needs and to whatother people expect from you.For some parents, exercise isan essential component tomanaging stress. Once you getin the habit of taking a briefbreak each day for yourself youwill see the value this has foreveryone around you! Enjoy your child. Take pleas- ure in spending time with yourchild each week doing some- thing that is not related to his or her kidney problems. Eventhough it might seem like there are not enough hours in a day to take time just for play, playing is a valuable activitywith both short- and long-term benefits for you and your child.Board games, card games, throwing a ball, reading a book, coloring a picture orplaying a video game are examples of some playtime activities that most kids enjoydoing with a parent. GETTING PROFESSIONAL HELP If parenting stress causes you to have physical or emotional problems that interfere with taking care of your dailyresponsibilities, you should call a professional for help. Yourchild' s doctor or social worker can direct you to mental health resources in your community.Your minister or rabbi mayalso offer advice aboutwhat kind of treatment and support is available.It is absolutely normal for parents of children with kidney problems to become overwhelmed with stress from time to time and it isimportant not to feel embarrassed to ask for help. Many parents getsupport from a counselor or psychotherapist (psy - chologist, social worker , or psychiatrist) experienced in working with parents who have medically ill children. Be sure to check with your health insurance provider to find out about your policy's coverage for mental health services.

MONITORING AND MANAGING STRESS: The Importance of Good Parental Mental Health for Children with Kidney Disease By Arlene C. Gerson, PhD and Barbara A. Fivush, MD Taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your child with CKD. Family Focus is available on the Web . To find this issue or back issues of the newspaper go to www .readfamilyfocus.org ADJUSTING TO A DIAG- NOSIS of chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be an over-whelming experience. Though all people with CKD are cer-tainly not the same, and indi- viduals respond to the diagnosis in different ways, it is common for people to have strong emotions when faced with the reality of need-ing to start dialysis. You may feel anger, guilt and shock. You may notice changes in yourability to work, your role in your family or your social life\u2014all of these add to the confusion and upset that most people report feeling as they learn to cope with CKD. Forsome, both physical and emo- tional treatment and rehabili-tation is necessary . Most people are able to adjust and return to many of theactivities that were present in their lives before CKD, includ-ing family , travel, leisure and work. To live well with kidney disease, it is important to care for both the physical and emo - tional issues that you may experience. T alking with some- one about these changes andhow they affect you can help you manage your feelings and lower your chances of becom-ing depressed or anxious, while increasing your chances of making a positive adjust - ment to living with CKD. KNOWING WHEN TO GET HELP Statistics show that up to 40 percent of people with CKD experience depression at sometime [1] [2]. Signs of depres- sion include trouble enjoyingthings that used to be fun,staying away from social situations such as time withfamily and friends, having ahard time concentrating andfeeling sad or down most of thetime. If you have one or moreof these symptoms it does notalways mean that you are suf - fering from depression, but itis important to discuss yoursymptoms with a professionalwho can help you. Other symp- toms commonly experienced by people suffering from depres- sion, such as difficulty sleepingand low appetite, can also be symptoms of uremia. Usually, depression is easily treated. Many people find thattalking about their feelings with the dialysis unit social worker or doctor, taking anti-depressant medication or see- ing a counselor on a regular basis can make a big differ-ence. Usually, a combination ofcounseling and medication is most effective in preventing or managing depression. Some people living with a chronic illness have a great deal of anxiety or nervousness. People who have an anxiousemotional response to a diag- nosis or treatment of CKD can sometimes have trouble sleep-ing and feel nervous and wor-ried much of the time, oftenover things that they normallywould not worry about.Anxiety can be quite disrup-tive to people's lives, making itdifficult to relax, concentrateand become involved in every - day activities. Some symptomsof depression and anxiety aresimilar, and anxiety itself issometimes a sign of depres-sion, so a proper evaluation by your medical team is important. Anxiety is also treatable with counseling and medication. THE ROLE OF THE DIAL YSIS SOCIAL WORKER Every dialysis center has a team on site to handle the range of challenges that those people on dialysis or with akidney transplant face. It is important for you to partner with the members of your dial-ysis team to make use of the skills that each has to offer.Fortunately, to find out about social support, professional counseling and to learn moreabout a variety of treatmentoptions for depression, anxietyor difficulty adjusting to dialy- sis and CKD management, you need look no further than yourdialysis social worker. The dialysis social worker is the one member of the health careteam with training and experi- ence in dealing with mental health issues. His or her mainrole is to counsel people with CKD and their family mem- bers to help them adjust to thechanges and challenges. Social workers can give brief therapy in the dialysis unit to help peo-ple better understand and manage some of the feelings and thoughts that can lead todepression or anxiety. The social worker can partner with individuals to identify and solve problems that often come along with the changes of living with CKD and help them develop better coping strategies. TREATMENT OPTIONS There are a variety of treat- ment options available to help with the emotional reactions to a CKD diagnosis. First, youshould talk to your social worker about how you are feel - ing. In addition to helping youunderstand your feelings, your social worker may be able tohelp you learn the best treat- ment options for your unique experiences. Among the treatment options available for depression andanxiety are individual and family counseling offered through many counseling cen - ters in the community. Social workers can give you resources for group counseling and sup-port groups for people facing similar challenges. There are a growing number of books,magazines, Web sites and other materials from organiza-tions like the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) which offer educational and emotional support, inspirational materi - als and information about living with CKD. Coping Effectively: A Guide for Patients and Their Families is one brochure available through the NKF by calling800-622-9010 or visiting www .kidney .org Dialysis social workers can help you find these resources and taking advantage of themcan help you feel less alone and more like an important part of the large network ofpeople living well with CKD.

But there are resources available. Most people are able to adjust and r eturn to many of the activities that were present in their liv es before CKD. 14 FAMIL Y FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3CONGRESS AND MEDICARE STAFF are paying more attention to the mental health of Medicare bene - ficiaries these days. This isclear in the Medicare Prescrip- tion Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, and in two draft regulations pub - lished on February 4, 2005 bythe Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS). The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement andModernization Act of 2003 makes many changes in Medicare. Notably it providesthat new beneficiaries are enti- tled to a \"Welcome to Medicare\" initial preventive examination.(In the past, Medicare has paid for a doctor's office visit only if a beneficiary was sick.) Benef-iciaries who get their first pre- ventive examination within six months after the effective date of their Medicare Part B cover - age period are eligible for thisservice. Not only is the preven- tive examination a welcome advance in the Medicare pro - gram but the rules that carry out this law state that the first preventive examination shouldinclude a review of the benefi-ciary' s risk factors for depres - sion (including past history ofdepression or other mood disor-ders) based on the use of anappropriate screening instru-ment, which the doctor or otherqualified non-physician healthcare professional may selectfrom various available screen-ing tests for this purpose.Medicare will not pay for a visit to both a doctor and a non-physician health care professional, however, for this screening. One of the Proposed Rules con- cerns dialysis clinics and the other relates to transplant cen-ters. Both recognize the need to evaluate the psychosocial issues faced by individuals who areserved by these facilities. The first reference to psychoso- cial concerns in the Proposed Rule, \"Conditions for Coverage for End Stage Renal Disease Facilities\" would make dialysis facilities: (a) inform people ondialysis of their right to be treated with respect and digni - ty, and (b) recognize each per- son's individuality and personal requirements, as well as alertstaff to be sensitive to the indi- viduals' psychosocial needs and ability to cope with end stagerenal disease (ESRD). In another draft section, CMS calls for a comprehensive assessment of all people who are new to dialysis and periodicre-assessment of those already on dialysis. CMS states that it is fitting and necessary forevery assessment to focus not only on the person' s medical needs, but also on his or herpsychosocial and rehabilitationneeds. In fact, evaluation of psy-chosocial needs is one of 13assessment criteria that theagency proposes to require.Although the existing regula-tions require a patient careplan, they do not require a com-prehensive assessment beforethe development of the careplan. The addition of an assess-ment is one of the major improvements that would come from the Proposed Rule. Someof the other criteria include evaluation of family and other support systems and evaluation of vocational and physical rehabilitation status and potential. Monthly re-assessment would be required if an individualexperiences very long or fre- quent hospitalizations, a major setback in health status, a sig- nificant change in psychosocial needs or poor nutrition. Under the Proposed Rule, new patients have to have an assessment within 20 days andanother assessment after three months. Stable patients haveto be re-assessed annually thereafter. However, as per the Proposed Rule, patients who arenot stable should be re-assessed on a monthly basis. CMS acknowledges that mentalhealth should be taken into account when considering whether a person is stable. A third section in the Proposed Rule for dialysis clinics wouldrequire that the plan of care for the person on dialysis include measurable and expected out-comes and estimated timetables to meet his or her medical and psychosocial needs as identified in the first and following assessments. When completed,this section would also state that the plan of care must out - line all of the services thatwould be given to reach and keep up the expected outcomes of care. The Proposed Rule would also require dialysis units to have a quality assessment and qualityimprovement program. In its response to the draft regulation, the National Kidney Foundation insisted that such quality assessment and quality improvement programs include mental health. The second Proposed Rule, \"Requirements for Approval and Reapproval of Transplant Centers T o Perform Organ Transplants\" also addresses psychosocial concerns. It says that transplant centers mustuse a qualified social worker to evaluate a transplant recipient's psychosocial needs, participatein care planning for the trans- plant recipient and identify community resources to assistthe person and his or her family. A new provision in the Proposed Rule for transplant centers would require that a likelytransplant candidate receive a psychosocial evaluation before being placed on the waitlist. Inexplaining this requirement, CMS states: \"Although a person may be medically suitable fortransplantation, he or she may have inadequate social support or coping abilities, or may beunable to demonstrate adequate adherence to a therapeutic regi- men, which could then put thegraft, and ultimately the trans- plant recipient, at risk.\" Family Focus readers who would like more information about the Medicare issues discussed in this article can send an e-mail to: info@kidney .orgLegislative and Regulatory Developments Affecting the Mental Health of People with CKD By Dolph Chianchiano, JD, MPH An UPDATE Dolph Chianchiano, JD, MPHOne of the Proposed Rules concerns dialysis clinics and the other relates to transplant centers. FAMILY FOCUS Volume 14, Number 3 15HELPING Y OURSELF FEELING WELL EMO- TIONALL Y may be chal- lenging when coping withphysical illness. For many peo- ple, how an illness will affectone's independence, family life, ability to work and financial picture becomes nearly asimportant as the physical symp- toms or treatment of the illness. Poor physical health and theworries that go with either chronic kidney disease (CKD) or being on dialysis may bringabout feelings of depression. Depression is not just feeling down in the dumps or blue nowand again. And it does not affect only your mood, as it is a true medical disorder that mayaffect your thoughts, feelings, physical health and behaviors. It is common for people whohave a chronic illness, such as CKD, to also experience depres-sion. It is not a sign of weak - ness, nor is it something that you can will yourself to snap out of. Understanding more about depression may be helpful inovercoming it. Here are some facts and figures that show how common depression is: IIDepression is the leading cause of disability in the United States.[1] IIDepression is now the leading cause of disability in the world.[2] IIChronic illness increases one's chance for depres- sion.[3] IISome studies have shown that 20-25 percent of people on dialysis are depressed.[4,5] IIDepression is treatable and most people who are treatedshow improvement.[3] Kidney disease experts think that depression among peopleon dialysis is both underdiag - nosed and undertreated.[6,7]When untreated, depression cancause unnecessary pain and suf-fering for those on dialysis andtheir families and symptomscan last for weeks, months oreven years. Among its many effects, depression can impactyour ability or desire to follow treatment recommendations,such as following a proper diet and getting adequate dialysis, and to take part in your overallplan of care. In addition, it has been shown that depression in people with kidney failure canlead to a higher chance of early death compared to people on dialysis who are not diagnosedwith depression.[8] Learning about the signs and symptoms of depression may bea good first step in the pursuit of feeling better. Here are somethings to look for , especially if they have occurred nearly every day for at least two weeks: IIFEELING sad or empty most of the day IILOSS of interest or pleasure in life IIDIFFICULTY concentrating or inability to make decisions IIFEELING worthless IITHOUGHTS of suicide. It is often useful to talk to fami- ly members or friends to see if they have noticed changes in your moods or behaviors thatyou may not have noticed. If you are on dialysis, your facil- ity health care team has resources and expertise to help you deal with your mental health issues and emotionalwellness. In particular, there is a master 's-prepared social worker who has the training and background to help you address the complex issues ofadjusting to a chronic disease.The Medicare guidelines fordialysis and kidney transplantprograms mandate the duties oflicensed master 's-prepared social workers in dialysis andtransplant facilities to \"supportand maximize the social func-tioning and adjustment of thepatient.\" The social worker canhelp you find ways to bettercope with the challenges youmay be facing. There are impor-tant things you can do to help yourself when facing depres-sion. (See sidebar: How to Help Yourself If You Are Depressed.) If you think you may be depressed, understand that depression is treatable. Talk toyour doctor or social worker about your concerns, and to see if you could benefitfrom treatment for depres- sion. Treatment options may include prescription antidepressant medication from your doctor, supportivecounseling from your dialysis facility social worker or counsel- ing from other professionals in your community. Depression is most effectively treated whenyou work with your care team to decide on the best treatmentmethod for you and when you are committed to sticking with the treatment plan. You CAN regain feelings of emotional well-being. T ake action today to feel better.

DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS may make one feel exhausted,worthless, helpless and hope-less. Such negative thoughtsand feelings make some peoplefeel like giving up. It is impor - tant to realize that these nega-tive views are part of thedepression and typically do notaccurately reflect the actual cir-cumstances. Negative thinkingfades as treatment begins totake effect. Some things youcan do include: SETTING realistic goals inlight of the depression andassume a reasonable amountof responsibility. BREAKING large tasks intosmall ones, setting prioritiesand doing what you can asyou can. TRYING to be with other peo-ple and to confide in someone;it is usually better than beingalone and isolated. PARTICIPATING in activitiesthat make you feel better. EXERCISING, going to amovie, a ballgame, or partici-pating in religious, social orother activities may help. EXPECTING your mood toimprove gradually, not imme-diately. Feeling better takestime.

If it is at leastas good as Medicare Part D andyou wait to sign up for Part D,you can join later without pay-ing a higher premium. But ifyour current plan is not at leastas good as Part D, you may paymore for Part D when you join. IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC KID- NEY DISEASE (CKD ), take the time you need to choose the bestplan for you. Think about whatdrugs you take now. Ask yourdoctor what drugs you shouldtake to keep you healthy andwhat drugs you may need if youchange treatments or yourhealth changes. You will savemore money with a \"kidneyfriendly\" plan, one that coversmost of the drugs your doctor tells you. Some drugs covered by Medicare Part D that peoplewith CKD often take includethose for bone disease, high cho-lesterol, diabetes, heart prob-lems, high blood pressuredepression and anxiety.
