BMJ 4/27/22.Observational study of CDC case surveillance and vaccine data during pre -Omicron period (12/14/20 -12/18/21). Every 10% improvement in vaccination coverage reduced mortality rates by 8% and case incidence rates by 7%. Counties with higher rates of vaccination coverage had lower rates of mortality and case incidence rates during the Alpha and Delta variant periods. There was a smaller lowering effect on incidence rates during the Delta period. FDA EUA Revision for Janssen (J&J) Vaccine The FDA has limited the authorized use of the Janssen COVID -19 vaccine to ages 18 years for those who: Other COVID -19 vaccines are not accessible or clinically appropriate Elect to receive Janssen vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a COVID -19 vaccine \"After conducting an updated analysis, evaluation and investigation of reported cases, the FDA has determined that the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a syndrome of rare and potentially life -threatening blood clots in combination with low levels of blood platelets with onset of symptoms approximately one to two weeks following administration of the Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine, warrants limiting the authorized use of the vaccine.\" 24FDA Announcement 5/5/22 Janssen EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare ProvidersCDC & WSSSRW: mRNA Vaccines Preferred Over Janssen The CDC and WSSSRW preferentially recommend mRNA vaccines over the Janssen (J&J) COVID -19 vaccine for primary vaccination and for boosters. The Janssen COVID -19 vaccine may be considered in some situations: When there is a contraindication to mRNA COVID -19 vaccines When a person would otherwise remain unvaccinated for COVID -19 due to limited access tomRNA COVID -19 vaccines When a person wants to receive the Janssen COVID -19 vaccine despite the safety concerns identified It is contraindicated to administer Janssen COVID -19 vaccine to people with a history ofthrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following receipt of the Janssen COVID -19 vaccine or any other adenovirus vector -based COVID -19 vaccines (e.g., AstraZeneca's COVID -19 vaccine, which is not authorized or approved in the United States). 25CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Clinical Guidance Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup Statement 12/17/21Upcoming CDC/ACIP Meeting 2022 Time: 8:00AM -1:00 PM PDT This meeting is virtual.
