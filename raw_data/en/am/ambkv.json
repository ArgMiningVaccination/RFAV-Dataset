Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument ofthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing ofcialrulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and forpublishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conven-tions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of generalinterest. It is published weekly. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform applicationof the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke,modify, or amend any of those previously published in theBulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless other-wise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internalmanagement are not published; however, statements of inter-nal practices and procedures that affect the rights and dutiesof taxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in therevenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings totaxpayers or technical advice to Service eld ofces, identify-ing details and information of a condential nature are deletedto prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply withstatutory requirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but theymay be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not berelied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel inthe disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings andprocedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations,court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered,and Service personnel and others concerned are cautionedagainst reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows:Part I.\u20141986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions ofthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.\u2014Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, TaxConventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legisla-tion and Related Committee Reports. Part III.\u2014Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to thesesubjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Alsoincluded in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rul-ings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued bythe Department of the Treasury's Ofce of the Assistant Sec-retary (Enforcement). Part IV.\u2014Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbar-ment and suspension lists, and announcements. The last Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. Thesemonthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and arepublished in the last Bulletin of each semiannual period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Congress has consistently sought to pro- tect religious beliefs in the context of health care and human services, including healthinsurance, even as it has sought to promoteaccess to health services. 1Against that backdrop, Congress granted the HealthResources and Services Administration(HRSA), a component of the United StatesDepartment of Health and Human Services(HHS), discretion under the Patient Protec-tion and Affordable Care Act to specify thatcertain group health plans and health insur-ance issuers shall cover, \"with respect towomen, such additional preventive care and screenings ...a sprovided for in compre- hensive guidelines supported 2713(a)(4). HRSA exercisedthat discretion under the last Administrationto require health coverage for, among otherthings, certain contraceptive services, 2while the administering agencies\u2014the Depart-ments of Health and Human Services, La-bor, and the Treasury (collectively, \"the De-partments\" 3)\u2014exercised the same discretion to allow exemptions to those re-quirements. Through rulemaking, includingthree interim nal rules, the Departmentsallowed exemptions and accommodationsfor certain religious objectors where theGuidelines require coverage of contracep-tive services. Many individuals and entitieschallenged the contraceptive coverage re-quirement and regulations (hereinafter, the\"contraceptive Mandate,\" or the \"Mandate\")as being inconsistent with various legal pro-tections, including the Religious FreedomRestoration Act, 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1.Much of that litigation continues to this day. The Departments have recently exer- cised our discretion to reevaluate theseexemptions and accommodations. Thisevaluation includes consideration of vari-ous factors, such as the interests served bythe existing Guidelines, regulations, andaccommodation process 4; the extensive litigation; Executive Order 13798, \"Pro-moting Free Speech and Religious Lib-erty\" (May 4, 2017); protection of the freeexercise of religion in the First Amend-ment and by Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993; Con-gress' history of providing protections forreligious beliefs regarding certain healthservices (including contraception, steril-ization, and items or services believed toinvolve abortion); the discretion affordedunder section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act;the structure and intent of that provisionin the broader context of section 2713 andthe Patient Protection and AffordableCare Act; the regulatory process and com-ments submitted in various requests forpublic comments (including in the Depart-ments' 2016 Request for Information). In light of these factors, the Depart- ments issue these new interim nal rulesto better balance the Government's inter-est in ensuring coverage for contraceptiveand sterilization services in relation to theGovernment's interests, including as re-flected throughout Federal law, to provideconscience protections for individuals andentities with sincerely held religious be-liefs in certain health care contexts, and tominimize burdens in our regulation of thehealth insurance market. A.The Affordable Care Act Collectively, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted on March 23, 2010, and theHealth Care and Education ReconciliationAct of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152), enactedon March 30, 2010, are known as theAffordable Care Act. In signing the Af- 1See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting individuals and health care entities from being required to provide or assist sterilizations, abortions, or other lawful health services if it would violate their \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div.

Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 383fordable Care Act, President Obama is- sued Executive Order 13535 (March 24,2010), which declared that, \"[u]nder theAct, longstanding Federal laws to protectconscience (such as the Church Amend-ment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, WeldonAmendment, 111-8) remain intact\" and that \"[n]u-merous executive agencies have a role inensuring that these restrictions are en-forced, including the HHS.\" The Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of partA of title XXVII of the Public HealthService Act (PHS Act) relating to grouphealth plans and health insurance issuersin the group and individual markets. Inaddition, the Affordable Care Act addssection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Re-tirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to theInternal Revenue Code (Code) to incorpo-rate the provisions of part A of titleXXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA andthe Code, and thereby make them appli- cable to certain group health plans regu-lated under ERISA or the Code. The sec-tions of the PHS Act incorporated intoERISA and the Code are sections 2701through 2728 of the PHS Act. These interim nal rules concern sec- tion 2713 of the PHS Act. Where it ap-plies, section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Actrequires coverage without cost sharing for\"such women's preventivecare \"as provided for\" guidelines developed byHRSA/HHS. The Congress did not spec-ify any particular additional preventivecare and screenings with respect to womenthat HRSA could or should include in itsGuidelines, nor did Congress indicate whetherthe Guidelines should include contraceptionand sterilization. The Departments have consistently in- terpreted section 2714(a)(4) PHS Act'sgrant of authority to include broad discre-tion to decide the extent to which HRSAwill provide for and support the coverageof additional women's preventive careand screenings in the Guidelines. In turn,the Departments have interpreted that dis-cretion to include the ability to exemptentities from coverage requirements an-nounced in HRSA's Guidelines. That in- terpretation is rooted in the text of section2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, which allowsHRSA to decide the extent to which theGuidelines will provide for and supportthe coverage of additional women's pre-ventive care and screenings. Accordingly, the Departments have con- sistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4) ofthe PHS Act's reference to \"comprehensiveguidelines purposesof this paragraph\" to grant HRSA authorityto develop such Guidelines. And becausethe text refers to Guidelines \"supported byHRSA for purposes of this paragraph,\" theDepartments have consistently interpretedthat authority to afford HRSA broad discre-tion to consider the requirements of cover-age and cost-sharing in determining the na-ture and extent of preventive care andscreenings recommended in the guidelines.(76 FR 46623). As the Departments havenoted, these Guidelines are different from\"the other guidelines referenced in section2713(a) of the PHS Act, which pre-dated the Affordable Care Act and were originallyissued for purposes of identifying the non-binding recommended care that providersshould provide to patients.\" Id. Guidelinesdeveloped as nonbinding recommendationsfor care implicate signicantly different le-gal and policy concerns than guidelinesdeveloped for a mandatory coverage re-quirement. To guide HRSA in exercisingthe discretion afforded to it in section2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, the Departmentshave previously promulgated regulationsdening the scope of permissible exemp-tions and accommodations for such guide-lines. (45 CFR 147.131). The interim nalrules set forth herein are a necessary andappropriate exercise of the authority ofHHS, of which HRSA is a component, andof the authority delegated to the Depart-ments collectively as 9833; 1191c;42 U.S.C. 300gg-92). Our of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act is conrmed by the Afford-able Care Act's statutory structure. Con-gress did not intend to require entirely uni-form coverage of preventive services (76FR 46623). To the contrary, Congresscarved out an exemption from section 2713of the PHS Act for grandfathered plans. In contrast, this exemption is not applicable tomany of the other provisions in Title I of theAffordable Care Act\u2014provisions previ-ously referred to FR 34540). Act, which prohib-its preexisting condition exclusions or otherdiscrimination based on health status ingroup health coverage; section 2708 of thePHS Act, which prohibits excessive waitingperiods (as of January 1, 2014); section2711 of the PHS Act, which relates to life-time limits; section 2712 of the PHS Act,which prohibits rescission of health insur-ance coverage; section 2714 of the PHS Act,which extends dependent coverage until age26; and section 2718 of the PHS Act, whichimposes a medical loss ratio on health in-surance issuers in the individual and groupmarkets (for insured coverage), or requiresthem to provide rebates to policyholders.(75 FR of ple in America with employer-sponsoredhealth coverage, approximately 25.5 millionare estimated to be enrolled in grandfatheredplans not subject to section 2713 of the PHSAct. 5As the Supreme Court observed, \"there is no legal requirement that grandfa-thered plans ever be phased out.\" Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751,2764 n.10 (2014). The Departments' interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to per-mit HRSA to establish exemptions fromthe Guidelines, and of the Departments'own authority as administering agenciesto guide HRSA in establishing such ex-emptions, is also consistent with Execu-tive Order 13535. That order, issued uponthe signing of the Affordable Care Act,specied that \"longstanding Federal lawsto protect conscience...remain intact,\"including laws that protect religious be-liefs (and moral convictions) from certainrequirements in the health care context.While the text of Executive Order 13535does not require the expanded exemptionsissued in these interim nal rules, the ex-panded exemptions are, as explained be-low, consistent with longstanding Federallaws to protect religious beliefs regarding 5Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2017 Annual Survey,\" available 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 384certain health matters, and are consistent with the intent that the Affordable CareAct would be implemented in accordancewith the protections set forth in thoselaws. B.The Regulations Concerning Women's Preventive Services On July 19, 2010, the Departments is- sued interim nal rules implementing sec- tion 2713 of the PHS Act (75 FR 41726).Those interim nal rules charged HRSAwith developing the Guidelines authorizedby section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS. 1. The Institute of Medicine Report In developing the Guidelines, HRSA relied on an independent report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now knownas the National Academy of Medicine) onwomen's preventive services, issued onJuly 19, 2011, \"Clinical Preventive Ser-vices for Women, Closing the Gaps\"(IOM 2011). The IOM's report wasfunded by the HHS Ofce of the Assis-tant Secretary for Planning and Evalua-tion (ASPE), pursuant to a fundingopportunity that charged the IOM toconduct a review of effective preventiveservices to ensure women's health andwell-being. 6 The IOM made a number of recom- mendations with respect to women's pre-ventive services. As relevant here, theIOM recommended that the Guidelinescover the full range of Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved contra-ceptive methods, sterilization procedures,and patient education and counseling forwomen with reproductive capacity. Be-cause FDA includes in the category of\"contraceptives\" certain drugs and de-vices that may not only prevent concep-tion (fertilization), but may also preventimplantation of an embryo, 7the IOM's recommendation included several contra-ceptive methods that many persons andorganizations believe are abortifacient\u2014 that is, as causing early abortion\u2014andwhich they conscientiously oppose forthat reason distinct from whether they alsooppose contraception or sterilization. One of the 16 members of the IOM committee, Dr. Anthony LoSasso, a Pro-fessor at the University of Illinois at Chi-cago School of Public Health, wrote aformal dissenting opinion. He argued thatthe IOM committee did not have sufcienttime to evaluate fully the evidence onwhether the use of preventive services be-yond those encompassed by the UnitedStates Preventive Services Task Force(USPSTF), HRSA's Bright Futures Proj-ect, and the Advisory Committee on Im-munization Practices (ACIP) leads tolower rates of disability or disease andincreased rates of well-being. He furtherargued that \"the recommendations weremade without high quality, systematic ev-idence of the preventive nature of the ser-vices considered,\" and that \"the commit-tee process for evaluation of the evidencelacked transparency and was largely sub-ject to the preferences of the committee'scomposition. Troublingly, the processtended to result in a mix of determinations ltered througha lens of advocacy.\" Dr. LoSasso alsoraised concerns that the committee did nothave time to develop a framework fordetermining whether coverage of anygiven preventive service leads to a reduc-tion in healthcare expenditure. 8(IOM 2011 at 231-32). In its response to Dr.LoSasso, the other 15 committee membersstated, in part, that \"At the rst committeemeeting, it was agreed that cost consider-ations were outside the scope of thecharge, and that the committee should notattempt to duplicate the disparate review processes used by other bodies, such asthe USPSTF, ACIP, and Bright Futures.HHS, with input from this committee,may consider other factors including costin its development of coverage decisions.\"2. HRSA's 2011 Guidelines and the Departments' Second Interim FinalRules On August 1, 2011, HRSA released onto its website its Guidelines for wom- en's preventive services, adopting therecommendations of the IOM. https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ TheGuidelines included coverage for allFDA-approved contraceptives, steriliza-tion procedures, and related patient ed-ucation and counseling for women withreproductive capacity, as prescribed bya health care provider. In administering this Mandate, on Au- gust 1, 2011, the Departments promul-gated interim nal rules amending our2010 interim nal rules. (76 FR 46621)(2011 interim nal rules). The 2011 in-terim nal rules specify that HRSA hasthe authority to establish exemptions fromthe contraceptive coverage requirementfor certain group health plans establishedor maintained by certain religious em-ployers and for health insurance coverageprovided in connection with such plans. 9 The 2011 interim nal rules dened anexempt \"religious employer\" narrowly asone that: reli-gious values as its purpose; (2) primarilyemployed persons who shared its religioustenets; (3) primarily served persons whoshared its religious tenets; and (4) was anonprot organization, as described insection 6033(a)(1) and (a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii)of the Code. Those relevant sections of theCode include only churches, their inte-grated auxiliaries, conventions or associ-ations of churches, and the exclusivelyreligious activities of a religious order.The practical effect of the rules' denitionof \"religious employer\" was to create po-tential uncertainty about whether employ-ers, including many of those houses ofworship or their integrated auxiliaries,would fail to qualify for the exemption ifthey engaged in outreach activities towardpersons who did not share their religious 6Because section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act species that the HRSA Guidelines shall include preventive care and screenings \"with respect to women,\" the Guidelines exclude services relating to a man's reproductive capacity, such as vasectomies and condoms. 7FDA's guide \"Birth Control: Medicines To Help You,\" species that various approved contraceptives, including Levonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate, and IUDs, work mainly by preventing fertilization and \"may also work ... by preventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus)\" of a human embryo after fertilization. Available at https://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/ byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm. 8The Departments do not relay these dissenting remarks as an endorsement of the remarks, but to describe the history of the Guidelines, which includes this part of the report that IOM provided to HRSA. 9The 2011 amended interim nal rules were issued and effective on August 1, 2011, and published in the Federal Register on August 3, 2011. (76 FR 46621). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 385tenets.10As the basis for adopting that limited denition of religious employer, the 2011 interim nal rules stated thatthey relied on the laws of some \"Statesthat exempt certain religious employersfrom having to comply with State lawrequirements to cover contraceptive ser-vices.\" (76 FR 46623). That same day,HRSA exercised the discretion describedin the 2011 interim nal rules to providethe exemption. 3. The Departments' Subsequent Rulemaking on the Accommodation andThird Interim Final Rules Final regulations issued on February 10, 2012, adopted the denition of \"reli- gious employer\" in the nal reg-ulations). 11(77 FR 8725). The exemption did not require religious employers to leany certication form or comply with anyother information collection process. Contemporaneous with the issuance of the 2012 nal regulations, HHS\u2014with theagreement of the Department of Labor(DOL) and the Department of the Trea-sury\u2014issued guidance establishing a tem-porary safe harbor from enforcement ofthe contraceptive coverage requirementby the Departments with respect to grouphealth plans established or maintained bycertain nonprot organizations with reli-gious objections to contraceptive cover-age (and the group health insurance cov-erage provided in connection with suchplans). 12The guidance provided that the temporary safe harbor would remain ineffect until the rst plan year beginning onor after August 1, 2013. The temporarysafe harbor did not apply to for-prot en-tities. The Departments stated that, duringthe temporary safe harbor, Depart-ments would engage in \"two goals\u2014providing contracep-tive accommodatingnon-exempted, nonprot objections to covering contra-ceptive services.\" (77 FR 8727). On March 21, 2012, the Departments published an advance notice of proposedrulemaking (ANPRM) that described pos-sible approaches to achieve those goalswith respect to religious nonprot organi-zations, and solicited public comments onthe same. (77 FR 16501). Following re-view of the comments on the ANPRM, theDepartments published proposed regula-tions on February 6, 2013 (2013 NPRM)(78 FR 8456). The 2013 NPRM proposed to expand the \"religious employer\" forpurposes of the religious employer ex-emption. Specically, it proposed to re-quire only that the religious employer beorganized and operate as a nonprot entityand be referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, eliminating therequirements that a religious employer (1)have the inculcation of religious values asits purpose, (2) primarily employ personswho share its religious tenets, and (3) pri-marily serve persons who share its reli-gious tenets. The 2013 NPRM also proposed to cre- ate a compliance process, which it calledan accommodation, for group health plansestablished, maintained, or arranged bycertain eligible religious nonprot organi-zations that fell outside the houses of wor-ship and integrated auxiliaries covered bysection 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of theCode (and, thus, outside of the religiousemployer exemption). The 2013 NPRMproposed to dene such eligible organiza-tions as nonprot entities that hold them-selves out as religious, oppose providingcoverage for certain contraceptive itemson account of religious objections, andmaintain a certication to this effect intheir records. The 2013 NPRM stated, without citing a supporting source, thatemployees of eligible organizations \"maybe less likely than\" employees of exempthouses of worship and integrated auxilia- ries to share their employer's faith andopposition to contraception on religiousgrounds. (78 FR 8461). The 2013 NPRMtherefore proposed that, in the case of aninsured group health plan established ormaintained by an eligible organization,the health insurance issuer providinggroup health insurance coverage in con-nection with the plan would provide con-traceptive coverage to plan participantsand beneciaries without cost sharing,premium, fee, or other charge to par-ticipants or beneciaries enrolled in theeligible organization's plan\u2014and withoutany cost to the eligible organization. 13In the case of a self-insured group healthplan established or maintained by an eli-gible organization, the 2013 NPRM pre-sented potential approaches under whichthe third party administrator of the planwould provide or arrange for contracep-tive coverage to plan participants and ben-eciaries. On August 15, 2012, the Departments also extended our temporary safe harboruntil the rst plan year beginning on orafter August 1, 2013. The Departments published nal regu- lations on July 2, 2013 (July 2013 nalregulations). (78 FR 39869). The July2013 nal regulations nalized the expan-sion of the exemption for houses of wor-ship and their integrated auxiliaries. Al-though some commenters had suggestedthat the exemption be further expanded,the Departments declined to adopt thatapproach. The July 2013 regulationsstated that, because employees of object-ing houses of worship and integrated aux-iliaries are relatively likely to oppose con-traception, exempting those organizations\"does not undermine the governmental in-terests furthered by the contraceptive cov-erage requirement.\" (78 FR 39874). But, like the 2013 NPRM, the July 2013 regu-lations assumed that \"[h]ouses of worshipand their integrated auxiliaries that object 10See, for example, Comments of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on Interim Final Rules on Preventive Services, File Code CMS-9992-IFC2 (Aug. 31, 2011). 11The 2012 nal regulations were published on February 15, 2012 (77 FR 8725). 12Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans, and Group Health Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing Under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, issued on February 10, 2012, and reissued on August 15, 2012. Available at: http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/12cv3932.pdf. The guidance,as reissued on August 15, 2012, claried, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, without success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coveragewere not precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor. The temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to insured student health insurance coverage arranged by nonprotinstitutions of higher education with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions set forth in the guidance. See nal rule entitled \"Student Health InsuranceCoverage\" published March 21, 2012 (77 FR 16457). 13The NPRM proposed to treat student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education in a similar manner. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 386to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than other em-ployers to employ people of the same faithwho share the same objection\" to contra-ceptives. (Id.) The July 2013 regulations also nal- ized an accommodation for eligible orga-nizations. Under the accommodation, aneligible organization was required to sub-mit a self-certication to its group healthinsurance issuer or third party administra-tor, as applicable. Upon receiving thatself-certication, the issuer or third partyadministrator would provide or arrangefor payments for the contraceptive ser-vices to the plan participants and bene-ciaries enrolled in the eligible organiza-tion's plan, without requiring any costsharing on the part of plan participantsand beneciaries and without cost to theeligible organization. With respect to self-insured plans, the third party administra-tors (or issuers they contracted with)could receive reimbursements by reducinguser fee payments (to Federally facilitatedExchanges) by the amounts paid out for contraceptive services under the accom-modation, plus an allowance for certainadministrative costs, as long as the Secre-tary of the Department of Health and Hu-man Services requests and an authorizingexception under OMB Circular No.A-25R is in effect. 14With respect to fully insured group health plans, the issuer wasexpected to bear the cost of such pay-ments, 15and HHS intended to clarify in guidance that the issuer could treat thosepayments as an adjustment to claims costsfor purposes of medical loss ratio and riskcorridor program calculations. With respect to self-insured group health plans, the July 2013 nal regula-tions specied that the self-certicationwas an instrument under which the planwas operated and that it obligated thethird party administrator to provide orarrange for contraceptive coverage byoperation of section 3(16) of ERISA.The regulations stated that, by submit-ting the self-certication form, the eli-gible organization \"complies\" with thecontraceptive coverage requirement anddoes not have to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. See,for example, Id. at 39874, 39896. Con-sistent with these statements, the De-partments, through the Department ofLabor, issued a self-certication form,EBSA Form 700. The form stated, inindented text labeled as a \"Notice toThird Party Administrators of Self-Insured Health Plans,\" that \"[t]he obli-gations of the third set in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A,29 CFR 2510.3-16, and 29 CFR2590.715-2713A\" and concluded, in un-indented text, that \"[t]his form is aninstrument under which the plan is op-erated.\" The Departments extended the tempo- rary safe harbor again on June 20, 2013, toencompass plan years beginning on or af-ter August 1, 2013, and before January 1,2014. The guidance extending the safeharbor included a form to be used by anorganization during this temporary periodto self-certify that its plan qualied for thetemporary safe harbor if no prior form hadbeen submitted. 4. Litigation Over the Mandate and the Accommodation Process During the period when the Depart- ments were publishing and modifying our regulations, organizations and individualsled dozens of lawsuits challenging theMandate. Plaintiffs included religiousnonprot organizations, businesses run byreligious families, individuals, and others.Religious plaintiffs principally argued thatthe Mandate violated the Religious Free-dom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) byforcing them to provide coverage or pay-ments for sterilization and contraceptiveservices, including what they viewed asearly abortifacient items, contrary to theirreligious beliefs. Based on this claim, inJuly 2012 a Federal district court issued apreliminary injunction barring the Depart-ments from enforcing the Mandate againsta business. 881 (D. Colo.2012). Multiple other courts proceededto issue similar injunctions against the Mandate, although a minority of courtsruled in the Departments' favor. Compare Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. Supp. 2d 106 (D.D.C. 2012),andThe Seneca Hardwood Com- v. Sebelius Geneva Coll. v. Sebelius), 941 F. Supp. 2d 672(W.D. Pa. 2013), with O'Brien v. U.S. Dep't Health & Human Servs., 894 F.Supp. 2d 1149 (E.D. Mo. 2012). A circuit split swiftly developed in cases led by religiously motivated for-prot businesses, to which neither the re-ligious employer exemption nor the eligi-ble organization accommodation (as thenpromulgated) applied. Several for-protbusinesses won rulings against the Man-date before the Unites States Court ofAppeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting enbanc, while similar rulings against the De-partments were issued by the Seventh andDistrict of Columbia (D.C.) Circuits.Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius (7th Cir. v. of Health & Human Servs. , 733 F.3d 1208 (D.C. Cir. 2013). The Third and Sixth Circuits disagreed withsimilar plaintiffs, and in November 2013the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorariinHobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary of U.S. De-partment of Health & Human Services , 724 F.3d 377 (3d Cir. 2013), to resolve thecircuit split. On June 30, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled against the Departments and heldthat, under RFRA, the Mandate could notbe applied to the closely held for-protcorporations before the Court becausetheir owners had religious objections toproviding such coverage. 16Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). The Court held that the \"contra-ceptive mandate 'substantially burdens'the exercise of religion\" as applied to em-ployers that object to providing contracep-tive coverage on religious grounds, andthat the plaintiffs were therefore entitledto an exemption unless the Mandate wasthe least restrictive means of furthering a 14See also 45 CFR 156.50. Under the regulations, if the third party administrator does not participate in a Federally facilitated Exchange as an issuer, it is permitted to contract with an insurer which does so participate, in order to obtain such reimbursement. The total contraceptive user fee adjustment for the 2015 benet year was $33 million. 15\"[P]roviding payments for contraceptive services is cost neutral for issuers.\" (78 FR 39877). 16The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-prot corporations. See 134 S. Ct. at 2774. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 387compelling governmental interest. Id.at 2775. The Court observed that, under the compelling interest test of RFRA, the De-partments could not rely on interests\"couched in very broad terms, such aspromoting 'public health' and 'genderequality,' but rather, had to demonstratethat a compelling interest was served byrefusing an exemption to the \"particularclaimant[s]\" seeking an exemption. Id.at 2779. Assuming without deciding that acompelling interest existed, the Court heldthat the Government's goal of guarantee-ing coverage for contraceptive methodswithout cost sharing could be achieved ina less restrictive manner. The C ourt ob- served that \"[t]he most straightforwardway of doing this would be for the Gov-ernment to assume the cost of providingthe four contraceptives at issue to anywomen who are unable to obtain themunder their health-insurance policiesdue to their employers' religious objec-tions.\" Id.at 2780. The Court also ob- served that the Departments had \"not provided any estimate of the averagecost per employee of providing access tothese contraceptives,\" nor \"any statisticsregarding the number of employees whomight be affected because they work forcorporations like Hobby Lobby, Cones-toga, and Mardel\". Id.at 2780-81. But the Court ultimately concluded that it\"need not rely on the option of a new,government-funded program in order toconclude that the HHS regulations failthe least-restrictive means test\" because\"HHS itself ha[d] demonstrated that itha[d] at its disposal an approach that isless restrictive than requiring employersto fund contraceptive methods that vio- late their religious beliefs.\" Id.at 2781-82. The Court explained that the \"already estab-lished\" accommodation process availableto nonprot organizations was a that \"serve[d] HHS'sstated interests equally well,\" although theCourt emphasized that its ruling did notdecide whether the accommodation process\"complie[d] with RFRA for purposes of allreligious claims\". Id.at 2788-82. Meanwhile, another plaintiff obtained temporary relief from the Supreme Courtin a case challenging the accommodationunder RFRA. Wheaton College, a Chris-tian liberal arts college in Illinois, ob-jected that the accommodation was a com-pliance process that rendered it complicit in delivering payments for abortifacientcontraceptive services to its employees.Wheaton College refused to execute theEBSA Form 700 required under the July2013 nal regulations. It was denied apreliminary injunction in the Federal dis-trict and appellate courts, and sought anemergency injunction pending appealfrom the Unites States Supreme Court onJune 30, 2014. On July 3, 2014, the Su-preme Court issued an interim order infavor of the College, stating that, \"[i]f the[plaintiff] informs the Secretary of Healthand Human Services in writing that it is anonprot organization that holds itself outas religious and has religious objections toproviding coverage for contraceptive ser-vices, the [Departments of Labor, Healthand Human Services, and the Treasury]are enjoined from enforcing [the Man-date] against the [plaintiff ]...pending disposition of . 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2807 (2014). The order stated thatWheaton College did not need to useEBSA Form 700 or send a copy of theexecuted form to its health insurance is-suers or third party administrators to meetthe condition for injunctive relief. Id. In response to this litigation, on August 27, 2014, the Departments simultaneouslyissued a third set of interim nal rules(August 2014 interim nal rules) (79 FR51092), and a notice of proposed rulemak-ing (August 2014 proposed rules) (79 FR51118). The August 2014 interim nalrules changed the accommodation processso that it could be initiated either by self-certication using EBSA Form 700 orthrough a notice informing the Secretaryof the Department of Health and HumanServices that an eligible organization hadreligious objections to coverage of all or asubset of contraceptive services. (79 FR 51092). In response to Hobby Lobby, the August 2014 proposed rules extended theaccommodation process to closely heldfor-prot entities with religious objectionsto contraceptive coverage, by includingthem in the denition of eligible organi-zations. (79 FR 51118). Neither the Au-gust 2014 interim nal rules nor the Au-gust 2014 proposed rules extended theexemption, and neither added a certica-tion requirement for exempt entities.In October 2014, based on an interpre- tation of the Supreme Court's interim or- der, HHS deemed Wheaton College ashaving submitted a sufcient notice toHHS. HHS conveyed that interpretation tothe DOL, so as to trigger the accommo-dation process. On July 14, 2015, the Departments - nalized both the August 2014 interim nalrules and the August 2014 proposed rulesin a set of nal regulations (the July 2015nal regulations) (80 FR 41318). (TheJuly 2015 nal regulations also encom-passed issues related to other preventiveservices coverage.) The preamble to theJuly 2015 nal regulations stated that,through the accommodation, payments forcontraceptives and sterilization would beprovided in a way that is \"seamless\" withthe coverage that eligible employers pro-vide to their plan participants and bene-ciaries. Id.at 41328. The July 2015 nal regulations allowed eligible organizationsto submit a notice to HHS as an alterna-tive to submitting the EBSA Form 700, but specied that such notice must includethe eligible organization's name and anexpression of its religious objection, alongwith the plan name, plan type, and nameand contact information for any of theplan's third party administrators or healthinsurance issuers. The Departments indi-cated that such information represents theminimum information necessary for us toadminister the accommodation process. When an eligible organization main- tains an insured group health plan or stu-dent health plan and provides the alterna-tive notice, the July 2015 nal regulationsprovide that HHS will inform the healthinsurance issuer of its obligations to covercontraceptive services to which the eligi-ble organization objects. Where an eligi-ble organization maintains a self-insuredplan under ERISA and provides the alter-native notice, the regulations provide thatDOL will work with HHS to send a sep-arate notication to the self-insured plan'sthird party administrator(s). The regula-tions further provide that such noticationis an instrument under which the plan isoperated for the purposes of section 3(16)of ERISA, and the instrument would des-ignate the third party administrator as theentity obligated to provide or arrange forpayments for contraceptives to which theeligible organization objects. The July October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 3882015 nal regulations continue to apply the amended notice requirement to eligi-ble organizations that sponsor churchplans exempt from ERISA pursuant tosection 4(b)(2) of ERISA, but acknowl-edge that, with respect to the operation ofthe accommodation process, section 3(16)of ERISA does not provide a mechanismto impose an obligation to provide contra-ceptive coverage as a plan administratoron those eligible organizations' third partyadministrators. (80 FR 41323). Meanwhile, a second split among Fed- eral appeals courts had developed involvingchallenges to the Mandate's accommoda-tion. Many religious nonprot organizationsargued that the accommodation impermissi-bly burdened their religious beliefs becauseit utilized the plans the organizations them-selves sponsored to provide services towhich they objected on religious grounds.They objected to the self-certication re-quirement on the same basis. Federal districtcourts split in the cases, granting prelimi-nary injunction motions to religious groups in the majority of cases, but denying them toothers. In most appellate cases, religiousnonprot organizations lost their challenges,where the courts often concluded that theaccommodation imposed no substantial bur-den on their religious exercise under RFRA.For example, Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 772 F. 3d 229(D.C. Cir. 2014); Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell , 794 F.3d of Health & Human Servs., 778F.3d 422 (3d Cir. 2015). But the EighthCircuit disagreed and ruled in favor of reli-gious nonprot employers. College v. Burwell, 801 F.3d 946, 949-50 (8th Cir.2015) (relying on Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 801F.3d 927 (8th Cir. 2015)). On November 6, 2015, the U.S. Su- preme Court granted certiorari in sevensimilar cases under the title of a lingfrom the Third Circuit, Zubik v. Burwell. The Court held oral argument on March23, 2016, and, after the argument, askedthe parties to submit supplemental briefsaddressing \"whether and how contracep-tive coverage may be obtained by peti-tioners' employees through petitioners'insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of peti-tioners beyond their own decision to pro-vide health insurance without contracep-tive coverage to their employees\". In abrief led with the Supreme Court onApril 12, 2016, the Government stated onbehalf of the Departments that the accom-modation process for eligible organiza-tions with insured plans could operatewithout any self-certication or writtennotice being submitted by eligible organi-zations. On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam opinion in Zubik, va- cating the judgments of the Courts of Ap-peals and remanding the cases \"in light ofthe substantial clarication and renementin the positions of the parties\" in theirsupplemental briefs. (136 S. Ct. 1557,1560 (2016).) The Court stated that it an-ticipated that, on remand, the Courts ofAppeals would \"allow the parties suf-cient time to resolve any outstanding is-sues between them.\" Id.The Court also specied that \"the Government may notimpose taxes or penalties on petitionersfor failure to provide the relevant notice\"while the cases remained pending. Id.at 1561. After remand, as indicated by the De- partments in court lings, some meetingswere held between attorneys for the Gov-ernment and for the plaintiffs in thosecases. Separately, at various times afterthe Supreme Court's remand order, HHSand DOL sent letters to the issuers andthird party administrators of certain plain-tiffs in Zubik and other pending cases, directing the issuers and third party ad-ministrators to provide contraceptive cov-erage for participants in those plaintiffs'group health plans under the accommoda-tion. The Departments also issued a Re-quest for Information (RFI) on July 26,2016, seeking public comment on optionsfor modifying the accommodation processin light of the supplemental brieng and the Supreme Court's remand order. (81 FR 47741). Public commentswere submitted in response to the RFI,during a comment period that closed onSeptember 20, 2016.On December 20, 2016, HRSA up- dated the Guidelines via its website, https://www.hrsa.gov/wom ensguidelines 2016/index.html. HRSA announced that, for plans subject to the Guidelines, the up-dated Guidelines would apply to the rstplan year beginning after December 20,2017. Among other changes, the updatedGuidelines specied that the required con-traceptive coverage includes follow-up care(for example, management and evaluation,as well as changes to, and removal or dis-continuation of, the contraceptive method).They also specied that coverage shouldinclude instruction in fertility awareness-based methods for women desiring an alter-native method of family planning. HRSAstated that, with the input of a committeeoperating under a cooperative agreement,HRSA would review and periodically up-date the Women's Preventive Services'Guidelines. The updated Guidelines did notalter the religious employer exemption oraccommodation process. On January 9, 2017, the Departments issued a document entitled, \"FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation Part36\" (FAQ). 17The FAQ stated that, after reviewing comments submitted in re-sponse to the 2016 RFI and consideringvarious options, the Departments couldnot nd a way at that time to amend theaccommodation so as to satisfy objectingeligible organizations while pursuing theDepartments' policy goals. Thus, the liti-gation on remand from the Supreme Courtremains unresolved. A separate category of unresolved liti- gation involved religious employees asplaintiffs. For example, in two cases, theplaintiff-employees work for a nonprotorganization that agrees with the employ-ees (on moral grounds) in opposing cov-erage of certain contraceptives they be-lieve to be abortifacient, and that iswilling to offer them insurance coveragethat omits such services. See March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116(D.D.C. 2015); Real Alternatives, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419, afrmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017). In another case, theplaintiff-employees work for a State gov-ernment entity that the employees claim iswilling, under State law, to provide a plan 17Available at: https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/les/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-36.pdf and contraception consistent with the employees' religious beliefs. HHS, 196 F. Supp. 3d 1010 (E.D. Mo.2016). Those and similar employee-plaintiffs generally contend that the Man-date violates their rights under RFRA bymaking it impossible for them to obtainhealth insurance consistent with their re-ligious beliefs, either from their willingemployer or in the individual market, be-cause the Departments offer no exemp-tions encompassing either circumstance.Such challenges have seen mixed success.Compare, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1020 (concluding that theMandate violates the employee plaintiffs'rights under RFRA and permanently en-joining the Departments) and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 133-34 (same),with Real employeeplaintiffs' RFRA On May 4, 2017, the President issued an \"Executive Order Promoting FreeSpeech and Religious Liberty.\" Regarding\"Conscience Protections with Respect toPreventive-Care Mandate,\" that order in- structs \"[t]he Secretary of the Treasury,the Secretary of Labor, and the Secre-tary of Health and Human Services [to]consider issuing amended regulations,consistent with applicable law, to ad-dress conscience-based objections to thepreventive-care mandate promulgatedunder section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42,United States Code.\" II. RFRA and Government Interests Underlying the Mandate RFRA provides that the Government \"shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burdenresults from a rule of general applicabil-ity\" unless the Government \"demonstratesthat application of the burden to the per-son\u2014(1) is in furtherance of a compellinggovernmental interest; and (2) is the leastrestrictive means of furthering that com-pelling governmental interest.\" 42 U.S.C.2000bb-1(a) and (b). In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court had \"little trouble conclud- ing\" that, in the absence of an or exemption, \"the HHS contraceptivemandate 'substantially Ct. at 2775. And although the Su-preme Court did not resolve the RFRAclaims presented in Zubik on their merits, it instructed the parties to consider alternative accommodations for the objecting plaintiffs,after the Government suggested that suchalternatives might be possible. Despite multiple rounds of rulemaking, however, the Departments have not as-suaged the sincere religious objections tocontraceptive coverage of numerous organi-zations, nor have we resolved the pendinglitigation. To the contrary, the Departmentshave been litigating RFRA challenges to theMandate and related regulations for morethan 5 years, and dozens of those challengesremain pending today. That litigation, andthe related modications to the accommo-dation, have consumed substantial govern-mental resources while creating uncertaintyfor objecting organizations, issuers, thirdparty administrators, employees, and bene-ciaries. Consistent with the President's Ex-ecutive Order and the Government's desireto resolve the pending litigation and preventfuture litigation from similar plaintiffs, theDepartments have concluded that it is ap- propriate to reexamine the exemption andaccommodation scheme currently in placefor the Mandate. These interim nal rules (and the com- panion interim nal rules published else-where in this Federal Register) are the result of that reexamination. The Depart-ments acknowledge that coverage of con-traception is an important and highly sen-sitive issue, implicating many differentviews, as reflected in the comments re-ceived on multiple rulemakings over thecourse of implementation of section2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act. After recon-sidering the interests served by the Man-date in this particular context, the objec-tions raised, and the applicable Federallaw, the Departments have determinedthat an expanded exemption, rather thanthe existing accommodation, is the mostappropriate administrative response to thereligious objections raised by certain en-tities and organizations concerning theMandate. The Departments have accord-ingly decided to revise the regulationschanneling HRSA authority under section2713(a)(4) of the PHS to provide an ex-emption from the Mandate to a broaderrange of entities and individuals that ob-ject to contraceptive coverage on religiousgrounds, while continuing to offer the ex-isting accommodation as an optional al-ternative. The Departments have also de- cided to create a process by which awilling employer and issuer may allow anobjecting individual employee to obtainhealth coverage without contraceptive cov-erage. These interim nal rules leaveunchanged HRSA's authority to decidewhether to include contraceptives in thewomen's preventive services Guidelines forentities that are not exempted by law, reg-ulation, or the Guidelines. These rulesalso do not change the many other mech-anisms by which the Government ad-vances contraceptive coverage, particu-larly for low-income women. In addition to relying on the text of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act and theDepartments' discretion to promulgaterules to carry out the provisions of thePHS Act, the Departments also draw onCongress' decision in the Affordable CareAct neither to specify that contraceptionmust be covered nor to require inflexibleacross-the-board application of section2713 of the PHS Act. The Departments further consider Congress' extensive his-tory of protecting religious objectionswhen certain matters in health care arespecically regulated\u2014often specicallywith respect to contraception, steriliza-tion, abortion, and activities connected toabortion. Notable among the many statutes (listed in footnote 1 in Section I-Background) thatinclude protections for religious beliefs are,not only the Church Amendments, but alsoprotections for health plans or health careorganizations in Medicaid or Medicare Ad-vantage to object \"on moral or religiousgrounds\" to providing coverage of certaincounseling or referral services. (42 U.S.C.1395w-22(j)(3)(B); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3)). In addition, Congress has protectedindividuals who object to prescribing or pro-viding contraceptives contrary to their reli-gious beliefs. Consolidated AppropriationsAct of 2017, Division C, Title VII, Sec.726(c) (Financial Services and GeneralGovernment Appropriations Act), Pub. L.No. 115-31 (May 5, 2017). Congress like-wise provided that, if the District of Colum-bia requires \"the provision of contraceptivecoverage by health insurance plans,\" \"it isthe intent of Congress that any legislationenacted on such issue should include a 'con-science clause' which provides exceptionsfor religious beliefs and moral convictions\". October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 390Id. at Division C, Title VIII, Sec. 808. In light of the fact that Congress did not re-quire HRSA to include contraception inGuidelines issued under section 2713 of thePHS Act, we consider it signicant, in sup-port of the implementation of those Guide-lines by the expanded exemption in theseinterim nal rules, that Congress' most re-cent statement on the prospect of Govern-ment mandated contraceptive coverage wasto express the specic intent that a con-science clause be provided and that it shouldprotect religious beliefs. The Departments' authority to guide HRSA's discretion in determining thescope of any contraceptive coverage re-quirement under section 2713(a)(4) of thePHS Act includes the authority to provideexemptions and independently justiesthis rulemaking. The Departments havealso determined that requiring certain ob-jecting entities or individuals to choosebetween the Mandate, the accommoda-tion, or penalties for noncompliance vio-lates their rights under RFRA. A.Elements of RFRA 1. Substantial Burden The Departments believe that agencies charged with administering a statute or associated regulations or guidance thatimposes a substantial burden on the exer-cise of religion under RFRA have discre-tion in determining how to avoid the im-position of such burden. The Departmentshave previously contended that the Man-date does not impose a substantial burdenon entities and individuals. With respectto the coverage Mandate itself, apart fromthe accommodation, and as applied to en-tities with religious objections, our argu-ment was rejected in Hobby Lobby, which held that the Mandate imposes a substan-tial burden. (134 S. Ct. at 2775-79.) Withrespect to whether the Mandate imposes asubstantial burden on entities that maychoose the accommodation, but mustchoose between the accommodation, theMandate, or penalties for noncompliance,a majority of Federal appeals courts haveheld that the accommodation does not im-pose a substantial burden on such entities(mostly religious nonprot entities). The Departments have reevaluated our position on this question, however, inlight of all the arguments made in various cases, public comments that have beensubmitted, and the concerns discussedthroughout these rules. We have con-cluded that requiring certain objecting en-tities or individuals to choose between theMandate, the accommodation, or penal- ties for noncompliance imposes a sub-stantial burden on religious exercise un-der RFRA. We believe that the Court'sanalysis in Hobby Lobby extends, for the purposes of analyzing a substantial burden, to the burdens that an entityfaces when it religiously opposes partic-ipating in the accommodation process orthe straightforward Mandate, and is sub-ject to penalties or disadvantages thatapply in this context if it chooses nei-ther. As the Eighth Circuit stated inSharpe Holdings , \"[i]n light of [non- prot religious organizations'] sincerelyheld religious beliefs, we conclude thatcompelling their participation in the ac-commodation process by threat of se-vere monetary penalty is a substantialburden on their exercise of religion. . ..That they themselves do not have toarrange or pay for objectionable contra-ceptive coverage is not determinative ofwhether the required or forbidden act isor is not religiously offensive\". (801F.3d at 942.) Our reconsideration of these issues has also led us to conclude, consistent with therulings in favor of religious employeeplaintiffs in Wieland andMarch for Life cited above, that the Mandate imposes asubstantial burden on the religious beliefsof individual employees who oppose con-traceptive coverage and would be able toobtain a plan that omits contraceptionfrom a willing employer or issuer (as ap-plicable), but cannot obtain one solely be-cause of the Mandate's prohibition on thatemployer and/or issuer providing them with such a plan. Consistent with our conclusion earlier this year after the remand of cases in Zu- bikand our reviewing of comments sub- mitted in response to the 2016 RFI, theDepartments believe there is not a way tosatisfy all religious objections by amend-ing the accommodation. Accordingly, theDepartments have decided it is necessaryand appropriate to provide the expandedexemptions set forth herein.2. Compelling Interest Although the Departments previously took the position that the application of the Mandate to certain objecting employ-ers was necessary to serve a compellinggovernmental interest, the Departmentshave now concluded, after reassessing therelevant interests and for the reasonsstated below, that it does not. Under suchcircumstances, the Departments are re-quired by law to alleviate the substantialburden created by the Mandate. Here, in- formed by the Departments' reassessmentof the relevant interests, as well as by ourdesire to bring to a close the more than 5years of litigation over RFRA challengesto the Mandate, the Departments have de-termined that the appropriate administra-tive response is to create a broader exemp-tion, rather than simply adjusting theaccommodation process. RFRA requires the Government to re- spect religious beliefs under \"the mostdemanding test known to constitutionallaw\": where the Government imposes asubstantial burden on religious exercise, itmust demonstrate a compelling govern-mental interest and show that the law orrequirement is the least restrictive meansof furthering that interest. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 534 (1997). Foran interest to be compelling, its rank mustbe of the \"highest order\". Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hia-leah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993); see alsoSherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 406-09(1963); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 221-29 (1972). In applying RFRA, theSupreme Court has \"looked beyondbroadly formulated interests justifying thegeneral applicability of government man-dates and scrutinized the asserted harm ofgranting specic exemptions to claimants.\" , 546 U.S. To justify asubstantial burden on religious exerciseunder RFRA, the Government must show it has a compelling interest in applying therequirement to the \"particular claimant[s]whose sincere exercise of religion is beingsubstantially burdened.\" Moreover, the Government must meet the\"exceptionally least-restrictive-means standard. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. Under that standard, the Government Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 391must establish that \"it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposinga substantial burden on the exercise of reli-gion by the objecting parties.\" Id. Upon further examination of the rele- vant provisions of the Affordable CareAct and the administrative record onwhich the Mandate was based, the Depart-ments have concluded that the applicationof the Mandate to entities with sincerelyheld religious objections to it does notserve a compelling governmental interest.The Departments have reached that con-clusion for multiple reasons, no one ofwhich is dispositive. First, Congress did not mandate that contraception be covered at all under theAffordable Care Act. Instead, Congressmerely provided for coverage of \"suchadditional preventive care and screenings\"for women \"provided for in comprehen-sive guidelines supported by [HRSA].\"Congress, thus, left the identication ofany additional required preventive ser-vices for women to administrative discre- tion. The fact that Congress granted theDepartments the authority to promulgateall rules appropriate and necessary for theadministration of the relevant provisionsof the Code, ERISA, and the PHS Act,including by channeling the discretionCongress afforded to HRSA to decidewhether to require contraceptive cover-age, indicates that the Departments' judg-ment should carry particular weight inconsidering the relative importance of theGovernment's interest in applying theMandate to the narrow population of en-tities exempted in these rules. Second, while Congress specied that many health insurance requirementsadded by the Affordable Care Act\u2014in-cluding provisions adjacent to section2713 of the PHS Act\u2014were so importantthat they needed to be applied to all healthplans immediately, the preventive ser-vices requirement in section 2713 of thePHS Act was not made applicable to\"grandfathered plans.\" That feature of theAffordable Care Act is signicant: ascited above, seven years after the Afford-able Care Act's enactment, approximately25.5 million people are estimated to beenrolled in grandfathered plans not sub-ject to section 2713 of the PHS Act. Wedo not suggest that a requirement that isinapplicable to grandfathered plans or oth-erwise subject to exceptions could never qualify as a serving a compelling interestunder RFRA. For example, \"[e]ven acompelling interest may be outweighed insome circumstances by another evenweightier consideration.\" Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. But Congress' decisionnot to apply section 2713 of the PHS Actto grandfathered plans, while deemingother requirements closely associated inthe same statute as sufciently importantto impose immediately, is relevant to ourassessment of the importance of the Gov-ernment interests served by the Mandate.As the Departments observed in immediately that category informs the Departments' assessment ofthe weight of the Government's interest inapplying the Guidelines issued pursuant tosection 2713 of the PHS Act to religiousobjectors. Third, various entities that brought le- gal challenges to the Mandate (including some of the largest employers) have beenwilling to provide coverage of some,though not all, contraceptives. For exam-ple, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were willing to provide coverage with no costsharing of 14 of 18 FDA-approved wom-en's contraceptive and sterilization meth-ods. (134 S. Ct. at 2766.) With respect toorganizations and entities holding thosebeliefs, the fact that they are willing toprovide coverage for various contracep-tive methods signicantly detracts fromthe government interest in requiring thatthey provide coverage for other contra-ceptive methods to which they object. Fourth, the case for a compelling inter- est is undermined by the existing accom-modation process, and how it applies tocertain similarly situated entities based onwhether or not they participate in certainself-insured group health plans, known aschurch plans, under applicable law. TheDepartments previously exempted eligibleorganizations from the contraceptive cov-erage requirement, and created an accom-modation under which those organizations bore no obligation to provide for such cov-erage after submitting a self-certication ornotice. Where a non-exempt religious orga-nization uses an insured group health planinstead of a self-insured church plan, thehealth insurance issuer would be obliged to provide contraceptive coverage or paymentsto the plan's participants under the accom-modation. Even in a self-insured churchplan context, the preventive services re-quirement in section 2713(a)(4) of the PHSAct applies to the plan, and through theCode, to the religious organization thatsponsors the plan. But under the accommo-dation, once a self-insured church plan lesa self-certication or notice, the accommo-dation relieves it of any further obligationwith respect to contraceptive services cov-erage. Having done so, the accommodationprocess would normally transfer the obliga-tion to provide or arrange for contraceptivecoverage to a self-insured plan's third partyadministrator (TPA). But the Departmentslack authority to compel church plan TPAsto provide contraceptive coverage or levynes against those TPAs for failing to pro-vide it. This is because church plans areexempt from ERISA pursuant to section4(b)(2) of ERISA. Section 2761(a) of thePHS Act provides that States may enforce the provisions of title XXVII of the PHSAct as they pertain to issuers, but not as theypertain to church plans that do not providecoverage through a policy issued by a healthinsurance issuer. The combined result ofPHS Act section 2713's authority to removecontraceptive coverage obligations fromself-insured church plans, and HHS's andDOL's lack of authority under the PHS Actor ERISA to require TPAs to become ad-ministrators of those plans to provide suchcoverage, has led to signicant incongruityin the requirement to provide contraceptivecoverage among nonprot organizationswith religious objections to the coverage. More specically, issuers and third party administrators for some, but not all,religious nonprot organizations are sub-ject to enforcement for failure to providecontraceptive coverage under the accom-modation, depending on whether they par- ticipate in a self-insured church plan. Nota-bly, many of those nonprot organizationsare not houses of worship or integratedauxiliaries. Under section 3(33)(C)(iv) ofERISA, many organizations in self-insuredchurch plans need not be churches, but canmerely \"share[] common religious bondsand convictions with [a] church or conven-tion or association of churches\". The effectis that many similar religious organizationsare being treated very differently with re- October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 392spect to their employees receiving contra- ceptive coverage\u2014depending on whetherthe organization is part of a church plan\u2014even though the Departments claimed acompelling interest to deny exemptions toall such organizations. In this context, thefact that the Mandate and the Departments'application thereof \"leaves appreciabledamage to [their] supposedly vital interestunprohibited\" is strong evidence that theMandate \"cannot be regarded as protectingan interest 'of the highest order.\" Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 520 (citation and quotationmarks omitted). Fifth, the Departments' previous asser- tion that the exemption for houses of wor-ship was offered to respect a certainsphere of church autonomy (80 FR 41325)does not adequately explain some of thedisparate results of the existing rules. Andthe desire to respect church autonomy isnot grounds to prevent the Departmentsfrom expanding the exemption to other religious entities. The Departments previ-ously treated religious organizations thatoperate in a similar fashion very differ-ently for the purposes of the Mandate.For example, the Departments exemptedhouses of worship and integrated auxilia-ries that may conduct activities, such asthe operating of schools, that are also con-ducted by non-exempt religious nonprotorganizations. Likewise, among religiousnonprot groups that were not exempt ashouses of worship or integrated auxilia-ries, many operate their religious activitiessimilarly even if they differ in whetherthey participate in self-insured churchplans. As another example, two religiouscolleges might have the same level ofreligiosity and commitment to denedideals, but one might identify with a spe-cic large denomination and choose to bein a self-insured church plan offered bythat denomination, while another mightnot be so associated or might not have asready access to a church plan and so mightoffer its employees a fully insured healthplan. Under the accommodation, employ-ees of the college using a fully insuredplan (or a self-insured plan that is not achurch plan) would receive coverage of contraceptive services without cost shar-ing, while employees of the college par-ticipating in the self-insured church planwould not receive the coverage where thatplan required its third party administratorto not offer the coverage. As the Supreme Court recently con- rmed, a self-insured church plan exemptfrom ERISA through ERISA 3(33) caninclude a plan that is not actually estab-lished or maintained by a church or by aconvention or association of churches, butis maintained by \"an organizatio n...t h e principal purpose or function of which isthe administration or funding of a plan orprogram for the provision of retirementbenets or welfare benets, or both, forthe employees of a church or a conventionor association of churches, if such organi-zation is controlled by or associated with achurch or a convention or association ofchurches\" (a so-called \"principal-purpose organization\"). See Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton, 137 S. Ct. 1652,1656-57 (U.S. June 5, 2017); ERISA3(33)(C). While the Departments take noview on the status of these particularplans, the Departments acknowledge thatthe church plan exemption not only in-cludes some non-houses-of-worship as or-ganizations whose employees can be cov-ered by the plan, but also, in certaincircumstances, may include plans that arenot themselves established and main-tained by houses of worship. Yet, suchentities and plans\u2014if they le a self-certication or notice through the existingaccommodation\u2014are relieved of obliga-tions under the contraceptive Mandate andtheir third party administrators are notsubject to a requirement that they providecontraceptive coverage to their plan par-ticipants and beneciaries. After considering the differential treat- ment of various religious nonprot orga-nizations under the previous accommoda-tion, the Departments conclude that it isappropriate to expand the exemption toother religious nonprot organizationswith sincerely held religious beliefs op-posed to contraceptive coverage. We also conclude that it is not appropriate to limitthe scope of a religious exemption by re-lying upon a small minority of State lawsthat contain narrow exemptions that focuson houses of worship and integrated aux-iliaries. (76 FR 46623.) Sixth, the Government's interest in en- suring contraceptive coverage for employ-ees of particular objecting employers isundermined by the characteristics of manyof those employers, especially nonprotemployers. The plaintiffs challenging theexisting accommodation include, amongother organizations, religious colleges anduniversities, and religious orders that pro-vide health care or other charitable ser-vices. Based in part on our experiencelitigating against such organizations, theDepartments now disagree with our pre-vious assertion that \"[h]ouses of worshipand their integrated auxiliaries that objectto contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than other em-ployers to employ people of the same faithwho share the same objection.\" 18(78 FR 39874.) Although empirical data was notrequired to reach our previous conclusion,we note that the conclusion was not sup-ported by any specic data or othersource, but instead was intended to be areasonable assumption. Nevertheless, inthe litigation and in numerous public com-ments submitted throughout the regula-tory processes described above, manyreligious nonprot organizations have in-dicated that they possess deep religiouscommitments even if they are not housesof worship or their integrated auxiliaries.Some of the religious nonprot groupschallenging the accommodation claim thattheir employees are required to adhere to astatement of faith which includes the en-tities' views on certain contraceptiveitems. 19The Departments recognize, of course, that not all of the plaintiffs chal-lenging the accommodation require all oftheir employees (or covered students) toshare their religious objections to contra-ceptives. At the same time, it has becomeapparent from public comments and from 18In changing its position, an agency \"need not demonstrate to a court's satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the old one; it sufces that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.\" FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). 19See, for example, Geneva College v. Sebelius, 929 F. Supp. 2d 402, 411 (W.D. Schools v. 988 F. Supp. 2d 935, 943 (N.D. Ind. 2013); Comments of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities, re: CMS-9968-P (led Apr. 8, 2013) (\"On behalf of [] 172 higher education institutions. . .a requirement for membership in the CCCU is that full-time administrators and faculty at our institutions share the Christian faith of the institution.\"). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 393court lings in of cases\u2014encom- passing hundreds of organizations\u2014thatmany religious nonprot organizationsexpress their beliefs publicly and holdthemselves out as organizations for whomtheir religious beliefs are vitally impor-tant. Employees of such organizations,even if not required to sign a statement offaith, often have access to, and knowledgeof, the views of their employers on con-traceptive coverage, whether through theorganization's published mission state-ment or statement of beliefs, through em-ployee benets disclosures and othercommunications with employees and pro-spective employees, or through publiclyled lawsuits objecting to providing suchcoverage and attendant media coverage.In many cases, the employees of religiousorganizations will have chosen to workfor those organizations with an under-standing\u2014explicit or implicit\u2014that theywere being employed to advance the or-ganization's goals and to be respectful ofthe organization's beliefs even if they donot share all of those beliefs. Religiousnonprot organizations that engage in ex-pressive activity generally have a FirstAmendment right of expressive associationand religious free exercise to choose to hirepersons (or, in the case of students, to admitthem) based on whether they share, or atleast will be respectful of, their beliefs. 20 Given the sincerely held religious be- liefs of many religious organizations, imposing the contraceptive-coverage re-quirement on those that object based onsuch beliefs might undermine the Govern-ment's broader interests in ensuring healthcoverage by causing the entities to stopproviding health coverage. For example,because the Affordable Care Act does notrequire institutions of higher education toarrange student coverage, some institutionsof higher education that object to the Man-date appear to have chosen to stop arrangingstudent plans rather than comply with the Mandate or be subject to the accommoda-tion with respect to such populations. 21 Seventh, we now believe the adminis- trative record on which the Mandate restsis insufcient to meet the high thresholdto establish a compelling governmentalinterest in ensuring that women coveredby plans of objecting organizations re-ceive cost-free contraceptive coveragethrough those plans. To begin, in supportof the IOM's recommendations, whichHRSA adopted, the IOM identied sev-eral studies showing a preventive servicesgap because women require more preven-tive care than men. (IOM 2011 at 19-21).Those studies did not identify contracep-tives or sterilization as composing a spe-cic portion of that gap, and the IOM didnot consider or establish in the reportwhether any cost associated with that gapremains after all other women's preven-tive services are covered without cost-sharing. Id. Even without knowing what the empirical data would show about thatgap, the coverage of the other women'spreventive services required under boththe HRSA Guidelines and throughout sec-tion 2713(a) of the PHS Act\u2014includingannual well-woman visits and a variety oftests, screenings, and counseling servic-es\u2014serves at a minimum to diminish thecost gap identied by IOM for women whose employers decline to cover some orall contraceptives on religious grounds. 22 Moreover, there are multiple Federal, State, and local programs that provide freeor subsidized contraceptives for low-income women. Such Federal programsinclude, among others, Medicaid (with a90 percent Federal m atch for family plan- ning services), Title X, community healthcenter grants, and Temporary Assistance forNeedy Families. According to the Guttm-acher Institute, government-subsidized fam-ily planning services are provided at 8,409health centers overall. 23The Title X pro- gram, for example, administered by the HHS Ofce of Population Affairs (OPA),provides a wide variety of voluntary familyplanning information and services for cli-ents based on their ability to pay, through anetwork that includes nearly 4,000 familyplanning centers. http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/ Individuals withfamily incomes at or below the HHS pov-erty guideline (for 2017, $24,600 for a fam-ily of four in the 48 contiguous States andthe District of Columbia) receive services atno charge unless a third party (governmentalor private) is authorized or obligated to payfor these services. Individuals with incomesin excess of 100 percent up to 250 percent ofthe poverty guideline are charged for ser-vices using a sliding fee scale based onfamily size and income. Unemancipated mi-nors seeking condential services are as-sessed fees based on their own income levelrather than their family's income. The avail-ability of such programs to serve the mostat-risk women (as dened in the IOM re-port) diminishes the Government's interestin applying the Mandate to objecting em-ployers. Many forms of contraception areavailable for around $50 per month, includ- ing long-acting methods such as thebirth control shot and intrauterine de-vices (IUDs). 24Other, more permanent forms of contraception like implantables bear a higher one-time cost, but whencalculated over the duration of use, costa similar amount. 25Various State pro- grams supplement the Federal programsreferenced above, and 28 States havetheir own mandates of contraceptivecoverage as a matter of State law. Thisexisting inter-governmental structurefor obtaining contraceptives signi-cantly diminishes the Government's in-terest in applying the Mandate to em-ployers over their sincerely heldreligious objections. 20Notably, \"the First Amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group's policy to be 'expressive association.'\" Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 655 (2000). 21See, for example, Manya Brachear Pashman, \"Wheaton College ends coverage amid ght against birth control mandate,\" Chicago Tribune (July 29, 2015); Laura Bassett, \"Franciscan University Drops Entire Student Health Insurance Plan Over Birth Control Mandate,\" HuffPost (May 15, 2012). 22The Departments are not aware of any objectors to the contraceptive Mandate that are unwilling to cover any of the other preventive services without cost sharing as required by PHS Act section 2713. 23\"Facts on Publicly Funded Contraceptive Services in the United States,\" March 2016. 24See, for example, Caroline Cunningham, \"How Much Will Your Birth Control Cost Once the Affordable Care Act Is Repealed?\" Washingtonian (Jan. 17, 2017), available at https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/01/17/how-much-will-your-birth-control-cost-once-the-affordable-care-act-is-repealed/; also, see https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth- control. 25Id. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 394The record also does not reflect that the Mandate is tailored to the women most likely to experience unintended preg-nancy, identied by the 2011 IOM reportas \"women who are aged 18 to 24 yearsand unmarried, who have a low income,who are not high school graduates, andwho are members of a racial or ethnicminority\". (IOM 2011 at 102). For exam-ple, with respect to religiously objectingorganizations, the Mandate applies inemployer-based group health plans andstudent insurance at private colleges and universities. It is not clear that applyingthe Mandate among those objecting enti-ties is a narrowly tailored way to benetthe most at-risk population. The entitiesappear to encompass some such women,but also appear to omit many of them andto include a signicantly larger cross-section of women as employees or planparticipants. At the same time, the Man-date as applied to objecting employersappears to encompass a relatively smallpercentage of the number of women im-pacted by the Mandate overall, since mostemployers do not appear to have consci-entious objections to the Mandate. 26The Guttmacher Institute, on which the IOMrelied, further reported that 89 percent ofwomen who are at risk of unintendedpregnancy and are living at 0 through 149percent of the poverty line are alreadyusing contraceptives, as are 92 percent of those with incomes of 300 percent ormore of the Federal poverty level. 27 The rates of\u2014and reasons for\u2014unin- tended pregnancy are notoriously difcultto measure. 28In particular, association and causality can be hard to disentangle,and the studies referred to by the 2011IOM Report speak more to associationthan causality. For example, IOM 2011references Boonstra, et al. (2006), as nd-ing that, \"as the rate of contraceptive useby unmarried women increased in theUnited States between 1982 and 2002, rates of unintended pregnancy and abortionfor unmarried women also declined,\" 29and Santelli and Melnikas as nding that \"in-creased rates of contraceptive use by ado-lescents from the early 1990s to the early2000s was associated with a decline in teenpregnancies and that periodic increases inthe teen pregnancy rate are associated withlower rates of contraceptive use\". IOM 2011at 105. 30In this respect, the report does not show that access to contraception causesdecreased incidents of unintended preg-nancy, because both of the assertions rely onassociation rather than causation, and theyassociate reduction in unintended pregnancywith increased use of contraception, notmerely with increased access to such con-traceptives.Similarly, in a study involving over 8,000 women between 2012 and 2015, conducted to determine whether contra-ceptive coverage under the Mandatechanged contraceptive use patterns, theGuttmacher Institute concluded that \"[w]eobserved no changes in contraceptive usepatterns among sexually active women.\" 31 With respect to teens, the Santelli andMelnikas study cited by IOM 2011 ob-serves that, between 1960 and 1990, ascontraceptive use increased, teen sexualactivity outside of marriage likewise in- creased (although the study does notassert a causal relationship). 32Another study, which proposed an economicmodel for the decision to engage in sexualactivity, stated that \"[p]rograms that in-crease access to contraception are foundto decrease teen pregnancies in the shortrun but increase teen pregnancies in thelong run.\" 33Regarding emergency ception in particular, \"[i]ncreased accessto emergency contraceptive pills enhancesuse but has not been shown to reduceunintended pregnancy rates.\" 34In the lon- ger term\u2014from 1972 through 2002\u2014while the percentage of sexually experi-enced women who had ever used someform of contraception rose to 98 per-cent, 35unintended pregnancy rates in the Unites States rose from 35.4 percent36to 49 percent.\"37The Departments note 26Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act approximately 6 percent of employer survey respondents did not offer contraceptive coverage, with 31 percent of respondents not knowing whether they offered such coverage Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2010 Annual Survey\" at 196, available at https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.les.wordpress.com/2013/04/8085.pdf. It is not clear whether the minority of employers who did not cover contraception refrained from doing so forconscientious reasons or for other reasons. Estimates of the number of women who might be impacted by the exemptions offered in these rules, as compared to the total number of womenwho will likely continue to receive contraceptive coverage, is discussed in more detail below. 27\"Contraceptive Use in the United States,\" September 2016. 28The IOM 2011 Report reflected this when it cited the IOM's own 1995 report on unintended pregnancy, \"The Best Intentions\" (IOM 1995). IOM 1995 identies various methodological difculties in demonstrating the interest in reducing unintended pregnancies by means of a coverage mandate in employer plans. These include: the ambiguity of intent as an evidence-basedmeasure (does it refer to mistimed pregnancy or unwanted pregnancy, and do studies make that distinction?); \"the problem of determining parental attitudes at conception\" and inaccuratemethods often used for that assessment, such as \"to use the request for an abortion as a marker\"; and the overarching problem of \"association versus causality,\" that is, whether intent causescertain negative outcomes or is merely correlated with them.

Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 395these and other studies38to observe the complexity and uncertainty in the rela- tionship between contraceptive access,contraceptive use, and unintended preg-nancy. Contraception's association with posi- tive health effects might also be partiallyoffset by an association with negativehealth effects. In 2013 the National Insti-tutes of Health indicated, in funding op-portunity announcement for the develop-ment of new clinically useful femalecontraceptive products, that \"hormonalcontraceptives have the disadvantage ofhaving many undesirable side effects[,]are associated with adverse events, andobese women are at higher risk for seriouscomplications such as deep venous throm-bosis.\" 39In addition, IOM 2011 stated that \"[I]ong-term use of oral contracep-tives has been shown to reduce a woman'srisk of endometrial cancer, as well as pro-tect against pelvic inflammatory diseaseand some benign breast diseases (PRB,1998). The Agency for Healthcare Re-search and Quality (AHRQ) is currentlyundertaking a systematic evidence review to evaluate the effectiveness of oral con-traceptives as primary prevention forovarian cancer (AHRQ, 2011).\" (IOM2011 at 107). However, after IOM 2011made this statement, AHRQ (a componentof HHS) completed its systematic evi-dence review. 40Based on its review, AHRQ stated users\"; \"[t]he risk of cervical cancer was signicantly in-creased in women with persistent humanpapillomavirus infection who used OCs,but heterogeneity prevented a formalmeta-analysis\"; \"[i]ncidences bothcolorectal cancer can-cer reduced by OCuse\"; \"[t]he events wasincreased increase infarction was not statisticallysignicant\"; \"[t]he overall strength of ev-idence ovarian cancer prevention wasmoderate to low\"; and \"[t]he simulationmodel predicted that the combined in-crease in risk of breast and cervical can-cers and vascular events was likely to beequivalent to or greater than the decreasedrisk in ovarian cancer.\" 41Based on these ndings, AHRQ concluded that \"[t]here isinsufcient evidence to recommend for oragainst the use of OCs solely for the pri-mary prevention of ovarian cancer. . .theharm/benet ratio for ovarian cancer pre-vention alone is uncertain, particularlywhen the potential quality-of-life impact of breast cancer and vascular events areconsidered.\" 42 In addition, in relation to several stud- ies cited above, imposing a coverageMandate on objecting entities whose planscover many enrollee families who mayshare objections to contraception could,among some populations, affect risky sex-ual behavior in a negative way. For exam-ple, it may not be a narrowly tailored wayto advance the Government interests iden-tied here to mandate contraceptive ac- cess to teenagers and young adults whoare not already sexually active and at sig-nicant risk of unintended pregnancy. 43 Finally, evidence from studies that post-date the Mandate is not inconsistentwith the observations the Departmentsmake here. In 2016, HRSA awarded a5-year cooperative agreement to theAmerican College of Obstetricians andGynecologists to develop recommenda-tions for updated Women's PreventiveServices Guidelines. The awardee formedan expert panel called the Women's Pre-ventive Services Initiative that issued areport (the WPSI report). 44After observ- ing that \"[p]rivate companies are increas-ingly the contraception provi-sions in the Affordable Care Act,\" theWPSI report cited studies through 2013stating that application of HRSA Guide-lines had applied preventive services cov-erage to 55.6 million women and had ledto a 70 percent decrease in out-of-pocket expenses for contraceptive services amongcommercially insured women. Id.at 57-58. The WPSI report relied on a 2015 report of the HHS Ofce of the Assistant Secretaryfor Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), \"TheAffordable Care Act Is Improving Access toPreventive Services for Millions of Ameri-cans,\" which estimated that persons whohave private insurance coverage of preven-tive services without cost sharing includes55.6 million women. 45 As discussed above and based on the Departments' knowledge of litigationchallenging the Mandate, during the time 38See, for example, J.L Due\u00f1as, et al., \"Trends in the Use of Contraceptive Methods and Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy in the Spanish Population during 1997-2007,\" 83 Contraception 82 (2011) (as use of contraceptives increased from 49 percent to 80 percent, the elective abortion rate more than doubled); D.

October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 396ASPE estimated the scope of preventive services coverage (2011-2013), houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries wereexempt from the Mandate, other objectingreligious nonprot organizations wereprotected by the temporary safe harbor,and hundreds of accommodated self-insured church plan entities were not sub- ject to enforcement of the Mandatethrough their third party administrators. Inaddition, dozens of for-prot entities thathad led lawsuits challenging the Man-date were protected by court orders pend-ing the Supreme Court's resolution ofHobby Lobby in June 2014. It would therefore appear that the benets recordedby the report occurred even though mostobjecting entities were not in compli-ance. 46Additional data indicates that, in 28 States where contraceptive coveragemandates have been imposed statewide,those mandates have not necessarily low-ered rates of unintended pregnancy (orabortion) overall. 47 The Departments need not take a posi- tion on these empirical questions. Our re-view is sufcient to lead us to concludethat signicantly more uncertainty andambiguity exists in the record than theDepartments previously acknowledgedwhen we declined to extend the exemp-tion to certain objecting organizations andindividuals as set forth herein, and that nocompelling interest exists to counselagainst us extending the exemption. During public comment periods, some commenters noted that some drugs in-cluded in the preventive services contra-ceptive Mandate can also be useful fortreating certain existing health conditions.The IOM similarly stated that \"the non- contraceptive benets of hormonal contra-ception include treatment of menstrualdisorders, acne or hirsutism, and pelvicpain.\" IOM 2011 at 107. Consequently,some commenters suggested that religiousobjections to the Mandate should not bepermitted in cases where such methods are used to treat such conditions, even ifthose methods can also be used for con-traceptive purposes. Section 2713(a)(4) ofthe PHS Act does not, however, apply tonon-preventive care provided solely fortreatment of an existing condition. It ap-plies only to \"such preventivecare and implementingthis section state repeatedly that they ap-ply to \"preventive\" services or care, and with respect to the coverage of contracep-tion specically, they declare that the meth-ods covered are \"contraceptive\" methods asa \"Type of Preventive Service,\" and thatthey are to be covered only \"[a]s prescribed\"by a physician or other health care provider.https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/The contraceptive coverage requirementin the Guidelines also only applies for\"women with reproductive capacity.\"https://www.hrsa.gov/wom ensguidelines/; (80 FR 40318). Therefore, the Guide-lines' inclusion of contraceptive ser-vices requires coverage of contraceptivemethods as a type of preventive serviceonly when a drug that the FDA hasapproved for contraceptive use is pre-scribed in whole or in part for such use.The Guidelines and section 2713(a)(4)of the PHS Act do not require coverageof such drugs where they are prescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive andnon-preventive use to treat an existingcondition. 48As discussed above, the last Administration decided to exempthouses of worship and their integratedauxiliaries from the Mandate, and to re-lieve hundreds of religious nonprot or- ganizations of their obligations underthe Mandate and not further require con-traceptive coverage to their employees.In several of the lawsuits challengingthe Mandate, some religious plaintiffsstated that they do not object and arewilling to cover drugs prescribed for thetreatment of an existing condition andnot for contraceptive purposes\u2014even ifthose drugs are also approved by theFDA for contraceptive uses. Therefore, the Departments conclude that the fact thatsome drugs that are approved for preventivecontraceptive purposes can also be used forexclusively non-preventive purposes to treatexisting conditions is not a sufcient reasonto refrain from expanding the exemption tothe Mandate. An additional consideration supporting the Departments' present view is that al-ternative approaches can further the inter-ests the Departments previously identiedbehind the Mandate. As noted above, theGovernment already engages in dozens ofprograms that subsidize contraception forthe low-income women identied by theIOM as the most at risk for unintendedpregnancy. The Departments have also ac-knowledged in legal brieng that contra-ception access can be provided throughmeans other than coverage offered by re-ligious objectors, for example, through \"a 46In addition, as in IOM 2011, the WPSI report bases its evidentiary conclusions relating to contraceptive coverage, use, unintended pregnancy, and health benets, on conclusions that the phenomena are \"associated\" with the intended outcomes, without showing there is a causal relationship. For example, the WPSI report states that \"[c]ontraceptive counseling in primary care may increase the uptake of hormonal methods and [long-acting reversible contraceptives], although data on structured counseling in specialized reproductive health settings demonstratedno such effect.\" Id.at 63. The WPSI report also acknowledges that a large-scale study evaluating the effects of providing no-cost contraception had \"no randomization or control report also identies the at-risk population as young, low-income, and/or minority women: \"[u]nintended pregnancies disproportionately occur in women age 18 to 24 years,especially among those with low incomes or from racial/ethnic minorities.\" Id.at 58. The WPSI report acknowledges that many in this population are already served by Title X programs, which provide family planning services to \"approximately 1 million teens each year.\" Id.at 58. The WPSI report observes that between 2008 and 2011\u2014before the contraceptive coverage requirement was implemented\u2014unintended pregnancy decreased to the lowest rate in 30 years. Id.at 58. The WPSI report does not address how to balance contraceptive coverage interests with religious objections, nor does it specify the extent to which applying the Mandate among commercially insured at objecting entities serves to deliver contraceptive coverage to womenmost at risk of unintended pregnancy. 47See Michael J. New, \"Analyzing the Impact of State Level Contraception Mandates on Public Health Outcomes,\" 13 Ave Maria L. Rev. 345 (2015), available at http://avemarialaw- law-review.avemarialaw.edu/Content/articles/vXIII.i2.new.nal.0809.pdf. 48The Departments previously cited the IOM's listing of existing conditions that contraceptive drugs can be used to treat (menstrual disorders, acne, and pelvic pain), and said of those uses that \"there are demonstrated preventive health benets from contraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy.\" 77 FR 8727 & n.7. This was not, however, an assertion that PHSAct section 2713(a)(4) or the Guidelines require coverage of \"contraceptive\" methods when prescribed for an exclusively non-contraceptive, non-preventive use. Instead it was an observation that such drugs\u2014generally referred to as \"contraceptives\"\u2014also have some alternate benecial uses to treat existing conditions. For the purposes of these interim nal rules, the Departmentsclarify here that our previous reference to the benets of using contraceptive drugs exclusively for some non-contraceptive and non-preventive uses to treat existing conditions did not meanthat the Guidelines require coverage of such uses, and consequently is not a reason to refrain from offering the expanded exemptions provided here. Where a drug approved by the FDAfor contraceptive use is prescribed for both a contraceptive use and a non-contraceptive use, the Guidelines (to the extent they apply) would require its coverage. Where a drug approvedby the FDA for contraceptive use is prescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use to treat an existing condition, it would be outside the scope of the Guidelines. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 employer plan sponsors, insti- tutions of education arranging studenthealth coverage, and individuals enrolledin plans where their employers or issuers(as applicable) are willing to offer them areligiously acceptable plan, hold sincerelyheld religious beliefs against (respec-tively) providing, arranging, or participat-ing in plans that comply with the Mandateeither by providing contraceptive cover-age or by using the accommodation. Be-cause we have concluded that requiringsuch compliance through the Mandate oraccommodation has constituted a substan-tial burden on the religious exercise of many such entities or individuals, and be-cause we conclude requiring such compli-ance did not serve a compelling interest andwas not the least restrictive means of serv-ing a compelling interest, we now believethat requiring such compliance led to theviolation of RFRA in many instances. Werecognize that this is a change of position onthis issue, and we make that change basedon all the matters discussed in this preamble. B.Discretion to Provide Religious Exemptions Even if RFRA does not compel the religious exemptions provided in these interim nal rules, the Departments be-lieve they are the most appropriate admin-istrative response to the religious objec- tions that have been raised. RFRA identiescertain circumstance under which govern-ment must accommodate religious exercise-when a government action imposes a sub-stantial burden on the religious exercise ofan adherent and imposition of that burden isnot the least restrictive means of achieving acompelling government interest. RFRAdoes not, however, prescribe the accommo-dation that the government must adopt.Rather, agencies have discretion to fashionan appropriate and administrable responseto respect religious liberty interests impli-cated by their own regulations. We knowfrom Hobby Lobby that, in the absence of any accommodation, the contraceptive-coverage requirement imposes a substantialburden on certain objecting employers. Weknow from other lawsuits and public com-ments that many religious entities have ob-jections to complying with the accommoda-tion based on their sincerely held religiousbeliefs. Previously, the Departments at-tempted to develop an accommodation thatwould either alleviate the substantial burdenimposed on religious exercise or satisfyRFRA's requirements for imposing thatburden. Now, however, the Departments have reassessed the relevant interests and deter-mined that, even if exemptions are notrequired by RFRA, they would exercisetheir discretion to address the substantialburden identied in Hobby Lobby by ex- panding the exemptions from the Mandateinstead of revising accommodations pre-viously offered. In the Departments' view,a broader exemption is a more direct, ef-fective means of satisfying all bona dereligious objectors. This view is informedby the fact that the Departments' previousattempt to develop an appropriate accom-modation did not satisfy all objectors.That previous accommodation consumedDepartmental resources not only throughthe regulatory process, but in persistentlitigation and negotiations. Offering ex-emptions as described in these interim -nal rules is a more workable way to re-spond to the substantial burden identiedinHobby Lobby and bring years of litiga- tion concerning the Mandate to a close. C.General Scope of Expanded Religious Exemptions 1. Exemption and Accommodation for Religious Employers, Plan Sponsors, andInstitutions of Higher Education For all of these reasons, and as further explained below, the Departments now believe it is appropriate to modify thescope of the discretion afforded to HRSAin the July 2015 nal regulations to directHRSA to provide the expanded exemp-tions and change the accommodation to anoptional process if HRSA continues tootherwise provide for contraceptive cov-erage in the Guidelines. As set forth be-low, the expanded exemption encom-passes non-governmental plan sponsorsthat object based on sincerely held reli-gious beliefs, and institutions of higher education in their arrangement of studenthealth plans. The accommodation is alsomaintained as an optional process for ex-empt employers, and will provide contra-ceptive availability for persons covered bythe plans of entities that use it (a legiti-mate program purpose). The Departments believe this approach is sufciently respectful of religious ob-jections while still allowing the Govern-ment to advance other interests. Even withthe expanded exemption, HRSA main-tains the discretion to require contracep-tive coverage for nearly all entities towhich the Mandate previously applied(since most plan sponsors do not appear topossess the requisite religious objections),and to reconsider those interests in thefuture where no covered objection exists.Other Government subsidies of contracep-tion are likewise not affected by this rule. 2. Exemption for Objecting Individuals Covered by Willing Employers andIssuers As noted above, some individuals have brought suit objecting to being covered under an insurance policy that includescoverage for contraceptives. See, for ex-ample, Wieland v. HHS, 196 Supp. 3d 2016); Soda v. McGetti- gan, No. 15-cv-00898 (D. Md.). Just asthe Departments have determined that theGovernment does not have a compellinginterest in applying the Mandate to em-ployers that object to contraceptive cover-age on religious grounds, we have alsoconcluded that the Government does nothave a compelling interest in requiring individuals to be covered by policies thatinclude contraceptive coverage when theindividuals have sincerely held religiousobjections to that coverage. The Govern-ment does not have an interest in ensuringthe provision of contraceptive coverage toindividuals who do not wish to have suchcoverage. Especially relevant to this con-clusion is the fact that the Departmentshave described their interests of healthand gender equality as being advancedamong women who \"want\" the coverageso as to prevent \"unintended\" pregnancy. 49Brief for the Respondents at 65, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016) Bulletin No. 2017-44 398(77 FR 8727).50No asserted interest is served by denying an exemption to indi- viduals who object to it. No unintendedpregnancies will be avoided or costs re-duced by imposing the coverage on thoseindividuals. Although the Departments previously took the position that allowing individualreligious exemptions would underminethe workability of the insurance system,the Departments now agree with thosedistrict courts that have concluded that anexemption that allows\u2014but does not re-quire\u2014issuers and employers to omit con-traceptives from coverage provided to ob-jecting individuals does not undermineany compelling interest. See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1019-20; March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 132. The individualexemption will only apply where the em-ployer and issuer (or, in the individual market, the issuer) are willing to offer apolicy accommodating the objecting indi-vidual. As a result, the Departments con-sider it likely that where an individualexemption is invoked, it will impose noburdens on the insurance market becausesuch burdens may be factored into thewillingness of an employer or issuer tooffer such coverage. At the level of planofferings, the extent to which plans covercontraception under the prior rules is al-ready far from uniform. Congress did notrequire compliance with section 2713 ofthe PHS Act by all entities\u2014in particularby grandfathered plans. The Departments'previous exemption for houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries, and our lack ofauthority to enforce the accommodationwith respect to self-insured church plans,show that the importance of a uniformhealth insurance system is not signi-cantly harmed by allowing plans to omitcontraception in many contexts. 51Fur- thermore, granting exemptions to individ-uals who do not wish to receive contra-ceptive coverage where the plan and, asapplicable, issuer and plan sponsor arewilling, does not undermine the Govern-ment's interest in ensuring the provisionof such coverage to other individuals whowish to receive it. Nor do such exemptionsundermine the operation of the manyother programs subsidizing contraception.Rather, such exemptions serve the Gov-ernment's interest in accommodatingreligious exercise. Accordingly, as furtherexplained below, the Departments haveprovided an exemption to address the con-cerns of objecting individuals. D.Effects on Third Parties of Exemptions The Departments note that the exemp- tions created here, like the exemptions created by the last Administration, do notburden third parties to a degree that coun-sels against providing the exemptions.Congress did not create a right to receivecontraceptive coverage, and Congress ex-plicitly chose not to impose the section2713 of the PHS Act requirements ongrandfathered plans that cover millions ofpeople. Individuals who are unable to ob-tain contraceptive coverage through theiremployer-sponsored health plans becauseof the exemptions created in these interimnal rules, or because of other exemptionsto the Mandate, have other avenues forobtaining contraception, including thevarious governmental programs discussedabove. As the Government is under noconstitutional obligation to fund contra-ception, cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 United States 297 (1980), even more so may theGovernment refrain from requiring pri-vate citizens to cover contraception forother citizens in violation of their reli-gious beliefs. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192-93 (1991) (\"A refusal tofund protected activity, without more,cannot be equated with the imposition of a'penalty' on that activity.\"). 52 That conclusion is consistent with the Supreme Court's observation that RFRAmay require exemptions even from lawsrequiring claimants \"to confer benets parties.\" Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781 n.37. The burdens imposed on such third parties may be relevant to the RFRAanalysis, but they cannot be dispositive.\"Otherwise, for example, the Governmentcould decide that all supermarkets mustsell alcohol for the convenience of cus-tomers (and thereby exclude Muslimswith religious objections from owning su-permarkets), or it could decide that allrestaurants must remain open on Satur-days to give employees an opportunity toearn tips (and thereby exclude Jews withreligious objections from owning restau-rants).\" Id.Where, as here, contraceptives are readily accessible and, for many low income persons, are available at reducedcost or for free through various governmen-tal programs, and contraceptive coveragemay be available through State sources orfamily plans obtained through non-objecting employers, the Departments havedetermined that the expanded exemptionsrather than accommodations are the appro-priate response to the substantial burden thatthe Mandate has placed upon the religiousexercise of many religious employers. III. Provisions of the Interim Final Rules With Comment Period The Departments are issuing these in- terim nal rules in light of the full history of relevant rulemaking (including priorinterim nal rules), public comments, andlitigation throughout the Federal courtsystem. The interim nal rules seek toresolve this matter and the long-runninglitigation with respect to religious objec-tions by extending the exemption underthe HRSA Guidelines to encompass enti-ties, and individuals, with sincerely heldreligious beliefs objecting to contracep-tive or sterilization coverage, and by mak-ing the accommodation process optionalfor eligible organizations. The Departments acknowledge that the foregoing analysis represents a changefrom the policies and interpretations wepreviously adopted with respect to the 50In this respect, the Government's interest in contraceptive coverage is different than its interest in persons receiving some other kinds of health coverage or coverage in general, which can lead to important benets that are not necessarily conditional on the recipient's desire to use the coverage and the specic benets that may result from their choice to use it. 51Also, see Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690 at *36 (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so would not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market.. . . Because the government has failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the Affordable Care Act) would be unworkable, it has not satised strict scrutiny.\" (citation and internal quotationmarks omitted)). 52Cf. also Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass'n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Ct. App. (\"a woman's right to an abortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or entity to facilitate either.\").

As the Supreme Court has ac-knowledged, \"[a]gencies are free tochange their existing policies as long asthey provide a reasoned explanation forthe change.\" \"demon-strate to a court's satisfaction that the rea-sons for the new policy are better than thereasons for the old one; it sufces that thenew policy is permissible under the stat-ute, that there are good reasons for it, andthat the agency believes it to be better,which the conscious change of course ad-equately indicates\".

Here, for all of the reasons discussed above, the Departments have determinedthat the Government's interest in the ap-plication of contraceptive coverage re-quirements in this specic context to theplans of certain entities and individualsdoes not outweigh the sincerely held reli-gious objections of those entities and in-dividuals based on the analyses set forth above. Thus, these interim nal rulesamend the Departments' July 2015 nalregulations to expand the exemption toinclude additional entities and personsthat object based on sincerely held reli-gious beliefs. These rules leave in placeHRSA's discretion to continue to requirecontraceptive and sterilization coveragewhere no such objection exists, and to theextent that section 2713 of the PHS Actapplies. These interim nal rules alsomaintain the existence of an accommoda-tion process, but consistent with our ex-pansion of the exemption, we make theprocess optional for eligible organiza-tions. HRSA is simultaneously updatingits Guidelines to reflect the requirements of these interim nal rules. 53 A.Regulatory Restatements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act These interim nal rules modify the restatements of the requirements of sec-tion 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act,contained in text CFR 147.130(a)(1)introductory text and (a)(1)(iv), so thatthey conform to the statutory text of sec-tion 2713 of the PHS Act. B.Prefatory Language of the Exemption in 45 CFR 147.132 These interim nal rules move the re- ligious exemption from 45 CFR 147.131 to a new \u00a7 147.132 and expand it as fol-lows. In the prefatory language of\u00a7 147.132, these interim nal rules specifythat not only are certain entities \"exempt,\"but the Guidelines shall not support orprovide for an imposition of the contra-ceptive coverage requirement to such en-tities. This is an acknowledgement thatsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act re-quires women's preventive services cov-erage only \"as provided for in comprehen-sive guidelines supported by the HealthResources and Services Administration.\"To the extent the HRSA Guidelines do notprovide for or support the application ofsuch coverage to exempt entities, the Af-fordable Care Act does not require thecoverage. Section 147.132 not only de-scribes the exemption of certain entitiesand plans, but does so by specifying thatthe HRSA Guidelines do not provide for,or support the application of, such cover-age to exempt entities and plans. C.General Scope of Exemption for Objecting Entities In the new 45 CFR 147.132 as created by these interim nal rules, these rules expand the exemption that was previously located in\u00a7 147.131(a). With respect to employers thatsponsor group health plans, the new lan-guage of \u00a7 147.132(a)(1) introductory textand (a)(1)(i) provides exemptions for em- ployers that object to coverage of all or asubset of contraceptives or sterilization andrelated patient education and counselingbased on sincerely held religious beliefs. For avoidance of doubt, the Depart- ments wish to make clear that the ex-panded exemption created in \u00a7 147.132(a)applies to several distinct entities involvedin the provision of coverage to the object-ing employer's employees. This explana-tion is consistent with how prior ruleshave worked by means of similar lan-guage. Section 147.132(a)(1) introductorytext and (a)(1)(i), by specifying that \"[a]group health plan and health insurancecoverage provided in connection with agroup health plan\" is exempt \"to the ex-tent the plan sponsor objects as speciedin paragraph (a)(2),\" exempt the grouphealth plans the sponsors of which object,and exempt their health insurance issuers from providing the coverage in thoseplans (whether or not the issuers havetheir own objections). Consequently,with respect to Guidelines issued under\u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), or the parallel pro-visions in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the plan sponsor, issuer, andplan covered in the exemption of thatparagraph would face no penalty as aresult of omitting contraceptive cover-age from the benets of the plan partic-ipants and beneciaries. Consistent with the restated exemption, exempt entities will not be required tocomply with a self-certication process.Although exempt entities do not need to le notices or certications of their ex-emption, and these interim nal rules donot impose any new notice requirementson them, existing ERISA rules governinggroup health plans require that, with re-spect to plans subject to ERISA, a plandocument must include a comprehensivesummary of the benets covered by theplan and a statement of the conditions foreligibility to receive benets. UnderERISA, the plan document provides whatbenets are provided to participants andbeneciaries under the plan and, there-fore, if an objecting employer would liketo exclude all or a subset of contraceptiveservices, it must ensure that the exclusion 53See https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ and https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 400is clear in the plan document. Moreover, if there is a reduction in a covered service orbenet, the plan has to disclose thatchange to plan participants. 54Thus, where an exemption applies and all or a subset ofcontraceptive services are omitted from aplan's coverage, otherwise applicableERISA disclosures must reflect the omis-sion of coverage in ERISA plans. Theseexisting disclosure requirements serve tohelp provide notice to participants andbeneciaries of what ERISA plans do anddo not cover. The Departments invite pub-lic comment on whether exempt entities,or others, would nd value either in beingable to maintain or submit a specic formof certication to claim their exemption,or in otherwise receiving guidance on away to document their exemption. The exemptions in \u00a7 147.132(a) apply \"to the extent\" of the objecting entities'sincerely held religious beliefs. Thus, en-tities that hold a requisite objection tocovering some, but not all, contraceptiveitems would be exempt with respect to theitems to which they object, but not withrespect to the items to which they do notobject. Likewise, the requisite objectionof a plan sponsor or institution of highereducation in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i) and (ii)exempts its group health plan, health in- surance coverage offered by a health in-surance issuer in connection with suchplan, and its issuer in its offering of suchcoverage, but that exemption does not ex-tend to coverage provided by that issuer toother group health plans where the plansponsor has no qualifying objection. Theobjection of a health insurance issuer in\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii) similarly operatesonly to the extent of its objection, and asotherwise limited as described below. D.Exemption of Employers and Institutions of Higher Education The scope of the exemption is ex- panded for non-governmental plan spon-sors and certain entities that arrange health coverage under these interim nalrules. The Departments have consistentlytaken the position that section 2713(a)(4)of the PHS Act grants HRSA authority toissue Guidelines that provide for and sup-port exemptions from a contraceptive cov-erage requirement. Since the beginning ofrulemaking concerning the Mandate,HRSA and the Departments have repeat-edly exercised their discretion to createand modify various exemptions within theGuidelines. 55 The Departments believe the approach of these interim nal rules better alignsour implementation of section 2713(a)(4)of the PHS Act with Congress' intent inthe Affordable Care Act and throughoutother Federal health care laws. As dis-cussed above, many Federal health carelaws and regulations provide exemptionsfor objections based on religious beliefs,and RFRA applies to the Affordable CareAct. Expanding the exemption removesreligious obstacles that entities and certainindividuals may face when they otherwisewish to participate in the health care mar-ket. This advances the Affordable CareActs goal of expanding health coverageamong entities and individuals that mightotherwise be reluctant to participate.These rules also leave in place many Fed-eral programs that subsidize contracep-tives for women who are most at risk ofunintended pregnancy and who may havemore limited access to contraceptives. 56 These interim nal rules achieve greateruniformity and simplicity in the regulationof health insurance by expanding the ex-emptions to include entities that object tothe Mandate based on their sincerely heldreligious beliefs. The Departments further conclude that it would be inadequate to merely attempt to amend the accommodation process in-stead of expand the exemption. The De-partments have stated in our regulationsand court briengs that the existing ac-commodation with respect to self-insured plans requires contraceptive coverage aspart of the same plan as the coverageprovided by the employer, and operates ina way \"seamless\" to those plans. As aresult, in signicant respects, the accom-modation process does not actually ac-commodate the objections of many enti-ties. The Departments have engaged in aneffort to attempt to identify an accommo-dation that would eliminate the plaintiffs'religious objections, including seekingpublic comment through an RFI, but westated in January 2017 that we were un-able to develop such an approach at thattime. 1. Plan Sponsors Generally The expanded exemptions in these in- terim nal rules cover any kind of non- governmental employer plan sponsor withthe requisite objections but, for the sake ofclarity, they include an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of employers whose objec-tions qualify the plans they sponsor for anexemption. Under these interim nal rules, the De- partments do not limit the Guidelines ex-emption with reference to nonprot statusor to sections 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) ofthe Code, as previous rules have done. Asignicant majority of States either im-pose no contraceptive coverage require-ment or offer broader exemptions than the exemption contained in the July 2015 nalregulations. 57Although the practice of States is by no means a limit on the dis-cretion delegated to HRSA by the Afford-able Care Act, nor a statement about whatthe Federal Government may do consis-tent with RFRA or other limitations infederal law, such State practice can beinformative as to the viability of broadprotections for religious liberty. In thiscase, such practice supports the Depart-ments' decision to expand the federal ex-emption, bringing the Federal Govern- 54See, 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the \"exceptions, reductions, and limitations of the coverage,\" including group health plans and group & individual issuers). 55\"The fact that the agency has adopted different denitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the denition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of the statute.\" Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863-64 (1984). 56See, for example, Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, Public Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; 42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.; the Indian Health Service, 25 U.S.C. 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the NIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713. 57See Guttmacher Institute, \"Insurance Coverage of Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 401ment's practice into greater alignment with the practices of the majority of theStates. 2. Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A) Despite not limiting the exemption to certain organizations referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, the exemption in these rules includes suchorganizations. Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A)species, as under the prior exemption, thatthe exemption covers \"a group health planestablished or maintained by ... [a] church,the integrated auxiliary of a church, a con-vention or association of churches, or a re-ligious order.\" In the preamble to rulessetting forth the prior exemption at\u00a7147.132(a), the Departments interpretedthis same language used in those rules bydeclaring that \"[t]he nal regulations con-tinue to provide that the availability of theexemption or accommodation be deter-mined on an employer by employer basis,which the Departments continue to believebest balances the interests of religious em-ployers and eligible organizations and thoseof employees and their dependents.\" (78 FR39886). Therefore, under the prior exemp-tion, if an employer participated in a houseof worship's plan\u2014perhaps because it wasafliated with a house of worship\u2014but wasnot an integrated auxiliary or a house ofworship itself, that employer was not con-sidered to be covered by the exemption,even though it was, in the ordinary meaningof the text of the prior regulation, participat-ing in a \"plan established or maintained by a[house of worship].\" Under these interim nal rules, how- ever, the Departments intend that, whenthis regulation text exempts a plan \"estab-lished or maintained by\" a house of wor-ship or integrated auxiliary, such exemp-tion will no longer \"be determined on anemployer by employer basis,\" but will bedetermined on a plan basis\u2014that is, bywhether the plan is a \"plan established ormaintained by\" a house of worship orintegrated auxiliary. This interpretationbetter conforms to the text of the regula-tion setting forth the exemption\u2014in boththe prior regulation and in the text setforth in these interim nal rules. It alsooffers appropriate respect to houses of worship and their integrated auxiliariesnot only in their internal employmentpractices but in their choice of organiza-tional form and/or in their activity of es-tablishing or maintaining health plans foremployees of associated employers thatdo not meet the threshold of being inte-grated auxiliaries. Moreover, under thisinterpretation, houses of worship wouldnot be faced with the potential prospect ofservices to which they have a religiousobjection being covered for employees ofan associated employer participating in aplan they have established and maintain. The Departments do not believe there is a sufcient factual basis to excludefrom this part of the exemption entitiesthat are so closely associated with a houseof worship or integrated auxiliary thatthey are permitted participation in itshealth plan, but are not themselves inte-grated auxiliaries. Additionally, this inter-pretation is not inconsistent with the op-eration of the accommodation under the prior rule, to the extent that, in practice and as discussed elsewhere herein, itdoes not force contraceptive coverage tobe provided on behalf of the plan par-ticipants of many religious organiza-tions in a self-insured church plan ex-empt from ERISA\u2014which are exemptin part because the plans are establishedand maintained by a church. (Section3(33)(A) of ERISA) In several lawsuitschallenging the Mandate, the Depart-ments took the position that some plansestablished and maintained by houses ofworship, but that included entities thatwere not integrated auxiliaries, werechurch plans under section 3(33) ofERISA and, thus, the Government \"hasno authority to require the plaintiffs'TPAs to provide contraceptive coverageat this time.\" Roman Catholic Archdio- of N.Y. F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). Thereforethe Departments believe it is most ap-propriate to use a plan basis, not anemployer by employer basis, to deter-mine the scope of an exemption for agroup health plan established or main-tained by a house of worship or inte-grated auxiliary.3. Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B) Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B) of the rules species that the exemption includes the plans of plan sponsors that are nonprotorganizations. 4. Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C) Under \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of closely held for-prot entities. This is con-sistent with the Supreme Court's ruling inHobby Lobby, which declared that a cor-porate entity is capable of possessing andpursuing non-pecuniary goals (in Hobby Lobby, religion), regardless of whether theentity operates as a nonprot organization,and rejecting the Departments' argumentto the contrary. (134 S. Ct. 2768-75)Some reports and industry experts haveindicated that not many for-prot entitiesbeyond those that had originally broughtsuit have sought relief from the Mandateafter Hobby Lobby. 58 5. Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D) Under \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of for-prot entities that are not closely held.The July 2015 nal regulations extendedthe accommodation to for-prot entitiesonly if they are closely held, by positivelydening what constitutes a closely heldentity. The Departments implicitly recog-nized the difculty of providing an afr-mative denition of closely held entitiesin the July 2015 nal regulations when weadopted a denition that included entitiesthat are merely \"substantially similar\" tocertain specied parameters, and we al-lowed entities that were not sure if theymet the denition to inquire with HHS;HHS was permitted to decline to answerthe inquiry, at which time the entity wouldbe deemed to qualify as an eligible orga-nization. The exemptions in these interimnal rules do not need to address thisdifculty because they include both for-prot entities that are closely held andfor-prot entities that are not closely 58See Jennifer Haberkorn, \"Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,\" Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), available at http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control- mandate-employers-229627. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 402held.59The mechanisms for determining whether a company has adopted and holds such principles or views is a matter ofwell-established State law with respect tocorporate decision-making, 60and the De- partments expect that application of suchlaws would cabin the scope of this exemp-tion. In including entities in the exemption that are not closely held, these interimnal rules provide for the possibility thatsome publicly traded entities may use theexemption. Even though the SupremeCourt did not extend its holding in Hobby Lobby to publicly traded corporations (the matter could be resolved without decidingthat question), the Court did instruct thatRFRA applies to corporations becausethey are \"persons\" as that term is denedin 1 U.S.C. 1. Given that the denitionunder 1 U.S.C. 1 applies to any corpora- tion, the Departments consider it appro-priate to extend the exemption set forth inthese interim nal rules to for-prot cor-porations whether or not they are closelyheld. The Departments are generallyaware that in a country as large as Amer-ica comprised of a supermajority of reli-gious persons, some publicly traded enti-ties might claim a religious character fortheir company, or that the majority ofshares (or voting shares) of some publiclytraded companies might be controlled by asmall group of religiously devout personsso as to set forth such a religious charac-ter. 61The fact that such a company is religious does not mean that it will havean objection to contraceptive coverage,and there are many fewer publicly tradedcompanies than there are closely heldones. But our experience with closely heldcompanies is that some, albeit a smallminority, do have religious objections tocontraceptive coverage. Thus we considerit possible, though very unlikely, that areligious publicly traded company mighthave objections to contraceptive cover-age. At the same time, we are not aware ofany publicly traded entities that chal-lenged the Mandate specically either publicly or in court. The Departmentsagree with the Supreme Court that it isimprobable that many publicly tradedcompanies with numerous \"unrelatedshareholders\u2014including institutional in-vestors with their own set of stakehold- ers\u2014would agree to run a corporation un-der the same religious beliefs\" andthereby qualify for the exemption. (134 S.Ct. at 2774) 6. Section 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E) Under \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of any other non-governmental employer. Theplans of governmental employers are notcovered by the plan sponsor exemption of\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i). The Departments arenot aware of reasons why it would beappropriate or necessary to offer religiousexemptions to governmental employerplan sponsors in the United States withrespect to the contraceptive Mandate. But,as discussed below, governmental em-ployers are permitted to respect an indi-vidual's objection under \u00a7 147.132(b) andthus to provide health insurance coveragewithout the objected-to contraceptive cov-erage to such individual. Where that ex-emption is operative, the Guidelines maynot be construed to prevent a willing gov-ernmental plan sponsor of a group healthplan from offering a separate benet pack-age option, or a separate policy, certicateor contract of insurance, to any individualwho objects to coverage or payments forsome or all contraceptive services basedon sincerely held religious beliefs. By the general extension of the exemp- tion to the plans of plan sponsors in\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i), these interim nalrules also exempt group health planssponsored by an entity other than an em-ployer (for example, a union) that objectsbased on sincerely held religious beliefs tocoverage of contraceptives or sterilization.7. Section 147.132(a)(1)(ii) As in the previous rules, the plans of institutions of higher education that ar- range student health insurance coveragewill continue to be treated similarly to theway in which the plans of employers aretreated, but for the purposes of such plansbeing exempt or electing the optional ac-commodation, rather than merely beingeligible for the accommodation as in theprevious rule. These interim nal rulesspecify, in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii), that theexemption is extended, in the case of in-stitutions of higher education (as denedin 20 U.S.C. 1002), to their arrangementof student health insurance coverage, in amanner comparable to the applicability ofthe exemption for group health insurancecoverage provided in connection with agroup health plan established or main-tained by a plan sponsor. As mentionedabove, because the Affordable Care Actdoes not require institutions of higher ed-ucation to arrange student coverage, someinstitutions of higher education that objectto the Mandate appear to have chosen tostop arranging student plans rather thancomply with the Mandate or use the ac-commodation. Extending the exemption in these interim nal rules may remove anobstacle to such entities deciding to offerstudent plans, thereby giving students an-other health insurance option. E.Exemption for Issuers These interim nal rules extend the exemption, in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii), to health insurance issuers offering group orindividual health insurance coverage thatsincerely hold their own religious objec-tions to providing coverage for contracep-tive services. The Departments are not currently aware of health insurance issuers that pos-sess their own religious objections to of-fering contraceptive coverage. Neverthe-less, many Federal health care conscience 59In the companion interim nal rules published elsewhere in this Federal Register, the Departments provide an exemption on an interim nal basis to closely held entities by using a negative denition: entities that do not have publicly traded ownership interests as dened by certain securities required to be registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although this is a more workable denition than set forth in our previous rules, we have determined that it is appropriate to offer the expanded religious exemptions to certain entities whetheror not they have publicly traded ownership interests. 60Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notication, they would expect that such principles or views would have been adopted and documented in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which they are incorporated or organized. 61See, e.g., Nasdaq.com, \"4 Publicly Traded Religious Companies if You're Looking to Invest in Faith\" (Feb. 7, 2014), available at http://www.nasdaq.com/article/4-publicly-traded- religious-companies-if-youre-looking-to-invest-in-faith-cm324665. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 403laws and regulations protect issuers or plans specically. For example, 42 U.S.C.1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3)protect plans or managed care organiza-tions in Medicaid or Medicare Advantage.The Weldon Amendment protects HMOs,health insurance plans, and any otherhealth care organizations are protectedfrom being required to provide coverageor pay for abortions. See, for example,Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017,Pub. L. No. 115-31, Div. H, Title V, Sec.507(d). Congress also declared this yearthat \"it is the intent of Congress\" to in-clude a \"conscience clause\" which pro-vides exceptions for religious beliefs if theDistrict of Columbia requires \"the provi-sion of contraceptive coverage by healthinsurance plans.\" See Id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808. In light of the clearly ex-pressed intent of Congress to protect reli-gious liberty, particularly in certain healthcare contexts, along with the specic ef-forts to protect issuers, the Departmentshave concluded that an exemption for is- suers is appropriate. As discussed above, where the exemp- tion for plan sponsors or institutions ofhigher education applies, issuers are ex-empt under those sections with respect toproviding coverage in those plans. Theissuer exemption in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii)adds to that protection, but the additionalprotection operates in a different way thanthe plan sponsor exemption operates. Asset forth in these interim nal rules, theonly plan sponsors, or in the case of indi-vidual insurance coverage, individuals,who are eligible to purchase or enroll inhealth insurance coverage offered by anexempt issuer that does not cover some orall contraceptive services are plan spon-sors or individuals who themselves objectand are otherwise exempt based on theirobjection. Thus, the issuer exemptionspecies that where a health insuranceissuer providing group health insurancecoverage is exempt under paragraph(a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject to anyrequirement to provide coverage for con-traceptive services under Guidelines is-sued under 42 CFR 147.130(a)(1)(iv) un-less the plan is otherwise exempt fromthat requirement. Accordingly, the onlyplan sponsors, or in the case of individualinsurance coverage, individuals, who areeligible to purchase or enroll in healthinsurance coverage offered by an issuer that is exempt under this paragraph(a)(1)(iii) that does not include coveragefor some or all contraceptive services areplan sponsors or individuals who them-selves object and are exempt. Issuers thathold religious objections should identifyto plan sponsors the lack of contraceptivecoverage in any health insurance coveragebeing offered that is based on the issuer'sexemption, and communicate the grouphealth plan's independent obligation toprovide contraceptive coverage, unless thegroup health plan itself is exempt underregulations governing the Mandate. In this way, the issuer exemption serves to protect objecting issuers bothfrom being asked or required to issue pol-icies that cover contraception in violationof the issuers' sincerely held religious be-liefs, and from being asked or required toissue policies that omit contraceptive cov-erage to non-exempt entities or individu-als, thus subjecting the issuers to potentialliability if those plans are not exempt from the Guidelines. At the same time, the is-suer exemption will not serve to removecontraceptive coverage obligations fromany plan or plan sponsor that is not alsoexempt, nor will it prevent other issuersfrom being required to provide contracep-tive coverage in individual insurance cov-erage. Permitting issuers to object to of-fering contraceptive coverage based onsincerely held religious beliefs will allowissuers to continue to offer coverage toplan sponsors and individuals, withoutsubjecting them to liability under section2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act or related pro-visions for their failure to provide contra-ceptive coverage. The issuer exemption does not specif- ically include third party administrators,although the optional accommodationprocess provided under these interim nalrules species that third party administra-tors cannot be required to contract with anentity that invokes that process. Some re-ligious third party administrators havebrought suit in conjunction with suitsbrought by organizations enrolled inERISA-exempt church plans. Such plansare now exempt under these interim nalrules, and their third party administrators,as claims processors, are under no obliga-tion under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHSAct to provide benets for contraceptiveservices, as that section applies only to plans and issuers. In the case of ERISA-covered plans, plan administrators are ob-ligated under ERISA to follow the planterms, but it is the Departments' under-standing that third party administrators arenot typically designated as plan adminis-trators under section 3(16) of ERISA and,therefore, would not normally act as planadministrators under section 3(16) ofERISA. Therefore, to the Departments'knowledge, it is only under the existingaccommodation process that third partyadministrators are required to undertakeany obligations to provide or arrange forcontraceptive coverage to which theymight object. These interim nal rulesmake the accommodation process op-tional for employers and other plan spon-sors, and specify that third party adminis-trators that have their own objection tocomplying with the accommodation pro-cess may decline to enter into, or con-tinue, contracts as third party administra-tors of such plans. For these reasons, theseinterim nal rules do not otherwise ex-empt third party administrators. TheDepartments solicit public comment,however, on whether there are situationswhere there may be an additional need toprovide distinct protections for third partyadministrators that may have religious be-liefs implicated by the Mandate. F.Scope of Objections Needed for the Objecting Entity Exemption Exemptions for objecting entities specify that they apply where the entities object as specied in \u00a7 147.132(a)(2). That paragraphspecies that exemptions for objecting enti-ties will apply to the extent that an entitydescribed in \u00a7147.132(a)(1) objects to itsestablishing, maintaining, providing, offer-ing, or arranging (as applicable) coverage,payments, or a plan that provides coverageor payments for some or all contraceptiveservices, based on its sincerely held reli-gious beliefs. G.Individual Exemption These interim nal rules include a spe- cial rule pertaining to individuals (referred to here as the \"individual exemption\").Section 147.132(b) provides CFR 2590.715- 2713(a)(1)(iv), may be construed to pre-vent a willing plan sponsor of a grouphealth plan or a willing health insuranceissuer offering group or individual healthinsurance coverage, from offering a sepa-rate benet package option, or a separatepolicy, certicate, or contract of insur-ance, to any individual who objects tocoverage or payments for some or all con-traceptive services based on the individu-al's sincerely held religious beliefs. Theindividual exemption extends to the cov-erage unit in which the plan participant, orsubscriber in the individual market, is en-rolled (for instance, to family coveragecovering the participant and his or herbeneciaries enrolled under the plan), butdoes not relieve the plan's or issuer's ob-ligation to comply with the Mandate withrespect to the group health plan at large or,as applicable, to any other individual pol-icies the issuer offers. This individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not speci-cally object to contraceptive coverage tooffer religiously acceptable coverage totheir participants or subscribers who doobject, while offering coverage that in-cludes contraception to participants orsubscribers who do not object. This indi-vidual exemption can apply with respectto individuals in plans sponsored by pri-vate employers or governmental employ-ers. For example, in one case broughtagainst the Departments, the State of Mis-souri enacted a law under which the Stateis not permitted to discriminate againstinsurance issuers that offer health planswithout coverage for contraception basedon employees' religious beliefs, or againstthe employees who suchoffers. See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015-16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat.191.724). Under the individual exemptionof these interim nal rules, employerssponsoring governmental plans would befree to honor the objections of individual employees by offering them plans thatomit contraceptive coverage, even if thosegovernmental entities do not object to of-fering contraceptive coverage in general.This \"individual exemption\" cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or an issuer to provide coverage omitting con-traception, or, with respect to health insur-ance coverage, to prevent the applicationof State law that requires coverage of suchcontraceptives or sterilization. Nor can theindividual exemption be construed to re-quire the guaranteed availability of cover-age omitting contraception to a plan spon-sor or individual who does not have asincerely held religious objection. This in-dividual exemption is limited to the re-quirement to provide contraceptive cover-age under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHSAct, and does not affect any other Federalor State law governing the plan or cover-age. Thus, if there are other applicablelaws or plan terms governing the benets,these interim nal rules do not affect suchother laws or terms. The Departments believe the individ- ual exemption will help to meet the Af-fordable Care Act's goal of increasinghealth coverage because it will reduce theincidence of certain individuals choosingto forego health coverage because theonly coverage available would violatetheir sincerely held religious beliefs. 62At the same time, this individual exemption\"does not undermine the governmental in-terests furthered by the contraceptive cov-erage requirement,\" 63because, when the exemption is applicable, the individualdoes not want the coverage, and thereforewould not use the objectionable itemseven if they were covered. H.Optional Accommodation Despite expanding the scope of the ex- emption, these rules also keep the accom- modation process, but revise it so as tomake it optional. In this way, objectingemployers are no longer required tochoose between direct compliance orcompliance through the accommodation.These rules maintain the location of theaccommodation process in the Code ofFederal Regulations at 45 CFR 147.131,26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, and 29 CFR2590.715-2713A. These rules, by virtueof expanding the plan sponsor exemptionbeyond houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries that were previously exempt,and beyond religious nonprot groups thatwere previously accommodated, and bydening eligible organizations for the ac-commodation with reference to those cov-ered by the exemption, likewise expandthe kinds of entities that may use the op-tional accommodation. This includes plansponsors with sincerely held religious be-liefs for the reasons described above. Con-sequently, under these interim nal rules,objecting employers may make use of theexemption, or may choose to pursue theoptional accommodation process. If an el-igible organization pursues the optionalaccommodation process through theEBSA Form 700 or other specied noticeto HHS, it voluntarily shifts an obligationto provide separate but seamless contra-ceptive coverage to its issuer or third partyadministrator. The fees adjustment process for quali- fying health issuers or third party admin-istrators pursuant to 45 CFR 156.50 is notmodied, and (as specied therein) re-quires for its applicability that an excep-tion under OMB Circular No. A-25R bein effect as the Secretary of the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services re-quests. If an eligible organization wishes to revoke its use of the accommodation, itcan do so under these interim nal rulesand operate under its exempt status. Aspart of its revocation, the issuer or thirdparty administrator of the eligible organi-zation must provide participants and ben-eciaries written notice of such revocationas specied in guidance issued by the Sec-retary of the Department of Health andHuman Services. This revocation processapplies both prospectively to eligible or-ganizations who decide at a later date toavail themselves of the optional accom-modation and then decide to revoke thataccommodation, as well as to organiza-tions that were included in the accommo-dation prior to the effective date of theseinterim nal rules either by their submis-sion of an EBSA Form 700 or notication,or by some other means under which theirthird party administrator or issuer was no- 62See, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1017, and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130, where the courts noted that the individual employee plaintiffs indicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to \"forgo health insurance altogether.\" 6378 FR 39874. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, by DOL or HHS that the accommo- dation applies. Consistent with other ap-plicable laws, the issuer or third partyadministrator of an eligible organizationmust promptly notify plan participantsand beneciaries of the change of status tothe extent such participants and benecia-ries are currently being offered contracep-tive coverage at the time the accommo-dated organization invokes its exemption.If contraceptive coverage is being offeredby an issuer or third party administratorthrough the accommodation process, therevocation will be effective on the 1 stday of the 1stplan year that begins on or after 30 days after the date of the revocation (toallow for the provision of notice to planparticipants in cases where contraceptivebenets will no longer be provided). Al-ternatively, an eligible organization maygive 60-days notice pursuant to section2715(d)(4) of the PHS Act, 64if applica- ble, to revoke its use of the accommoda-tion process. The Departments have eliminated the provision in the previous accommodationunder which an issuer is deemed to havecomplied with the Mandate where the is-suer relied reasonably and in good faith ona representation by an eligible organiza-tion as to its eligibility for the accommo-dation, even if that representation waslater determined to be incorrect. Becauseany organization with a sincerely held re-ligious objection to contraceptive cover-age is now eligible for the optional ac-commodation under these interim nalrules and is also exempt, the Departmentsbelieve there is minimal opportunity formistake or misrepresentation by the orga-nization, and the reliance provision is nolonger necessary. I.Denition of Contraceptive Services for the Purpose of these Rules The interim nal rules specify that when the rules refer to \"contraceptive\" services, benets, or coverage, such termsinclude contraceptive or sterilizationitems, services, or related patient educa-tion or counseling, to the extent speciedfor purposes of \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv). Thiswas the case under the previous rules, asexpressed in the preamble text of the var-ious iterations of the regulations, but theDepartments wish to make the scope clearby specifying it in the regulatory text. J.Conclusion The Departments believe that the Guidelines and the exemptions expanded herein will advance the limited purposesfor which Congress imposed section 2713of the PHS Act, while acting consistentlywith Congress' well-established record ofallowing for religious exemptions with re-spect to especially sensitive health careand health insurance requirements. Theseinterim nal rules leave fully in place overa dozen Federal programs that provide, orsubsidize, contraceptives for women, in-cluding for low income women based onnancial need. These interim nal rulesalso maintain HRSA's discretion to de-cide whether to continue to require con-traceptive coverage under the Guidelines(in plans where Congress applied section2713 of the PHS Act) if no objectionexists. The Departments believe this arrayof programs and requirements betterserves the interest of providing contracep-tive coverage while protecting the con-science rights of entities that have sin-cerely held religious objections to some orall contraceptive or sterilization services. The Departments request and encour- age public comments on all matters ad-dressed in these interim nal rules. V. Interim Final Rules, Request for Comments and Waiver of Delay ofEffective Date Section 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act authorize the Secretaries of the Trea-sury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, theSecretaries) to promulgate any interim -nal rules that they determine are appropri-ate to carry out the provisions of chapter100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B oftitle I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVIIof the PHS Act, which include sections2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act and theincorporation of those sections into sec-tion 715 of ERISA and section 9815 of theCode. These interim nal rules fall underthose statutory authorized justications,as did previous rules on this matter (75 FR 41726; 76 FR 46621; 79 FR 51092). Section 553(b) the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires notice andcomment rulemaking, involving a noticeof proposed rulemaking and a commentperiod prior to nalization of regulatoryrequirements - except when an agency,for good cause, nds that notice and pub-lic comment thereon are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public in-terest. These provisions of the APA do notapply here because of the specic author-ity granted to the Secretaries by section9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA,and section 2792 of the PHS Act. Even if these provisions of the APA applied, they would be satised: The De-partments have determined that it wouldbe impracticable and contrary to the pub-lic interest to delay putting these provi-sions in place until a full public notice-and-comment process is completed. Asdiscussed earlier, the Departments haveissued three interim nal rules implement-ing this section of the PHS Act because ofthe immediate needs of covered entitiesand the weighty matters implicated by theHRSA Guidelines. As recently as Decem-ber 20, 2016, HRSA updated those Guide-lines without engaging in the regulatoryprocess (because doing so is not a legalrequirement), and announced that it plansto continue to update the Guidelines. Dozens of lawsuits over the Mandate have been pending for nearly 5 years. TheSupreme Court remanded several of thosecases more than a year ago, stating that onremand \"[w]e anticipate that the Courts of Appeals will allow the parties sufcienttime to resolve any outstanding issues be-tween them\". Zubik, 136 S. Ct. at 1560. During that time, Courts of Appeals havebeen asking the parties in those cases tosubmit status reports every 30 through 90days. Those status reports have informedthe courts that the parties were in discus-sions, and about the RFI issued in late2016 and its subsequent comment processand the FAQ the Departments issued in-dicating that we could not nd a way atthat time to amend the accommodationprocess so as to satisfy objecting eligibleorganizations while pursuing the Depart-ments' policy goals. Since then, several 64See also 26 CFR 29 CFR Bulletin No. 2017-44 406courts have issued orders setting more pressing deadlines. For example, onMarch 10, 2017, the United States Courtof Appeals for the Seventh Circuit orderedthat, by May 1, 2017, \"the court expects tosee either a report of an agreement toresolve the case or detailed reports on theparties' respective positions. In the eventno agreement is reported on or beforeMay 1, 2017, the court will plan to sched-ule oral argument on the merits of the caseon short notice after that date\". The De-partments submitted a status report butwere unable to set forth their specic po-sition because this interim nal rule wasnot yet on public display. Instead, the De-partments informed the Court that we \"arenow considering whether further adminis-trative action would be appropriate\". Inresponse, the court extended the deadlineto June 1, 2017, again declaring the courtexpected \"to see either a report of anagreement to resolve the case or detailedreports on the parties' respective posi-tions\". The Departments were again un- able to set forth their position in that statusreport, but were able to state that the \"De-partments of Health and Human Services,Labor, and the Treasury are engaged inrulemaking to reconsider the regulationsat issue here,\" citing https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eoDetails?rrid /H11005127381. As discussed above, the Departments have concluded that, in many instances,requiring certain objecting entities or in-dividuals to choose between the Mandate,the accommodation, or penalties for non-complaince has violated RFRA. Goodcause exists to issue the expanded exemp-tion in these interim nal rules in order tocure such violations (whether among liti-gants or among similarly situated partiesthat have not litigated), to help settle orresolve cases, and to ensure, moving for-ward, that our regulations are consistentwith any approach we have taken in re-solving certain litigation matters. The Departments have also been sub- ject to temporary injunctions protectingmany religious nonprot organizationsfrom being subject to the accommodationprocess against their wishes, while manyother organizations are fully exempt, havepermanent court orders blocking the con-traceptive coverage requirement, or arenot subject to section 2713 of the PHS Actand its enforcement due to Congress' lim-ited application of that requirement. Good cause exists to change the Departments'previous rules to direct HRSA to bring itsGuidelines in accord with the legal reali-ties and remove the threat of a futureviolation of religious beliefs, includingwhere such violations are contrary to Fed-eral law. Other objecting entities similarly have not had the protection of court injunctions.This includes some nonprot entities thathave sued the Departments, but it alsoincludes some organizations that do nothave lawsuits pending against us. For ex-ample, many of the closely held for-protcompanies that brought the array of law-suits challenging the Mandate leading upto the decision in Hobby Lobby are not protected by injunctions from the currentrules, including the requirement that theyeither fully comply with the Mandate orsubject themselves to the accommodation.Continuing to apply the Mandate's regu-latory burden on individuals and organi-zations with religious beliefs against it could serve as a deterrent for citizens whomight consider forming new entities\u2014nonprot or for-prot\u2014and to offeringhealth insurance in employer-sponsoredplans or plans arranged by institutions ofhigher education. Delaying the protectionafforded by these interim nal rules wouldbe contrary to the public interest becauseit would serve to extend for many monthsthe harm caused to all entities and indi-viduals with religious objections to theMandate. Good cause exists to provideimmediate resolution to this myriad ofsituations rather than leaving them to con-tinued uncertainty, inconsistency, and costduring litigation challenging the previousrules. These interim nal rules provide a spe- cic policy resolution that courts havebeen waiting to receive from the Depart-ments for more than a year. If the Depart-ments were to publish a notice of pro-posed rulemaking instead of these interimnal rules, many more months could passbefore the current Mandate is lifted fromthe entities receiving the expanded ex-emption, during which time those entitieswould be deprived of the relief clearly setforth in these interim nal rules. In re-sponse to several of the previous rules onthis issue\u2014including three issued as in-terim nal rules under the statutory au-thority cited above\u2014the Departments received more than 100,000 public com-ments on multiple occasions. Those com-ments included extensive discussion aboutwhether and by what extent to expand theexemption. Most recently, on July 26,2016, the Departments issued a request forinformation (81 FR 47741) and receivedover 54,000 public comments about dif-ferent possible ways to resolve these is-sues. In connection with past regulations,the Departments have offered or expandeda temporary safe harbor allowing organi-zations that were not exempt from theHRSA Guidelines to operate out of com-pliance with the Guidelines. The Depart-ments will fully consider comments sub-mitted in response to these interim nalrules, but believe that good cause exists toissue the rules on an interim nal basisbefore the comments are submitted andreviewed. As the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated with respect toan earlier interim nal rule promulgated with respect to this issue in Priests for Life v. U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices, 772 F.3d 229, 276 (D.C. Cir.2014), vacated on other Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), \"[S]ev-eral reasons support HHS's decision notto engage in notice and comment here\".Among other things, the Court noted that\"the agency made a good cause nding inthe rule it issued\"; that \"the regulationsthe interim nal modies were re-cently enacted pursuant to notice andcomment rulemaking, and presented vir-tually identical issues\"; that \"HHS willexpose its interim rule to notice and com-ment before its permanent implementa-tion\"; and that \"delay in implementationof the rule would interfere with theprompt availability of contraceptive cov-erage and delay the implementation of thealternative opt-out for religious objec-tors\". Id.at 277. Delaying the availability of the ex- panded exemption would delay the abilityof those organizations and individuals toavail themselves of the relief afforded bythese interim nal rules. Good cause issupported by providing relief for entitiesand individuals for whom the Mandateoperates in violation of their sincerelyheld religious beliefs, but who would haveto experience that burden for many more Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 407months under the prior regulations if these rules are not issued on an interim nalbasis. Good cause is also supported by theeffect of these interim nal rules in bring-ing to a close the uncertainty caused byyears of litigation and regulatory changesmade under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHSAct. Issuing interim nal rules with acomment period provides the public withan opportunity to comment on whetherthese regulations expanding the exemp-tion should be made permanent or subjectto modication without delaying the ef-fective date of the regulations. Delaying the availability of the ex- panded exemption would also increase thecosts of health insurance. As reflected inlitigation pertaining to the Mandate, someentities are in grandfathered health plansthat do not cover contraception. Theywish to make changes to their health plansthat will reduce the costs of insurancecoverage for their beneciaries or policy-holders, but which would cause the plansto lose grandfathered status. They are re- fraining from making those changes\u2014andtherefore are continuing to incur and passon higher insurance costs\u2014to prevent theMandate from applying to their plans inviolation of their consciences. Issuingthese rules on an interim nal basis isnecessary in order to help reduce the costsof health insurance for such entities andtheir plan participants. These interim nal rules also set forth an optional accommodation process, andexpand eligibility for that process to abroader category of entities. Delaying theavailability of the optional accommoda-tion process would delay the ability oforganizations that do not now qualify forthe accommodation, but wish to opt intoit, to be able to do so and therefore toprovide a mechanism for contraceptivecoverage to be provided to their employ-ees while the organization's religious ob-jections are accommodated. For the foregoing reasons, the Depart- ments have determined that it would beimpracticable and contrary to the publicinterest to engage in full notice and com-ment rulemaking before putting these in-terim nal rules into effect, and that it is inthe public interest to promulgate interimnal rules. For the same reasons, the De-partments have determined, consistentwith section 553(d) of the APA (5 U.S.C.553(d)), that there is good cause to make these interim nal rules effective immedi-ately upon ling at the Ofce of the Fed- eral Register. VI. Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden We have examined the impacts of the interim nal rules as required by Execu- tive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planningand Review (September 30, 1993), Exec-utive Order 13563 on Improving Regula-tion and Regulatory Review (January 18,2011), the Regulatory Flexibility Act(RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96354), section 1102(b) of the Social Secu-rity Act, section 202 of the UnfundedMandates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22,1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999),the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C.804(2) and Executive Order 13771 on Re-ducing Regulation and Controlling Regu-latory Costs (January 30, 2017). A. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563\u2014 Department of HHS and Department ofLabor Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 di- rect agencies to assess all costs and ben- ets of available regulatory alternativesand, if regulation is necessary, to selectregulatory approaches that maximize netbenets (including potential economic,environmental, and bothcosts and benets, reducing costs, harmo-nizing rules, and promoting flexibility. Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 denes a \"signicant regulatory action\" asan action that is likely to result in a reg-ulation: (1) having an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more in anyone year, or adversely and materially af-fecting a sector of the economy, produc-tivity, competition, jobs, the environment,public health or safety, or State, local, ortribal governments or communities (alsoreferred to as \"economically signicant\");(2) creating a serious inconsistency or oth-erwise interfering with an action taken orplanned by another agency; (3) materiallyaltering the budgetary impacts of entitle-ment grants, user fees, or loan programsor the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policyissues arising out of legal mandates, thePresident's priorities, or the principles setforth in the Executive Order. A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economi-cally signicant effects ($100 million ormore in any one year), and an \"economi-cally signicant\" regulatory action is sub-ject to review by the Ofce of Manage-ment and Budget (OMB). As discussedbelow regarding anticipated effects ofthese rules and the Paperwork ReductionAct, these interim nal rules are not likelyto have economic impacts of $100 millionor more in any 1 year, and therefore do notmeet the denition of \"economically sig-nicant\" under Executive Order 12866.However, OMB has determined that theactions are signicant within the meaningof section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order.Therefore, OMB has reviewed these nalregulations, and the Departments haveprovided the following assessment of theirimpact. 1. Need for Regulatory Action These interim nal rules amend the Departments' July 2015 nal regulations to expand the exemption from the require-ment to provide coverage for contracep-tives and sterilization, established underthe HRSA Guidelines, promulgated undersection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, section715(a)(1) of the ERISA, and section9815(a)(1) of the Code, and to revise theaccommodation process to make it op-tional for eligible organizations. The ex-panded exemption would apply to individ-uals and entities that have religiousobjections to some (or all) of the contra-ceptive and/or sterilization services thatwould be covered under the Guidelines.Such action is taken, among other reasons,to provide for participation in the healthinsurance market by certain entities or in-dividuals free from penalties for violatingsincerely held religious beliefs opposed toproviding or receiving coverage of contra-ceptive services, and to resolve many ofthe lawsuits that have been led againstthe Departments. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 4082. Anticipated Effects The Departments assess this interim nal rule together with a companion in- terim nal rule concerning moral but non-religious conscientious objections to con-traception, published elsewhere in thisFederal Register. Regarding entities thatare extended an exemption, absent expan-sion of the exemption the Guidelines would require many of these entities andindividuals to either: pay for coverage ofcontraceptive services that they nd religiously objectionable; submit self-certications that would result in their issueror third party administrator paying for suchservices for their employees, which someentities also believe entangles them in theprovision of such objectionable coverage;or, pay tax penalties or be subject to otheradverse consequences for non-compliancewith these requirements. These interim nalrules remove certain associated burdens im-posed on these entities and individuals\u2014that is, by recognizing their religious objec-tions and exempting them\u2014on the basis ofsuch objections\u2014from the contraceptiveand/or sterilization coverage requirement ofthe HRSA Guidelines and making the ac-commodation process optional for eligibleorganizations. To the extent that entities choose to revoke their accommodated status tomake use of the expanded exemption im-mediately, a notice will need to be sent toenrollees (either by the entity or by theissuer or third party administrator) thattheir contraceptive coverage is changing,and guidance will reflect that such a noticerequirement is imposed no more than isalready required by preexisting rules thatrequire notices to be sent to enrollees ofchanges to coverage during a plan year. Ifthe entities wait until the start of their nextplan year to change to exempt status, in-stead of doing so during a plan year, thoseentities generally will also be able toavoid sending any supplementary noticesin addition to what they would otherwisenormally send prior to the start of a newplan year. Additionally, these interim nalrules provide such entities with an offset-ting regulatory benet by the exemptionitself and its relief of burdens on theirreligious beliefs. As discussed below, as-suming that more than half of entities thathave been using the previous accommo-dation will seek immediate revocation of their accommodated status and noticeswill be sent to all their enrollees, the totalestimated cost of sending those noticeswill be $51,990. The Departments estimate that these interim nal rules will not result in anyadditional burdens or costs on issuers orthird party administrators. As discussedbelow, the Departments believe that 109of the 209 entities making use of the ac-commodation process will instead makeuse of their newly exempt status. In con-trast, the Departments expect that a muchsmaller number (which we assume to be9) will make use of the accommodationthat were not provided access to it previ-ously. Reduced burdens for issuers andthird party administrators due to reduc-tions in use of the accommodation willmore than offset increased obligations onissuers and third party administratorsserving the fewer number of entities thatwill newly opt into the accommodation.This will lead to a net decrease in burdens and costs on issuers and third party ad-ministrators, who will no longer have con-tinuing obligations imposed on them bythe accommodation. These interim nal rules will result in some persons covered in plans of newlyexempt entities not receiving coverage orpayments for contraceptive services. TheDepartments do not have sufcient data todetermine the actual effect of these ruleson plan participants and beneciaries, in-cluding for costs they may incur for con-traceptive coverage, nor of unintendedpregnancies that may occur. As discussedabove and for reasons explained here,there are multiple levels of uncertaintyinvolved in measuring the effect of theexpanded exemption, including but notlimited to\u2014 how many entities will make use of their newly exempt status. how many entities will opt into the accommodation maintained by theserules, under which their plan participantswill continue receiving contraceptive cov-erage. which contraceptive methods some newly exempt entities will continue to pro-vide without cost-sharing despite the entityobjecting to other methods (for example, asreflected in Hobby Lobby, several objecting entities still provide coverage for 14 of the18 women's contraceptive or sterilization methods, 134 S. Ct. at 2766). how many women will be covered by plans of entities using their newly exemptstatus. which of the women covered by those plans want and would have usedcontraceptive coverage or payments forcontraceptive methods that are no longercovered by such plans. whether, given the broad availability of contraceptives and their relatively lowcost, such women will obtain and use con-traception even if it is not covered. the degree to which such women are in the category of women identied byIOM as most at risk of unintended preg-nancy. the degree to which unintended preg- nancies may result among those women,which would be attributable as an effect ofthese rules only if the women did nototherwise use contraception or a particularcontraceptive method due to their planmaking use of its newly exempt status. the degree to which such unintended pregnancies may be associated with neg- ative health effects, or whether such ef-fects may be offset by other factors, suchas the fact that those women will be oth-erwise enrolled in insurance coverage. the extent to which such women will qualify for alternative sources of contra-ceptive access, such as through a parent'sor spouse's plan, or through one of themany governmental programs that subsi-dize contraceptive coverage to supple-ment their access. The Departments have access to sources of information discussed in thefollowing paragraphs that are relevant tothis issue, but those sources do not pro-vide a full picture of the impact of theseinterim nal rules. First, the prior rules already exempted certain houses of worship and their inte-grated auxiliaries. Further, as discussedabove, the prior accommodation processallows hundreds of additional religiousnonprot organizations in self-insuredchurch plans that are exempt from ERISAto le a self-certication or notice thatrelieves not only themselves but, in effect,their third party administrators of any ob-ligation to provide contraceptive coverageor payments. Although in the latter case,third party administrators are legally per- Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 409mitted to provide the coverage, several self-insured church plans themselves haveexpressed an objection in litigation to al-lowing such contraceptive coverage to beprovided, and according to informationreceived during litigation, it appears thatsuch contraceptive coverage has not beenprovided. In addition, a signicant portionof the lawsuits challenging the Mandatewere brought by a single rm representingCatholic dioceses and related entitiescovered by their diocese-sponsored plans.In that litigation, the Departments tookthe position that, where those diocese-sponsored plans are self-insured, thoseplans are likely church plans exempt fromERISA. 65For the purposes of considering whether the expanded exemption in these rules affects the persons covered by suchdiocese-sponsored plans, the Departmentscontinue to assume that such plans aresimilar to other objecting entities usingself-insured church plans with respect totheir third party administrators being un-likely to provide contraceptive coverageto plan participants and beneciaries un-der the previous rule. Therefore the De-partments estimate that these interim nalrules have no signicant effect on the con-traceptive coverage of women covered byplans of houses of worship and their inte-grated auxiliaries, entities using a self-insured church plan, or church diocesessponsoring self-insured plans. It is possible that an even greater num- ber of litigating or accommodated plansmight have made use of self-insuredchurch plan status under the previous ac-commodation. Notably, one of the largestnonprot employers that had led suitchallenging the Mandate had, under theseprior rules, shifted most of their employ-ees into self-insured church plans, and theDepartments have taken the position thatvarious other employers that led suit were eligible to assume self-insured church planstatus. 66The Supreme Court's recent deci- sion in Advocate Health Care Network , while not involving this Mandate, also clar- ies certain circumstances under which re-ligious hospitals may be eligible for self-insured church plan status. See 137 S. Ct. at1656-57, 1663 (holding that a church planunder ERISA can be a plan not establishedand maintained by a church, if it is main-tained by a principal-purpose organization). Second, when the Departments previ- ously created the exemption, expanded its application, and provided an accommoda-tion (which, as mentioned, can lift obliga-tions on self-insured church plans forhundreds of nonprot organizations), we concluded that no signicant burden or costswould result at all. (76 FR 46625; 78 FR39889.) We reached this conclusion despitethe impact, just described, whereby the pre-vious rule apparently lead to women notreceiving contraceptive coverage throughhundreds of nonprot entities using self-insured church plans. We also reached thisconclusion without counting any signicantburden or cost to some women covered inthe plans of houses of worship or integratedauxiliaries that might want contraceptivecoverage. This conclusion was based in parton the assertion, set forth in previous regu-lations, that employees of houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries likely share theiremployers' opposition to contraception.Many other religious nonprot entities,however, both adopt and implement reli-gious principles with similar fervency. Forthe reasons discussed above, the Depart-ments no longer believe we can distinguishmany of the women covered in the plans ofreligious nonprot entities from the womencovered in the plans of houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries regarding whichthe Departments assumed share their em- ployers' objection to contraception, norfrom women covered in the plans of reli-gious entities using self-insured churchplans regarding which we chose not to cal-culate any anticipated effect even though weconceded we were not requiring their thirdparty administrators to provide contracep-tive coverage. In the estimates and assump-tions below, we include the potential effectof these interim rules on women covered bysuch entities, in order to capture all of theanticipated effects of these rules. Third, these interim nal rules extend the exemption to for-prot entities. Among thefor-prot employers that led suit challeng-ing the Mandate, the one with the mostemployees was Hobby Lobby. 67As noted above, and like some similar entities, the plaintiffs in Hobby Lobby were willing to provide coverage with no cost sharing ofvarious contraceptive services: 14 of 18FDA-approved women's contraceptive andsterilization methods. 68(134 S. Ct. at 2766.) The effect of expanding the exemption tofor-prot entities is therefore mitigated tothe extent many of the persons covered bysuch entities' plans may receive coveragefor at least some contraceptive services. Nopublicly traded for-prot entities have ledlawsuits challenging the Mandate. The De-partments agree with the Supreme Court'sexpectation in this regard: \"it seems unlikelythat the sort of corporate giants to whichHHS refers will often assert RFRA claims.HHS has not pointed to any example of apublicly traded corporation asserting RFRArights, and numerous practical restraintswould likely prevent that from occurring.For example, the idea that unrelated share-holders\u2014including institutional investorswith their own set of stakeholders\u2014wouldagree to run a corporation under the samereligious beliefs seems improbable\".

See 134 S. Ct. at 2765-66. Hobby Lobby was willing to cover: sterilization surgery for women; sterilization implant for women; with cap with spermicide; female condom; spermicide alone. Id.Among women using these 18 female contraceptive methods, 85 percent use the 14 methods that Hobby Lobby and entities with similar beliefs were willing to cover (22,446,000 out of 26,436,000), and \"[t]he pilland female sterilization have been the two most commonly used methods since 1982.\" See Guttmacher Institute, \"Contraceptive Use in the United States\" (Sept. 2016), available athttps://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 410Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774. Therefore, al- though publicly traded entities could makeuse of exempt status under these interimnal rules, the Departments do not expectthat very many will do so, as compared tothe 87 religious closely held for-prot enti-ties that brought litigation challenging theMandate (some of which might be contentwith the accommodation). Fourth, the Departments have a limited amount of information about entities thathave made use of the accommodation pro-cess as set forth in the previous rules.HHS previously estimated that 209 enti-ties would make use of the accommoda-tion process. That estimate was based onHHS's observation in its August 2014 in-terim nal rules and July 2015 nal reg-ulations that there were 122 eligible enti-ties that had led litigation challengingthe accommodation process, and 87closely held for-prot entities that hadled suit challenging the gen-eral. (79 FR 51096; 80 FR 41336). TheDepartments acknowledged that entities that had not litigated might make use ofthe accommodation, but we stated we didnot have better data to estimate how manymight use the accommodation overall. After issuing those rules, the Depart- ments have not received complete data onthe number of entities actually using theaccommodation, because the accommoda-tion does not require many accommodatedentities to submit information to us. Ourlimited records indicate that approxi-mately 63 entities have afrmatively sub-mitted notices to HHS to use the accom-modation. This includes some fullyinsured and some self-insured plans, but itdoes not include entities that may haveused the accommodation by submitting anEBSA form 700 self-certication directlyto their issuer or third party administrator.We have deemed some other entities asbeing subject to the accommodationthrough their litigation lings, but thatmight not have led to contraceptive cov-erage being provided to persons coveredin some of those plans, either because theyare exempt as houses of worship or inte-grated auxiliaries, they are in self-insuredchurch plans, or we were not aware oftheir issuers or third party administratorsso as to send them letters obligating themto provide such coverage. Our recordsalso indicate that 60 plans used the con-traceptive user fees adjustments in the 2015 plan year, the last year for which wehave data. This includes only self-insuredplans, and it includes some plans that self-certied through submitting notices andother plans that, presumably, self-certiedthrough the EBSA form 700. These sets of data are not inconsistent with our previous estimate that 209 entitieswould use the accommodation, but they in-dicate that some non-litigating entities usedthe accommodation, and some litigating en-tities did not, possibly amounting to a sim-ilar number. For this reason, and because wedo not have more complete data available,we believe the previous estimate of 209accommodated entities is still the best esti-mate available for how many entities haveused the accommodation under the previousrule. This assumes that the number of liti-gating entities that did not use the accom-modation is approximately the same as thenumber of non-litigating entities that did useit. In considering how many entities will use the voluntary accommodation moving forward\u2014and how many will use the ex-panded exemption\u2014we also do not havespecic data. We expect the 122 nonprotentities that specically challenged the ac-commodation in court to use the expandedexemption. But, as noted above, we be-lieve a signicant number of them are notpresently participating in the accommoda-tion, and that some nonprot entities inself-insured church plans are not provid-ing contraceptive coverage through theirthird party administrators even if they areusing the accommodation. Among the 87for-prot entities that led suit challeng-ing the Mandate in general, few if anyled suit challenging the accommodation.We do not know how many of those en-tities are using the accommodation, howmany may be complying with the Man-date fully, how many may be relying oncourt injunctions to do neither, or howmany will use the expanded exemptionmoving forward. Among entities thatnever litigated but used the accommoda-tion, we expect many but not all of themto continue using the accommodation, andwe do not have data to estimate how manysuch entities there are or how many willchoose either option. Overall, therefore, without sufcient data to estimate what the estimated 209previously accommodated entities will do under these interim nal rules, we assumethat just over half of them will use theexpanded exemption, and just under halfwill continue their accommodated statusunder the voluntary process set forth inthese rules. Specically, we assume that109 previously accommodated entitieswill make use of their exempt status, and100 will continue using the accommoda-tion. This estimate is based in part on ourview that most litigating nonprot entitieswould prefer the exemption to the accom-modation, but that many of either have notbeen using the accommodation or, if theyhave been using it, it is not providingcontraceptive coverage for women in theirplans where they participate in self-insured church plans. This estimate is alsoconsistent with our lack of knowledge ofhow many for-prot entities were usingthe accommodation and will choose theexemption or the accommodation, giventhat many of them did not bring legalchallenges against the accommodation af- terHobby Lobby. This estimate is further consistent with our view, explained inmore detail below, that some entities thatare using the accommodation and did notbring litigation will use the exemption, butmany accommodated, non-litigating enti-ties\u2014including the ones with the largestrelative workforces accommo-dated entities\u2014will continue using the ac-commodation. The Departments recog-nize that we do not have better data toestimate the effects of these interim nalrules on such entities. In addition to these factors, we recog- nize that the expanded exemption and ac-commodation are newly available to reli-gious for-prot entities that are not closelyheld and some other plan sponsors. Asexplained above, the Departments believereligious for-prot entities that are notclosely held may exist, or may wish tocome into being. HHS does not anticipatethat there will be signicant number ofsuch entities, and among those, we believethat very few if any will use the accom-modation. All of the for-prot entities thathave challenged the Mandate have beenreligious closely held entities. It is also possible that religious non- prot or closely held for-prot entitiesthat were already eligible for the accom-modation but did not previously use it will Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 411opt into it moving forward, but because they could have done so under the previ-ous rules, their opting into the accommo-dation is not caused by these rules. Without any data to estimate how many of any entities newly eligible forand interested in using the accommoda-tion might exist, HHS assumes for thepurposes of estimating the anticipated ef-fect of these rules that less than 10 entities(9) will do so. Therefore, we estimate that 109 entities will use the voluntary accom-modation moving forward, 100 of whichwere already using the previous accom-modation, and that 109 entities that havebeen using the previous accommodationwill use the expanded exemption instead. Fifth, in attempting to estimate the an- ticipated effect of these interim nal ruleson women receiving contraceptive cover-age, the Departments have limited infor-mation about the entities that have ledsuit challenging the Mandate. Approxi-mately 209 entities have brought suit chal-lenging the Mandate over more than 5years. They have included a broad rangeof nonprot entities and closely held for-prot entities. We discuss a number ofpotentially relevant points: First, the Departments do not believe that out-of-pocket litigation costs havebeen a signicant barrier to entities choos-ing to le suit. Based on the Departments'knowledge of these cases through publicsources and litigation, nearly all the enti-ties were represented pro bono and weresubject to little or no discovery during thecases, and multiple public interest lawrms publicly provided legal services forentities willing to challenge the Man-date. 69(It is noteworthy, however, that such pro bono arrangements and minimi-zation of discovery do not eliminate 100 percent of the time costs of participatingin litigation or, as discussed in more detailbelow, the potential for negative publicity.Both concerns could have dissuaded par-ticipation in lawsuits, and the potential fornegative publicity may also dissuade par-ticipation in the expanded exemptions.) Second, prior to the Affordable Care Act, the vast majority of entities alreadycovered contraception, albeit not always without cost-sharing The Departments donot have data to indicate why entities thatdid not cover contraception prior to theAffordable Care Act chose not to cover it.As noted above, however, the Departmentshave maintained that compliance with thecontraceptive Mandate is cost-neutral to is-suers, which indicates that no signicantnancial incentive exists to omit contracep-tive coverage. As indicated by the report byHHS ASPE discussed above, we have as-sumed that millions of women received pre-ventive services after the Mandate went intoeffect because nearly all entities compliedwith the Guidelines. We are not aware ofexpressions from most of those entities in-dicating that they would have sincerely heldreligious objections to complying with theMandate, and therefore that they wouldmake use of the expanded exemption pro-vided here. Third, omitting contraceptive coverage has subjected some entities to serious pub-lic criticism and in some cases organizedboycotts or opposition campaigns thathave been reported in various media andonline outlets regarding entities that haveled suit. The Departments expect thateven if some entities might not receivesuch criticism, many entities will be re-luctant to use the expanded exemptionunless they are committed to their views to a signicant degree. Overall, the Departments do not know how many entities will use the expandedexemption. We expect that some non-litigating entities will use it, but given theaforementioned considerations, we believeit might not be very many more. Moreover,many litigating entities are already exemptor are not providing contraceptive coverageto women in their plans due to their partic- ipating in self-insured church plans, so theeffect of the expanded exemption amonglitigating entities is signicantly lower thanit would be if all the women in their planswere already receiving the coverage. To calculate the anticipated effects of this rule on contraceptive coverage amongwomen covered by plans provided by liti-gating entities, we start by examining courtdocuments and other public sources. 70 These sources provide some information,albeit incomplete, about how many peopleare employed by these entities. As notedabove, however, contraceptive coverageamong the employees of many litigatingentities will not be affected by these rulesbecause some litigating entities were ex-empt under the prior rule, while others wereor appeared to be in self-insured churchplans so that women covered in their planswere already not receiving contraceptivecoverage. Among litigating entities that were nei- ther exempt nor likely using self-insuredchurch plans, our best estimate based oncourt documents and public sources is thatsuch entities employed approximately65,000 persons, male and female. 71The average number of workers at rms offer- ing health benets that are actually cov-ered by those benets is 62 percent. 72This 69See, for example, Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, \"Award-winning attorney 'humbled' by recognition,\" Pittsburgh Catholic (\"Jones Day is doing the cases 'pro bono,' or voluntarily and without payment.\") (quoting Paul M. Pohl, Partner, Jones Day), available at http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/award-winning-attorney-humbled-recognition; \"Little Sisters Fight for Religious Freedom,\" National Review (Oct. 2, 2013) (\"the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty is representing us pro bono, as they do all their clients.\") (quoting Sister Constance Veit, L.S.P., communications director for the Little Sisters of the Poor), available at http://www.nationalreview.com/article/360103/little-sisters-ght-religious-freedom-interview; Suzanne Cassidy,\"Meet the major legal players in the Conestoga Wood Specialties Supreme Court case,\" LancasterOnline (Mar. 25, 2014) (\"Cortman and the other lawyers arguing on behalf of Conestoga Wood Specialties and Hobby Lobby are offering their services pro bono.\"), available at http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/meet-the-major-legal-players-in-the-conestoga-wood-specialties/article_302bc8e2-b379-11e3-b669-001a4bcf6878.html. 70Where complaints, afdavits, or other documents led in court did not indicate the number of employees that work for an entity, and that entity was not apparently exempt as a house of worship or integrated auxiliary, and it was not using the kind of plan that we have stated in litigation qualies for self-insured church plan status (see, for example, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius, 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)), we examined employment data contained in some IRS form W-3's that are publicly available online for certainnonprot groups, and looked at other websites discussing the number of people employed at certain entities. 71In a small number of lawsuits, named plaintiffs include organizations claiming to have members that seek an exemption. We have very little information about the number, size, and types of entities those members. Based on limited information from those cases, however, their membership appears to consist mainly, although not entirely, of houses of worship, integratedauxiliaries, and participants in self-insured plans of churches. As explained above, the contraceptive coverage of women covered by such plans is not likely to be affected by the expandedexemption in these rules. However, to account for plans subject to contraceptive coverage obligations among those members we have added 10,000 to our estimate of the number of personsamong litigants that may be impacted by these rules. 72See Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets: 2017 Annual Survey\" at 57, available Employer-Health-Benets-Annual-Survey-2017. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 412amounts to approximately 34,000 em- ployees covered under those plans. DOLestimates that for each employee policy-holder, there is approximately one depen-dent. 73This amounts to approximately 68,000 covered persons. Census data in- dicate that women of childbearing age\u2014that is, women aged 15-44\u2014compose20.2 percent of the general population. 74 In addition, approximately 44.3 percent ofwomen of childbearing age use women'scontraceptive methods covered by theGuidelines. 75Therefore, we estimate that approximately 7,221 women of childbear-ing age that use contraception covered bythe Guidelines are covered by employersponsored plans of entities that have ledlawsuits challenging the Mandate, wherethose plans are neither exempt under theprior rule nor are self-insured churchplans. We also estimate that for the educa- tional institutions objecting to the Man-date as applied to student coverage thatthey arranged, where the entities were nei-ther exempt under the prior rule nor weretheir student plans self-insured, such stu-dent plans likely covered approximately3,300 students. On average, we expectthat approximately half of those students(1,650) are female. For the purposes ofthis estimate, we also assume that femalepolicyholders covered by plans arrangedby institutions of higher education arewomen of childbearing age. We expectthat they would have less than the averagenumber of dependents per policyholderthan exists in standard plans, but for thepurposes of providing an upper bound tothis estimate, we assume that they wouldhave an average of one dependent perpolicyholder, thus bringing the number of policyholders and dependents back up to3,300. Many of those dependents arelikely not to be women of childbearingage, but in order to provide an upper bound to this estimate, we assume theyare. Therefore, for the purposes of thisestimate, we assume that the effect ofthese expanded exemptions on studentplans of litigating entities includes 3,300women. Assuming that 44.3 perecent ofsuch women use contraception covered bythe Guidelines, 76we estimate that 1,462 of those women would be affected bythese rules. Together, this leads the Departments to estimate that approximately 8,700 womenof childbearing age may have their contra-ception costs affected by plans of litigatingentities using these expanded exemptions.As noted above, the Departments do nothave data indicating how many of thosewomen agree with their employers' or edu-cational institutions' opposition to contra-ception (so that fewer of them than thenational average might actually use contra-ception). Nor do we know how many wouldhave alternative contraceptive access from aparent's or spouse's plan, or from Federal,State, or local governmental programs, norhow many of those women would fall in thecategory of being most at risk of unintendedpregnancy, nor how many of those entitieswould provide some contraception in theirplans while only objecting to certain contra-ceptives. Sixth, in a brief led in the Zubik liti- gation, the Departments stated that \"in2014, [HHS] provided user-fee reductionsto compensate TPAs for making contra-ceptive coverage available to more than600,000 employees and beneciaries,\" and that \"[t]hat gure includes both menand women covered under the relevantplans.\" 77HHS has reviewed the informa- tion giving rise to that estimate, and has received updated information for 2015. In2014, 612,000 persons were covered byplans claiming contraceptive user fees ad-justments, and in 2015, 576,000 personswere covered by such plans. These num-bers include all persons in such plans, notjust women of childbearing age. HHS's information indicates that reli- gious nonprot hospitals or health sponsored a signicant minority ofthe accommodated self-insured plans thatwere using contraceptive user fees adjust-ments, yet those plans covered more than80 percent of the persons covered in allplans using contraceptive user fees adjust-ments. Some of those plans cover nearly100,000 persons each, and several otherscover approximately 40,000 persons each.In other words, these plans were propor-tionately much larger than the plans pro-vided by other entities using the contra-ceptive user fees adjustments. There are two reasons to believe that a signicant fraction of the persons coveredby previously accommodated plans pro-vided by religious nonprot hospitals orhealth systems may not be affected by theexpanded exemption. A broad range ofreligious hospitals or health systems havepublicly indicated that they do not consci-entiously oppose participating in the ac-commodation. 78Of course, some of these religious hospitals or health systems mayopt for the expanded exemption underthese interim nal rules, but others mightnot. In addition, among plans of religious 73\"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21.

The Guidelines' requirement of contraceptive coverage only applies \"for all women with reproductive capacity.\" https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/; also, see 80 FR 40318. In addition, studies commonly consider the 15-44 age range to assess contraceptive use by women of childbearing age. See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, \"Contraceptive Use in the United States\" (Sept. 2016), availableat https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states (reporting that of 60,877,000 women aged 15-44, 26,945,000 use women's contraceptive methods covered by the Guidelines). 76It would appear that a smaller percentage of college-aged women use contraception\u2014and use more expensive methods such as long acting methods or sterilization\u2014than among other women of childbearing age. SeeNCHS Data Brief, \"Current Contraceptive Status Among Women Aged 15-44: United States, 2011-2013\" (Dec. 2014), available at https://www.cdc.gov/ nchs/data/databriefs/db173.pdf. of 18-19 & n.7, Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14-1418, et al. (U.S. led Feb. 10, 2016). The actual number is 612,487. 78See, for example, https://www.chausa.org/newsroom/women%27s-preventive-health-services-nal-rule (\"HHS has now established an accommodation that will allow our ministries to continue offering health insurance plans for their employees as they have always done. . .. We are pleased that our members now have an accommodation that will not require them to contract,provide, pay or refer for contraceptive coverage. . .. We will work with our members to implement this accommodation.\") In comments submitted in previous rules concerning this Mandate,the Catholic Health Association has stated it \"is the national leadership organization for the Catholic health ministry, consisting of more than 2,000 Catholic health care sponsors, systems,hospitals, long-term care facilities, and related organizations. Our ministry is represented in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\" Comments on CMS-9968-ANPRM (dated June 15,2012). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 413nonprot hospitals or health systems, some have indicated that they might beeligible for status as a self-insured churchplan. 79As discussed above, some litigants challenging the Mandate have appeared,after their complaints were led, to makeuse of self-insured church plan status. 80 (The Departments take no view on thestatus of these particular plans underERISA, but simply make this observationfor the purpose of seeking to estimate theimpact of these interim nal rules.) Nev-ertheless, overall it seems likely that manyof the remaining religious hospital orhealth systems plans previously using theaccommodation will continue to opt intothe voluntary accommodation under theseinterim nal rules, under which their em-ployees will still receive contraceptivecoverage. To the extent that plans of reli-gious hospitals or health systems are ableto make use of self-insured church planstatus, the previous accommodation rulewould already have allowed them to re-lieve themselves and their third party ad-ministrators of obligations to provide con-traceptive coverage or payments.Therefore, in such situations these interimnal rules would not have an anticipatedeffect on the contraceptive coverage ofwomen in those plans. Considering all these data points and limitations, the Departments offer the fol-lowing estimate of the number of womenwho will be impacted by the expandedexemption in these interim nal rules. TheDepartments begin with the 8,700 women of childbearing age that use contraceptionwho we estimate will be affected by use ofthe expanded exemption among litigatingentities. In addition to that number, wecalculate the following number of womenaffected by accommodated entities expanded exemption. As noted above,approximately 576,000 plan participantsand beneciaries were covered by self-insured plans that received contraceptiveuser fee adjustments in 2014. Althoughadditional self-insured entities may haveparticipated in the accommodation with-out making use of contraceptive user feesadjustments, we do not know what num- ber of entities did so. We consider it likelythat self-insured entities with relativelylarger numbers of covered persons hadsufcient nancial incentive to make useof the contraceptive user fees adjustments.Therefore, without better data available,we assume that the number of personscovered by self-insured plans using con-traceptive user fees adjustments approxi-mates the number of persons covered byall self-insured plans using the accommo-dation. An additional but unknown number of persons were likely covered in fully in-sured plans using the accommodation.The Departments do not have data on howmany fully insured plans have been usingthe accommodation, nor on how manypersons were covered by those plans.DOL estimates that, among persons cov-ered by employer sponsored insurance,56.1 percent are covered by self-insuredplans and 43.9 percent are covered byfully insured sponding to the 576,000 persons coveredby self-insured plans using user fee ad-justments, we estimate an additional451,000 persons were covered by fullyinsured plans using the accommodation.This yields an estimate of 1,027,000 cov-ered persons of all ages and sexes in plansusing the previous accommodation. As discussed below, and recognizing the limited data available for our esti-mates, the Departments estimate that 100of the 209 entities that were using the accommodation under the prior rule willcontinue to opt into it under these interimnal rules. Notably, however, the dataconcerning accommodated self-insuredplans indicates that plans sponsored byreligious hospitals and health systems en-compass more than 80 percent of the per-sons covered in such plans. In otherwords, plans sponsored by such entitieshave a proportionately larger number ofcovered persons than do plans sponsoredby other accommodated entities, whichhave smaller numbers of covered persons.As also cited above, many religious hos-pitals and health systems have indicated that they do not object to the accommo-dation, and some of those entities mightalso qualify as self-insured church plans,so that these interim nal rules would notimpact the contraceptive coverage theiremployees receive. We do not have spe-cic data on which plans of which sizeswill actually continue to opt into the ac-commodation, nor how many will makeuse of self-insured church plan status. Weassume that the proportions of coveredpersons in self-insured plans using contra-ceptive user fees adjustments also apply infully insured plans, for which we lackrepresentative data. Based on these as-sumptions and without better data avail-able, we assume that the 100 accommo-dated entities that will remain in theaccommodation will account for 75 per-cent of all the persons previously coveredin accommodated plans. In comparison,we assume the 109 accommodated entitiesthat will make use of the expanded ex-emption will encompass 25 percent ofpersons previously covered in accommo-dated plans. Applying these percentages to the total number of 1,027,000 persons we estimateare covered in accommodated plans, weestimate that approximately 257,000 per-sons previously covered in accommodatedplans will be covered in the 109 plans thatuse the expanded exemption, and 770,000persons will be covered in the estimated100 plans that continue to use the accom-modation. According to the Census data cited above, 20.2 percent of these personsare women of childbearing age, whichamounts to approximately 51,900 womenof childbearing age in previously accom-modated plans that we estimate will usethe expanded exemption. As noted above,approximately 44.3 percent of women ofchildbearing age use women's contracep-tive methods covered by the Guidelines,so that we expect approximately 23,000women that use contraception covered bythe Guidelines to be affected by accom-modated entities using the expanded ex-emption. 79See, for example, Brief of the Catholic Health Association of the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioners, Advocate 16-74, 16-86, 16-258, 2017 371934 at *1 (U.S. led Jan. 24, 2017) (\"CHA members have relied for decades that the 'church exemption contained in\" ERISA.).

October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 414It is not clear the extent to which this number overlaps with the number esti- mated above of 8,700 women in plans oflitigating entities that may be affected bythese rules. Based on our limited informa-tion from the litigation and accommoda-tion notices, we expect that the overlap issignicant. Nevertheless, in order to esti-mate the possible effects of these rules, weassume there is no overlap between thesetwo numbers, and therefore that these in-terim nal rules would affect the contra-ceptive costs of approximately 31,700women. Under the assumptions just discussed, the number of women whose contracep-tive costs will be impacted by the ex-panded exemption in these interim nalrules is less than 0.1 percent of the 55.6million women in private plans that HHSASPE estimated 82receive preventive ser- vices coverage under the Guidelines. In order to estimate the cost of contra- ception to women affected by the ex-panded exemption, the Departments areaware that, under the prior accommoda-tion process, the total user fee adjustmentamount for self-insured plans for the 2015benet year was $33 million. These ad-justments covered the cost of contracep-tive coverage provided to women partici-pants and beneciaries in self-insuredplans where the employer objected andmade use of the accommodation, andwhere an authorizing exception underOMB Circular No. A-25R was in effect asthe Secretary of the Department of Healthand Human Services requests. Nine per-cent of that amount was attributable toadministrative costs and margin, accord-ing to the provisions of 45 CFR156.50(d)(3)(ii). Thus the amount of theadjustments attributable to the cost of con-traceptive services was about $30 million.As discussed above, in 2015 that amountcorresponded to 576,000 persons coveredby such plans. Among those persons, ascited above, approximately 20.2 percenton average were women of childbearingage\u2014that is, approximately 116,000women. As noted above, approximately44.3 percent of women of childbearingage use women's contraceptive methodscovered by the Guidelines, which includes51,400 women in those plans. Therefore,entities using contraceptive user fees ad-justments received approximately $584per year per woman of childbearing agethat use contraception covered by theGuidelines and are covered in their plans. As discussed above, the Departments estimate that the expanded exemptionswill impact the contraceptive costs of ap-proximately 31,700 women of childbear-ing age that use contraception covered bythe Guidelines. At an average of $584 peryear, the nancial transfer effects attribut-able to the interim nal rules on thosewomen would be approximately $18.5million. 8384To account for uncertainty in the esti- mate, we conducted a second analysis us-ing an alternative framework, in order tothoroughly consider the possible upperbound economic impact of these interimnal rules. As noted above, the HHS ASPE report estimated that 55.6 million women aged15 to 64 and covered by private insurancehad preventive services coverage underthe Affordable Care Act. Approximately16.2 percent of those women were en-rolled in plans on exchanges or were oth-erwise not covered by employer spon-sored insurance, so only 46.6 millionwomen aged 15 to 64 received the cover-age through employer sponsored privateinsurance plans. 85In addition, some of those private insurance plans were offeredby government employers, encompassingapproximately 10.5 million of thosewomen aged 15 to 64. 86The expanded exemption in these interim nal rules doesnot apply to government plan sponsors.Thus we estimate that the number ofwomen aged 15 to 64 covered by privatesector employer sponsored insurance whoreceive preventive services coverage un-der the Affordable Care Act is approxi-mately 36 million. Prior to the implementation of the Af- fordable Care Act, approximately 6 per-cent of employer survey respondents didnot offer contraceptive coverage, with 31percent of respondents not knowing 82Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/affordable-care-act-improving-access-preventive-services-millions-americans; also, see Abridged Report, available at https://www.womenspre - ventivehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/WPSI_2016AbridgedReport.pdf. 83As noted above, the Departments have taken the position that providing contraceptive coverage is cost neutral to issuers. (78 FR 39877). At the same time, because of the up-front costs of some contraceptive or sterilization methods, and because some entities did not cover contraception prior to the Affordable Care Act, premiums may be expected to adjust to reflect changes in coverage, thus partially offsetting the transfer experienced by women who use the affected contraceptives. As discussed elsewhere in this analysis, such women may make up approximately8.9 percent (/H11005 20.2 percent x 44.3 percent) of the covered population, in which case the offset would also be approximately 8.9 percent. 84Describing this impact as a transfer reflects an implicit assumption that the same products and services would be used with or without the rule. Such an assumption is somewhat oversimplied because the interim nal rules shift cost burden to consumption decision-makers (that is, the women who choose whether or not to use the relevant contraceptives) and thuscan be expected to lead to some decrease in use of the affected drugs and devices and a potential increase in pregnancy\u2014thus leading to a decrease and an increase, respectively, in medicalexpenditures. 85Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/les/pdf/139221/The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20is%20Improving%20Access%20to%20Preventive%20Services%20for%20 Millions%20of%20Americans.pdf. 86The ASPE study relied on Census data of private health insurance plans, which included plans sponsored by either private or public sector employers. See Table 2, notes2&3(explaining the scope of private plans and government plans for purposes of Table 2), available at https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-250.pdf. According to data tables from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of HHS (https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/), State and local governments employ 19,297,960 persons; 99.2 percent of those employers offer health insurance; and 67.4 percent of employees that work at such entities where insurance is offered areenrolled in those plans, amounting to 12.9 million persons enrolled. DOL estimates that in the public sector, for each policyholder there is an average of slightly less than one dependent.\"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21. https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/les/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2015.pdf. There-fore, State and local government employer plans cover approximately 24.8 million persons of all ages. Census data indicates that on average, 12 percent of persons covered by privateinsurance plans are aged 65 and older. Using these numbers, we estimate that State and local government employer plans cover approximately 21.9 million persons under age 65. The Federal Government has approximately 8.2 million persons covered in its employee health plans. According to information we received from the Ofce of Personnel Management, this includes 2.1 million employees having 3.2 million dependents, and 1.9 million retirees (annuitants) having 1 million dependents. We do not have information about the ages of thesepolicyholders and dependents, but for the purposes of this estimate we assume the annuitants and their dependents are aged 65 or older and the employees and their dependents are underage 65, so that the Federal Government's employee health plans cover 5.3 million persons under age 65. Thus, overall we estimate there are 27.2 million persons under age 65 enrolled in private health insurance sponsored by government employers. Of those, 38.3 percent are women aged 15-64, that is, 10.5 million. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 415whether they offered such coverage.87 The 6 percent may have included approx- imately 2.16 million of the women aged15-64 covered by employer sponsored in-surance plans in the private sector. Ac-cording to Census data, 59.9 percent ofwomen aged 15 to 64 are of childbearing age (aged 15 to 44), in this case, 1.3million. And as noted above, approxi-mately 44.3 percent of women of child-bearing age use women's contraceptivemethods covered by the Guidelines.Therefore we estimate that 574,000women of childbearing age that use con-traceptives covered by the Guidelineswere covered by plans that omitted con-traceptive coverage prior to the Afford-able Care Act. 88 It is unknown what motivated those employers to omit contraceptive cover-age\u2014whether they did so for conscien-tious reasons, or for other reasons. Despiteour lack of information about their mo-tives, we attempt to make a reasonableestimate of the upper bound of the numberof those employers that omitted contra-ception before the Affordable Care Actand that would make use of these ex-panded exemptions based on sincerelyheld religious beliefs. To begin, we estimate that publicly traded companies would not likely makeuse of these expanded exemptions. Eventhough the rule does not preclude publiclytraded companies from dropping coveragebased on a sincerely held religious belief,it is likely that attempts to object on reli-gious grounds by publicly traded compa-nies would be rare. The Departments takenote of the Supreme Court's decision inHobby Lobby, where the Court observed that \"HHS has not pointed to any exampleof a publicly traded corporation assertingRFRA rights, and numerous practical re-straints would likely prevent that fromoccurring. For example, the idea that un-related shareholders\u2014including institu-tional investors with their own set ofstakeholders\u2014would agree to run a cor- poration under the same religious beliefsseems improbable\". 134 S. Ct. at 2774.The Departments are aware of severalFederal health care conscience laws 89that in some cases have existed for decadesand that protect companies, includingpublicly traded companies, from discrim-ination if, for example, they decline tofacilitate abortion, but we are not aware ofexamples where publicly traded compa-nies have made use of these exemptions.Thus, while we consider it important toinclude publicly traded companies in thescope of these expanded exemptions forreasons similar to those used by the Con-gress in RFRA and some health care con-science laws, in estimating the anticipatedeffects of the expanded exemptions weagree with the Supreme Court that it isimprobable any will do so. This assumption is signicant because 31.3 percent of employees in the privatesector work for publicly traded compa-nies. 90That means that only approxi- mately 394,000 women aged 15 to 44 thatuse contraceptives covered by the Guide- lines were covered by plans of non-publiclytraded companies that did not provide con-traceptive coverage pre-Affordable CareAct.Moreover, these interim nal rules build on existing rules that already exempt houses of worship and integrated auxilia-ries and, as explained above, effectivelyremove obligations to provide contracep-tive coverage within objecting self-insured church plans. These rules will therefore not effect transfers to women inthe plans of such employers. In attemptingto estimate the number of such employers,we consider the following information.Many Catholic dioceses have litigated orled public comments opposing the Man-date, representing to the Departments andto courts around the country that ofcialCatholic Church teaching opposes contra-ception. There are 17,651 Catholic par-ishes in the United States 91, 197 Catholic dioceses,925,224 Catholic elementary schools, and 1,205 Catholic secondaryschools. 93Not all Catholic schools are integrated auxiliaries of Catholicchurches, but there are other Catholicentities that are integrated auxiliariesthat are not schools, so we use the num-ber of schools to estimate of the numberof integrated auxiliaries. Among self-insured church plans that oppose theMandate, the Department has been suedby two\u2014Guidestone and ChristianBrothers. Guidestone is a plan organizedby the Southern Baptist convention. Itcovers 38,000 employers, some ofwhich are exempt as churches or inte-grated auxiliaries, and some of whichare not. 94Christian Brothers is a plan that covers Catholic organizations. Itcovers Catholic churches and integratedauxiliaries, which are estimated above,but also it has said in litigation that it 87Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2010 Annual Survey\" at 196, available at https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.les.wordpress - .com/2013/04/8085.pdf. 88Some of the 31 percent of survey respondents that did not know about contraceptive coverage may not have offered such coverage. If it were possible to account for this non-coverage, the estimate of potentially affected covered women could increase. On the other hand, these employers' lack of knowledge about contraceptive coverage suggests that they lacked sincerely held religious beliefs specically objecting to such coverage\u2014beliefs without which they would not qualify for the expanded exemptions offered by these rules. In that case, omission ofsuch employers and covered women from this estimation approach would be appropriate. Correspondingly, the 6 percent of employers that had direct knowledge about the absence ofcoverage may be more likely to have omitted such coverage on the basis of religious beliefs than were the 31 percent of survey respondents who did not know whether the coverage wasoffered. Yet an entity's mere knowledge about its coverage status does not itself reflect its motive for omitting coverage. In responding to the survey, the entity may have simply examinedits plan document to determine whether or not contraceptive coverage was offered. As will be relevant in a later portion of the analysis, we have no data indicating what portion of the entitiesthat omitted contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act did so on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs, as opposed to doing so for other reasons that would not qualify themfor the expanded exemption offered in these interim nal rules. 89For example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b), 42 U.S.C. 238n, and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31. 90John Asker, et al., \"Corporate Investment and Stock Market Listing: A Puzzle?\" 28 Review of Financial Studies Issue 2, at 342-390 (Oct. 7, 2014), available at https://doi.org/10.1093/ rfs/hhu077. This is true even though there are only about 4,300 publicly traded companies in the U.S. See Rayhanul Ibrahim, \"The number of publicly-traded US companies is down 46%in the past two decades,\" Yahoo! Finance (Aug. 8, 2016), available at https://nance.yahoo.com/news/jp-startup-public-companies-fewer-000000709.html. 91Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno, \"Diocese of Reno available at http://www.renodiocese.org/documents/2016/9/2016%202017%20directory.pdf. 92Wikipedia, \"List the United States,\" at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_dioceses_in_the_United_States. 93National Catholic Educational Association, \"Catholic School available at 94Guidestone Financial Resources, \"Who We Serve,\" at https://www.guidestone.org/AboutUs/WhoWeServe. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 416also covers about 500 additional entities that are not exempt as churches. In total,therefore, we estimate that approxi-mately 62,000 employers among housesof worship, integrated auxiliaries, andchurch plans, were exempt or relievedof contraceptive coverage obligationsunder the previous rules. We do notknow how many persons are covered inthe plans of those employers. Guide-stone reports that among its 38,000 em-ployers, its plan covers approximately 220,000 persons, and its employers include\"churches, mission-sending agencies, hospi-tals, educational institutions and other re-lated ministries.\" Using that ratio, we esti-mate that the 62,000 church and church planemployers among Guidestone, ChristianBrothers, and Catholic churches would in-clude 359,000 persons. Among them, as ref-erenced above, 72,500 would be of child-bearing age, and 32,100 would usecontraceptives covered by the Guidelines.Therefore, we estimate that the private, non-publicly traded employers that did not covercontraception pre-Affordable Care Act, andthat were not exempt by the previous rulesnor were participants in self-insured churchplans that oppose contraceptive coverage,covered 362,100 women aged 15 to 44 thatuse contraceptives covered by the Guide-lines. As noted above, we estimate an aver-age annual expenditure on contraceptiveproducts and services of $584 per user. Thatwould amount to $211.5 million in potentialtransfer impact among entities that did notcover contraception pre-Affordable CareAct for any reason. We do not have data indicating how many of the entities that omitted coverageof contraception pre-Affordable Care Actdid so on the basis of sincerely held reli-gious beliefs that might qualify them forexempt status under these interim nal rules, as opposed to having done so forother reasons. Besides the entities thatled lawsuits or submitted public com-ments concerning previous rules on thismatter, we are not aware of entities thatomitted contraception pre-AffordableCare Act and then opposed the contracep- tive coverage requirement after it was im-posed by the Guidelines. For the follow-ing reasons, however, we believe that areasonable estimate is that no more thanapproximately one third of the personscovered by relevant entities\u2014that is, nomore than approximately 120,000 af-fected women\u2014would likely be subject topotential transfer impacts under the ex-panded religious exemptions offered inthese interim nal rules. Consequently, asexplained below, we believe that the po-tential impact of these interim nal rulesfalls substantially below the $100 millionthreshold for economically signicant andmajor rules. First, as mentioned, we are not aware of information that would lead us to esti-mate that all or most entities that omittedcoverage of contraception pre-AffordableCare Act did so on the basis of sincerelyheld conscientious objections in generalor religious beliefs specically, as op-posed to having done so for other reasons.Moreover, as suggested by the Guidestonedata mentioned previously, employerswith conscientious objections may tend tohave relatively few employees. Also,avoiding negative publicity, the difcultyof taking away a fringe benet that em-ployees have become accustomed to hav-ing, and avoiding the administrative costof renegotiating insurance contracts, allprovide reasons for some employers not toreturn to pre-Affordable Care Act lack ofcontraceptive coverage. Additionally, asdiscussed above, many employers withobjections to contraception, includingseveral of the largest litigants, only objectto some contraceptives and cover as manyas 14 of 18 of the contraceptive methodsincluded in the Guidelines. This will re-duce, and potentially eliminate, the con- traceptive cost transfer for women cov-ered in their plans. 95Furthermore, among nonprot entities that object to the Man-date, it is possible that a greater share oftheir employees oppose contraceptionthan among the general population, whichshould lead to a reduction in the estimate of how many women in those plans actu-ally use contraception. In addition, not all sincerely held con- scientious objections to contraceptivecoverage are likely to be held by personswith religious beliefs as distinct from per-sons with sincerely held non-religiousmoral convictions, whose objectionswould not be encompassed by these in-terim nal rules. 96We do not have data to indicate, among entities that did not covercontraception pre-Affordable Care Actbased on sincerely held conscientious ob-jections as opposed to other reasons,which ones did so based on religious be-liefs and which ones did so instead basedon non-religious moral convictions.Among the general public, polls varyabout religious beliefs but one prominentpoll shows that 89 percent of Americanssay they believe in God, while 11 percentsay they do not or are agnostic. 97There- fore, we estimate that for every ten entitiesthat omitted contraception pre-AffordableCare Act based on sincerely held consci-entious objections as opposed to other rea-sons, one did so based on sincerely heldnon-religious moral convictions, andtherefore are not affected by the expandedexemption provided by these interim nalrules for religious beliefs. Based on our estimate of an average annual expenditure on contraceptive prod-ucts and services of $584 per user, theeffect of the expanded exemptions on120,000 women would give rise to ap-proximately $70.1 million in potentialtransfer impact. This falls substantiallybelow the $100 million threshold for ec-onomically signicant and major rules. Inaddition, as noted above, premiums maybe expected to adjust to reflect changes incoverage, thus partially offsetting the transfer experienced by women who usethe affected contraceptives. As discussedelsewhere in this analysis, such womenmay make up approximately 8.9 percent(/H1100520.2 percent x 44.3 percent) of the covered population, in which case the off- 95On the other hand, a key input in the approach that generated the one third threshold estimate was a survey indicating that six percent of employers did not provide contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act. Employers that covered some contraceptives pre-Affordable Care Act may have answered \"yes\" or \"don't know\" to the survey. In such cases, the potential transfer estimate has a tendency toward underestimation because the rule's effects on such women\u2014causing their contraceptive coverage to be reduced from all 18 methods to some smallersubset\u2014have been omitted from the calculation. 96Such objections may be encompassed by companion interim nal rules published elsewhere in this Federal Register. Those rules, however, as an interim nal matter, are more narrow in scope than these rules. For example, in providing expanded exemptions for plan sponsors, they do not encompass companies with certain publicly traded ownership interests. 97Gallup, \"Most Americans Still Believe in God\" (June 14-23, 2016), available at http://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 417set would also be approximately 8.9 per- cent, yielding a potential transfer of $63.8million. We request comment on all aspects of the preceding regulatory impact analysis,as well as on how to attribute impacts tothis interim nal rule and the companioninterim nal rule concerning exemptionsprovided based on sincerely held (non-religious) moral convictions publishedelsewhere in this Federal Register. B. Special Analyses\u2014Department of the Treasury For purposes of the Department of the Treasury, certain Internal Revenue Ser- vice (IRS) regulations, including this one,are exempt from the requirements in Ex-ecutive Order 12866, as supplemented byExecutive Order 13563. The Departmentsanticipate that there will be more entitiesreluctantly using the existing accommoda-tion that will choose to operate under thenewly expanded exemption, than entitiesthat are not currently eligible to use theaccommodation that will opt into it. Theeffect of this rule will therefore be thatfewer overall adjustments are made to theFederally facilitated Exchange user feesfor entities using the accommodation pro-cess, as long as the Secretary of the De-partment of Health and Human Servicesrequests and an authorizing exception un-der OMB Circular No. A-25R is in effect,than would have occurred under the pre-vious rule if this rule were not nalized.Therefore, a regulatory assessment is notrequired. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certain requirements with respect to Federal rulesthat are subject to the notice and commentrequirements of section 553(b) of theAPA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that arelikely to have a signicant economic im-pact on a substantial number of small en-tities. Under Section 553(b) of the APA, ageneral notice of proposed rulemaking isnot required when an agency, for goodcause, nds that notice and public com-ment thereon are impracticable, unneces-sary, or contrary to the public interest. Theinterim nal rules are exempt from theAPA, both because the PHS Act, ERISA,and the Code contain specic provisionsunder which the Secretaries may adoptregulations by interim nal rule and be-cause the Departments have made a goodcause nding that a general notice of pro-posed rulemaking is not necessary earlierin this preamble. Therefore, the RFA doesnot apply and the Departments are notrequired to either certify that the regula-tions or this amendment would not have asignicant economic impact on a substan-tial number of small entities or conduct aregulatory flexibility analysis. Nevertheless, the Departments care- fully considered the likely impact of therule on small entities in connection withtheir assessment under Executive Order12866. The Departments do not expectthat these interim nal rules will have asignicant economic effect on a substan-tial number of small entities, because theywill not result in any additional costs toaffected entities, and in many cases willrelieve burdens and costs from such enti-ties. By exempting from the Mandatesmall businesses and nonprot organiza-tions with religious objections to some (orall) contraceptives and/or sterilization, theDepartments have reduced regulatory bur-den on such small entities. Pursuant tosection 7805(f) of the Code, these regula-tions have been submitted to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Busi-ness Administration for comment on theirimpact on small business. D. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Health and HumanServices Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), Federal agencies are re- quired to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed col- lection of information. Interested personsare invited to send comments regardingour burden estimates or any other aspectof this collection of information, includ-ing any of the following subjects: (1) thenecessity and utility of the proposed in-formation collection for the proper perfor-mance of the agency's functions; (2) theaccuracy of the estimated burden; (3)ways to enhance the quality, utility, andclarity of the information to be collected;and (4) the use of automated collectiontechniques or other forms of information technology to minimize the informationcollection burden. However, we are requesting an emer- gency review of the information collec-tion referenced later in this section. Incompliance with the requirement of sec-tion 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, we havesubmitted the following for emergency re-view to the Ofce of Management andBudget (OMB). We are requesting anemergency review and approval underboth 5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(i) and (iii) ofthe implementing regulations of the PRAin order to implement provisions regard-ing self-certication or notices to HHSfrom eligible organizations (\u00a7147.131(c)(3)), notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services(\u00a7147.131(f)), and notice of revocationof accommodation (\u00a7147.131(c)(4)). Inaccordance with 5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(i), we believe public harm is reason-ably likely to ensue if the normal clear-ance procedures are followed. The useof normal clearance procedures is rea-sonably likely to prevent or disrupt thecollection of information. Similarly, inaccordance with 5 CFR 1320.13(a)(2)(iii), we believe the use of normalclearance procedures is reasonablylikely to cause a statutory or court or- dered deadline to be missed. Many caseshave been on remand for over a year fromthe Supreme Court, asking the Depart-ments and the parties to resolve this mat-ter. These interim nal rules extend ex-emptions to entities, which involves nocollection of information and which theDepartments have statutory authority todo by the use of interim nal rules. If theinformation collection involved in theamended accommodation process is notapproved on an emergency basis, newlyexempt entities that wish to opt into theamended accommodation process mightnot be able to do so until normal clearanceprocedures are completed. A description of the information col- lection provisions implicated in these in-terim nal rules is given in the followingsection with an estimate of the annualburden. Average labor costs (including100 percent fringe benets) used to esti-mate the costs are calculated using data October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 418available from the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics.98 a. ICRs Regarding Self-Certication or Notices to HHS (\u00a7147.131(c)(3)) Each organization seeking to be treated as an eligible organization that wishes to use the optional accommodation processoffered under these interim nal rulesmust either use the EBSA Form 700 method of self-certication or provide no-tice to HHS of its religious objection tocoverage of all or a subset of contracep-tive services. Specically, these interimnal rules continue to allow eligible orga-nizations to notify an issuer or third partyadministrator using EBSA Form 700, or tonotify HHS, of their religious objection tocoverage of all or a subset of contracep-tive services, as set forth in the July 2015nal regulations. The burden related to thenotice to HHS is currently approved underOMB Control Number 0938-1248 and theburden related to the self-certication(EBSA Form 700) is currently approvedunder OMB control number 0938-1292. Notably, however, entities that are par- ticipating in the previous accommodationprocess, where a self-certication or no-tice has already been submitted, andwhere the entities choose to continue theiraccommodated status under these interimnal rules, generally do not need to le anew self-certication or notice (unlessthey change their issuer or third party ad-ministrator). As explained above, HHS as-sumes that, among the 209 entities weestimated are using the previous accom-modation, 109 will use the expanded ex-emption and 100 will continue under thevoluntary accommodation. Those 100 en-tities will not need to le additional self-certications or notices. HHS also as-sumes that an additional 9 entities thatwere not using the previous accommoda-tion will opt into it. Those entities will besubject to the self-certication or noticerequirement.In order to estimate the cost for an entity that chooses to opt into the accom- modation process, HHS assumes, as it didin its August 2014 interim nal rules, thatclerical staff for each eligible organizationwill gather and enter the necessary infor-mation and send the self-certication tothe issuer or third party administrator asappropriate, or send the notice to HHS. 99 HHS assumes that a compensation andbenets manager and inside legal counselwill review the self-certication or noticeto HHS and a senior executive would ex- ecute it. HHS estimates that an eligibleorganization would spend approximately50 minutes (30 minutes of clerical labor ata cost of $55.68 per hour, 10010 minutes for a compensation and benets managerat a cost of $122.02 per hour, 1015 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $134.50 perhour, 102and 5 minutes by a senior executive at a cost of $186.88 per hour103) preparing and sending the self-certication or notice toHHS and ling it to meet the recordkeepingrequirement. Therefore, the total annual bur-den for preparing and providing the infor-mation in the self-certication or notice toHHS will require approximately 50 minutesfor each eligible organization with an equiv-alent cost burden of approximately $74.96for a total hour burden of approximately 7.5hours with an equivalent cost of approxi-mately $675 for 9 entities. As DOL andHHS share jurisdiction, they are splitting thehour burden so each will account for ap-proximately 3.75 burden hours with anequivalent cost of approximately $337. HHS estimates that each self- certication or notice to HHS will re-quire $0.49 in postage and $0.05 in ma-terials cost (paper and ink) and the totalpostage and materials cost for each self-certication or notice sent via mail willbe $0.54. For purposes of this analysis,HHS assumes that 50 percent of self-certications or notices to HHS will bemailed. The total cost for sending theself-certications or notices to HHS bymail is approximately $2.70 for 5 enti-ties. As DOL and HHS share jurisdic- tion they are splitting the cost burden soeach will account for $1.35 of the costburden. b. ICRs Regarding Notice of Availability of Separate Payments forContraceptive Services (\u00a7147.131(e)) As required by the July 2015 nal reg- ulations, a health insurance issuer or third party administrator providing or arrangingseparate payments for contraceptive ser-vices for participants and beneciaries ininsured or self-insured group health plans(or student enrollees and covered depen-dents in student health insurance cover-age) of eligible organizations is requiredto provide a written notice to plan partic-ipants and beneciaries (or student enroll-ees and covered dependents) informingthem of the availability of such payments.The notice must be separate from, butcontemporaneous with (to the extent pos-sible), any application materials distrib-uted in connection with enrollment (orre-enrollment) in group or student cover-age of the eligible organization in anyplan year to which the accommodation isto apply and will be provided annually. Tosatisfy the notice requirement, issuers andthird party administrators may, but are notrequired to, use the model language setforth previously by HHS or substantiallysimilar language. The burden for this ICRis currently approved under OMB controlnumber 0938-1292. As mentioned, HHS is anticipating that approximately 109 entities will use theoptional accommodation (100 that used itpreviously, and 9 that will newly opt intoit). It is unknown how many issuers orthird party administrators provide healthinsurance coverage or services in connec-tion with health plans of eligible organi-zations, but HHS will assume at least 109.It is estimated that each issuer or thirdparty administrator will need approxi-mately 1 hour of clerical labor (at $55.68 98May 2016 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States found at https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm. 99For purposes of this analysis, the Department assumes that the same amount of time will be required to prepare the self-certication and the notice to HHS. 100Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly wage $27.84, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes436011.htm. 101Occupation code 11-3111 for Compensation and Benets mean hourly wage $61.01, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes113111.htm. 102Occupation code 23-1011 for Lawyers with mean hourly wage $67.25, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm. 103Occupation code11-1011 for Chief Executives with mean hourly https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes111011.htm. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 419per hour)104and minutes of manage- ment review (at $117.40 per hour)105to prepare the notices. The total burden for each issuer or third party administrator toprepare notices will be 1.25 hours with anequivalent cost of approximately $85.03.The total burden for all issuers or third party administrators will be 136 hours,with an equivalent cost of $9,268. AsDOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they aresplitting the hour burden so each will ac-count for 68 burden hours with an equiv-alent cost of $4,634, with approximately55 respondents. As discussed above, the Departments estimate that 770,000 persons will be cov-ered in the plans of the 100 entities thatpreviously used the accommodation andwill continue doing so, and that an addi-tional 9 entities will newly opt into theaccommodation. It is not known howmany persons will be covered in the plansof the 9 entities newly using the accom-modation. Assuming that those 9 entitieswill have a similar number of coveredpersons per entity, we estimate that all 109accommodated entities will encompass839,300 covered persons. We assume thatsending one notice to each participant willsatisfy the need to send the notices to allparticipants and dependents. Among per-sons covered by plans, approximately50.1 percent are participants and 49.9 per-cent are dependents. 106For 109 entities, the total number of notices will be420,490. For purposes of this analysis, theDepartments also assume that 53.7 per-cent of notices will be sent electronically,and 46.3 percent will be mailed. 107There- fore, approximately 194,687 notices willbe mailed. HHS estimates that each notice will require $0.49 in postage and $0.05 inmaterials cost (paper and ink) and the totalpostage and materials cost for each noticesent via mail will be $0.54. The total costfor sending approximately 194,687 no-tices by mail is approximately $105,131.As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, theyare splitting the cost burden so each willaccount for $52,565 of the cost burden. c. ICRs Regarding Notice of Revocation of Accommodation (\u00a7147.131(c)(4)) An eligible organization may revoke its use of the accommodation process; its issuer or third party administratormust provide written notice of such re-vocation to participants and benecia-ries as soon as practicable. As discussedabove, HHS estimates that 109 entitiesthat are using the accommodation pro-cess will revoke their use of the accom-modation, and will therefore be requiredto cause the notication to be sent (theissuer or third party administrator cansend the notice on behalf of the entity).For the purpose of calculating ICRs as-sociated with revocations of the accom-modation, and for various reasons dis-cussed above, HHS assumes thatlitigating entities that were previouslyusing the accommodation and that willrevoke it fall within the estimated 109entities that will revoke the accommo-dation overall. As before, HHS assumes that, for each issuer or third party administrator, a man-ager and inside legal counsel and clericalstaff will need approximately 2 hours toprepare and send the notication to par-ticipants and beneciaries and maintainrecords (30 minutes for a manager at acost of $117.40 per hour, 10830 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $134.50 perhour 109, 1 hour for clerical labor at a cost of $55.68 per hour110). The burden per respondent will be 2 hours with anequivalent cost of $181.63; for 109 en-tities, the total burden will be 218 hourswith an equivalent cost of approxi-mately $19,798. As DOL and HHSshare jurisdiction, they are splitting thehour burden so each will account for109 burden hours with an equivalentcost of approximately $9,899. As discussed above, HHS estimates that there are 257,000 covered personsin accommodated plans that will revoketheir accommodated status and use theexpanded exemption. 111As before, we use the average of 50.1 percent of cov-ered persons who are policyholders, andestimate that an average of 53.7 percentof notices will be sent electronically and46.3 percent by mail. Therefore, approx-imately 128,757 notices will be sent, ofwhich 59,615 notices will be mailed.HHS estimates that each notice will re-quire $0.49 in postage and $0.05 in ma-terials cost (paper and ink) and the totalpostage and materials cost for each no-tice sent via mail will be $0.54. Thetotal cost for sending approximately59,615 notices by mail is approximately$32,192. As DOL and HHS share juris-diction, they are splitting the hour bur-den so each will account for 64,379notices, with an equivalent cost of ap-proximately $16,096. 104Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly wage $27.84. 105Occupation code 11-1021 General and Operations Managers with mean hourly wage $58.70. 106\"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21. Using March 2015 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey. https://www.dol.gov/sites/ default/les/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2015.pdf. 107According to data from the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), 36.0 percent of individuals age 25 and over have access to the internet at work. According to a Greenwald & Associates survey, 84 percent of plan participants nd it acceptable to make electronic delivery the default option, which is used as the proxy for the number of participants who will not opt out that are automatically enrolled (for a total of 30.2 percent receiving electronic disclosure at work). Additionally, the NTIA reports that 38.5 percent of individuals age 25 and over have access to the internet outside of work. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 61 percent of internet users use online banking, which is used as the proxyfor the number of internet users who will opt in for electronic disclosure (for a total of 23.5 percent receiving electronic disclosure outside of work). Combining the 30.2 percentwho receive electronic disclosure at work with the 23.5 percent who receive electronic disclosure outside of work produces a total of 53.7 percent who will receive electronicdisclosure overall. 108Occupation code 11-1021 for General and Operations Managers with mean hourly wage $58.70, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes111021.htm. 109Occupation code 23-1011 for Lawyers with mean hourly wage $67.25, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes231011.htm. 110Occupation code 43-6011 for Executive Secretaries and Executive Administrative Assistants with mean hourly wage $27.84, https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes436011.htm. 111In estimating the number of women that might have their contraceptive coverage affected by the expanded exemption, we indicated that we do not know the extent to which the number of women in accommodated plans affected by these rules overlap with the number of women in plans offered by litigating entities that will be affected by these rules, though we assumethere is signicant overlap. That uncertainty should not affect the calculation of the ICRs for revocation notices, however. If the two numbers overlap, the estimates of plans revoking theaccommodation and policyholders covered in those plans would already include plans and policyholders of litigating entities. If the numbers do not overlap, those litigating entity plans wouldnot presently be enrolled in the accommodation, and therefore would not need to send notices concerning revocation of accommodated status.

E. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Labor Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and an individual is not required to re-spond to, a collection of information un-less it displays a valid OMB control num-ber. In accordance with the requirementsof the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA Form700 and alternative notice have previouslybeen approved by OMB under controlnumbers 1210-0150 and 1210-0152. Acopy of the ICR may be by con-tacting the PRA addressee shown belowor at http://www.RegInfo.gov. PRA AD-DRESSEE: G.

These interim nal rules amend the ICR by changing the accommodation pro- cess to an optional process for exemptorganizations and requiring a notice ofrevocation to be sent by the issuer or third party administrator to participants andbeneciaries in plans whose employerwho revokes their accommodation. DOLsubmitted the ICRs in order to obtain OMB approval under the PRA for theregulatory revision. The request was madeunder emergency clearance proceduresspecied in regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13.In an effort to consolidate the number ofinformation collection requests, DOL willcombine the ICR related OMB con-trol number 1210-0152 the ICR re-lated to the OMB 1210-0150. Once the ICR is approved DOL willdiscontinue 1210-0152. A copy of the in- formation collection request may be ob-tained free of charge on the RegInfo.govWeb site at http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr /H11005201705-1210- 001. This approval will allow respondents to temporarily utilize the additional flexi-bility these interim nal regulations pro-vide, while DOL seeks public commenton the collection methods\u2014includingtheir utility and burden. Consistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, the Departmentsexpect that each of the estimated 9 eligibleorganizations newly opting into the ac-commodation will spend approximately50 minutes in preparation time and incur$0.54 mailing cost to self-certify or notifyHHS. Each of the 109 issuers or thirdparty administrators for the 109 eligibleorganizations that make use of the accom- Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 421modation overall will distribute Notices of Availability of Separate Payments forContraceptive Services. These issuers andthird party administrators will spend ap-proximately 1.25 hours in preparationtime and incur $0.54 cost per mailed no-tice. Notices of Availability of SeparatePayments for Contraceptive Services willneed to be sent to 420,489 policyholders,and 53.7 percent of the notices will be sentelectronically, while 46.3 percent will bemailed. Finally, 109 entities using the pre-vious accommodation process will revokeits use and will therefore be required tocause the Notice of Revocation of Accom-modation to be sent (the issuer or thirdparty administrator can send the notice onbehalf of the entity). These entities willspend approximately two hours in prepa-ration time and incur $0.54 cost permailed notice. Notice of Revocation ofAccommodation will need to be sent to anaverage of 128,757 policyholders and53.7 percent of the notices will be sentelectronically. The DOL information col-lections in this rule are found in 29 CFR2510.3-16 and 2590.715-2713A and aresummarized as follows: Type of Review: Revised Collection.

Type of DOL-EBSA.F. Regulatory Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 Executive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, \"[t]o the maximum ex- tent permitted by law, the Secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Ser-vices and the heads of all other executivedepartments and agencies (agencies) withauthorities and responsibilities under theAct shall exercise all authority and discre-tion available to them to waive, defer,grant exemptions from, or delay the im-plementation of any provision or require-ment of the Act that would impose a scalburden on any State or a cost, fee, tax,penalty, or regulatory burden on individ-uals, families, healthcare providers, healthinsurers, patients, recipients of healthcareservices, purchasers of health insurance,or makers of medical devices, products, ormedications.\" In addition, agencies are di-rected to \"take all actions consistent withlaw to minimize the unwarranted eco-nomic and regulatory burdens of the [Af-fordable Care Act], and prepare to affordthe States more flexibility and control tocreate a more free and open healthcaremarket.\" These interim nal rules exercisethe discretion provided to the Depart-ments under the Affordable Care Act,RFRA, and other laws to grant exemp-tions and thereby minimize regulatoryburdens of the Affordable Care Act on theaffected entities and recipients of healthcare services. Consistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017), we haveestimated the costs and cost savings attrib-utable to this interim nal rule. As discussedin more detail in the preceding analysis, thisinterim nal rule lessens incremental report-ing costs. 113Therefore, this interim nal rule is considered an Executive Order 13771deregulatory action. F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104-4), requires the Departments to prepare a written statement, which includes an as-sessment of anticipated costs and benets,before issuing \"any rule that includes anyFederal mandate that may result in theexpenditure by State, local, and tribal gov-ernments, in the aggregate, or by the pri-vate sector, of $100,000,000 or more (ad-justed annually for inflation) in any oneyear.\" The current threshold after adjust-ment for inflation is $148 million, usingthe most current (2016) Im plicit Price Deflater for the Gross Domestic Prod-uct. For purposes of the Unfunded Man-dates Reform Act, these interim nalrules do not include any Federal man-date that may result in expenditures byState, local, or tribal governments, nordo they include any Federal mandatesthat may impose an annual burden of$100 million, adjusted for inflation, ormore on the private sector. G. Federalism Executive Order 13132 outlines funda- mental principles of federalism, and re- quires the adherence to specic criteria byFederal agencies in the process of theirformulation and implementation of poli-cies that have \"substantial direct effects\"on States, the relationship between theFederal Government and States, or thedistribution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of Government.Federal agencies promulgating regula-tions that have these federalism implica-tions must consult with State and localofcials, and describe the extent of theirconsultation and the nature of the con-cerns of State and local ofcials in thepreamble to the regulation. These interim nal rules do not have any Federalism implications, since theyonly provide exemptions from the contra-ceptive and sterilization coverage require-ment in HRSA Guidelines supplied undersection 2713 of the PHS Act. 112Denotes that there is an overlap between jurisdiction shared by HHS and DOL over these respondents and therefore they are included only once in the total. 113Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential decreased expenditures on contraceptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-related medical services. OMB's guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-ofce/2017/04/05/memorandum- implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that impacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments. The Food and Drug Administration,within HHS, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditureimpacts in the analyses that accompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benets (positive benets if expenditures are reduced, negative benets if expenditures areraised). Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting convention leads to this interim nal rule's medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) benets, ratherthan as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes.

Section 54.9815-2713AT is added to read as follows: \u00a7 54.9815-2713AT Accommodations in connection with coverage ofpreventive health services(temporary). (a)Eligible organizations for optional accommodation. An eligible organization is an organization that meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this sec-tion. (1) The organization is an objecting entity described in 45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i) or (ii); (2) Notwithstanding its status under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and under45 CFR 147.132(a), the organization vol-untarily seeks to be considered an eligible Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 423organization to invoke the optional ac- commodation under paragraph (b) or (c)of this section as applicable; and (3) [Reserved] (4) The organization self-certies in the form and manner specied by the Sec-retary of Labor or provides notice to theSecretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services as described in paragraph(b) or (c) of this section. To qualify as an eligible organization, the organization mustmake such self-certication or notice avail-able for examination upon request by therst day of the rst plan year to which theaccommodation in paragraph (b) or (c) ofthis section applies. The self-certication ornotice must be executed by a person autho-rized to make the certication or provide thenotice on behalf of the organization, andmust be maintained in a manner consistentwith the record retention requirements undersection 107 of ERISA. (5) An eligible organization may re- voke its use of the accommodation pro-cess, and its issuer or third party admin-istrator must provide participants andbeneciaries written notice of such revo-cation as specied in guidance issued bythe Secretary of the Department of Healthand Human Services. If contraceptivecoverage is currently being offered by anissuer or third party administrator throughthe accommodation process, the revoca-tion will be effective on the rst day of therst plan year that begins on or after 30days after the date of the revocation (toallow for the provision of notice to planparticipants in cases where contraceptivebenets will no longer be provided). Al-ternatively, an eligible organization maygive sixty-days notice pursuant to section2715(d)(4) of the PHS Act and \u00a7 54.9815-2715(b), if applicable, to revoke its use ofthe accommodation process. (b)Optional accommodation - self- insured group health plans . (1) A group health plan established or maintained by an eligible organization that provides ben-ets on a self-insured basis may volun-tarily elect an optional accommodationunder which its third party administra-tor(s) will provide or arrange paymentsfor all or a subset of contraceptive ser-vices for one or more plan years. To in-voke the optional accommodation pro-cess:(i) The eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more third party administrators. (ii) The eligible organization must pro- vide either a copy of the self-certicationto each third party administrator or a no-tice to the Secretary of the Department ofHealth and Human Services that it is aneligible organization and of its objectionas described in 45 CFR 147.132 to cover-age of all or a subset of contraceptiveservices. (A) When a copy of the self-certication is provided directly to a third party admin-istrator, such self-certication must includenotice that obligations of the third partyadministrator are set forth in 29 CFR2510.3-16 and this section. (B) When a notice is provided to the Secretary of Health and Human Services,the notice must include the name of theeligible organization; a statement that itobjects as described in 45 CFR 147.132 tocoverage of some or all contraceptive ser-vices (including an identication of the subset of contraceptive services to whichcoverage the eligible organization objects,if applicable), but that it would like toelect the optional accommodation pro-cess; the plan name and type (that is,whether it is a student health insuranceplan within the meaning of 45 CFR147.145(a) or a church plan within themeaning of section 3(33) of ERISA); andthe name and contact information for anyof the plan's third party administrators. Ifthere is a change in any of the informationrequired to be included in the notice, theeligible organization must provide up-dated information to the Secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Ser-vices for the optional accommodation pro-cess to remain in effect.

(A) When a self-certication is pro- vided directly to an issuer, the issuer hassole responsibility for providing such cov-erage in accordance with \u00a7 147.130(a)(iv).(B) When a notice is provided to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the notice must includethe name of the eligible organization; astatement that it objects as described in\u00a7 147.132 to coverage of some or all con-traceptive services (including an identi-cation of the subset of contraceptive ser-vices to which coverage the eligibleorganization objects, if applicable) butthat it would like to elect the optionalaccommodation process; the plan nameand type (that is, whether it is a studenthealth insurance plan within the meaningof \u00a7 147.145(a) or a church plan withinthe meaning of section 3(33) of ERISA);and the name and contact information forany of the plan's health insurance issuers.If there is a change in any of the informa-tion required to be included in the notice,the eligible organization must provide updated information to the Secretary of the Department of Health and HumanServices for the optional accommoda-tion to remain in effect. The Departmentof Health and Human Services will senda separate notication to each of theplan's health insurance issuers inform-ing the issuer that the Secretary of theDeparement of Health and Human Ser-vices has received a notice under para-graph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and de-scribing the obligations of the issuerunder this section. (2) If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certication from an eligible organi-zation or the notication from the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services asdescribed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of thissection and does not have an objection asdescribed in \u00a7 147.132 to providing thecontraceptive services identied in theself-certication or the notication fromthe Department of Health and Human Ser-vices, then the issuer will provide pay- ments for contraceptive services as fol-lows\u2014 (i) The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the grouphealth insurance coverage provided inconnection with the group health plan andprovide separate payments for any contra-ceptive services required to be coveredunder \u00a7 141.130(a)(1)(iv) for plan partic-ipants and beneciaries for so long as theyremain enrolled in the plan. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 429(ii) With respect to payments for con- traceptive services, the issuer may not im- pose any cost-sharing requirements (suchas a copayment, coinsurance, or a deduct-ible), premium, fee, or other charge, orany portion thereof, directly or indirectly,on the eligible organization, the grouphealth plan, or plan participants or bene-ciaries. The issuer must segregate pre- mium revenue collected from the eligi-ble organization from the monies usedto provide payments for contraceptiveservices. The issuer must provide pay-ments for contraceptive services in amanner that is consistent with the re-quirements under sections 2706, 2709,2711, 2713, 2719, and 2719A of thePHS Act. If the group health plan ofthe eligible organization provides cov-erage for some but not all of anycontraceptive services required to becovered under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), the is-suer is required to provide payments onlyfor those contraceptive services for whichthe group health plan does not provide coverage. However, the issuer may pro-vide payments for all contraceptive ser-vices, at the issuer's option. (3) A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than acopy of the self-certication from the el-igible organization or the noticationfrom the Department of Health and Hu-man Services described in paragraph(d)(1)(ii) of this section. (e)Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services -insured group health plans and studenthealth insurance coverage. For each plan year to which the optional accom-modation in paragraph (d) of this sec-tion is to apply, an issuer required toprovide payments for contraceptive ser-vices pursuant to paragraph (d) of thissection must provide to plan participantsand beneciaries written notice of theavailability of separate payments forcontraceptive services contemporaneouswith (to the extent possible), but sepa-rate from, any application materials dis-tributed in connection with enrollment(or re-enrollment) in group health cov-erage that is effective beginning on therst day of each applicable plan year.The notice must specify that the eligibleorganization does not administer or fundcontraceptive benets, but that the is-suer provides separate payments for contraceptive services, and must pro-vide contact information for questionsand complaints. The following modellanguage, or substantially similar lan-guage, may be used to satisfy the noticerequirement of this paragraph (e) \"Your[employer/institution of higher educa-tion] has certied that your [grouphealth plan/student health insurancecoverage] qualies for an accommoda-tion with respect to the Federal require- ment to cover all Food and DrugAdministration-approved contraceptive ser-vices for women, as prescribed by a healthcare provider, without cost sharing. Thismeans that your [employer/institution ofhigher education] will not contract, arrange,pay, or refer for contraceptive coverage. In-stead, [name of health insurance issuer] willprovide separate payments for contraceptiveservices that you use, without cost sharingand at no other cost, for so long as you areenrolled in your [group health plan/studenthealth insurance coverage]. Your [employ-er/institution of higher education] will notadminister or fund these payments . If youhave any questions about this notice, contact[contact information for health insurance is-suer].\" (f)Denition. For the purposes of this section, reference to \"contraceptive\" ser-vices, benets, or coverage includes contra-ceptive or sterilization items, procedures, orservices, or related patient education orcounseling, to the extent specied for pur-poses of \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv). (g)Severability. Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceableby its terms, or as applied to any person orcircumstance, shall be construed so as tocontinue to give maximum effect to theprovision permitted by law, unless suchholding shall be one of utter invalidity orunenforceability, in which event the pro-vision shall be severable from this sectionand shall not affect the remainder thereofor the application of the provision to per-sons not similarly situated or to dissimilarcircumstances. 12. Add \u00a7 147.132 to read as follows: \u00a7 147.132 Religious exemptions in connection with coverage of certainpreventive health services. (a)Objecting entities. (1) Guidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by theHealth Resources and Services Admin- istration must not provide for or supportthe requirement of coverage or pay-ments for contraceptive services withrespect to a group health plan estab-lished or maintained by an objectingorganization, or health insurance cover-age offered or arranged by an objectingorganization, and thus the Health Re-sources and Service Administration willexempt from any guidelines' require-ments that relate to the provision ofcontraceptive services: (i) A group health plan and health in- surance coverage provided in connection with a group health plan to the extent thenon-governmental plan sponsor objects asspecied in paragraph (a)(2) of this sec-tion. Such non-governmental plan spon-sors include, but are not limited to, thefollowing entities\u2014 (A) A church, an integrated auxiliary of a church, a convention or association ofchurches, or a religious order. (B) A nonprot organization.(C) A closely held for-prot entity.(D) A for-prot entity that is not closely held. (E) Any other non-governmental em- ployer. (ii) An institution of higher education as dened in 20 U.S.C. 1002 in its ar-rangement of student health insurancecoverage, to the extent that institution ob-jects as specied in paragraph (a)(2) ofthis section. In the case of student healthinsurance coverage, this section is appli-cable in a manner comparable to its appli-cability to group health insurance cover-age provided in connection with a grouphealth plan established or maintained by aplan sponsor that is an employer, and ref-erences to \"plan participants and bene-ciaries\" will be interpreted as referencesto student enrollees and their covered de- pendents; and (iii) A health insurance issuer offering group or individual insurance coverage tothe extent the issuer objects as specied inparagraph (a)(2) of this section. Where ahealth insurance issuer providing grouphealth insurance coverage is exempt underthis paragraph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remainssubject to any requirement to provide cov-erage for contraceptive services underGuidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 430unless it is also exempt from that require- ment. (2) The exemption of this paragraph (a) will apply to the extent that an entity described in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion objects to its establishing, maintain-ing, providing, offering, or arranging (asapplicable) coverage, payments, or aplan that provides coverage or paymentsfor some or all contraceptive services,based on its sincerely held religious be-liefs. (b)Objecting individuals. Guidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by theHealth Resources and Services Admin-istration must not provide for or supportthe requirement of coverage or pay-ments for contraceptive services withrespect to individuals who object asspecied in this paragraph (b), and noth-ing in \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), 26 CFR54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv), or 29 CFR2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) may be con-strued to prevent a willing health insur-ance issuer offering group or individualhealth insurance coverage, and as appli-cable, a willing plan sponsor of a grouphealth plan, from offering a separatebenet package option, or a separatepolicy, certicate or contract of insur-ance, to any individual who objects tocoverage or payments for some or allcontraceptive services based on sin-cerely held religious beliefs. (c)Denition. For the purposes of this section, reference to \"contraceptive\"services, benets, or coverage includescontraceptive or sterilization items, pro-cedures, or services, or related patienteducation or counseling, to the extentspecied for purposes of \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv). (d)Severability. Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforce-able by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, shall be con-strued so as to continue to give maxi-mum effect to the provision permittedby law, unless such holding shall be oneof utter invalidity or unenforceability, inwhich event the provision shall be sev-erable from this section and shall notaffect the remainder thereof or the ap-plication of the provision to persons notsimilarly situated DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employee Benets SecurityAdministration29 CFR Part 2590 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES45 CFR Part 147 Moral Exemptions and Accommodations forCoverage of CertainPreventive Services Underthe Affordable Care Act AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service, De- partment of the Treasury; Employee Ben- ets Security Administration, Departmentof Labor; and Centers for Medicare &Medicaid Services, Department of Healthand Human Services.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background In the context of legal requirements touching on certain sensitive health care issues\u2014including health coverage of con-traceptives\u2014Congress has a consistenthistory of supporting conscience protec-tions for moral convictions alongside pro-tections for religious beliefs, including aspart of its efforts to promote access to health services. 114Against that backdrop, Congress granted the Health Resourcesand Services Administration (HRSA), acomponent of the United States Depart-ment of Health and Human Services(HHS), discretion under the Patient Pro-tection and Affordable Care Act to specifythat certain group health plans and healthinsurance issuers shall cover, \"with re-spect to women, such additional preven-tive care and screening sprovided for in comprehensive guidelines Health Service Act section2713(a)(4). exercised that discre-tion under the last Administration to re-quire health coverage for, among otherthings, certain contraceptive services, 115 while the administering agencies\u2014theDepartments of Health and Human Ser-vices, Labor, and the Treasury (collec-tively, \"the Departments\" 116), exercised both the discretion granted to HHSthrough HRSA, its component, in PHSAct section 2713(a)(4), and the authoritygranted to the Departments as 26 29 HRSA in carrying outthat provision. Through rulemaking, in-cluding three interim nal rules, the De-partments exempted and accommodatedcertain religious objectors, but did not of-fer an exemption or accommodation toany group possessing non-religious moralobjections to providing coverage for someor all contraceptives. Many individualsand entities challenged the contraceptivecoverage requirement and regulations(hereinafter, the \"contraceptive Mandate,\" 114See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting individuals and health care entities from being required to provide or assist sterilizations, abortions, or other lawful health services if it would violate their \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d) (Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-31 (protecting any \"health care professional, a hospital, aprovider-sponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care facility, organization, or plan\" in objecting to abortion for anyreason); Id.at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808 (regarding any requirement of \"the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans\" in the District of Columbia, \"it is the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a 'conscience clause' which provides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.\"); Id.at Div. C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) (Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act) (protecting individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \"religious beliefsor moral convictions\"); Id.at Div. I, Title III (Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act) (protecting applicants for family planning funds based on their \"religious or conscientious commitment to offer only natural family planning\"); 42 U.S.C. 290bb-36 (prohibiting the statutory section from being construed to require suicide relatedtreatment services for youth where the parents or legal guardians object based on \"religious beliefs or moral objections\"); 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) (protecting against forced counselingor referrals in Medicare Choice, now Medicare Advantage, managed care plans with respect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\"); 42 U.S.C. 1396a(w)(3) (ensuring particularFederal law does not infringe on \"conscience\" as protected in State law concerning advance directives); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicaidmanaged care plans with respect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\"); 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b) (protecting objection to abortion funding in legal services assistance grants basedon \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 14406 (protecting organizations and health providers from being required to inform or counsel persons pertaining to assisted suicide);42 U.S.C. 18023 (blocking any requirement that issuers or exchanges must cover abortion); 42 U.S.C. 18113 (protecting health plans or health providers from being required to provide anitem or service that helps cause assisted suicide); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(g) (protecting vaccination objections by \"aliens\" due to \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 18 U.S.C. 3597 (protecting objectors to participation in Federal executions based on \"moral or religious convictions\"); 20 U.S.C. 1688 (prohibiting sex discrimination law to be used to require assistancein abortion for any reason); 22 U.S.C. 7631(d) (protecting entities from being required to use HIV/AIDS funds contrary to their \"religious or services\" generally includes contraceptives, sterilization, and related patient education and counseling, unless otherwise indicated. 116Note, however, that in sections under headings listing only two of the three Departments, the term \"Departments\" generally refers only to the two Departments listed in the heading. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 432or the \"Mandate\") as being inconsistent with various legal protections. These chal-lenges included lawsuits brought by somenon-religious organizations with sincerelyheld moral convictions inconsistent withproviding coverage for some or all con-traceptive services, and those cases con-tinue to this day. Various public com-ments were also submitted asking theDepartments to protect objections basedon moral convictions. The Departments have recently exer- cised our discretion to reevaluate theseexemptions and accommodations. Thisevaluation includes consideration of vari-ous factors, such as: the interests servedby the existing Guidelines, regulations,and accommodation process 117; the exten- sive litigation; Executive ReligiousLiberty\" 4, 2017); Congress' historyof providing protections for moral convic-tions alongside religious beliefs regardingcertain health services (including contra-ception, sterilization, and items or ser-vices believed to involve abortion); thediscretion afforded under PHS Act section2713(a)(4); the structure and intent of thatprovision in the broader context of section2713 and the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act; and the history of the regulatory process and comments sub-mitted in various requests for publiccomments (including in the Depart-ments' 2016 Request for Information).Elsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin, the Departments published, contempora-neously with these interim nal rules,companion interim nal rules expandingexemptions to protect sincerely held re-ligious beliefs in the context of the con-traceptive Mandate. In light of these considerations, the De- partments issue these interim nal rules tobetter balance the Government's interestin promoting coverage for contraceptiveand sterilization services with the Govern-ment's interests in providing conscienceprotections for individuals and entitieswith sincerely held moral convictions incertain health care contexts, and in mini-mizing burdens imposed by our regulationof the health insurance market.A. The Affordable Care Act Collectively, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted on March 23, 2010, and theHealth Care and Education ReconciliationAct of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152), enactedon March 30, 2010, are known as theAffordable Care Act. In signing the Af-fordable Care Act, President Obama is-sued Executive Order 13535 (March 24,2010), which declared that, \"[u]nder theAct, longstanding Federal laws to protectconscience (such as the Church Amend-ment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7, WeldonAmendment, 111-8) remain intact\" and that \"[n]u-merous executive agencies have a role inensuring that these restrictions are en-forced, including the Department ofHealth and Human Services (HHS).\"Those laws protect objections based onmoral convictions in addition to religiousbeliefs. The Affordable Care Act reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of partA of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) relating to grouphealth plans and health insurance issuersin the group and individual markets. Inaddition, the Affordable Care Act addssection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to theInternal Revenue Code (Code) to incorpo-rate the provisions of part A of titleXXVII of the PHS Act into ERISA andthe Code, and thereby make them appli-cable to certain group health plans regu-lated under ERISA or the Code. The sec-tions of the PHS Act incorporated intoERISA and the Code are sections 2701through 2728 of the PHS Act. These interim nal rules concern sec- tion 2713 of the PHS Act. Where it ap-plies, section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Actrequires coverage without cost sharing for\"such women's preventivecare \"as provided for\" guidelines developed byHRSA/HHS. The Congress did not spec-ify any particular additional preventivecare and screenings with respect towomen that HRSA could or should in-clude in its Guidelines, nor did Congressindicate whether the Guidelines should in- clude contraception and sterilization. The Departments have consistently in- terpreted section 2713(a)(4)'s of the PHSAct grant of authority to include broaddiscretion to decide the extent to whichHRSA will provide for and support thecoverage of additional women's preven-tive care and screenings in the Guidelines.In turn, the Departments have interpretedthat discretion to include the ability toexempt entities from coverage require-ments announced in HRSA's Guidelines.That interpretation is rooted in the text ofsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, whichallows HRSA to decide the extent towhich the Guidelines will provide for andsupport the coverage of additional wom-en's preventive care and screenings. Accordingly, the Departments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4)of the PHS Act reference to \"comprehen-sive guidelines supported by the HealthResources and Services Administrationfor purposes of this paragraph\" to grantHRSA authority to develop such Guide-lines. And because the text refers toGuidelines \"supported by the Health Re-sources and Services Administration forpurposes of this paragraph,\" the Depart-ments have consistently interpreted thatauthority to afford HRSA broad discretionto consider the requirements of coverageand cost-sharing in determining the natureand extent of preventive care and screen-ings recommended in the guidelines. (76FR 46623). As the Departments havenoted, these Guidelines are different from\"the other guidelines referenced in section 2713(a), which pre-dated the AffordableCare Act and were originally issued forpurposes of identifying the non-bindingrecommended care that providers shouldprovide to Id.Guidelines nonbinding recommendations signicantly different legaland policy concerns than guidelines de-veloped for a mandatory coverage re-quirement. To guide HRSA in exercisingthe discretion afforded to it in section2713(a)(4), the Departments have previ-ously promulgated regulations deningthe scope of permissible religious exemp-tions and accommodations for such guide-lines. (45 CFR 147.131). The interim nal 117In \"accommodation\" and 2017-44 October 30, 2017 433rules set forth herein are a necessary and appropriate exercise of the authority del-egated to the Departments as administra-tors of the statutes. (26 U.S.C. 9833; 29U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92). Our interpretation of section 2713(a) (4) of the PHS Act is conrmed by theAffordable Care Act's statutory structure.The Congress did not intend to requireentirely uniform coverage of preventiveservices. (76 FR 46623). To the contrary,Congress carved out an exemption fromsection 2713 for grandfathered plans. Thisexemption is not applicable to many of theother provisions in Title I of the Afford-able Care Act\u2014provisions previously re-ferred to by the preexistingcondition exclusions or other discrimina-tion based on health status in group healthcoverage; section 2708, which prohibitsexcessive waiting periods (as of which relates tolifetime limits; section pro-hibits rescissions of health insurance cov-erage; section 2714, which extends depen-dent coverage until age 26; and section2718, which imposes a medical loss ratioon health insurance issuers in the individ-ual and group markets (for insured cover-age), or requires them to provide rebatesto policyholders. (75 FR 34538, 34540,34542). Consequently, of the 150 millionnonelderly people in America withemployer-sponsored health coverage, ap-proximately 25.5 million are estimated tobe enrolled in grandfathered plans notsubject to section 2713 of the PHS Act. 118 As the Supreme Court observed, \"there isno legal requirement that grandfatheredplans ever be phased out.\" Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2764 n.10 (2014). The Departments' interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to per- mit HRSA to establish exemptions fromthe Guidelines, and of the Departments'own authority as administering agenciesto guide HRSA in establishing such ex- emptions, is also consistent with Execu-tive Order 13535. That order, issued uponthe signing of the Affordable Care Act,specied that \"longstanding Federal lawsto protect conscience . . . remain intact,\"including laws that protect religious be-liefs and moral convictions from certainrequirements in the health care context.Although the text of Executive Order13535 does not require the expanded ex-emptions issued in these interim nalrules, the expanded exemptions are, asexplained below, consistent with long-standing Federal laws to protect con-science regarding certain health matters,and are consistent with the intent that theAffordable Care Act would be imple-mented in consideration of the protectionsset forth in those laws. B. The Regulations Concerning Women's Preventive Services On July 19, 2010, the Departments is- sued interim nal rules implementing sec- tion 2713 of the PHS Act (75 FR 41726).Those interim nal rules charged HRSAwith developing the Guidelines authorizedby section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act. 1. The Institute of Medicine Report In developing the Guidelines, HRSA relied on an independent report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now knownas the National Academy of Medicine) onwomen's preventive services, issued onJuly 19, 2011, \"Clinical Preventive Ser-vices for Women, Closing the Gaps\"(IOM 2011). The IOM's report wasfunded by the HHS Ofce of the AssistantSecretary for Planning and Evaluation,pursuant to a funding opportunity thatcharged the IOM to conduct a review ofeffective preventive services to ensurewomen's health and well-being. 119 The IOM made a number of recom- mendations with respect to women's pre-ventive services. As relevant here, theIOM recommended that the Guidelines cover the full range of Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved contra-ceptive methods, sterilization procedures,and patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity. Be-cause FDA includes in the category of\"contraceptives\" certain drugs and de-vices that may not only prevent concep- tion (fertilization), but may also preventimplantation of an embryo, 120the IOM's recommendation included sev-eral contraceptive methods that manypersons and organizations believe areabortifacient\u2014that is, as causing earlyabortion\u2014and which they conscien-tiously oppose for that reason distinctfrom whether they also oppose contra-ception or sterilization. One of the 16 members of the IOM committee, Dr. Anthony LoSasso, a Pro-fessor at the University of Illinois at Chi-cago School of Public Health, wrote aformal dissenting opinion. He stated thatthe IOM committee did not have sufcienttime to evaluate fully the evidence on whether the use of preventive servicesbeyond those encompassed by section2713(a)(1) through (3) of the PHS Act leadsto lower rates of disability or disease andincreased rates of well-being, such that theIOM should recommend additional servicesto be included under Guidelines issued un-der section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act. Hefurther stated that \"the recommendationswere made without high quality, systematicevidence of the preventive nature of theservices considered,\" and that \"the com- mittee process for evaluation of the ev-idence lacked transparency and waslargely subject to the preferences of thecommittee's composition.

In its response to Dr. LoSasso, the other 15 committeemembers stated in part that \"At the rstcommittee meeting, it was agreed thatcost considerations were outside thescope of the charge, and that the com-mittee should not attempt to duplicatethe disparate review processes used byother bodies, such as the USPSTF,ACIP, and Bright Futures. HHS, withinput from this committee, may considerother factors including cost in its devel-opment of coverage decisions.\" 2. HRSA's 2011 Guidelines and the Departments' Second Interim FinalRules On August 1, 2011, HRSA released onto its website its Guidelines for women's pre- ventive services, adopting the recommenda-tions of the IOM. https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ The Guidelines in-cluded coverage for all FDA-approved con-traceptives, sterilization procedures, and re-lated patient education and counseling forwomen with reproductive capacity, as pre-scribed by a health care provider (hereinaf-ter \"the Mandate\"). In administering this Mandate, on Au- gust 1, 2011, the Departments promul-gated interim nal rules amending our 2010 interim nal rules. (76 FR 46621)(2011 interim nal rules). The 2011 in-terim nal rules specied that HRSA hasthe authority to establish exemptions fromthe contraceptive coverage requirement for certain group health plans established ormaintained by certain religious employersand for health insurance coverage providedin connection with such plans. 122The 2011 interim nal rules only offered the exemp-tion to a narrow scope of employers, andonly if they were religious. As the basis foradopting that limited denition of religious employer, the 2011 interim nal rules statedthat they relied on the laws of some \"Statesthat exempt certain religious employersfrom having to comply with State law re-quirements to cover contraceptive services.\"(76 FR 46623). Several comments weresubmitted asking that the exemption includethose who object to contraceptive coveragebased on non-religious moral convictions,including pro-life, non-prot advocacy or-ganizations. 123 3. The Departments' Subsequent Rulemaking on the Accommodation andThird Interim Final Rules Final regulations issued on February 10, 2012, adopted the denition of \"reli- gious employer\" in the nal reg-ulations). 124(77 FR 8725). The exemption did not require exempt employers to leany certication form or comply with anyother information collection process. Contemporaneously with the issuance of the 2012 nal regulations, HHS\u2014withthe agreement of the Department of Labor(DOL) and the Department of the Trea-sury\u2014issued guidance establishing a tem-porary safe harbor from enforcement ofthe contraceptive coverage requirementby the Departments with respect to group health plans established or maintained bycertain nonprot organizations with reli-gious objections to contraceptive cover-age (and the group health insurance cov-erage provided in connection with suchplans). 125The temporary safe harbor did not include nonprot organizations thathad an objection to contraceptives basedon moral convictions but not religious be-liefs, nor did it include for-prot entitiesof any kind. The Departments stated that,during the temporary safe harbor, the De-partments would engage in toachieve \"two goals\u2014providing contracep-tive to covering contra-ceptive services.\" (77 FR 8727). On March 21, 2012, the Departments published an advance notice of proposedrulemaking (ANPRM) that described pos-sible approaches to achieve those goalswith respect to religious nonprot organi-zations, and solicited public comments onthe same. (77 FR 16501). Following re-view of the comments on the ANPRM, theDepartments published proposed regula-tions on February 6, 2013 (2013 NPRM)(78 FR 8456). The 2013 NPRM proposed to expand the \"religious employer\" forpurposes of the religious employer ex-emption. Specically, it proposed to re-quire only that the religious employer beorganized and operate as a nonprot entityand be referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code, eliminating therequirements that a religious employer\u2014(1) have the inculcation of religious val-ues as its purpose; (2) primarily employpersons who share its religious tenets; and(3) primarily serve persons who share itsreligious tenets. The proposed expandeddenition still encompassed only religiousentities. The 2013 NPRM also proposed to cre- ate a compliance process, which it calledan accommodation, for group health plansestablished, maintained, or arranged bycertain eligible nonprot organizationsthat fell outside the houses of worship andintegrated auxiliaries covered by section6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Code (and,thus, outside of the religious employerexemption). The 2013 NPRM proposed todene such eligible organizations as non- 121The Departments do not relay these dissenting remarks as an endorsement of the remarks, but to describe the history of the Guidelines, which includes this part of the report that IOM provided to HRSA. 122The 2011 amended interim nal rules were issued and effective on August 1, 2011, and published in the Federal Register on August 3, 2011. (76 FR 46621). 123See, for example, Americans United for Life (\"AUL\") Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D/H11005HHS-OS- 2011-0023-59496. 124The 2012 nal regulations were published on February 15, 2012 (77 FR 8725). 125Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Group Health Plans, and Group Health Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing Under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, Section 715(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Section 9815(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, issued on February 10, 2012, and reissued on August 15, 2012. Available at: http://www.lb7.uscourts.gov/documents/12cv3932.pdf. The guidance,as reissued on August 15, 2012, claried, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, without success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coveragewere not precluded from eligibility for the safe harbor. The temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to insured student health insurance coverage arranged by nonprotinstitutions of higher education with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions set forth in the guidance. See nal rule entitled \"Student Health InsuranceCoverage\" published March 21, 2012 (77 FR 16457). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 435prot entities that hold themselves out as religious, oppose providing coverage forcertain contraceptive items on account ofreligious objections, and maintain a certi-cation to this effect in their records. The2013 NPRM stated, without citing a sup-porting source, that employees of eligibleorganizations \"may be less likely than\"employees of exempt houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries to share theiremployer's faith and opposition to contra-ception on religious grounds. (78 FR8461). The 2013 NPRM therefore pro-posed that, in the case of an insured grouphealth plan established or maintained by an eligible organization, the health insur-ance issuer providing group health insur-ance coverage in connection with the planwould provide contraceptive coverage toplan participants and beneciaries withoutcost sharing, premium, fee, or othercharge to plan participants or beneciariesenrolled in the eligible organization'splan\u2014and without any cost to the eligibleorganization. 126In the case of a self- insured group health plan established ormaintained by an eligible organization,the 2013 NPRM presented potential ap-proaches under which the third party ad-ministrator of the plan would provide orarrange for contraceptive coverage to planparticipants and beneciaries. The pro-posed accommodation process was not tobe offered to non-religious nonprot or-ganizations, nor to any for-prot entities.Public comments again included the re-quest that exemptions encompass objec-tions to contraceptive coverage based onmoral convictions and not just based onreligious beliefs. 127On August 15, 2012, the Departments extended our temporarysafe harbor until the rst plan year begin-ning on or after August 1, 2013. The Departments published nal regu- lations on July 2, 2013 (July 2013 nalregulations) (78 FR 39869). The July2013 nal regulations nalized the expan-sion of the exemption for houses of wor-ship and their integrated auxiliaries. Al-though some commenters had suggestedthat the exemption be further expanded, the Departments declined to adopt thatapproach. The July 2013 regulationsstated that, because employees of object-ing houses of worship and integrated aux-iliaries are relatively likely to oppose con-traception, exempting those organizations\"does not undermine the governmental in-terests the contraceptive requirement.\" (78 2013regulations assumed that \"[h]ouses ofworship and their integrated auxiliariesthat object to contraceptive coverage onreligious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of thesame faith who share the same objection\"to contraceptives. Id. The July 2013 regulation also nalized an accommodation for eligible organiza-tions, which were then dened to includesolely organizations that are religious. Un-der the accommodation, an eligible orga-nization was required to submit a self-certication to its group health insuranceissuer or third party administrator, as ap-plicable. Upon receiving that self-certication, the issuer or third party ad-ministrator would provide or arrange forpayments for the contraceptive services tothe plan participants and beneciaries en-rolled in the eligible organization's plan,without requiring any cost sharing on thepart of plan participants and beneciariesand without cost to the eligible organiza-tion. With respect to self-insured plans,the third party administrators (or issuersthey contracted with) could receive reim-bursements by reducing user fee payments(to Federally facilitated Exchanges) by theamounts paid out for contraceptive ser-vices under the accommodation, plus anallowance for certain administrative costs,as long as the HHS Secretary requests andan authorizing exception under OMB Cir-cular No. A-25R is in effect. 128With re- spect to fully insured group health plans,the issuer was expected to bear the cost ofsuch payments, 129and HHS intended to clarify in guidance that the issuer couldtreat those payments as an adjustment to claims costs for purposes of medical lossratio and risk corridor program calcula-tions. The Departments extended the tem-porary safe harbor again on June 20, 2013,to encompass plan years beginning on orafter August 1, 2013, and before January1, 2014. 4. Litigation Over the Mandate and the Accommodation Process During the period when the Depart- ments were publishing and modifying our regulations, organizations and individualsled dozens of lawsuits challenging theMandate. Plaintiffs included religiousnonprot organizations, businesses run byreligious families, individuals, and others,including several non-religious organiza-tions that opposed coverage of certaincontraceptives under the Mandate on thebasis of non-religious moral convictions.Religious for-prot entities won variouscourt decisions leading to the SupremeCourt's ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). The Supreme Court ruled against the Depart-ments and held that, under the ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act of 1993(RFRA), the Mandate could not be ap-plied to the closely held for-prot corpo-rations before the Court because theirowners had religious objections to provid-ing such coverage. 130 On August 27, 2014, the Departments simultaneously issued a third set of in-terim nal rules (August 2014 interim -nal rules) (79 FR 51092), and a notice ofproposed 2014 pro-posed rules) (79 FR 51118). The August2014 interim nal rules changed the ac-commodation process so that it could beinitiated either by self-certication usingEBSA Form 700 or through a notice in-forming the Secretary of HHS that an el-igible organization had religious objec-tions to coverage of all or a subset ofcontraceptive services. (79 FR 51092). Inresponse to Hobby Lobby, the August 126The NPRM proposed to treat student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education in a similar manner. 127See,for example, AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P at 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D /H11005CMS-2012-0031-79115. 128See also 45 CFR 156.50. Under the regulations, if the third party administrator does not participate in a Federally-facilitated Exchange as an issuer, it is permitted to contract with an insurer which does so participate, in order to obtain such reimbursement. The total contraceptive user fee adjustment for the 2015 benet year was $33 million. 129\"[P]roviding payments for contraceptive services is cost neutral for issuers.\" (78 FR 39877). 130The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-prot corporations. See134 S. Ct. at 2774. October 30, 2017 No. 2017-44 4362014 proposed rules extended the accom- modation process to closely held for-protentities with religious objections to con-traceptive coverage, by including them inthe denition of eligible organizations.(79 FR 51118). Neither the August 2014interim nal rules nor the August 2014proposed rules extended the exemption;neither added a certication requirementfor exempt entities; and neither encom-passed objections based on non-religiousmoral convictions. On July 14, 2015, the Departments - nalized both the August 2014 interim nalrules and the August 2014 proposed rulesin a set of nal regulations (the July 2015nal regulations) (80 FR 41318). (TheJuly 2015 nal regulations also encom-passed issues related to other preventiveservices coverage.) The July 2015 nalregulations allowed eligible organizationsto submit a notice to HHS as an alterna-tive to submitting the EBSA Form 700,but specied that such notice must includethe eligible organization's name and an expression of its religious objection, alongwith the plan name, plan type, and nameand contact information for any of theplan's third party administrators or healthinsurance issuers. The Departments indi-cated that such information represents theminimum information necessary for us toadminister the accommodation process. Meanwhile, a second series of legal chal- lenges were led by religious nonprot or-ganizations that stated the accommodationimpermissibly burdened their religious be-liefs because it utilized their health plans toprovide services to which they objected onreligious grounds, and it required them tosubmit a self-certication or notice. On No-vember 6, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Courtgranted certiorari in seven similar cases un-der the title of a ling from the Third Cir-cuit,Zubik v. Burwell. On May 16, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam opinioninZubik, vacating the judgments of the Courts of Appeals\u2014most of which hadruled in the Departments' favor\u2014and re-manding \"in the and renement in the posi-tions of the parties\" that had been led insupplemental briefs. 136 S. Ct. 1557, 1560(2016). The Court stated that it anticipatedthat, on remand, the Courts of Appeals would \"allow the parties sufcient time toresolve any outstanding issues betweenthem.\" Id.The Court also specied that \"the Government may not impose taxes or pen-alties on petitioners for failure to provide therelevant notice\" while the cases remainedpending. Id.at 1561. After by the De- partments in court lings, meetings wereheld between attorneys for the Govern-ment and for the plaintiffs in those cases.The Departments also issued a Requestfor Information (\"RFI\") on July 26, 2016,seeking public comment on options formodifying the accommodation process inlight of the supplemental brieng and remand order.(81 weresubmitted in response the RFI, during acomment period that closed on September20, 2016. Those comments included therequest that the exemption be expanded toinclude those who oppose the Mandate foreither religious \"or moral\" reasons, con- sistent with various state laws (such as inConnecticut or Missouri) that protect ob-jections to contraceptive coverage basedon moral convictions. 131 Beginning in 2015, lawsuits challeng- ing the Mandate were also led by variousnon-religious organizations with moralobjections to contraceptive coverage.These organizations asserted that they be-lieve some methods classied by FDA ascontraceptives may have an abortifacienteffect and therefore, in their view, aremorally equivalent to abortion. These or-ganizations have neither received an ex-emption from the Mandate nor do theyqualify for the accommodation. For exam-ple, the organization that since 1974 hassponsored the annual March for Life inWashington, D.C. (March for Life), led acomplaint claiming that the Mandate vio-lated the equal protection component ofthe Due Process Clause of the FifthAmendment, and was arbitrary and capri-cious under the Administrative ProcedureAct (APA). Citing, for example, (77 FR8727), March for Life argued that theDepartments' stated interests behind theMandate were only advanced amongwomen who \"want\" the coverage so as toprevent \"unintended\" pregnancy. March for Life contended that because it onlyhires employees who publicly advocateagainst abortion, including what they re-gard as abortifacient contraceptive items,the Departments' interests were not ratio-nally advanced by imposing the Mandateupon it and its employees. Accordingly,March for Life contended that applyingthe Mandate to it (and other similarly sit-uated organizations) lacked a rational ba-sis and therefore doing so was arbitraryand capricious in violation of the APA.March for Life further contended that be-cause the Departments concluded the gov-ernment's interests were not underminedby exempting houses of worship and in-tegrated auxiliaries (based on our assump-tion that such entities are relatively morelikely than other religious nonprots tohave employees that share their viewsagainst contraception), applying the Man-date to March for Life or similar organi-zations that denitively hire only employ-ees who oppose certain contraceptives lacked a rational basis and therefore vio-lated their right of equal protection underthe Due Process Clause. March for Life's employees, who stated they were personally religious (al-though personal religiosity was not a con-dition of their employment), also sued asco-plaintiffs. They contended that theMandate violates their rights under RFRAby making it impossible for them to obtainhealth insurance consistent with their re-ligious beliefs, either from the plan M arch for Life wanted to offer them, or in theindividual market, because the Departmentsoffered no exemptions in either circum-stance. Another non-religious nonprot or-ganization that opposed the Mandate's re-quirement to provide certain contraceptivecoverage on moral grounds also led a law-suit challenging the Mandate. Real Alterna- tives, Inc. v. Burwell, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419(M.D. Pa. 2015). Challenges by non-religious nonprot organizations led to conflicting opinionsamong the Federal courts. A district courtagreed with the March for Life plaintiffson the organization's equal protectionclaim and the employees' RFRA claims(not ruling on the APA claim), example, https://www.regulations.gov/document?D/H11005CMS-2016-0123-54142; see also https://www.regulations.gov/document?D/H11005CMS-2016-0123-54218 and https:// www.regulations.gov/document?D/H11005CMS-2016-0123-46220. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 437and issued a permanent injunction against the Departments that is still in place.March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d116 (D.D.C. 2015). The appeal in March for Life is pending and has been stayed since early 2016. In another case, Federaldistrict and appellate courts in Pennsylva-nia disagreed with the reasoning fromMarch for Life and ruled against claims brought by a similarly non-religious non-prot employer and its religious employ-ees. Real Alternatives, 150 F. Supp. 3d 419, afrmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017). One member of the appeals courtpanel in Real Alternatives dissented in part, stating he would have ruled in favorof the individual employee plaintiffs un-der RFRA. Id.at *18. On December 20, 2016, HRSA up- dated the Guidelines via its website,https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines2016/index.html. HRSA announced that,for plans subject to the Guidelines, the up-dated Guidelines would apply to the rstplan year beginning after December 20, 2017. Among other changes, the updatedGuidelines specied that the required con-traceptive coverage includes follow-up care(for example, management and evaluation,as well as changes to, and removal or dis-continuation of, the contraceptive method).They also specied, for the rst time, thatcoverage should include instruction in fer-tility awareness-based methods for womendesiring an alternative method of familyplanning. HRSA stated that, with the inputof a committee operating under a coopera-tive agreement, HRSA would review andperiodically update the Women's Preven-tive Services' Guidelines. The updatedGuidelines did not alter the religious em-ployer exemption or accommodation pro-cess, nor did they extend the exemption oraccommodation process to organizations orindividuals that oppose certain forms ofcontraception (and coverage thereof) onmoral grounds. On January 9, 2017, the Departments issued a document entitled, \"FAQs AboutAffordable Care Act Implementation Part36.\" 132The FAQ stated that, after review- ing comments submitted in response tothe 2016 RFI and considering various op-tions, the Departments could not nd away at that time to amend the accommo- dation so as to satisfy objecting eligibleorganizations while pursuing the Depart-ments' policy goals. The Departments didnot adopt the approach requested by cer-tain commenters, cited above, to expandthe exemption to include those who op-pose the Mandate for moral reasons. On May 4, 2017, the President issued Executive Order 13798, \"Promoting FreeSpeech and Religious Liberty.\" Section 3of that order declares, \"Conscience Pro-tections with Respect to Preventive-CareMandate. The Secretary of the Treasury,the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shallconsider issuing amended regulations,consistent with applicable law, to ad-dress conscience-based objections to thepreventive-care mandate promulgatedunder section 300gg-13(a)(4) of title 42,United States Code.\" II. Expanded Exemptions and Accommodations for MoralConvictions These interim nal rules incorporate conscience protections into the contracep- tive Mandate. They do so in part to bringthe Mandate into conformity with Con-gress's long history of providing or sup-porting conscience protections in the reg-ulation of sensitive health-care issues,cognizant that Congress neither requiredthe Departments to impose the Mandatenor prohibited them from providing con-science protections if they did so. Specif-ically, these interim nal rules expand ex-emptions to the contraceptive Mandate toprotect certain entities and individuals thatobject to coverage of some or all contra-ceptives based on sincerely held moralconvictions but not religious beliefs, andthese rules make those exempt entitieseligible for accommodations concerningthe same Mandate. A. Discretion to Provide Exemptions under Section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Actand the Affordable Care Act The Departments have consistently in- terpreted HRSA's authority under section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act to allow forexemptions and accommodations to the contraceptive Mandate for certain object-ing organizations. Section 2713(a)(4) ofthe PHS Act gives HRSA discretion todecide whether and in what circumstancesit will support Guidelines providing foradditional women's preventive servicescoverage. That authority includes HR-SA's discretion to include contraceptivecoverage in those Guidelines, but the Con-gress did not specify whether or to whatextent HRSA should do so. Therefore,section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act allowsHRSA to not apply the Guidelines to cer-tain plans of entities or individuals withreligious or moral objections to contracep-tive coverage, and by not applying theGuidelines to them, to exempt those enti-ties from the Mandate. These rules are anecessary and appropriate exercise of theauthority of HHS, of which HRSA is acomponent, and of the authority delegatedto the Departments collectively as admin-istrators of the statutes. (26 U.S.C. 9833;29 U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92). Our protection of conscience in these interim nal rules is consistent with the structure and intent of the Affordable CareAct. The Affordable Care Act refrainsfrom applying section 2713(a)(4) of thePHS Act to millions of women in grand-fathered plans. In contrast, we anticipatethat conscientious exemptions to the Man-date will impact a much smaller numberof women. President Obama emphasizedin signing the Affordable Care Act that\"longstanding Federal law to protect con-science\"\u2014laws with conscience protec- tions encompassing moral (as well as reli-gious) objections\u2014specically Exec-utive Care Act suggests Congress' intent todeviate from its long history, discussed be-low, of protecting moral convictions in par-ticular health care contexts. The Depart-ments' implementation of section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act with respect to contra-ceptive coverage is a context similar tothose encompassed by many other healthcare conscience protections provided or sup-ported by Congress. This Mandate concernscontraception and sterilization services, in- 132Available at: https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/les/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-36.pdf October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 438cluding items believed by some citizens to have an abortifacient effect\u2014that is, tocause the destruction of a human life at anearly stage of embryonic development.These are highly sensitive issues in the his-tory of health care regulation and have longbeen shielded by conscience protections inthe laws of the United States. B. Congress' History of Providing Exemptions for Moral Convictions In deciding the most appropriate way to exercise our discretion in this context, the Departments draw on nearly 50 yearsof statutory law and Supreme Court prec-edent discussing the protection of moralconvictions in certain circumstances\u2014particularly in the context of health careand health insurance coverage. Congressvery recently expressed its intent on thematter of Government-mandated contra-ceptive coverage when it declared, withrespect to the possibility that the Districtof Columbia would require contraceptivecoverage, that \"it is the intent of Congressthat any legislation enacted on such issueshould include a 'conscience clause'which provides exceptions for religiousbeliefs and moral convictions.\" Consoli-dated Act of 2017, Divi-sion C, Title VIII, Sec. 808, Pub. L. No.115-31 (May 5, 2017). In support of theseinterim nal rules, we consider it signi-cant that Congress' most recent statementon the prospect of Government mandatedcontraceptive coverage specically in-tends that a conscience clause be includedto protect moral convictions. The many statutes listed in Section I-Background under footnote 1, whichshow Congress' consistent protection ofmoral convictions alongside religious be-liefs in the Federal regulation of healthcare, includes laws such as the 1973Church Amendments, which we discuss atlength below, all the way to the 2017Consolidated Appropriations Act dis-cussed above. Notably among those laws,the Congress has enacted protections forhealth plans or health care organizationsin Medicaid or Medicare Advantage toobject \"on moral or religious grounds\" toproviding coverage of certain counselingor referral services. 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) (protecting against forcedcounseling or referrals in MedicareChoice, now Medicare Advantage, man-aged care plans with respect to objectionsbased on \"moral or religious grounds\");42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3) (protectingagainst forced counseling or referrals inMedicaid managed care plans with respectto objections based on \"moral or religiousgrounds\"). The Congress has also pro-tected individuals who object to prescrib-ing or providing contraceptives contraryto their \"religious beliefs or moral convic-tions.\" Consolidated Appropriations Actof 2017, Division C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c)(Financial Services and General Govern-ment Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No.115-31. C. The Church Amendments' Protection of Moral Convictions One of the most important and well- established federal statutes respecting conscientious objections in specic healthcare contexts was enacted over the courseof several years beginning in 1973, ini-tially as a response to court decisions rais-ing the prospect that entities or individualsmight be required to facilitate abortions orsterilizations. These sections of the UnitedStates Code are known as the ChurchAmendments, named after their primarysponsor Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho).The Church Amendments specicallyprovide conscience protections based onsincerely held moral convictions. Amongother things, the amendments protect therecipients of certain Federal health fundsfrom being required to perform, assist, ormake their facilities available for abor-tions or sterilizations if they object \"on thebasis of religious beliefs or moral convic-tions,\" and they prohibit recipients of cer-tain Federal health funds from discrimi-nating against any personnel \"because herefused to perform or assist in the perfor-mance of such a procedure or abortion onthe grounds that his performance or assis-tance in the performance of the procedureor abortion would be contrary to his reli-gious beliefs or moral convictions\" (42U.S.C. 300a-7(b), (c)(1)). Later additionsto the Church Amendments protect otherconscientious objections, including someobjections on the basis of moral convic-tion to \"any lawful health service,\" or to\"any part of a health service program.\"(42 U.S.C. 300a-7(c)(2), (d)). In contextscovered by those sections of the Church Amendments, the provision or coverageof certain contraceptives, depending onthe circumstances, could constitute \"anylawful health service\" or a \"part of ahealth service program.\" As such, the pro-tections provided by those provisions ofthe Church Amendments would encom-pass moral objections to contraceptiveservices or coverage. The Church Amendments were en- acted in the wake of the Supreme Court'sdecision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Even though the Court in Roe required abortion to be legal in certaincircumstances, Roedid not include, within that right, the requirement that other citi-zens must facilitate its exercise. Thus, Roe favorably quoted the proceedings of theAmerican Medical Association House ofDelegates 220 (June 1970), which de-clared \"Neither physician, hospital, norhospital personnel shall be required toperform any act violative of personally-held moral principles.\" 410 U.S. at 144 & n.38 (1973). Likewise in Roe's compan- ion case, Doe v. Bolton, the Court ob- served that, under State law, \"a physicianor any other employee has the right torefrain, for moral or religious reasons,from participating in the abortion proce-dure.\" 410 U.S. 179, 197-98 (1973). TheCourt said that these conscience provi-sions \"obviously...afford appropriateprotection.\" Id.at 198. As an Arizona court later put it, \"a woman's right to anabortion or to contraception does not com-pel a private person or entity to facilitateeither.\" Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass'n of Pro-Life Obstetricians &Gynecologists, 257 P.3d 181, 196 (Ariz.Ct. App. 2011). The Congressional Record contains relevant discussions that occurred whenthe protection for moral convictions wasrst proposed in the Church Amendments.When Senator Church introduced the rstof those amendments in 1973, he cited notonly Roe v. Wade but also an instance where a Federal court had ordered a Cath-olic hospital to perform sterilizations. 119Congr. Rec. S5717-18 (Mar. 27, 1973).After his opening remarks, Senator AdlaiStevenson III (D-IL) rose to ask that theamendment be changed to specify that italso protects objections to abortion andsterilization based on moral convictions Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 439on the same terms as it protects objections based on religious beliefs. The followingexcerpt of the Congressional Record isparticularly relevant to this discussion: Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, rst of all I commend the Senator from Idahofor bringing this matter to the attention ofthe Senate. I ask the Senator a question. One need not be of the Catholic faith or any other religious faith to feel deeplyabout the worth of human life. The pro-tections afforded by this amendment runonly to those whose religious beliefswould be offended by the necessity ofperforming or participating in the perfor-mance of certain medical procedures; oth-ers, for moral reasons, not necessarily forany religious belief, can feel equally asstrong about human life. They too canrevere human life. As mortals, we cannot with condence say, when life begins. But whether it is life,or the potentiality of life, our moral convic-tions as well as our religious beliefs, warrantprotection from this intrusion by the Gov-ernment. Would, therefore, the Senator in-clude moral convictions? Would the Senator consider an amend- ment on page 2, line 18 which would addto religious beliefs, the words \"or moral\"? Mr. CHURCH. I would suggest to the Senator that perhaps his objective couldbe more clearly stated if the words \"ormoral conviction\" were added after \"reli-gious belief.\" I think that the SupremeCourt in considering the protection wegive religious beliefs has given compara-ble treatment to deeply held moral convic-tions. I would not be averse to amendingthe language of the amendment in such amanner. It is consistent with the generalpurpose. I see no reason why a deeplyheld moral conviction ought not be giventhe same treatment as a religious belief. Mr. STEVENSON. The Senator's sug- gestion is well taken. I thank him. 119 Congr. Rec. S5717-18. As the debate proceeded, Senator Church went on to quote Doe v. Bolton's reliance on a Georgia statute that stated \"a physician or any other employee has theright to refrain, for moral or religious rea-sons, from participating in the abortion procedure.\" 119 Congr. Rec. at S5722(quoting 410 U.S. at 197-98). SenatorChurch added, \"I see no reason why theamendment ought not also to cover doc-tors and nurses who have strong moralconvictions against these particular oper-ations.\" Id.Considering the scope of the protections, Senator Gaylord Nelson (D- WI) asked whether, \"if a hospital board,or whatever the ruling agency for the hos-pital was, a governing agency or other-wise, just capriciously\u2014and not upon thereligious or moral questions at all\u2014sim-ply said, 'We are not going to bother withthis kind of procedure in this hospital,'would the pending amendment permitthat?\" 119 Congr. Rec. at S5723. SenatorChurch responded that the amendmentwould not encompass such an objection.Id. Senator James L. Buckley (C-NY), speaking in support of the amendment,added the following perspective: Mr. BUCKLEY. Mr. President, I com- pliment the Senator from Idaho for pro-posing this most important and timelyamendment. It is timely in the rst in-stance because the attempt has alreadybeen made to compel the performance ofabortion and sterilization operations onthe part of those who are fundamentallyopposed to such procedures. And it istimely also because the recent SupremeCourt decisions will likely unleash a se-ries of court actions across the UnitedStates to try to impose the personal pref-erences of the majority of the SupremeCourt on the totality of the Nation. I believe it is ironic that we should have this debate at all. Who would havepredicted a year or two ago that we wouldhave to guard against even the possibilitythat someone might be free [sic] 133to participate in an abortion or sterilizationagainst his will? Such an idea is repugnantto our political tradition. This is a Nationwhich has always been concerned with theright of conscience. It is the right of con-science which is protected in our draftlaws. It is the right of conscience whichthe Supreme Court has quite properly ex-panded not only to embrace those youngmen who, because of the tenets of a par-ticular faith, believe they cannot kill an- other man, but also those who because oftheir own deepest moral convictions areso persuaded. I am delighted that the Senator from Idaho has amended his language to in-clude the words \"moral conviction,\" be-cause, of course, we know that this is nota matter of concern to any one religiousbody to the exclusion of all others, or evento men who believe in a God to the ex-clusion of all others. It has been a tradi-tional concept in our society from the ear-liest times that the right of conscience,like the paramount right to life fromwhich it is derived, is sacred. 119 Congr. Rec. at S5723. In support of the same protections when they were debated in the U.S. House, Representative Margaret Heckler(R-MA) 134likewise observed that \"the right of conscience has long been recog-nized in the parallel situation in which theindividual's right to conscientious objec-tor status in our selective service systemhas been protected\" and \"expanded by theSupreme Court to include moral convic-tion as well as formal religious belief.\"119 Congr. Rec. H4148-49 (May 31,1973). Rep. Heckler added, \"We are con-cerned here only with the right of moralconscience, which has always been a partof our national tradition.\" Id.at 4149. These rst of the Church Amendments, codied at 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b) and(c)(1), passed the House 372-1, wereapproved 94-0. 119 Congr.Rec. at H4149; 119 Congr. Rec. S10405(June 5, 1973). The subsequently adoptedprovisions that comprise the ChurchAmendments similarly extend protectionto those organizations and individualswho object to the provision of certain ser-vices on the basis of their moral convic-tions. And, as noted above, subsequentstatutes add protections for moral objec-tions in many other situations. These in-clude, for example: Protections for individuals and entities that object to abortion: see 42 U.S.C.238n; 42 U.S.C. 18023; 42 U.S.C.2996f(b); and meant \"[forced]...against his will.\" 134Rep. Heckler later served as the 15th Secretary of HHS, from March 1983 to December 1985. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 440ations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31; Protections for entities and individuals that object to providing or coveringcontraceptives: see id. at Div. C, TitleVIII, Sec. 808; id. at Div. C, Government AppropriationsAct); and id.at Div. I, Title III; and Protections for entities and individuals that object to performing, assisting,counseling, or referring as pertains tosuicide, assisted suicide, or Departments believe that the intent behind Congress' protection of moral con-victions in certain health care contexts,especially to protect entities and individ-uals from governmental coercion, sup-ports our decision in these interim nalrules to protect sincerely held moral con-victions from governmental compulsionthreatened by the contraceptive Mandate. D. Court Precedents Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions The legislative history of the protection of moral convictions in the rst Church Amendments shows that Members ofCongress saw the protection as being con-sistent with Supreme Court decisions. Notonly did Senator Church cite the abortioncase Doe v. Bolton as a parallel instance of conscience protection, but he also spoke of the Supreme Court generally giving\"comparable treatment to deeply heldmoral convictions.\" Both Senator Buckleyand specically cited theSupreme protection of moral con-victions in laws governing military ser-vice. Those legislators appear to havebeen referencing cases such as Welsh v. United States, 398 U.S. 333 (1970), whichthe Supreme Court decided just 3 yearsearlier. Welsh involved what is perhaps the Government's paradigmatic compellinginterest\u2014the need to defend the nation bymilitary force. The Court stated that,where the Government protects objections to military service based on \"religioustraining and belief,\" that protection wouldalso extend to avowedly non-religious ob-jections to war held with the same moralstrength. Id.at 343. The Court declared, \"[i]f an individual deeply and sincerelyholds beliefs that are purely ethical ormoral in source and content but that nev-ertheless impose upon him a duty of con-science to refrain from participating inany war at any time, those beliefs cer-tainly occupy in the life of that individual'a place parallel to that lled b y...God' in traditionally religious persons. Becausehis beliefs function as a religion in his life,such an individual is as much entitled to a'religious' conscientious objector exemp-t i o n...a si ssomeone who derives hisconscientious opposition to war from tra-ditional religious convictions.\" The Departments look to the descrip- tion of moral convictions in Welsh to help explain the scope of the protection pro-vided in these interim nal rules. Neitherthese interim nal rules, nor the ChurchAmendments or other Federal health careconscience statutes, dene \"moral convic-tions\" (nor do they dene \"religious be-liefs\"). But in issuing these interim nalrules, we seek to use the same backgroundunderstanding of that term that is reflectedin the Congressional Record in 1973, inwhich legislators referenced cases such asWelsh to support the addition of language protecting moral convictions. In protect-ing moral convictions parallel to religiousbeliefs, Welsh describes moral convic- tions warranting such the and sin-cerely holds\"; (2) \"that are purely ethicalor moral in source and content; (3) \"butthat nevertheless impose upon him a du-ty\"; (4) and that \"certainly occupy in thelife of that individual a place parallel tothat lled by...God' in traditionallyreligious persons,\" such that one could say\"his beliefs function as a religion in hislife.\" (398 U.S. at 339-40). As recited above, Senators Church and Nelsonagreed that protections for such moralconvictions would not encompass an ob-jection that an individual or entity raises\"capriciously.\" Instead, along with the re-quirement that protected moral convic-tions must be \"sincerely held,\" this under-standing cabins the protection of moralconvictions in contexts where they occupya place parallel to that lled by sincerelyheld religious beliefs in religious personsand organizations. In the context of this particular Man- date, it is also worth noting that, in Hobby Lobby, Justice Ginsburg (joined, in thispart of the opinion, by Justices Breyer,Kagan, and Sotomayor), cited Justice Har-lan's opinion in Welsh, 398 U.S. at 357- 58, in support of her statement that \"[s]ep-arating moral convictions from religiousbeliefs would be of questionable legiti-macy.\" 134 S. Ct. at 2789 n.6. In quotingthis passage, the Departments do not meanto suggest that all laws protecting onlyreligious beliefs constitute an illegitimate\"separat[ion]\" of moral convictions, nordo we assert that moral convictions mustalways be protected alongside religiousbeliefs; we also do not agree with JusticeHarlan that distinguishing between reli-gious and moral objections would violatethe Establishment Clause. Instead, the De-partments believe that, in the specichealth care context implicated here, pro-viding respect for moral convictions par-allel to the respect afforded to religiousbeliefs is appropriate, draws from long- standing Federal Government practice,and shares common ground with Con-gress' intent in the Church Amendmentsand in later Federal conscience statutesthat provide protections for moral convic-tions alongside religious beliefs in otherhealth care contexts. E. Conscience Protections in Regulations and Among the States The tradition of protecting moral con- victions in certain health contexts is not limited to Congress. Multiple federal reg-ulations protect objections based on moralconvictions in such contexts. 135Other federal regulations have also applied theprinciple of respecting moral convictions 135See, for example, 42 CFR 422.206 (declaring that the general Medicare Advantage rule \"does not require the MA plan to cover, furnish, or pay for a particular counseling or referral service if the MA organization that offers the plan\u2014(1) Objects to the provision of that service on moral or religious grounds.\"); 42 CFR 438.102 (declaring that information requirements do not apply \"if the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP objects to the service on moral or religious grounds\"); 48 CFR 1609.7001 (\"health plan sponsoring organizations are not required to discuss treatmentoptions that they would not ordinarily discuss in their customary course of practice because such options are inconsistent with their professional judgment or ethical, moral or religiousbeliefs.\"); 48 CFR 352.270-9 (\"Non-Discrimination for Conscience\" clause for organizations receiving HIV or Malaria relief funds). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 441alongside religious beliefs when they have determined that it is appropriate to do soin particular circumstances. The EqualEmployment Opportunity Commissionhas consistently protected \"moral or ethi-cal beliefs as to what is right and wrongwhich are sincerely held with the strengthof traditional religious views\" alongsidereligious views under the \"standard [] de-veloped in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 (1965) and [ Welsh].\" (29 CFR 1605.1). The Department of Justice hasdeclared that, in cases of capital punish-ment, no ofcer or employee may be re-quired to attend or participate if doing so\"is contrary to the moral or religious con-victions of the ofcer or employee, or ifthe employee is a medical professionalwho considers such participation or atten-dance contrary to medical ethics.\" (28CFR 26.5). 136 Forty-ve States have health care conscience protections covering objec-tions to abortion, and several of thosealso cover sterilization or contracep-tion. 137Most of those State laws protect objections based on \"moral,\" \"ethical,\"or \"conscientious\" grounds in additionto \"religious\" grounds. Particularly inthe case of abortion, some Federal andState conscience laws do not require anyspecied motive for the objection. (42U.S.C. 238n). These various statutes and regulations reflect an important govern-mental interest in protecting moral con-victions in appropriate health contexts. The contraceptive Mandate implicates that governmental interest. Many personsand entities object to this Mandate in partbecause they consider some forms ofFDA-approved contraceptives to be abor-tifacients and morally equivalent to abor-tion due to the possibility that some of theitems may have the effect of preventingthe implantation of a human embryo afterfertilization. Based on our knowledgefrom the litigation, all of the current liti- gants asserting purely non-religious ob-jections share this view, and most of thereligious litigants do as well. The Su-preme Court, in describing family busi-ness owners with religious objections,explained that \"[t]he owners of the busi-nesses have religious objections to abor-tion, and according to their religious be-liefs the four contraceptive methods atissue are abortifacients. If the ownerscomply with the HHS mandate, they be-lieve they will be facilitating abortions.\"Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2751. Outsideof the context of abortion, as cited above,Congress has also provided health careconscience protections pertaining to ster-ilization, contraception, and other healthcare services and practices. F. Founding Principles The Departments also look to guidance from the broader history of respect for conscience in the laws and founding prin-ciples of the United States. Members ofCongress specically relied on the Amer-ican tradition of respect for consciencewhen they decided to protect moral con-victions in health care. As quoted above,in supporting protecting conscience basedon non-religious moral convictions, Sen-ator Buckley declared \"[i]t has been atraditional concept in our society from theearliest times that the right of conscience,like the paramount right to life fromwhich it is derived, is sacred.\" Rep. Heck-ler similarly stated that \"the right of moralconscience...h a salways been a part ofour national tradition.\" This tradition isreflected, for example, in a letter PresidentGeorge Washington wrote saying that\"[t]he Citizens of the United States ofAmerica have a right to applaud them-selves for having given to mankind exam-ples of an enlarged and liberal policy: apolicy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunitiesof citizenship.\" 138Thomas Jefferson sim- ilarly declared that ourConstitution ought to be dearer to manthan that which protects the rights of con-science against the enterprises of the civilauthority.\" 139Although these statements by Presidents Washington and Jeffersonwere spoken to religious congregations,and although religious and moral con-science were tightly intertwined for theFounders, they both reflect a broad prin-ciple of respect for conscience againstgovernment coercion. James Madisonlikewise called conscience \"the most sa-cred of all property,\" and proposed thatthe Bill of Rights should guarantee, inaddition to protecting religious belief andworship, that \"the full and equal rights ofconscience [shall not] be in any manner,or on any pretext infringed.\" 140 These Founding Era statements of gen- eral principle do not specify how theywould be applied in a particular healthcare context. We do not suggest that thespecic protections offered in this rulewould also be required or necessarily ap-propriate in any other context that doesnot raise the specic concerns implicatedby this Mandate. These interim nal rulesdo not address in any way how the Gov-ernment would balance its interests with respect to other health services not en-compassed by the contraceptive Man-date. 141Instead we highlight this tradition of respect for conscience from our Found-ing Era to provide background support forthe Departments' decision to implementsection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, whileprotecting conscience in the exercise ofmoral convictions. We believe that theseinterim nal rules are consistent both withthe American tradition of respect for con-science and with Congress' history of pro-viding conscience protections in the kinds 136See also 18 CFR 214.11 (where a law enforcement agency (LEA) seeks assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafcking of persons, the reasonableness of the LEA's request will depend in part on \"[c]ultural, religious, or moral objections to the request\"). 137According to the Guttmacher Institute, 45 states have conscience statutes pertaining to abortion (43 of which cover institutions), 18 have conscience statutes pertaining to sterilization (16 of which cover institutions), and 12 have conscience statutes pertaining to contraception (8 of which cover institutions). \"Refusing to Provide Health Services\" (June 1, 2017), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-services. 138From George Washington to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island (Aug. 18, 1790), available at https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-06-02-0135. 139Letter to the Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church at New London, Connecticut (February 4, 1809), available at https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/99-01-02-9714. 140James Madison, \"Essay on Property\" (March 29, 1792); First draft of the First Amendment, 1 Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789). 141As the Supreme Court stated in Hobby Lobby, the Court's decision concerns only the contraceptive Mandate, and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, for example, for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fail if they conflict with an employer's religious beliefs. Nor does the Court's opinion provide a shield for employerswho might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious (or moral) practice. 134 S. Ct. at 2783. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 442of health care matters involved in this Mandate. G. Executive Orders Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions Protecting moral convictions, as set forth in the expanded exemptions and ac- commodations of these rules, is consistentwith recent executive orders. PresidentTrump's Executive Order concerning thisMandate directed the Departments to con-sider providing protections, not speci-cally for \"religious\" beliefs, but for \"con-science.\" We interpret that term to includemoral convictions and not just religiousbeliefs. Likewise, President Trump's rstExecutive Order, EO 13765, declared that\"the Secretary of Health and HumanServices (Secretary) and the heads of allother executive departments and agencies(agencies) with authorities and responsi-bilities under the [ACA] shall exercise allauthority and discretion available to themto waive, defer, grant exemptions from, ordelay the implementation of any provisionor requirement of the Act that would im-pose a scal burden on any State or a cost,fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden onindividuals, families, healthcare provid-ers, health insurers, patients, recipients ofhealthcare services, purchasers of healthinsurance, or makers of medical devices,products, or medications.\" This Mandateimposes both a cost, fee, tax, or penalty,and a regulatory burden, on individualsand purchasers of health insurance thathave moral convictions opposed to pro-viding contraceptive coverage. These in-terim nal rules exercise the Departments'discretion to grant exemptions from theMandate to reduce and relieve regulatoryburdens and promote freedom in thehealth care market. H. Litigation Concerning the Mandate The sensitivity of certain health care matters makes it particularly important for the Government to tread carefully whenengaging in regulation concerning thoseareas, and to respect individuals and orga-nizations whose moral convictions areburdened by Government regulations.Providing conscience protections ad-vances the Affordable Care Act's goal ofexpanding health coverage among entitiesand individuals that might otherwise be reluctant to participate in the market. Forexample, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby declared that, if HHS requires own- ers of businesses to cover procedures thatthe owners \"could not in good con-science\" cover, such as abortion, \"HHSwould effectively exclude these peoplefrom full participation in the economiclife of the Nation.\" 134 S. Ct. at 2783.That would be a serious outcome. Asdemonstrated by litigation and publiccomments, various citizens sincerely holdmoral convictions, which are not neces-sarily religious, against providing or par-ticipating in coverage of contraceptiveitems included in the Mandate, and somebelieve that some of those items maycause early abortions. The Departmentswish to implement the contraceptive cov-erage Guidelines issued under section2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act in a way thatrespects the moral convictions of our cit-izens so that they are more free to engagein \"full participation in the economic life of the Nation.\" These expanded exemp-tions do so by removing an obstacle thatmight otherwise lead entities or individu-als with moral objections to contraceptivecoverage to choose not to sponsor or par-ticipate in health plans if they includesuch coverage. Among the lawsuits challenging the Mandate, two have been led based inpart on non-religious moral convictions.In one case, the Departments are subjectto a permanent injunction requiring us torespect the non-religious moral objectionsof an employer. See March for Life v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C.2015). In the other case, an appeals courtrecently afrmed a district court rulingthat allows the previous regulations to beimposed in a way that violates the moralconvictions of a small nonprot pro-lifeorganization and its employees. See Real Alternatives, 2017 WL 3324690. Our lit-igation of these cases has led to inconsis-tent court rulings, consumed substantialgovernmental resources, and created un- certainty for objecting organizations, issu-ers, third party administrators, and employ-ees and beneciaries. The organizations thathave sued seeking a moral exemption haveall adopted moral tenets opposed to contra-ception and hire only employees who sharethis view. It is reasonable to conclude thatemployees of these organizations would therefore not benet from the Mandate. As aresult, subjecting this subset of organiza-tions to the Mandate does not advance anygovernmental interest. The need to resolvethis litigation and the potential concerns ofsimilar entities, and our requirement to com-ply with permanent injunctive relief cur-rently imposed in March for Life, provide substantial reasons for the Departments toprotect moral convictions through these in-terim nal rules. Even though, as discussedbelow, we assume the number of entitiesand individuals that may seek exemptionfrom the Mandate on the basis of moralconvictions, as these two sets of litigantsdid, will be small, we know from the litiga-tion that it will not be zero. As a result, theDepartments have taken these types of ob-jections into consideration in reviewing ourregulations. Having done so, we consider itappropriate to issue the protections set forthin these interim nal rules. Just as Congress,in adopting the early provisions of theChurch Amendments, viewed it as neces-sary and appropriate to protect those orga-nizations and individuals with objections tocertain health care services on the basis ofmoral convictions, so we, too, believe that\"our moral convictions as well as our reli-gious beliefs, warrant protection from thisintrusion by the Government\" in this situa-tion. I. The Departments' Rebalancing of Government Interests For additional discussion of the Gov- ernment's balance of interests concerning religious beliefs issued contemporane-ously with these interim nal rules, see therelated document published by the De-partment elsewhere in this issue of theFederal Register. There, we acknowl-edge that the Departments have changedthe policies and interpretations we previ-ously adopted with respect to the Mandateand the governmental interests that under-lying it, and we assert that we now believethe Government's legitimate interests inproviding for contraceptive coverage donot require us to violate sincerely heldreligious beliefs while implementing theGuidelines. For parallel reasons, the De-partments believe Congress did not setforth\u2014and we do not possess\u2014intereststhat require us to violate sincerely held Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 443moral convictions in the course of gener- ally requiring contraceptive coverage.These changes in policy are within theDepartments' authority. As the SupremeCourt has acknowledged, \"[a]gencies arefree to change their existing policies aslong as they provide a reasoned explana-tion for the change.\" Motorcars, analysis\" an agency\"demonstrate to a court's satisfactionthat the reasons for the new policy arebetter than the reasons for the old one; itsufces that the new policy is permissibleunder the statute, that there are good rea-sons for it, and that the agency believes itto be better, which the conscious changeof course adequately indicates.\" United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. King , 200 F. Supp. 3d 163, 169-70 (D.D.C. 2016) (cit-ingFCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc. , 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)); see also New Edge Network, Inc. v. FCC , 461 F.3d 1105, 1112-13 (9th Cir. 2006) (rejecting an argument that \"an agency changing itscourse by rescinding a rule is obligated tosupply a reasoned analysis for the changebeyond that which may be required whenan agency does not act in the rst in-stance\"). 142 The Departments note that the exemp- tions created here, like the exemptionscreated by the last Administration, do notburden third parties to a degree that coun-sels against providing the exemptions. Inaddition to the apparent fact that manyentities with non-religious moral objec-tions to the Mandate appear to only hirepersons that share those objections, Con-gress did not create a right to receive con- traceptive coverage, and Congress explicitlychose not to impose the section 2713 re-quirements on grandfathered plans benet-ting millions of people. Individuals who areunable to obtain contraceptive coveragethrough their employer-sponsored healthplans because of the exemptions created inthese interim nal rules, or because of otherexemptions to the Mandate, have other av-enues for obtaining contraception, includingthrough various other mechanisms by which the Government advances contraceptivecoverage, particularly for low-incomewomen, and which these interim nal rulesleave unchanged. 143As the Government is under no constitutional obligation to fundcontraception, cf. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), even more so may the Govern-ment refrain from requiring private citizensto cover contraception for other citizens inviolation of their moral convictions. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192-93 (1991)(\"A refusal to fund protected activity, with-out more, cannot be equated with the impo-sition of a 'penalty' on that activity.\"). The Departments acknowledge that coverage of contraception is an importantand highly controversial issue, implicat-ing many different views, as reflected forexample in the public comments receivedon multiple rulemakings over the courseof implementation of section 2713(a)(4)of the PHS Act. Our expansion of con- science protections for moral convictions,similar to protections contained in numer-ous statutes governing health care regula-tion, is not taken lightly. However, afterreconsidering the interests served by theMandate in this particular context, the ob-jections raised, and the relevant Federallaw, the Departments have determinedthat expanding the exemptions to includeprotections for moral convictions is amore appropriate administrative responsethan continuing to refuse to extend theexemptions and accommodations to cer-tain entities and individuals for whomthe Mandate violates their sincerely heldmoral convictions. Although the numberof organizations and individuals that mayseek to take advantage of these exemp-tions and accommodations may be small,we believe that it is important formally tocodify such protections for objectionsbased on moral conviction, given thelong-standing recognition of such protec-tions in health care and health insurancecontext in law and regulation and the par-ticularly sensitive nature of these issues inthe health care context. These interim nalrules leave unchanged HRSA's authorityto decide whether to include contraceptives in the women's preventive services Guide- lines for entities that are not exempted bylaw, regulation, or the Guidelines. Theserules also do not change the many othermechanisms by which the Government ad-vances contraceptive coverage, particularlyfor low-income women. III. Provisions of the Interim Final Rules With Comment Period The Departments are issuing these in- terim nal rules in light of the full history of relevant rulemaking (including 3 previ-ous interim nal rules), public comments,and the long-running litigation from non-religious moral objectors to the Mandate,as well as the information contained in thecompanion interim nal rules issued else-where in this issue of the Federal Regis- ter. These interim nal rules seek to re-solve these matters by directing HRSA, tothe extent it requires coverage for certaincontraceptive services in its Guidelines, toafford an exemption to certain entities andindividuals with sincerely held moral con-victions by which they object to contra-ceptive or sterilization coverage, and bymaking the accommodation process avail-able for certain organizations with suchconvictions. For all of the reasons discussed and referenced above, the Departments havedetermined that the Government's interestin applying contraceptive coverage re-quirements to the plans of certain entitiesand individuals does not outweigh the sin-cerely held moral objections of those en-tities and individuals. Thus, these interimnal rules amend the regulations amendedin both the Departments' July 2015 nalregulations and in the companion interimnal rules concerning religious beliefs is-sued contemporaneously with these in-terim nal rules and published elsewherein this issue of the Bulletin. These interim nal rules expand those exemptions to include additional entitiesand persons that object based on sincerelyheld moral convictions. These rules leavein place HRSA's discretion to continue to 142See also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 863-64 (1984) (\"The fact that the agency has adopted different denitions in different contexts adds force to the argument that the denition itself is flexible, particularly since Congress has never indicated any disapproval of a flexible reading of the statute.\") 143See, for example, Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq.; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, Public Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; 42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.; the Indian Health Service, 25 U.S.C. 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq.; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the NIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 444require contraceptive and sterilization coverage where no objection specied inthe regulations exists, and if section 2713of the PHS Act otherwise applies. Theseinterim nal rules also maintain the exis-tence of an accommodation process as avoluntary option for organizations withmoral objections to contraceptive cover-age, but consistent with our expansionof the exemption, we expand eligibilityfor the accommodation to include organi-zations with sincerely held moral convic-tions concerning contraceptive coverage.HRSA is simultaneously updating itsGuidelines to reflect the requirements ofthese interim nal rules. 144 1. Exemption for Objecting Entities Based on Moral Convictions In the new 45 CFR 147.133 as created by these interim nal rules, we expand the exemption that was previously located in\u00a7 147.131(a), and that was expanded in\u00a7 147.132 by the companion interim nalrules concerning religious beliefs issuedcontemporaneously with these interim -nal rules and published elsewhere in thisissue of the Bulletin. With respect to employers that sponsor group health plans, \u00a7147.133(a)(1) and(a)(1)(i) provide exemptions for certainemployers that object to coverage of all ora subset of contraceptives or sterilizationand related patient education and counsel-ing based on sincerely held moral convic-tions. For avoidance of doubt, the Depart- ments wish to make clear that the ex-panded exemption in \u00a7 147.133(a) appliesto several distinct entities involved in theprovision of coverage to the objecting em-ployer's employees. This explanation isconsistent with how prior rules haveworked by means of similar language.Section 147.133(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i), byspecifying that \"[a] group health plan andhealth insurance coverage provided inconnection with a group health plan\" isexempt \"to the extent the plan sponsorobjects as specied in paragraph (a)(2),\"exempt the group health plans the spon-sors of which object, and exempt their health insurance issuers in providing thecoverage in those plans (whether or notthe issuers have their own objections).Consequently, with respect to Guidelinesissued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), or in 26 and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), the plan sponsor, issuer,and plan covered in the exemption of thatparagraph would face no penalty as a re-sult of omitting contraceptive coveragefrom the benets of the plan participantsand beneciaries. Consistent with the restated exemption, exempt entities will not be required tocomply with a self-certication process.Although exempt entities do not need tole notices or certications of their ex-emption, and these interim nal rules donot impose any new notice requirementson them, existing ERISA rules governinggroup health plans require that, with re-spect to plans subject to ERISA, a plandocument must include a comprehensivesummary of the benets covered by theplan and a statement of the conditions foreligibility to receive benets. UnderERISA, the plan document provides whatbenets are provided to participants andbeneciaries under the plan and, there-fore, if an objecting employer would liketo exclude all or a subset of contraceptiveservices, it must ensure that the exclusionis clear in the plan document. Moreover, ifthere is a reduction in a covered service orbenet, the plan has to disclose thatchange to plan participants. 145Thus, where an exemption applies and all or asubset of contraceptive services are omit-ted from a plan's coverage, otherwise ap- plicable ERISA disclosures should reflectthe omission of coverage in ERISA plans.These existing disclosure requirementsserve to help provide notice to participantsand beneciaries of what ERISA plans doand do not cover. The Departments invitepublic comment on whether exempt enti-ties, or others, would nd value either inbeing able to maintain or submit a specicform of certication to claim their exemp-tion, or in otherwise receiving guidance on a way to document their exemption. The exemptions in \u00a7 147.133(a) apply \"to the extent\" of the objecting entities'sincerely held moral convictions. Thus,entities that hold a requisite objection tocovering some, but not all, contraceptiveitems would be exempt with respect to theitems to which they object, but not withrespect to the items to which they do notobject. Likewise, the requisite objectionof a plan sponsor or institution of highereducation in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(i) and (ii)exempts its group health plan, health in-surance coverage offered by a health in-surance issuer in connection with suchplan, and its issuer in its offering of suchcoverage, but that exemption does not ex-tend to coverage provided by that issuer toother group health plans where the plansponsors have no qualifying objection.The objection of a health insurance issuerin \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii) similarly operatesonly to the extent of its objection, and asotherwise limited as described below. 2. Exemption of Certain Plan Sponsors The rules cover certain kinds of non- governmental employer plan sponsors with the requisite objections, and the rulesspecify which kinds of entities qualify forthe exemption. Under these interim nal rules, the De- partments do not limit the exemption withreference to nonprot status as previousrules have done. Many of the federalhealth care conscience statutes citedabove offer protections for the moral con-victions of entities without regard towhether they operate as nonprots or for-prot entities. In addition, a signicantmajority of states either impose no con-traceptive coverage requirement, or offerbroader exemptions than the exemptioncontained in the July 2015 nal regula-tions. 146States also generally protect moral convictions in health care con-science laws, and they often offer thoseprotections whether or not an entity oper- 144Seehttps://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ and 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the \"exceptions, reductions, and limitations of the coverage,\" including group health plans and group & individual issuers). 146SeeGuttmacher Institute, \"Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives\" (Aug. 1, 2017), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/insurance-coverage-contraceptives. Bulletin No. 2017-44 30, 2017 445ates as a nonprot.147Although the prac- tice of states is by no means a limit on the discretion delegated to HRSA by the Af-fordbable Care Act, nor is it a statementabout what the Federal Government maydo consistent with other protections orlimitations in federal law, such state prac-tice can be informative as to the viabilityof offering protections for conscientiousobjections in particularly sensitive healthcare contexts. In this case, the existence ofmany instances where conscience protec-tions are offered, or no underlying man-date of this kind exists that could violatemoral convictions, supports the Depart-ments' decision to expand the Federal ex-emption concerning this Mandate as setforth in these interim nal rules. Section 147.133(a)(1)(i)(A) of the rules species that the exemption includesthe plans of a plan sponsor that is a non-prot organization with sincerely heldmoral convictions. Section 147.133(a)(1)(i)(B) of the rules species that the exemption includes theplans of a plan sponsor that is a for-protentity that has no publicly traded owner-ship interests (for this purpose, a publiclytraded ownership interest is any class ofcommon equity securities required to beregistered under section 12 of the Securi-ties Exchange Act of 1934). Extending the exemption to certain for- prot entities is consistent with the Su-preme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby, which declared that a corporate entity iscapable of possessing and pursuing non-pecuniary goals (in Hobby Lobby, reli- gion), regardless of whether the entity op-erates as a nonprot organization, andrejecting the Departments' argument tothe contrary. 134 S. Ct. 2768-75. Somereports and industry experts have indi-cated that not many for-prot entities be-yond those that had originally brought suit have sought relief from the Mandate afterHobby Lobby. 148The mechanisms for de- termining whether a company has adoptedand holds certain principles or views, suchas sincerely held moral convictions, is amatter of well-established State law with respect to corporate decision-making, 149 and the Departments expect that applica-tion of such laws would cabin the scope ofthis exemption. The July 2015 nal regulations ex- tended the accommodation to for-protentities only if they are closely held, bypositively dening what constitutes aclosely held entity. Any such positive def-inition runs up against the myriad statedifferences in dening such entities, andpotentially intrudes into a traditional areaof state regulation of business organiza-tions. The Departments implicitly recog-nized the difculty of dening closelyheld entities in the July 2015 nal regula-tions when we adopted a denition thatincluded entities that are merely \"substan-tially similar\" to certain specied param-eters, and we allowed entities that werenot sure if they met the denition to in-quire with HHS; HHS was permitted todecline to answer the inquiry, at whichtime the entity would be deemed to qual-ify as an eligible organization. Instead ofattempting to positively dene closelyheld businesses for the purpose of thisrule, the Departments consider it muchmore clear, effective, and preferable todene the category negatively by refer-ence to one element of our previous def-inition, namely, that the entity has no pub-licly traded ownership interest (that is, anyclass of common equity securities re-quired to be registered under section 12 ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934). In this way, these interim nal rules differ from the exemption provided toplan sponsors with objections based onsincerely held religious beliefs set forth in\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)\u2014those extend to for-prot entities whether or not they areclosely held or publicly traded. TheDepartments seek public comment on whether the exemption in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(i) for plan sponsors with moral objec-tions to the Mandate should be nalized toencompass all of the types of plan spon-sors covered by \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i), in-cluding publicly traded corporations with objections based on sincerely held moralconvictions, and also non-federal govern-mental plan sponsors that may have ob-jections based on sincerely held moralconvictions. In the case of particularly sensitive health care matters, several signicantfederal health care conscience statutesprotect entities' moral objections withoutprecluding publicly traded and govern-mental entities from using those protec-tions. For example, the rst paragraph ofthe Church Amendments provides certainprotections for entities that object basedon moral convictions to making their fa-cilities or personnel available to assist inthe performance of abortions or steriliza-tions, and the statute does not limit thoseprotections based on whether the entitiesare publicly traded or governmental. (42U.S.C. 300a-7(b)). Thus, under section300a-7(b), a hospital in a publicly tradedhealth system, or a local governmentalhospital, could adopt sincerely held moralconvictions by which it objects to provid-ing facilities or personnel for abortions orsterilizations, and if the entity receivesrelevant funds from HHS specied by sec-tion 300a-7(b), the protections of thatsection would apply. The Coats-SnoweAmendment likewise provides certainprotections for health care entities andpostgraduate physician training programsthat choose not to perform, refer for, orprovide training for abortions, and thestatute does not limit those protectionsbased on whether the entities are publiclytraded or governmental. (42 U.S.C. 238n). The Weldon Amendment 150provides certain protections for health care entities,hospitals, provider-sponsored organiza-tions, health maintenance organizations,and health insurance plans that do notprovide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions, and the statute doesnot limit those protections based onwhether the entity is publicly traded orgovernmental. The Affordable Care Actprovides certain protections for any insti- 147See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, \"Refusing to Provide Health Services\" (Aug. 1, 2017), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health- services. 148See Jennifer Haberkorn, \"Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,\" Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), available at http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control- mandate-employers-229627. 149Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notication, they would expect that such principles or views would have been adopted and documented in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which they are incorporated or organized. 150Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 446tutional health care entity, hospital, provider-sponsored organization, healthmaintenance organization, health insur-ance plan, or any other kind of health carefacility, that does not provide any healthcare item or service furnished for the pur-pose of causing or assisting in causingassisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy kill-ing, and the statute similarly does not limitthose protections based on whether theentity is publicly traded or governmental.(42 U.S.C. 18113). 151 and 1396u- 2(b)(3) U.S.C. protect organizationsthat offer Medicaid and Medicare Advan-tage managed care plans from being re-quired to provide, reimburse for, or providecoverage of a counseling or referral serviceif they object to doing so on moral grounds,and those paragraphs do not further specifythat publicly traded entities do not qualifyfor the protections. Congress' most recentstatement on Government requirements ofcontraceptive coverage specied that, if theDistrict of Columbia requires \"the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insur-ance plans,\" \"it is the intent of Congress thatany legislation enacted on such issue shouldinclude a 'conscience clause' which pro-vides exceptions for religious beliefs andmoral convictions.\" Appropri-ations Act of 2017, Division C, Title VIII,Sec. 808. Congress expressed no intent thatsuch a conscience should be limited basedon whether the entity is publicly traded. At the same time, the Departments lack signicant information about the need toextend the expanded exemption further.We have been subjected to litigation bynonprot entities expressing objections tothe Mandate based on non-religious moralconvictions, and we have been sued byclosely held for-prot entities expressingreligious objections. This combination ofdifferent types of plaintiffs leads us tobelieve that there may be a small numberof closely held for-prot entities thatwould seek to use an exemption to thecontraceptive Mandate based on moralconvictions. The fact that many closelyheld for-prot entities brought challengesto the Mandate has led us to offer protec-tions that would include publicly tradedentities with religious objections to theMandate if such entities exist. But the combined lack of any lawsuits challeng-ing the Mandate by for-prot entities withnon-religious moral convictions, and ofany lawsuits by any kind of publiclytraded entity, leads us to not extend theexpanded exemption in these interim nalrules to publicly traded entities, but ratherto invite public comment on whether to doso in a way parallel to the protections setforth in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i). We agree withthe Supreme Court that it is improbablethat many publicly traded companies withnumerous \"unrelated shareholders\u2014in-cluding institutional investors with theirown set of stakeholders\u2014would agree torun a corporation under the same religiousbeliefs\" (or moral convictions) andthereby qualify for the exemption. Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2774. We are also not aware of other types of plan sponsors (suchas non-Federal governmental entities) thatmight possess moral objections to compli-ance with the Mandate, including whethersome might consider certain contraceptive methods as having a possible abortifacienteffect. Nevertheless, we would welcomeany comments on whether such corpora-tions or other plan sponsors exist and wouldbenet from such an exemption. Despite our a lack of complete infor- mation, the Departments know that non-prot entities have challenged the Man-date, and we assume that a closely heldbusiness might wish to assert non-religiousmoral convictions in objecting to the Man-date (although we anticipate very few if anywill do so). Thus we have chosen in theseinterim nal rules to include them in theexpanded exemption and thereby remove anobstacle preventing such entities fromclaiming an exemption based on non-religious moral convictions. But we are lesscertain that we need to use these interimnal rules to extend the expanded exemp-tion for moral convictions to encompassother kinds of plan sponsors not included inthe protections of these interim nal rules.Therefore, with respect to plan sponsors notincluded in the expanded exemptions of\u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(i), and non-federal govern-mental plan sponsors that might have moralobjections to the Mandate, we invite publiccomment on whether to include such enti-ties when we nalize these rules at a laterdate. The Departments further conclude that it would be inadequate to merely provideentities access to the accommodation pro-cess instead of to the exemption wherethose entities object to the Mandate basedon sincerely held moral convictions. TheDepartments have stated in our regula-tions and court briengs that the existingaccommodation with respect to self-insured plans requires contraceptive cov- erage as part of the same plan as thecoverage provided by the employer, andoperates in a way \"seamless\" to thoseplans. As a result, in signicant respects,the accommodation process does not ac-tually accommodate the objections ofmany entities. This has led many religiousgroups to challenge the accommodation incourt, and we expect similar challengeswould come from organizations objectingto the accommodation based on moralconvictions if we offered them the accom-modation but not an exemption. When wetook that narrow approach with religiousnonprot entities it led to multiple cases inmany courts that we needed to litigate tothe Supreme Court various times. Althoughobjections to the accommodation were notspecically litigated in the two casesbrought by nonprot non-religious organi-zations (because we have not even madethem eligible for the accommodation), thoseorganizations made it clear that they andtheir employees strongly oppose coverageof certain contraceptives in their plans andin connection with their plans. 3. Exemption for Institutions of Higher Education The plans of institutions of higher ed- ucation that arrange student health insur- ance coverage will be treated similarly tothe way that plans of employers aretreated for the purposes of such plans be-ing exempt or accommodated based onmoral convictions. These interim nalrules specify, in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(ii), thatthe exemption is extended, in the case ofinstitutions of higher education (as de-ned in 20 U.S.C. 1002), to their arrange-ment of student health insurance cover- 151The lack of the limitation in this provision may be particularly relevant since it is contained in the same statute, the ACA, as the provision under which the Mandate\u2014and these exemptions to the Mandate\u2014are promulgated. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 447age, in a manner comparable to the applicability of the exemption for grouphealth insurance coverage provided inconnection with a group health plan estab-lished or maintained by a plan sponsor. The Departments are not aware of institutions of higher education that ar-range student coverage and object to theMandate based on non-religious moralconvictions. We have been sued by sev-eral institutions of higher education thatarrange student coverage and object tothe Mandate based on religious beliefs.We believe the existence of such entitieswith non-religious moral objections, orthe possible formation of such entities inthe future, is sufciently possible so thatwe should provide protections for themin these interim nal rules. But based ona lack of information about such enti-ties, we assume that none will use theexemption concerning student coverageat this time. 4. Exemption for Issuers These interim nal rules extend the exemption, in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii), to health insurance issuers offering group orindividual health insurance coverage thatsincerely hold their own moral convic-tions opposed to providing coverage forcontraceptive services. As discussed above, where the exemp- tion for plan sponsors or institutions ofhigher education applies, issuers are ex-empt under those sections with respect toproviding coverage in those plans. Theissuer exemption in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii)adds to that protection, but the additionalprotection operates in a different way thanthe plan sponsor exemption operates. Theonly plan sponsors, or in the case of indi-vidual insurance coverage, individuals,who are eligible to purchase or enroll inhealth insurance coverage offered by anexempt issuer that does not cover some orall contraceptive services are plan spon-sors or individuals who themselves objectand are otherwise exempt based on theirobjection (whether the objection is basedon moral convictions, as set forth in theserules, or on religious beliefs, as set forth inexemptions created by the companion in-terim nal rules published elsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin). Thus, the issuer exemption species that where a healthinsurance issuer providing group healthinsurance coverage is exempt under para-graph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subjectto any requirement to provide coveragefor contraceptive services under Guide-lines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) un-less the plan is otherwise exempt fromthat requirement. Accordingly, the onlyplan sponsors, or in the case of individualinsurance coverage, individuals, who areeligible to purchase or enroll in healthinsurance coverage offered by an issuerthat is exempt under this paragraph(a)(1)(iii) that does not include some or allcontraceptive services are plan sponsorsor individuals who themselves object andare exempt. Under the rules as amended, issuers with objections based on sincerely heldmoral convictions could issue policiesthat omit contraception to plan sponsors or individuals that are otherwise exempt based on either their religious beliefs or theirmoral convictions, and issuers with sin-cerely held religious beliefs could likewiseissue policies that omit contraception to plansponsors or individuals that are otherwiseexempt based on either their religious be-liefs or their moral convictions. Issuers that hold moral objections should identify to plan sponsors the lack of contra-ceptive coverage in any health insurancecoverage being offered that is based on theissuer's exemption, and communicate thegroup health plan's independent obligationto provide contraceptive coverage, unlessthe group health plan itself is exempt underregulations governing the Mandate. In this way, the issuer exemption serves to protect objecting issuers bothfrom being asked or required to issue pol-icies that cover contraception in violationof the issuers' sincerely held moral con-victions, and from being asked or requiredto issue policies that omit contraceptivecoverage to non-exempt entities or indi-viduals, thus subjecting the issuers to po-tential liability if those plans are not ex-empt from the Guidelines. At the sametime, the issuer exemption will not serveto remove contraceptive coverage obli- gations from any plan or plan sponsorthat is not also exempt, nor will it pre-vent other issuers from being required toprovide contraceptive coverage in indi-vidual insurance coverage. Protectingissuers that object to offering contracep-tive coverage based on sincerely heldmoral convictions will help preservespace in the health insurance market forcertain issuers so that exempt plan spon-sors and individuals will be able to ob-tain coverage. The Departments are not currently aware of health insurance issuers that pos-sess their own religious or moral objec-tions to offering contraceptive coverage.Nevertheless, many Federal health careconscience laws and regulations protectissuers or plans specically. For example,as discussed above, 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) protectplans or managed care organizations inMedicaid or Medicare Advantage. TheWeldon Amendment protects HMOs,health insurance plans, and any otherhealth care organizations from being re-quired to provide coverage or pay forabortions. See, for example, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div. H, Title V, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-31. Themost recently enacted Consolidated Ap-propriations Act declares that \"conscience clause\" to protectmoral concerning \"the provi-sion contraceptive coverage by healthinsurance plans.\" See id. at Div. C, Title VIII, Sec. 808. The issuer exemption does not specif- ically include third party administrators,for the reasons discussed in the compan-ion interim nal rules concerning reli-gious beliefs issued contemporaneouslywith these interim nal rules and pub-lished elsewhere in this issue of the Bul- letin. The Departments solicit public com-ment; however, on whether there aresituations where there may be an addi-tional need to provide distinct protectionsfor third party administrators that mayhave moral convictions implicated by theMandate. 152 152The exemption for issuers, as outlined here, does not make a distinction among issuers based on whether they are publicly traded, unlike the plan sponsor exemption for business entities. Because the issuer exemption operates more narrowly than the exemption for business plan sponsors operates, in the ways described here, and exists in part to help preserve market options for objecting plan sponsors, the Departments consider it appropriate to not draw such a distinction among issuers. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 4485. Scope of Objections Needed for the Objecting Entity Exemption Exemptions for objecting entities spec- ify that they apply where the entities ob- ject as specied in \u00a7 147.133(a)(2). Thatsection species that exemptions for ob-jecting entities will apply to the extent thatan entity described in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1) ob-jects to its establishing, maintaining, pro-viding, offering, or arranging (as applica-ble) for coverage, payments, or a plan thatprovides coverage or payments for someor all contraceptive services, based on itssincerely held moral convictions. 6. Individual Exemption These interim nal rules include a spe- cial rule pertaining to individuals (referred to here as the \"individual exemption\").Section 147.133(b) provides CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv), may be construed to pre-vent a willing plan sponsor of a grouphealth plan and/or a willing health insur-ance issuer offering group or individualhealth insurance coverage, from offering aseparate benet package option, or a sep-arate policy, certicate, or contract of in-surance, to any individual who objects tocoverage or payments for some or all con-traceptive services based on the individu-al's sincerely held moral convictions. Theindividual exemption extends to the cov-erage unit in which the plan participant, orsubscriber in the individual market, is en-rolled (for instance, to family coveragecovering the participant and his or herbeneciaries enrolled under the plan), butdoes not relieve the plan's or issuer's ob-ligation to comply with the Mandate withrespect to the group health plan at large or,as applicable, to any other individual pol-icies the issuer offers. This individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not speci-cally object to contraceptive coverage tooffer morally acceptable coverage to theirparticipants or subscribers who do object, while offering coverage that includes con-traception to participants or subscriberswho do not object. This individual exemp-tion can apply with respect to individualsin plans sponsored by private employersor governmental employers. For example,in one case brought against the Depart-ments, the State of Missouri enacted a lawunder which the State is not permitted to discriminate against insurance issuersthat offer health plans without coveragefor contraception based on employees'moral convictions, or against the indi-vidual employees who accept such of-fers. See Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015-16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat.191.724). Under the individual exemp-tion of these interim nal rules, employ-ers sponsoring governmental planswould be free to honor the sincerelyheld moral objections of individual em-ployees by offering them plans that omitcontraception, even if those governmen-tal entities do not object to offering con-traceptive coverage in general. This \"individual exemption\" cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or anissuer to provide coverage omitting con-traception, or, with respect to health insur-ance coverage, to prevent the applicationof state law that requires coverage of suchcontraceptives or sterilization. Nor can theindividual exemption be construed to re-quire the guaranteed availability of cover-age omitting contraception to a plan spon-sor or individual who does not have asincerely held moral objection. This indi-vidual exemption is limited to the require-ment to provide contraceptive coverageunder section 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act,and does not affect any other federal orstate law governing the plan or coverage.Thus, if there are other applicable laws or plan terms governing the benets, theseinterim nal rules do not affect such otherlaws or terms. The Departments believe the individ- ual exemption will help to meet the Af-fordable Care Act's goal of increasinghealth coverage because it will reduce the incidence of certain individuals choosingto forego health coverage because theonly coverage available would violatetheir sincerely held moral convictions. 153 At the same time, this individual exemp-tion \"does not undermine the governmen-tal interests furthered by the contraceptivecoverage requirement,\" 154because, when the exemption is applicable, the individualdoes not want the coverage, and thereforewould not use the objectionable itemseven if they were covered. In addition,because the individual exemption only op-erates when the employer and/or issuer, asapplicable, are willing, the exemption willnot undermine any governmental interestin the workability of the insurance market,because we expect that any workabilityconcerns will be taken into account in thedecision of whether to be willing to offerthe individual morally acceptable cover-age. For similar reasons, we have changed our position and now believe the individ-ual exemption will not undermine anyGovernment interest in uniformity in thehealth insurance market. At the level ofplan offerings, the extent to which planscover contraception under the prior rulesis already far from uniform. The Congressdid not require compliance with section2713 of the PHS Act by all entities\u2014inparticular by grandfathered plans. TheDepartments' previous exemption forhouses of worship and integrated auxil-iaries, and our accommodation of self-insured church plans, show that the im-portance of a uniform health insurancesystem is not signicantly harmed byallowing plans to omit contraception inmany contexts. 155 With respect to operationalizing this provision of these rules, as well as the similar provision protecting individualswith religious objections to purchasing in-surance that covers some or all contracep-tives, in the interim nal rules publishedelsewhere in this issue of the Bulletin, the Departments note that a plan sponsor or 153This prospect has been raised in cases of religious individuals\u2014see, for example, Wieland, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1017, and March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130\u2014where the courts noted that the individual employee plaintiffs indicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to \"forgo health insurance altogether.\" (3d Cir. Aug. 4, 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so would not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning marke t...Because the government has failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the ACA) would be unworkable, it has not satised strict scrutiny.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 449health insurance issuer is not required to offer separate and different benet pack-age options, or separate and differentforms of policy, certicate, or contract ofinsurance with respect to those individualswho object on moral bases from thosewho object on religious bases. That is, awilling employer or issuer may offer thesame benet package option or policy,certicate, or contract of insurance\u2014which excludes the same scope of some orall contraceptive coverage\u2014to individualswho are exempt from the Mandate be-cause of their moral convictions (underthese rules) or their religious beliefs (un-der the regulations as amended by theinterim nal rules pertaining to religiousbeliefs). 7. Optional Accommodation In addition to expanding the exemption to those with sincerely held moral convic- tions, these rules also expand eligibilityfor the optional accommodation processto include employers with objectionsbased on sincerely held moral convictions.This is accomplished by inserting refer-ences to the newly added exemption formoral convictions, 45 CFR 147.133, intothe regulatory sections where other re-spects the accommodation process worksthe same as it does for entities with ob-jections based on sincerely held religiousbeliefs, as described in the companion in-terim nal rules concerning religious be-liefs issued contemporaneously with theseinterim nal rules and published else-where in this issue of the Bulletin. The Departments are not aware of en- tities with objections to the Mandatebased on sincerely held moral convictionsthat wish to make use of the optionalaccommodation, and our present assump-tion is that no such entities will seek to usethe accommodation rather than the ex-emption. But if such entities do wish touse the accommodation, making it avail-able to them will both provide contracep-tive coverage to their plan participants andrespect those entities' objections. Becauseentities with objections to the Mandatebased on sincerely held non-religiousmoral convictions have not previously hadaccess to the accommodation, they would not be in a position to revoke their use ofthe accommodation at the time these in-terim nal rules are issued, but could doso in the future under the same parametersset forth in the accommodation regula-tions. 8. Regulatory Restatements of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act These interim nal rules insert refer- ences to 45 CFR 147.133 into the restate- ments of the requirements of section2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PHS Act, con-tained in 26 54.9815-2713T(a)(1)introductory text and 45 CFR 147.130(a)(1)and (a)(1)(iv). 9. Conclusion The Departments believe that the Guidelines, and the expanded exemptions and accommodations set forth in theseinterim nal rules, will advance the legit-imate but limited purposes for which Con-gress imposed section 2713 of the PHSAct, while acting consistently with Con-gress' w ell-established record of allow- ing for moral exemptions with respect tovarious health care matters. These in-terim nal rules maintain HRSA's dis-cretion to decide whether to continue torequire contraceptive coverage underthe Guidelines if no regulatorily recog-nized exemption exists (and in planswhere Congress applied section 2713 ofthe PHS Act). As cited above, theseinterim nal rules also leave fully inplace over a dozen Federal programsthat provide, or subsidize, contracep-tives for women, including for low in-come women based on nancial need.The Departments believe this array ofprograms and requirements better servesthe interests of providing contraceptivecoverage while protecting the moralconvictions of entities and individualsconcerning coverage of some or all con-traceptive or sterilization services. The Departments request and encour- age public comments on all matters ad-dressed in these interim nal rules.IV. Interim Final Rules, Request for Comments and Waiver of Delay ofEffective Date Section 9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792 of the PHS Act authorize the Secretaries of the Trea-sury, Labor, and HHS (collectively, theSecretaries) to promulgate any interim -nal rules that they determine are appropri-ate to carry out the provisions of chapter100 of the Code, part 7 of subtitle B oftitle I of ERISA, and part A of title XXVIIof the PHS Act, which include sections2701 through 2728 of the PHS Act and theincorporation of those sections into sec-tion 715 of ERISA and section 9815 of theCode. These interim nal rules fall underthose statutory authorized justications,as did previous rules on this matter (75 FR41726; 76 FR 46621; and 79 FR 51092). Section 553(b) of the APA requires notice and comment rulemaking, involv-ing a notice of proposed rulemaking and a comment period prior to nalization ofregulatory requirements - except when anagency, for good cause, nds that notice and public comment thereon are imprac-ticable, unnecessary, or contrary to thepublic interest. These provisions ofthe APA do not apply here because ofthe specic authority granted to the Sec-retaries by section 9833 of the Code,section 734 of ERISA, and section 2792of the PHS Act. Even if these provisions of the APA applied, they would be satised: TheDepartments have determined that itwould be impracticable and contrary tothe public interest to delay putting theseprovisions in place until a full publicnotice-and-comment process is com-pleted. As discussed earlier, the Depart-ments have issued three interim nalrules implementing this section of thePHS Act because of the immediateneeds of covered entities and theweighty matters implicated by theHRSA Guidelines. As recently as De-cember 20, 2016, HRSA updated thoseGuidelines without engaging in the reg-ulatory process (because doing so is nota legal requirement), and announcedthat it plans to so continue to update theGuidelines. Two lawsuits have been pending for several years by entities raising non- October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 450religious moral objections to the Man- date.156In one of those cases, the De- partments are subject to a permanentinjunction and the appeal of that casehas been stayed since February 2016. Inthe other case, Federal district and ap-peals courts ruled in favor of the Depart-ments, denying injunctive relief to theplaintiffs, and that case is also stillpending. Based on the public commentsthe Departments have received, we havereason to believe that some similar non-prot entities might exist, even if it islikely a small number. 157 For entities and individuals facing a burden on their sincerely held moral con-victions, providing them relief from Gov-ernment regulations that impose such aburden is an important and urgent matter,and delay in doing so injures those entitiesin ways that cannot be repaired retroac-tively. The burdens of the existing rulesundermine these entities' and individuals'participation in the health care market be-cause they provide them with a seriousdisincentive\u2014indeed a crisis of con-science\u2014between participating in or pro-viding quality and affordable health insur-ance coverage and being forced to violatetheir sincerely held moral convictions.The existence of inconsistent court rulingsin multiple proceedings has also causedconfusion and uncertainty that has ex- tended for several years, with differentfederal courts taking different positions onwhether entities with moral objections areentitled to relief from the Mandate. De-laying the availability of the expandedexemption would require entities to bearthese burdens for many more months.Continuing to apply the Mandate's regu-latory burden on individuals and organi-zations with moral convictions objectingto compliance with the Mandate alsoserves as a deterrent for citizens whomight consider forming new entities con-sistent with their moral convictions andoffering health insurance through thoseentities. Moreover, we separately expanded ex- emptions to protect religious beliefs in thecompanion interim nal rules issued con- temporaneously with these interim nalrules and published elsewhere in this issueof the Bulletin. Because Congress has provided many statutes that protect reli-gious beliefs and moral convictions simi-larly in certain health care contexts, it isimportant not to delay the expansion ofexemptions for moral convictions set forthin these rules, since the companion rulesprovide protections for religious beliefson an interim nal basis. Otherwise, ourregulations would simultaneously provideand deny relief to entities and individualsthat are, in the Departments' view, simi-larly deserving of exemptions and accom-modations consistent, with similar protec-tions in other federal laws. This couldcause similarly situated entities and indi-viduals to be burdened unequally. In response to several of the previous rules on this issue\u2014including three issuedas interim nal rules under the statutoryauthority cited above\u2014the Departmentsreceived more than 100,000 public com-ments on multiple occasions. Those com-ments included extensive discussion aboutwhether and to what extent to expand theexemption. Most recently, on July 26,2016, the Departments issued a request forinformation (81 FR 47741) and receivedover 54,000 public comments about dif-ferent possible ways to resolve these is- sues. As noted above, the public com-ments in response to both the RFI andvarious prior rulemaking proceedings in-cluded specic requests that the exemp-tions be expanded to include those whooppose the Mandate for either religious or\"moral\" reasons. 158In connection with past regulations, the Departments have of-fered or expanded a temporary safe harborallowing organizations that were not ex-empt from the HRSA Guidelines to oper-ate out of compliance with the Guidelines.The Departments will fully consider com-ments submitted in response to these in-terim nal rules, but believe that goodcause exists to issue the rules on an in-terim nal basis before the comments aresubmitted and reviewed. Issuing interimnal rules with a comment period pro- vides the public with an opportunity tocomment on whether these regulations ex-panding the exemption should be madepermanent or subject to modicationwithout delaying the effective date of theregulations. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit stated with respect to an ear-lier IFR promulgated with respect to thisissue in Priests for Life v. U.S. Depart- ment of Health and Human Services , 772 F.3d 229, 276 (D.C. Cir. 2014), vacated on other grounds, Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 1557 (2016), \"[S]everal reasons sup-port HHS's decision not to engage in no-tice and comment here.\" Among otherthings, the Court noted that \"the agencymade a good cause nding in the rule itissued\"; that \"the regulations the interimnal rule modies were recently enactedpursuant to notice and comment rulemak-ing, and presented virtually identical is-sues\"; that \"HHS will expose its interimrule to notice and comment before its per-manent implementation\"; and that notproceeding under interim nal ruleswould implementation of thealternative opt-out for religious objec-tors.\" Id.at 277. Similarly, not proceeding with exemptions and accommodations formoral objectors here would delay the im-plementation of those alternative opt-outs for moral objectors. Delaying the availability of the ex- panded exemption could also increase thecosts of health insurance for some entities.As reflected in litigation pertaining to theMandate, some entities are in grandfa-thered health plans that do not cover con-traception. As such, they may wish tomake changes to their health plans thatwill reduce the costs of insurance cover-age for their beneciaries or policyhold-ers, but which would cause the plans tolose grandfathered status. To the extentthat entities with objections to the Man-date based on moral convictions but notreligious beliefs fall into this category,they may be refraining from making thosechanges\u2014and therefore may be continu- 156March for Life, 128 F. Supp. 3d 116; Real Alternatives, 867 F.3d 338. 157See, for example, Americans United for Life (\"AUL\") Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D/H11005HHS-OS- 2011-0023-59496, and AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P at 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at 30, 2017 451ing to incur and pass on higher insurance costs\u2014to prevent the Mandate from ap-plying to their plans in violation of theirconsciences. We are not aware of the ex-tent to which such entities exist, but 17percent of all covered workers are ingrandfathered health plans, encompassingtens of millions of people. 159Issuing these rules on an interim nal basis reduces thecosts of health insurance and regulatoryburdens for such entities and their planparticipants. These interim nal rules also expand access to the optional accommodationprocess for certain entities with objectionsto the Mandate based on moral convic-tions. If entities exist that wish to use thatprocess, the Departments believe theyshould be able to do so without the delaythat would be involved by not offeringthem the optional accommodation processby use of interim nal rules. Proceedingotherwise could delay the provision ofcontraceptive coverage to those entities'employees. For the foregoing reasons, the De- partments have determined that it wouldbe impracticable and contrary to thepublic interest to engage in full noticeand comment rulemaking before puttingthese interim nal rules into effect, andthat it is in the public interest to promul-gate interim nal rules. For the samereasons, the Departments have deter-mined, consistent with section 553(d) ofthe APA (5 U.S.C. 553(d)), that there isgood cause to make these interim nalrules effective immediately upon lingfor public inspection at the Ofce of the Federal Register . V. Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden We have examined the impacts of the interim nal rules as required by Execu- tive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planningand Review (September 30, 1993), Exec-utive Order 13563 on Improving Regula-tion and Regulatory Review (January 18,2011),, the Regulatory Flexibility Act(RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, section1102(b) of the Social SecurityAct, section 202 of the Unfunded Man-dates Reform Act of 1995 (March 22,1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999),the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C.804(2)and Executive Order 13771 on Re-ducing Regulation and Controlling Regu-latory Costs (January 30, 2017). A. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563\u2014 Department of HHS and Department ofLabor Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 di- rect agencies to assess all costs and ben- ets of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to selectregulatory approaches that maximize netbenets (including potential economic,environmental, and and benets, reducing costs, har-monizing rules, and promoting Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 denes a \"signicant regulatory action\" asan action that is likely to result in a reg-ulation: (1) having an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more in any 1year, or adversely and materially affectinga sector of the economy, productivity,competition, jobs, the environment, publichealth or safety, or State, local, or tribalgovernments or communities (also re-ferred to as \"economically signicant\");(2) creating a serious inconsistency or oth-erwise interfering with an action taken orplanned by another agency; (3) materiallyaltering the budgetary impacts of entitle-ment grants, user fees, or loan programsor the rights and obligations of recipientsthereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policyissues arising out of legal mandates, thePresident's priorities, or the principles setforth in the Executive Order. A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economi-cally signicant effects ($100 million ormore in any one year), and an \"economi-cally signicant\" regulatory action is sub-ject to review by the Ofce of Manage- ment and Budget (OMB). As discussedbelow regarding anticipated effects ofthese rules and the Paperwork ReductionAct, these interim nal rules are not likely to have economic impacts of $100 millionor more in any one year, and therefore donot meet the denition of \"economicallysignicant\" under Executive Order 12866.However, OMB has determined that theactions are signicant within the meaningof section 3(f)(4) of the Executive Order.Therefore, OMB has reviewed these nalregulations and the Departments have pro-vided the following assessment of theirimpact. . 1. Need for Regulatory Action These interim nal rules amend the Departments' July 2015 nal regulations and do so in conjunction with the amend-ments made in the companion interim -nal rules concerning religious beliefsissued contemporaneously with these in-terim nal rules and published elsewherein this issue of the Bulletin. These interim nal rules expand the exemption from therequirement to provide coverage for con-traceptives and sterilization, establishedunder the HRSA Guidelines, promulgatedunder section 2713(a)(4) 715(a)(1) of the ERISA, and sec-tion 9815(a)(1) of the Code, to includecertain entities and individuals with objec-tions to compliance with the Mandatebased on sincerely held moral convictions,and they revise the accommodation pro-cess to make entities with such convic-tions eligible to use it. The expandedexemption would apply to certain individ-uals, nonprot entities, institutions ofhigher education, issuers, and for-protentities that do not have publicly tradedownership interests, that have a moral ob-jection to providing coverage for some (orall) of the contraceptive and/or steriliza-tion services covered by the Guidelines.Such action is taken, among other reasons,to provide for conscientious participationin the health insurance market free frompenalties for violating sincerely heldmoral convictions opposed to providing orreceiving coverage of contraceptive ser-vices, to resolve lawsuits that have beenled against the Departments by somesuch entities, and to avoid similar legalchallenges. 159Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2017 Annual Survey,\" available 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 4522. Anticipated Effects The Departments acknowledge that ex- panding the exemption to include objec- tions based on moral convictions mightresult in less insurance coverage of con-traception for some women who maywant the coverage. Although the Depart-ments do not know the exact scope of thateffect attributable to the moral exemptionin these interim nal rules, they believe itto be small. With respect to the expanded exemp- tion for nonprot organizations, as noted above the Departments are aware of twosmall nonprot organizations that haveled lawsuits raising non-religious moralobjections to coverage of some contracep-tives. Both of those entities have fewerthan ve employees enrolled in healthcoverage, and both require all of theiremployees to agree with their oppositionto the coverage. 160Based on comments submitted in response to prior rulemak-ings on this subject, we believe that atleast one other similar entity exists. How-ever, we do not know how many similarentities exist. Lacking other informationwe assume that the number is small. With-out data to estimate the number of suchentities, we believe it to be less than 10,and assume the exemption will be used bynine nonprot entities. We also assume that those nine entities will operate in a fashion similar to the twosimilar entities of which we are aware, sothat their employees will likely share theirviews against coverage of certain contra-ceptives. This is consistent with our con-clusion in previous rules that no signi-cant burden or costs would result fromexempting houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries. (See 76 FR 46625 and 78 FR 39889). We reached that conclu-sion without ultimately requiring thathouses of worship and integrated auxilia-ries only hire persons who agree with theirviews against contraception, and withouteven requiring that such entities actuallyoppose contraception in order to be ex-empt (in contrast, the expanded exemptionhere requires the exempt entity to actuallypossess sincerely held moral convictions objecting to the coverage). In concludingthat the exemption for houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries would result inno signicant burden or costs, we reliedon our assumption that the employees ofexempt houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries likely share their employers'opposition to contraceptive coverage. A similar assumption is supported with respect to the expanded exemption fornonprot organizations. To our knowl-edge, the vast majority of organizationsobjecting to the Mandate assert religiousbeliefs. The only nonprot organizationsof which we are aware that possess non-religious moral convictions against someor all contraceptive methods only hire per-sons who share their convictions. It ispossible that the exemption for nonprotorganizations with moral convictions inthese interim nal rules could be used bya nonprot organization that employs per-sons who do not share the organization'sviews on contraception, but it was alsopossible under our previous rules that ahouse of worship or integrated auxiliarycould employ persons who do not sharetheir views on contraception. 161Although we are unable to nd sufcient data onthis issue, we believe that there are farfewer non-religious moral nonprot orga-nizations opposed to contraceptive cover-age than there are churches with religiousobjections to such coverage. Based on ourlimited data, we believe the most likelyeffect of the expanded exemption for non-prot entities is that it will be used byentities similar to the two entities thathave sought an exemption through litiga-tion, and whose employees also opposethe coverage. Therefore, we expect thatthe expanded exemption for nonprotentities will have no effect of reducingcontraceptive coverage to employees whowant that coverage. These interim nal rules expand the exemption to include institutions of highereducation that arrange student coverageand have non-religious moral objectionsto the Mandate, and they make exemptentities with moral objections eligible touse the accommodation. The Departments are not aware of either kind of entity. Webelieve the number of entities that objectto the Mandate based on non-religiousmoral convictions is already very small.The only entities of which we are awarethat have raised such objections are not institutions of higher education, and ap-pear to hold objections that we assumewould likely lead them to reject the ac-commodation process. Therefore, for thepurposes of estimating the anticipated ef-fect of these interim nal rules on contra-ceptive coverage of women who wishto receive such coverage, we assumethat\u2014at this time\u2014no entities with non-religious moral objections to the Mandatewill be institutions of higher educationthat arrange student coverage, and no en-tities with non-religious moral objectionswill opt into the accommodation. We wishto make the expanded exemption and ac-commodation available to such entities incase they do exist or might come intoexistence, based on similar reasons tothose given above for why the exemptionsand accommodations are extended toother entities. We invite public commenton whether and how many such entitieswill make use of these interim nal rules. The expanded exemption for issuers will not result in a distinct effect on con-traceptive coverage for women who wishto receive it because that exemption onlyapplies in cases where plan sponsors orindividuals are also otherwise exempt, andthe effect of those exemptions is discussedelsewhere herein. The expanded exemp-tion for individuals that oppose contracep-tive coverage based on sincerely heldmoral convictions will provide coveragethat omits contraception for individualsthat object to contraceptive coverage. The expanded moral exemption would also cover for-prot entities that do nothave publicly traded ownership interests,and that have non-religious moral objec-tions to the Mandate. The Departments arenot aware of any for-prot entities thatpossess non-religious moral objections tothe Mandate. However, scores of for-prot entities have led suit challenging 160Non-religious nonprot organizations that engage in expressive activity generally have a First Amendment right to hire only people who share their moral convictions or will be respectful of them\u2014including their convictions on whether the organization or others provide health coverage of contraception, or of certain items they view as being abortifacient. 161Cf., for example, Gallup, \"Americans, Including Catholics, Say Birth Control Is Morally OK,\" (May 22, 2012) (\"Eighty-two percent of U.S. Catholics say birth control is morally acceptable\"), available at http://www.gallup.com/poll/154799/americans-including-catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 453the Mandate. Among the over 200 entities that brought legal challenges, only twoentities (less than 1 percent) raised non-religious moral objections\u2014both werenonprot. Among the general public polls vary about religious beliefs, but one prom-inent poll shows that 89 percent of Amer-icans say they believe in God. 162Among non-religious persons, only a very smallpercentage appears to hold moral objec-tions to contraception. A recent studyfound that only 2 percent of religiouslyunafliated persons believed using contra-ceptives is morally wrong. 163Combined, this suggests that 0.2 percent of Ameri-cans at most 164might believe contracep- tives are morally wrong based on moralconvictions but not religious beliefs. Wehave no information about how many ofthose persons run closely held businesses,offer employer sponsored health insur-ance, and would make use of the ex-panded exemption for moral convictionsset forth in these interim nal rules. Giventhe large number of closely held entitiesthat challenged the Mandate based onreligious objections, we assume thatsome similar for-prot entities with non-religious moral objections exist. But weexpect that it will be a comparativelysmall number of entities, since among thenonprot litigants, only two were non-religious. Without data available to esti-mate the actual number of entities thatwill make use of the expanded exemptionfor for-prot entities that do not have pub-licly traded ownership interests and thathave objections to the Mandate based onsincerely held moral convictions, we ex-pect that fewer than 10 entities, if any, will do so\u2014we assume nine for-prot en-tities will use the exemption in these in-terim nal rules. The expanded exemption encompass- ing certain for-prot entities could result in the removal of contraceptive coveragefrom women who do not share their em-ployers' views. The Departments useddata from the Current Population Survey(CPS) and the Medical Expenditure PanelSurvey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC)to obtain an estimate of the number ofpolicyholders that will be covered by theplans of the nine for-prot entities weassume may make use of these expandedexemptions. 165The average number of policyholders (9) in plans with under 100employees was obtained. It is not knownwhat size the for-prot employers will bethat might claim this exemption, but asdiscussed above these interim nal rulesdo not include publicly traded companies(and we invite public comments onwhether to do so in the nal rules), andboth of the two nonprot entities thatchallenged the Mandate included fewerthan ve policyholders in each entity.Therefore we assume the for-prot enti-ties that may claim this expanded exemp-tion will have fewer than 100 employeesand an average of 9 policyholders. Fornine entities, the total number of policy-holders would be 81. DOL estimates thatfor each policyholder, there is approxi-mately one dependent. 166This amounts to 162 covered persons. Census data indicatethat women of childbearing age\u2014that is,women aged 15-44\u2014comprise 20.2 per-cent of the general population. 167This amounts to approximately 33 women of childbearing age for this group of individ-uals covered by group plans sponsored byfor-prot moral objectors. Approximately 44.3 percent of women currently use con-traceptives covered by the Guidelines. 168 Thus we estimate that 15 women mayincur contraceptive costs due to for-protentities using the expanded exemptionprovided in these interim nal rules. 169In the companion interim nal rules concern-ing religious beliefs issued contemporane-ously with these interim nal rules andpublished elsewhere in this issue of theBulletin, we estimate that the average costof contraception per year per woman ofchildbearing age that use contraceptioncovered by the Guidelines, within healthplans that cover contraception, is $584.Consequently, we estimate that the antic-ipated effects attributable to the cost ofcontraception from for-prot entities us-ing the expanded exemption in these in-terim nal rules is approximately $8,760. The Departments estimate that these interim nal rules will not result in anyadditional burden or costs on issuers orthird party administrators. As discussedabove, we assume that no entities withnon-religious moral convictions will usethe accommodation, although we wish tomake it available in case an entity volun-tarily opts into it in order to allow contra-ceptive coverage to be provided to its planparticipants and beneciaries. Finally, be-cause the accommodation process was notpreviously available to entities that pos-sess non-religious moral objections to the 162Gallup, \"Most Americans Still Believe in God\" (June 14-23, 2016), available at http://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx. 163Pew Research Center, \"Where the Public Stands on Religious Liberty vs. Nondiscrimination\" at page 26 (Sept. 28, 2016), available at http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/ sites/11/2016/09/Religious-Liberty-full-for-web.pdf. 164The study dened religiously \"unafliated\" as agnostic, atheist or \"nothing in particular\" (id. at 8), as distinct from several versions of Protestants, or Catholics. \"Nothing in particular\" might have included some theists. 165\"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21.

The Guidelines' requirement of contraceptive coverage only applies \"for all women with reproductive capacity.\" https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/; see also 80 FR 40318. In addition, studies commonly consider the 15-44 age range to assess contraceptive use by women of childbearing age. See,., Guttmacher Institute, \"Contraceptive Use in the United States\" (Sept. 2016), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. 168Seehttps://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. 169We note that many non-religious for-prot entities which sued the Departments challenging the Mandate, including some of the largest employers, only objected to coverage of 4 of the 18 types of contraceptives required to be covered by the Mandate\u2014namely, those contraceptives which they viewed as abortifacients, and akin to abortion \u2014and they were willing to provide coverage for other types of contraception. It is reasonable to assume that this would also be the case with respect to some for-prots that object to the Mandate on the basis of sincerelyheld moral convictions. Accordingly, it is possible that even fewer women beneciaries under such plans would bear out-of-pocket expenses in order to obtain contraceptives, and that thosewho might do so would bear lower costs due to many contraceptive items being covered. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 454Mandate, we do not anticipate that these interim nal rules will result in any bur-den from such entities revoking their ac-commodated status. The Departments believe the foregoing analysis represents a reasonable estimateof the likely impact under the rules ex-panded exemptions. The Departments ac-knowledge uncertainty in the estimate andtherefore conducted a second analysis us-ing an alternative framework, which is setforth in the companion interim nal ruleconcerning religious beliefs issued con-temporaneously with this interim nalrule and published elsewhere in this issueof the Bulletin. Under either estimate, this interim nal rule is not economically sig-nicant. We reiterate the rareness of instances in which we are aware that employersassert non-religious objections to contra-ceptive coverage based on sincerely heldmoral convictions, as discussed above,and also that in the few instances wheresuch an objection has been raised, em-ployees of such employers also opposedcontraception. We request comment on all aspects of the preceding regulatory impact analysis. B. Special Analyses\u2014Department of the Treasury For purposes of the Department of the Treasury, certain Internal Revenue Ser- vice (IRS) regulations, including this one,are exempt from the requirements in Ex-ecutive Order 12866, as supplemented byExecutive Order 13563. The Departmentsestimate that the likely effect of these in-terim nal rules will be that entities willuse the exemption and not the accommo-dation. Therefore, a regulatory assessmentis not required. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certain requirements with respect to Federal rulesthat are subject to the notice and commentrequirements of section 553(b) of theAPA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that arelikely to have a signicant economic im-pact on a substantial number of small en-tities. Under Section 553(b) of the APA, ageneral notice of proposed rulemaking isnot required when an agency, for goodcause, nds that notice and public com-ment thereon are impracticable, unneces-sary, or contrary to the public interest. Theinterim nal rules are exempt from theAPA, both because the PHS Act, ERISA,and the Code contain specic provisionsunder which the Secretaries may adoptregulations by interim nal rule and be-cause the Departments have made a goodcause nding that a general notice of pro-posed rulemaking is not necessary earlierin this preamble. Therefore, the RFA doesnot apply and the Departments are notrequired to either certify that the regula-tions or this amendment would not have asignicant economic impact on a substan-tial number of small entities or conduct aregulatory flexibility analysis. Nevertheless, the Departments care- fully considered the likely impact of therule on small entities in connection withtheir assessment under Executive Order12866. The Departments do not expectthat these interim nal rules will have asignicant economic effect on a substan-tial number of small entities, because theywill not result in any additional costs toaffected entities. Instead, by exemptingfrom the Mandate small businesses andnonprot organizations with moral objec-tions to some or all contraceptives and/orsterilization, the Departments have re-duced regulatory burden on small entities.Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code,these regulations have been submitted tothe Chief Counsel for Advocacy of theSmall Business Administration for com-ment on their impact on small business. D. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Health and Human Services Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), federal agencies are re- quired to publish notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed col- lection of information. Interested personsare invited to send comments regardingour burden estimates or any other aspectof this collection of information, includ-ing any of the following subjects: (1) thenecessity and utility of the proposed in-formation collection for the proper perfor-mance of the agency's functions; (2) theaccuracy of the estimated burden; (3)ways to enhance the quality, utility, andclarity of the information to be collected; and (4) the use of automated collectiontechniques or other forms of informationtechnology to minimize the informationcollection burden. We estimate that these interim nal rules will not result in additional burdensnot accounted for as set forth in the com-panion interim nal rules concerning reli-gious beliefs issued contemporaneouslywith these interim nal rules and pub-lished elsewhere in this issue of theBulletin. As discussed there, regulationscovering the accommodation include pro-visions regarding self-certication or no-tices to HHS from eligible organizations(\u00a7 147.131(c)(3)), notice of availability ofseparate payments for contraceptive ser-vices 147.131(f)), and notice of revo-cation of accommodation (\u00a7 147.131(c)(4)). The burdens related to those ICRs arecurrently approved under OMB ControlNumbers 0938-1248 and 0938-1292.These interim nal rules amend the ac-commodation regulations to make entities with moral objections to the Mandate el-igible to use the same accommodationprocesses. The Departments will updatethe forms and model notices regardingthese processes to reflect that entities withsincerely held moral convictions are eligi-ble organizations. As discussed above, however, we as- sume that no entities with non-religiousmoral objections to the Mandate will usethe accommodation, and we know that nosuch entities were eligible for it until now,so that they do not possess accommodatedstatus to revoke. Therefore we believe thatthe burden for these ICRs is accounted forin the collection approved under OMBControl Numbers 0938-1248 and 0938-1292, as described in the interim nalrules concerning religious beliefs issuedcontemporaneously with these interim -nal rules. We are soliciting comments on all of the possible information collection re-quirements contained in these interim -nal rules, including those discussed in thecompanion interim nal rules concerningreligious beliefs issued contemporane-ously with these interim nal rules andpublished elsewhere in this issue of theBulletin, for which these interim nalrules provide eligibility to entities withobjections based on moral convictions. In Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 455addition, we are also soliciting comments on all of the related information collectionrequirements currently approved under0938-1292 and 0938-1248. To obtain copies of a supporting state- ment and any related forms for the pro-posed collection(s) summarized in this no-tice, you may make your request usingone of following: 1. Access CMS' website address at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/PaperworkReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing.html. 2. E-mail your request, including your address, phone number, OMB num-ber, and CMS document identier, toPaperwork@cms.hhs.gov. 3. Call the Reports Clearance Ofce at (410) 786-1326. If you comment on these information collections, that is, reporting, recordkeep-ing or third-party disclosure requirements,please submit your comments electroni-cally as specied in the ADDRESSESsection of these interim nal rules withcomment period. E. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Labor Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and an individual is not required to re-spond to, a collection of information un-less it displays a valid OMB control num-ber. In accordance with the requirementsof the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA Form700 and alternative notice have previouslybeen approved by OMB under controlnumbers 1210-0150 and 1210-0152. Acopy of the ICR may be by con-tacting the PRA addressee shown belowor at http://www.RegInfo.gov. PRA AD-DRESSEE: G. Christopher Cosby, Ofceof Policy and Research, U.S. Departmentof Labor, Employee Benets Security 202-693-8410; Fax:202-219-4745. These are not toll-freenumbers.Consistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, although these interim nal rules make entities with cer-tain moral convictions eligible for the ac-commodation, we assume that no entitieswill use it rather than the exemption, andsuch entities were not previously eligiblefor the accommodation so as to revoke it.Therefore we believe these interim nalrules do not involve additional burden notaccounted for under OMB control number1210-0150. Regarding the ICRs discussed in the companion interim nal rules concerningreligious beliefs issued contemporane-ously with these interim nal rules andpublished elsewhere in this issue of theBulletin, the forms for which would beused if any entities with moral objectionsused the accommodation process in thefuture, DOL submitted those ICRs in or-der to obtain OMB approval under thePRA for the regulatory revision. The re-quest was made under emergency clear-ance procedures specied in regulations at5 CFR 1320.13. OMB approved the ICRsunder the emergency clearance process. Inan effort to consolidate the number ofinformation collection requests, DOL in-dicated it will combine related tothe OMB control number 1210-0152 withthe ICR control num-ber 1210-0150. Once the ICR is approved,DOL indicated it will 1210-0152. OMB approved the ICR under con-trol number 1210-0150 through [DATE].A copy of the information collection re-quest may be obtained free of charge onthe RegInfo.gov website at http://www. reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr/H11005201705-1210-001. This approval al- lows respondents temporarily to utilize the additional flexibility these interimnal regulations provide, while DOLseeks public comment on the collectionmethods\u2014including their utility andburden. Contemporaneously with thepublication of these interim nal rules,DOL will publish a notice in the Fed- eral Register informing the public ofits intention to extend the OMB ap- proval. F. Regulatory Reform Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 Executive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, \"[t]o the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services (Secretary)and the heads of all other executive de-partments and agencies (agencies) withauthorities and responsibilities under theAct shall exercise all authority and dis-cretion available to them to waive, de-fer, grant exemptions from, or delay theimplementation of any provision or re-quirement of the Act that would imposea scal burden on any State or a cost,fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burdenon individuals, families, healthcare pro-viders, health insurers, patients, recipi-ents of healthcare services, purchasersof health insurance, or makers of medi-cal devices, products, or medications.\"In addition, agencies are directed to\"take all actions consistent with law tominimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the [Affordable CareAct], and prepare to afford the States moreflexibility and control to create a more freeand open healthcare market.\" These interimnal rules exercise the discretion providedto the Departments under the AffordableCare Act and other laws to grant exemptionsand thereby minimize regulatory burdens ofthe Affordable Care Act on the affectedentities and recipients of health care ser-vices. Consistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017),we have estimated the costs and cost sav-ings attributable to this interim nal rule.As discussed in more detail in the preced-ing analysis, this interim nal rule lessensincremental reporting costs. 170Therefore, this interim nal rule is considered an EO13771 deregulatory action. 170Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential decreased expenditures on contraceptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-related medical services. OMB's guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-ofce/2017/04/05/memorandum- implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that impacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments. The Food and Drug Administration,within HHS, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditureimpacts in the analyses that accompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benets (positive benets if expenditures are reduced, negative benets if expenditures areraised). Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting convention leads to this interim nal rule's medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) benets, ratherthan as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 456G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104- 4), requires the Departments to prepare awritten statement, which includes an as-sessment of anticipated costs and benets,before issuing \"any rule that includes anyFederal mandate that may result in theexpenditure by State, local, and tribal gov-ernments, in the aggregate, or by the pri-vate sector, of $100,000,000 or more (ad-justed annually for inflation) in any oneyear.\" The current threshold after adjust-ment for inflation is $148 million, usingthe most current (2016) Implicit Price De-flator for the Gross Domestic Product. Forpurposes of the Unfunded Mandates Re-form Act, these interim nal rules do notinclude any Federal mandate that may re-sult in expenditures by State, local, ortribal governments, nor do they includeany Federal mandates that may impose anannual burden of $100 million, adjustedfor inflation, or more on the private sector. H. Federalism Executive Order 13132 outlines funda- mental principles of federalism, and re- quires the adherence to specic criteria byFederal agencies in the process of theirformulation and implementation of poli-cies that have \"substantial direct effects\"on States, the relationship between theFederal Government and States, or thedistribution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of Government.Federal agencies promulgating regula-tions that have these federalism implica-tions must consult with state and localofcials, and describe the extent of theirconsultation and the nature of the con-cerns of state and local ofcials in thepreamble to the regulation. These interim nal rules do not have any Federalism implications, since theyonly provide exemptions from the contra-ceptive and sterilization coverage require-ment in HRSA Guidelines supplied undersection 2713 of the PHS Act.

Add \u00a7147.133 to read as follows: \u00a7 147.133 Moral exemptions in connection with coverage of certainpreventive health services. (a)Objecting entities. (1) Guidelines issued under \u00a7147.130(a)(1)(iv) by the Health Resources and Services Adminis-tration must not provide for or support therequirement of coverage or payments forcontraceptive services with respect to agroup health plan established or main-tained by an objecting organization, orhealth insurance coverage offered or ar-ranged by an objecting organization, andthus the Health Resources and ServiceAdministration will exempt from anyguidelines' requirements that relate to theprovision of contraceptive services: (i) A group health plan and health in- surance coverage provided in connectionwith a group health plan to the extent oneof the following non-governmental plansponsors object as specied in paragraph(a)(2) this section: (A) A nonprot A for-prot entity that has no pub- licly traded ownership interests (for thispurpose, a publicly traded ownership in-terest is any class of common equity se-curities required to be registered undersection 12 of the Securities Exchange Actof 1934); (ii) An institution of higher education as dened in 20 U.S.C. 1002 in its ar-rangement of student health insurancecoverage, to the extent that institution ob-jects as specied in paragraph (a)(2) ofthis section.

Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous Treatment of Amounts Paid to Section 170(c)Organizations underEmployer Leave- BasedDonation Programs to AidVictims of Hurricane andTropical Storm Maria Notice 2017-62 This notice provides guidance on the treatment of leave-based donation pro- grams to aid victims of Hurricane andTropical Storm Maria. TREATMENT OF LEAVE-BASED DONATION PAYMENTS In response to the extreme need for charitable relief for victims of Hurricane and Tropical Storm Maria, employers mayhave adopted or may be consideringadopting leave-based donation programs.Under leave-based donation programs,employees can elect to forgo vacation,sick, or personal leave in exchange forcash payments that the employer makes tocharitable organizations described in\u00a7 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code(\u00a7 170(c) organizations). This notice pro-vides guidance for income and employ-ment tax purposes on the treatment ofcash payments made by employers underleave-based donation programs for the re-lief of victims of Hurricane and TropicalStorm Maria. The Internal Revenue Service (the Ser- vice) will not assert that cash payments anemployer makes to \u00a7 170(c) organizationsin exchange for vacation, sick, or personalleave that its employees elect to forgoconstitute gross income or wages of theemployees if the payments are: (1) madeto the \u00a7 170(c) organizations for the reliefof victims of Hurricane and TropicalStorm Maria; and (2) paid to the \u00a7 170(c)organizations before January 1, 2019. Similarly, the Service will not assert that the opportunity to make such an elec-tion results in constructive receipt of grossincome or wages for employees. Electingemployees may not claim a charitablecontribution deduction under \u00a7 170 withrespect to the value of forgone leave ex-cluded from compensation and wages. The Service will not assert that an em- ployer is permitted to deduct these cashpayments exclusively under the rules of\u00a7 170 rather than the rules of \u00a7 162. Cashpayments to which this guidance appliesneed not be included in Box 1, 3 (if ap-plicable), or 5 of the Form W-2.

Update for Weighted Average Interest Rates,Yield Curves, and SegmentRates Notice 2017-63 This notice provides guidance on the corporate bond monthly yield curve, the corresponding spot segment rates used un-der \u00a7 417(e)(3), and the 24-month averagesegment rates of theInternal Revenue Code. In addition, thisnotice provides guidance as to the interestrate on 30-year Treasury securities under\u00a7 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(II) as in effect for planyears beginning before 2008 and the 30-year Treasury weighted average rate un-der \u00a7 431(c)(6)(E)(ii)(I). YIELD CURVE AND SEGMENT RATES Generally, except for certain plans un- der section 104 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and CSEC plans under\u00a7 414(y), \u00a7 430 of the Code species theminimum funding requirements that applyto single-employer plans pursuant to\u00a7 412. Section 430(h)(2) species the in-terest rates that must be used to determinea plan's target normal cost and fundingtarget. Under this provision, present valueis generally determined using three 24-month average interest rates (\"segmentrates\"), each of which applies to cashflows during specied periods. To the ex-tent provided under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iv),these segment rates are adjusted by theapplicable percentage of the 25-year aver-age segment rates for the period endingSeptember 30 of the year preceding thecalendar year in which the plan year be-gins. 171However, an election may be made under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) to use themonthly yield curve in place of the seg-ment rates. Notice 2007-81, 2007-44 I.R.B. 899, provides guidelines for determining themonthly corporate bond yield curve, andthe 24-month average corporate bond seg-ment rates used to compute the target nor-mal cost and the funding target. Consis-tent with the methodology specied inNotice 2007-81, the monthly corporatebond yield curve derived from September2017 data is in Table I at the end of thisnotice. The spot rst, second, and thirdsegment rates for the month of September2017 are, respectively, 1.96, 3.58, and4.35. The 24-month average segment rates determined under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(i)through (iii) must be adjusted pursuant to \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iv) to be within the appli-cable minimum and maximum percent-ages of the corresponding 25-year averagesegment rates. For plan years beginningbefore 2021, the applicable minimum per-centage is 90% and the applicable maxi-mum percentage is 110%.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE .01 The purpose of this revenue proce- dure is to update Rev. Proc. 2000-40, 2000-2 C.B. 357, to take into account theprovisions of \u00a7 430 of the Internal Reve-nue Code (Code), which was enacted aspart of the Pension Protection Act of2006, Pub. L. 109-280. This revenue pro-cedure provides automatic approval changes in funding method usedfor dened benet plansfor calculations described under \u00a7 430. method is a recognized actuarialtechnique utilized for establishing theamount and incidence of the annual actu-arial cost of pension plan benets andexpenses. The approvals under this reve-nue procedure are granted in accordancewith \u00a7 412(d)(1) of the Code and section302(d)(1) of the Employee Retirement In-come Security Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-406, as amended (ERISA). .02 Section 3 of this revenue procedure provides automatic approval for three as-set valuation method changes, automaticapproval for two valuation date changes, and automatic approval for one type ofchange in the treatment of benets fundedthrough insurance contracts. Section 4 ofthis revenue procedure provides automaticapproval for a change in funding methodin special situations in which there is achange in the plan's actuary, actuarialsoftware, or the data elements used in theactuarial valuation, and for fully fundedterminating plans. Section 5 of this reve-nue procedure provides automatic ap-proval for a change in funding method inconnection with a plan merger. .03 Taxpayers, plan administrators, and enrolled actuaries are cautioned to con-sider the overall restrictions on use ofautomatic approval under this revenueprocedure (see section 6 of this revenueprocedure), and the specic restrictionswith respect to each of the approvals. .04 The application of a funding method approved under this revenue procedure mustconform to all of the requirements of theregulations under \u00a7 430. Thus, for example,the funding method must comply with therequirements for the determination of targetnormal cost and funding target, as requiredunder \u00a7 accor-dance with \u00a7 ence in the funding shortfall attributable tothe change in funding method is used, inconjunction with the present value of exist-ing amortization installments, to determinethe shortfall amortization base for the yearof the change. SECTION 2. BACKGROUND .01 Sections 412 and 430 set forth the minimum funding standards that apply generally with respect to single-employerdened benet pension plans. 172Under \u00a7 412(d)(1), a change of funding methodmay take effect for a plan year only if thechange is approved by the Internal Reve-nue Service (IRS). .02 A funding method is used for a plan year if it is used to determine the mini-mum required contribution for that year.Section 1.430(d)-1(f)(1)(iii) provides theprocedure for establishing the fundingmethod for a plan. In the case of a plan forwhich an actuarial report under \u00a7 6059(Schedule isrequired to be led, the funding method isestablished by the ling of the ScheduleSB, if it is led no later than the due date(with extensions) for that ling. In thecase of a plan for which Schedule SB isnot required to be led, the fundingmethod is established by the delivery ofthe completed Schedule SB to the em-ployer, if it is delivered no later than whatwould have been the due date (with ex-tensions) for ling the Schedule SB, weresuch a ling required. .03 Section 1.430(d)-1(f)(1)(iv) pro- vides that the funding method of a plan includes not only the overall fundingmethod used by the plan but also eachspecic method of computation used inapplying the overall method. However,the choice of which actuarial assumptionsare used is not a part of the fundingmethod. See Section 3.02 of Rev. Proc.2017-57, 2017-44 I.R.B. xx, for exam-ples of changes in funding method andchanges in actuarial assumptions. .04 Regulations under \u00a7 430 provide for a number of changes in fundingmethod that are treated as approved by theIRS and may be implemented without anyfurther action by the IRS. For example, \u00a7 1.430(d)-1(g)(3)(iii) provides that anychange in a plan's funding method for therst plan year to which \u00a7 430 applies todetermine the plan's minimum requiredcontribution is automatically approved bythe IRS. In addition, under \u00a7 1.430(g)-1(b)(2)(iv), if a plan ceases to be eligiblefor the small plan exception for a planyear because the number of participantsexceeded 100 in the prior plan year, thenany required change in the valuation dateto the rst day of the plan year is auto-matically approved by the IRS. .05 Rev. Proc. 2000-40 grants auto- matic approval for certain changes in fund-ing method, but does not take into accountthe provisions of \u00a7 430. This revenue pro-cedure modies Rev. 430.Rev. 2000-40 continues to provideautomatic infunding method for dened benet plansthat are not subject to the required minimumfunding rules of \u00a7 430. Rev. Proc. 2017-57provides the procedure for obtaining theIRS's approval for a change in fundingmethod if that change is not eligible forautomatic approval. .06 Announcement 2010-3, 2010-4 I.R.B. 333, provides for automatic ap-proval of changes in funding method fortakeover plans (plans for which there hasbeen a change in both the plan's enrolledactuary and the business organization pro-viding actuarial services to the plan) andchanges in pension valuation softwarewith respect to single-employer denedbenet plans subject to \u00a7 430, provided certain conditions are satised. An-nouncement 2010-3 was effective forplan years beginning on or January 1,2009. Announcement 2015-3 ampliedAnnouncement 2010-3 and provided foradditional circumstances under which au-tomatic approval for a change in fundingmethod for takeover plans is available.Announcement 2015-3 was effective forplan years beginning on or after January 1,2013. These two announcements providedinterim automatic approval for changes infunding method prior to the issuance ofthe more comprehensive guidance regard-ing changes in funding method under\u00a7 430 set forth in this revenue procedure. 172Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA contain funding rules which apply generally to single-employer dened benet plans and are parallel to the rules of \u00a7\u00a7 412 and 430 of the Code. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 466Section 8 of this revenue procedure spec- ies a time after which the automatic ap-provals set forth in those two announce-ments may no longer be used. SECTION 3. APPROVAL FOR SPECIFIED CHANGES INFUNDING METHOD Subject to the restrictions of section 6 of this revenue procedure and to the con- ditions under the applicable change infunding method described in section 3.01,3.02, or 3.03 of this revenue procedure,approval is granted for a change in fund-ing method described in this section 3. .01Approval for changes in asset val- uation method. Approval is granted for thefollowing changes in asset valuationmethod, provided that the asset valuationmethod was not changed in any of the fourpreceding plan years. (1) A change in asset valuation method to a method that determines the value ofplan assets as fair market value, as denedin \u00a7 1.430(g)-1(c)(1)(ii). (2) A change in asset valuation method to a method that determines the value ofplan assets as the average of the fair mar-ket value on the valuation date and theadjusted fair market value of assets deter-mined for one or more earlier determina-tion dates, as described in \u00a7 430(g)(3)(B)and the regulations and Notice 2009-22, 2009-14I.R.B. 741.) asset value determinedunder the method must be restricted sothat it is not greater than 110% and notless than 90% of the fair market value, asdescribed in \u00a7 1.430(g)-1(c)(2)(iii). (3) A change in asset valuation method to a method that applies a phase-in for thedetermination of the value of plan assets.Under this method, the value of plan as-sets is determined as the average of thefair market value on the valuation dateand the adjusted fair market value of as-sets determined for one or more earlierdetermination dates, as described below.The asset value determined under thismethod must be restricted so that it is notgreater than 110% and not less than 90%of the fair market value, as described in\u00a7 1.430(g)-1(c)(2)(iii). In the rst plan year this asset valuation method is used, the value of plan assets isthe fair market value. In the second planyear this asset valuation method is used, the value of plan assets is the average ofthe fair market value of assets on thevaluation date and the adjusted fair marketvalue of assets from the immediately pre-ceding valuation date. In the third planyear this asset valuation method is used,the value of plan assets is the average ofthe fair market value of assets on thevaluation date and the adjusted fair marketvalue of assets from the two immediatelypreceding valuation dates. The phase-in that applies under this method is not a change in funding methodin years two and three. The rst plan yearof the four-year limitation on changes re-ceiving automatic approval as describedin this section 3.01 starts in the rst yearof this phase-in method. Failure to applythis method for the second or third planyear would be considered a change infunding method for the year for which thefailure occurred, which would require ap-proval for that year. This approval is available only if the determination dates used for the adjustedfair market values after the phase-in of thenew asset valuation method are not thesame as the determination dates used forthis purpose prior to the change in assetvaluation method. Accordingly, this auto-matic approval may not be used merely torestart the asset valuation method in useprior to the change in funding method. .02Approval for changes in valuation date. Approval is granted for the follow-ing changes in valuation date, providedthat the valuation date was not changed inany of the four preceding plan years. (1) A change in the valuation date to the day that is the rst day of the planyear. (2) A change in the valuation date to the last day of the plan year, if there wasa change in the plan year and the valuationdate for the prior plan year was the lastday of that plan year. .03Approval for change in treatment of benets funded through insurance con-tracts. Approval is granted for a change inthe treatment of benets funded throughinsurance contracts if, as of the prior planyear's valuation date, none of the planbenets were funded through insurancecontracts.SECTION 4. APPROVAL FOR CHANGES IN FUNDING METHODIN SPECIAL SITUATIONS Subject to the restrictions of section 6 of this revenue procedure and to the con- ditions under the applicable change infunding method described in section 4.01,4.02, 4.03 or 4.04 of this revenue proce- dure, approval is granted for a change infunding method described in this section 4. .01Approval for change in funding method for takeover plans . Approval is granted for a change in funding method,including a change in the valuation date tothe last day of the plan year (withoutregard to whether there is also a change inplan year) or a change in software, if allthe conditions set forth in paragraphs (1)through (4) of this section 4.01 are satis-ed. (1) Both the enrolled actuary for the plan and the business organization provid-ing actuarial services to the plan have changed. (2) The new method is substantially the same as the method used by the priorenrolled actuary and is consistent with thedescription of the method contained in theprior actuarial report or prior Schedule SB(disregarding any difference attributableto a change in funding method for whichautomatic approval is provided withoutregard to this section 4.01). (3) The funding target and target nor- mal cost (without regard to any adjust-ments for employee contributions andplan-related expenses), as determined bythe new enrolled actuary as of the valua-tion date for the prior plan year (using theactuarial assumptions of the prior enrolledactuary and using the data elements andvaluation software of the new enrolledactuary), are both within 3% of those val-ues as determined for that prior plan yearby the prior enrolled actuary. (4) The actuarial value of plan assets, as determined by the new enrolled actuaryas of the valuation date for the prior planyear (using the actuarial assumptions ofthe prior enrolled actuary), is within 2% ofthe value for that prior plan year as deter-mined by the prior enrolled actuary. Alternatively, the comparisons de- scribed in paragraphs (3) and (4) of thissection 4.01 may be made on the basis ofthe current plan year, provided that the Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 467prior enrolled actuary has issued an actu- arial report that includes the results for thecurrent plan year (or has provided asigned Schedule SB to the new enrolledactuary for the current plan year, to theextent guidance issued by the IRS wouldpermit the new enrolled actuary to revisethose entries on that Schedule SB). For purposes of this revenue proce- dure, an actuarial report must be signed bythe enrolled actuary for the plan and mustmeet the applicable standards of perfor-mance under regulations issued by theJoint Board for the Enrollment of Actuar-ies. See 20 CFR 901.20. In addition, forpurposes of this section 4.01, the currentplan year means the rst plan year forwhich a Schedule SB is signed by the newenrolled actuary, and the prior plan yearmeans the plan year that immediately pre-cedes the current plan year. .02Approval for change in funding method due to change in valuation soft-ware. Approval is granted for a change infunding method that results from a change in valuation software if all the conditionsset forth in paragraphs (1) through (5) ofthis section 4.02 are satised. Note thatcertain changes in valuation software maynot constitute changes in funding method.For example, the update of the valuationsoftware to incorporate the actual socialsecurity taxable wage base for the currentyear is not a change in funding method.Also, if all of the results of each speciccomputation are the same after the changein valuation software, there is no changein funding method. (1) The enrolled actuary for the plan is the same as the enrolled actuary for theplan for the prior plan year or the businessorganization providing actuarial servicesto the plan is the same as the businessorganization that provided actuarial ser-vices to the plan for the prior plan year.(Accordingly, the approval under section4.01 of this revenue procedure is notavailable.) (2) The new method is substantially the same as the method used for the prior planyear (disregarding any difference attribut-able to a change in funding method forwhich automatic approval is providedwithout regard to this section 4.02).(3) The new valuation software gener- ally will be used by the enrolled actuary for the single-employer plans to which theenrolled actuary provides actuarial ser-vices. (4) For either the prior plan year or the current plan year, the funding target, tar-get normal cost (without regard to anyadjustments for employee contributionsand plan-related expenses), and actuarialvalue of assets determined under the newvaluation software are each within 1% ofthe respective values determined underthe valuation software used for the priorplan year (all other factors being held con-stant). However, the 1% threshold is in-creased to 2% of the respective values ifthe approval under this section 4.02 wasnot used in the prior year. (5) The modications to the computa- tions in the valuation software or the useof a different valuation software systemare designed to produce results that are noless accurate than the results producedprior to the modications or change. .03Approval for change in funding method due to change in selection of dataelements. Approval is granted for achange in funding method used in valuingliabilities due to a change in the selectionof data elements 173that are used in the actuarial valuation if all of the conditionsset forth in paragraphs (1) through (4) ofthis section 4.03 are satised. For exam-ple, a change from using the prior years'actual compensation with an adjustmentto the current valuation date to using thecurrent annual rate of pay is approved, ifthe applicable conditions are satised. (1) The enrolled actuary for the plan is the same as the enrolled actuary for theplan for the prior plan year or the businessorganization providing actuarial servicesto the plan is the same as the businessorganization that provided actuarial ser-vices to the plan for the prior plan year. (2) Other than the change in data ele- ments described in this section 4.03, thenew method is the same (disregarding anydifference attributable to a change infunding method for which automatic ap-proval is provided without regard to thissection 4.03).(3) The funding target and target nor- mal cost (without regard to any adjust-ments for employee contributions andplan-related expenses) determined usingthe all of the new data elements (for eitherthe current plan year or the prior planyear) are each within 1% of the respectivevalues determined using the prior data el-ements (with all other factors being heldconstant). (4) The use of any new data element is designed to produce results that are noless accurate than the results producedprior to the modications or change. .04Approval for change in funding method for fully funded terminated plans . Approval is granted for a change in fund-ing method described in paragraph (1) ofthis section 4.04 for the plan year in whichthe plan is terminated, if all the conditionsset forth in paragraph (2) of this section4.04 are satised. (1) Any or all of the following changes in funding method may be made: (a) The asset valuation method may be changed to a method that determines thevalue of plan assets as the fair marketvalue of assets, even if that change doesnot otherwise satisfy the conditions ofsection 3.01 of this revenue procedure. (b) For a plan that is eligible to desig- nate any day during the plan year as itsvaluation date pursuant to \u00a7 430(g)(2)(B),the valuation date may be changed to thedate of termination or the rst day of theplan year, even if the change does nototherwise satisfy the conditions of section3.02 of this revenue procedure. (c) The funding method may be changed as a result of a change in both theenrolled actuary for the plan and the busi-ness organization providing actuarial ser-vices to the plan, even if the change doesnot otherwise satisfy the conditions ofsection 4.01 of this revenue procedure. (d) The funding method may be changed as a result of a change in the valuationsoftware, even if the change does not other-wise satisfy the conditions of section 4.02 ofthis revenue procedure. (e) The funding method may be changed as a result of a change in the dataelements, even if the change does not oth- 173Data elements are types of data, such as compensation, dates of birth or hire, or gender, used to value the plan liabilities. See section 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 2017-57 for examples of changes in the selection of data elements. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 468erwise satisfy the conditions of section 4.03 of this revenue procedure. (2) The conditions which must be sat- ised to receive automatic approval underthis section 4.04 are: (a) As of the date of termination, the assets of the plan (exclusive of contribu-tions receivable) are sufcient to satisfyall benet liabilities (whether or not thecorresponding benets are vested). (b) If applicable, a timely notice of intention to terminate was led with thePension Benet Guaranty Corporationpursuant to section 4041(b)(2)(A) ofERISA. SECTION 5. APPROVAL FOR CHANGES IN FUNDING METHODIN CONNECTION WITH PLANMERGERS Subject to the restrictions of section 6 of this revenue procedure and to the con- ditions under the applicable change infunding method described in section 5.01,5.02, or 5.03 of this revenue procedure,approval is granted for a change in fund-ing method described in this section 5. Any contribution that is made to the trust after the date of the merger may becredited on the Schedule SB for eitherplan, provided that the contribution ismade within the period described in\u00a7 430(j) for the plan year for which thecontribution is credited. Alternatively, acontribution made after the date of themerger may be treated as a contribution tothe merged plan. .01Approval for change in funding method in connection with de minimismerger. Approval is granted for a changein funding method in connection with a de minimis merger if the condition set forth in paragraph (1) of this section 5.01 is satised, and the procedures set forth inparagraphs (2) through (5) of this section5.01 are followed. A de minimis merger is a merger of a smaller plan (within the mean-ing of \u00a7 1.414(l)-1(h)(1)) and a larger plan(within of \u00a7\u00a7 1.414(l)-1(h)(2), 1.414(l)-1(h)(3), and 1.414(l)-1(h)(4) apply in deter-mining whether a merger is de minimis. (1) The smaller plan is treated as ter- minated on the date of the merger forpurposes of \u00a7 430, and by 8\u00bd months after the date of the merger, sufcient contri-butions have been made for the smallerplan to eliminate any unpaid minimumrequired contribution for any plan yearending before the date of the merger andto satisfy the minimum required contribu-tion for the short plan year that ends onthe date of the merger. 174 (2) If the valuation date for the larger plan for the plan year in which the mergeroccurs precedes the date of the merger, theminimum required contribution for theongoing plan for that plan year is deter-mined without regard to the merger. (3) For the actuarial valuation of the ongoing plan as of the valuation date co-incident with or next following the date ofthe merger, except to the extent automaticapproval has been provided for a changein funding method without regard to thissection 5.01, the funding method used (in-cluding asset valuation method) is that forthe larger plan. The funding method usedfor the smaller plan is disregarded. (4) For the actuarial valuation of the ongoing plan as of the valuation date co-incident with or next following the date ofthe merger, the interest rates used arethose that would have been used for thelarger plan unless the plan sponsor of theongoing plan elects an alternative interestrate available under \u00a7 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) orrequests approval under the procedures setforth in Rev. Proc. 2017-57 to revoke aninterest rate election that was in effect forthe larger plan. The interest rates used forthe smaller plan are disregarded. (5) Any amortization installments, funding standard carryover balance, andprefunding balance existing prior to thevaluation date of the larger plan coinci-dent with or next following the date of themerger continue for the ongoing plan as ifthe merger had never occurred. Theseamounts with respect to the smaller planare disregarded for purposes of applying\u00a7 430 with respect to the ongoing plan. For purposes of this section 5, refer- ences to the ongoing plan mean the planas designated by the plan administrator(within the meaning of \u00a7 414(g)), whosename and plan number will be reported onSchedule SB for the rst plan year thatbegins on or after the merger. .02Approval for change in funding method in connection with a merger ofplans with same plan year and mergerdate of rst or last day of plan year . Approval is granted for a change in fund-ing method in connection with a merger ofone plan with another plan in a given planyear if all the conditions set forth in para-graphs (1) through (3) of this section 5.02are satised, and the procedures set forthin paragraphs (4) through (6) of this sec-tion 5.02 are followed. (1) Both plans have the same plan year and each plan has a valuation date that iseither the rst or last day of the plan year. (2) The date of the merger is either the rst day of the plan year or the last day ofthe plan year of the two plans. (3) In a case in which the date of the merger is the rst day of the plan year, by8\u00bd months after the date of the merger,sufcient contributions have been madefor each plan to eliminate any unpaid min-imum required contribution and to satisfythe minimum required contribution forany plan year that ends before the date ofthe merger. In a case in which the date ofthe merger is the last day of the plan year,by 8\u00bd months after the date of the merger,sufcient contributions have been madefor each plan to eliminate any unpaid min-imum required contribution for the planfor any plan year ending before the date ofthe merger, and to satisfy the minimumrequired contribution for the plan year thatends on the date of the merger. (4) If the date of the merger is the rst day of the plan year, the minimum re-quired contribution under \u00a7 430 is deter-mined for the ongoing plan for the entireplan year in which the merger occurs inthe manner provided in paragraph (5) ofthis section 5.02. Consequently, for theplan year in which the merger occurs, onlyone Schedule SB is required for themerged plan. (5) For the plan year of the ongoing plan following the plan year in which themerger occurs, the minimum funding re-quirements under \u00a7 430 for the ongoingplan are determined in accordance with 174If the plan year that ends on the date of the merger is less than a 12-month plan year, the minimum required contribution for the smaller plan for this period is determined in accordance with \u00a7 1.430(a)-1(b)(2)(ii). The smaller plan is subject to the generally applicable reporting requirements, including ling Schedule SB, for that plan year. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 469the rules set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this paragraph 5.02(5). (a) If the asset valuation method that was used for each of the two plans wasidentical in all respects (including withrespect to the determination dates used ifthe asset valuation method is the averag-ing method under \u00a7 430(g)(3)(B)), the as-set valuation method used for the ongoingplan is that method (disregarding any dif-ference attributable to a change in fundingmethod for which automatic approval isprovided without regard to this section5.02). If the same asset valuation methodwas not used for each of the two plans (forexample, a method that determines thevalue of plan assets as the fair marketvalue was used for one of the plans, and amethod that determines the value of planassets as the average of fair market valueon the valuation date and adjusted fairmarket value determined for the two priordetermination dates was used for the otherplan), the asset valuation method used forthe ongoing plan must be the asset valua- tion method that was used for one of thetwo plans (disregarding any difference at-tributable to a change in funding methodfor which automatic approval is providedwithout regard to this section 5.02). If anaveraging method is the method chosenfor the ongoing plan, that asset valuationmethod must reflect the historical cashflows for both plans, even if this requiresthe reconstruction of historical cash flowsand expected earnings for a plan that wasnot valued using the method chosen forthe ongoing plan. (b) If all components of the funding method (other than the asset valuationmethod) used for each of the two planswere the same, then the funding method(other than the asset valuation method) forthe ongoing plan must be that method(disregarding any difference attributableto a change in funding method for whichautomatic approval is provided withoutregard to this section 5.02). If all compo-nents of the funding method (other thanthe asset valuation method) used for eachof the two plans were not the same, thenthe funding method (other than the assetvaluation method) for the ongoing planmust be one of the funding methods forone of the two plans (disregarding anydifference attributable to a change infunding method for which automatic ap-proval is provided without regard to this section 5.02). (c) The interest rates used for the plan after the merger are those that would havebeen used for one of the two plans. How-ever, the interest rates may be changed ifthe plan sponsor of the ongoing planelects an alternative interest rate availableunder \u00a7 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) or requests ap-proval under the procedures set forth inRev. Proc. 2017-57 to revoke an interestrate election that was in effect for one ofthe two plans. (d) All amortization installments that were maintained for the two plans continueto be maintained for the ongoing plan, ex-cept as provided under \u00a7 430(c)(6). (6) If the date of the merger is the last day of the plan year, the minimum re-quired contribution under \u00a7 430 for eachof the plans for the plan year in which themerger occurs is determined without re-gard to the merger. Consequently, sepa-rate Schedules SB are required forthe plans for the plan year in which the merger occurs without regard to themerger in such a case. For the plan yearfollowing the plan year in which themerger occurs, the minimum requiredcontribution is determined for the planafter the merger by following the proce-dures set forth in paragraph (5) of thissection 5.02 as if the merger occurred onthe rst day of the following plan year. .03Approval for change in funding method in connection with certain merg-ers with transition period not exceeding12 months. Approval is granted for achange in funding method that resultsfrom a merger of one plan with anotherplan if all the conditions set forth in para-graphs (1) through (4) of this section 5.03are satised, and the procedures set forthin paragraphs (5) through (8) of this sec-tion 5.03 are followed. (1) Each of the plans, prior to the merger, had a valuation date that was therst day of the plan year. (2) The plans do not have the same plan year, or if both plans have the sameplan year, the date of the merger is not therst day or the last day of the plan year. (3) The period from the rst day of the plan year of the plan that is not the ongo-ing plan during which the merger takesplace to the end of the plan year of theongoing plan during which the mergertakes place (the \"transition period\") does not exceed 12 months. (4) The plan that is not the ongoing plan is treated as terminated on the date of the merger for purposes of \u00a7 430, and by8\u00bd months after the date of the merger,sufcient contributions have been madefor that plan to eliminate any unpaid min-imum required contribution for any planyear that ends before the date of themerger, and to satisfy the minimum re-quired contribution for the short plan yearthat ends on the date of the merger. Forthe ongoing plan, by 8\u00bd months after theend of the last plan year that ends on orbefore the date of the merger, sufcientcontributions have been made for thatplan to eliminate any unpaid minimumrequired contribution and to satisfy theminimum required contribution for thatprior plan year. (5) The period from the date of merger to the end of the plan year of the ongoingplan is designated as the interim period.The target normal cost attributable to theplan that is not the ongoing plan for theinterim period is the target normal costdetermined for the period from the begin-ning of the plan year of that plan to theend of the interim period, reduced by thetarget normal cost for the short plan yeardescribed in paragraph (4) of this section5.03. The amortization installments attrib-utable to the plan that is not the ongoingplan for the interim period are theamounts that would otherwise be deter-mined for that plan for the plan year thatincludes the date of the merger, proratedto reflect the duration of the interim pe-riod. (6) Unless the date of the merger is the rst day of the plan year of the ongoingplan, the funding requirement for the on-going plan for the plan year in which themerger occurs is determined in accor- dance with the steps described in para-graphs (a) through (c) of this paragraph5.03(6). (a) In the rst step, the target normal cost and amortization installments for theongoing plan are the full year amountsdetermined without regard to the merger. (b) In the second step, the target nor- mal cost and amortization installments at-tributable to the plan that is not the ongo-ing plan are determined for the interim October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 470period as described in paragraph (5) of this section 5.03. (c) In the third step, the target normal cost and amortization installments from the rst two steps are combined in a man-ner similar to the treatment for separateplans under \u00a7 413(c)(4)(A). A Schedule SB is required for the on- going plan for the plan year in which themerger occurs with the combined targetnormal cost and amortization installmentsdescribed in paragraph (c) of this para-graph 5.03(6). (7) For the plan year of the ongoing plan following the plan year in which themerger occurs, the minimum funding re-quirements under \u00a7 430 for the ongoingplan are determined in accordance withthe rules set forth in paragraphs (a)through (d) of this paragraph 5.03(7). (a) If the asset valuation method that was used for each of the two plans wasidentical in all respects (including, if theasset valuation method is the averagingmethod under \u00a7 430(g)(3)(B), the deter-mination dates), the asset valuationmethod used for the ongoing plan is thatmethod (disregarding any difference at-tributable to a change in funding methodfor which automatic approval is providedwithout regard to this section 5.03). If thesame asset valuation method was not usedfor each of the two plans (for example, amethod that determines the value of planassets as the fair market value was usedfor one of the plans, and a method thatdetermines the value of plan assets as theaverage of fair market value on the valu-ation date and adjusted fair market valuedetermined for the two prior determina-tion dates was used for the other plan), theasset valuation method used for the ongo-ing plan must be the asset valuationmethod that was used for one of the twoplans (disregarding any difference attrib- utable to a change in funding method forwhich automatic approval for the changeis provided without regard to this section5.03). If an averaging method is themethod chosen for the ongoing plan, thatasset valuation method must reflect thehistorical cash flows for both plans, evenif this requires the reconstruction of his-torical cash flows and expected earningsfor the plan that was not valued using themethod chosen for the ongoing plan.(b) If all components of the funding method (other than the asset valuation method) used for each of the two planswere the same, then the funding method(other than the asset valuation method) forthe ongoing plan must be that method(disregarding any difference attributableto a change in funding method for whichautomatic approval is provided withoutregard to this section 5.03). If all compo-nents of the funding method (other thanthe asset valuation method) used for eachof the two plans were not the same, thenthe funding method (other than the assetvaluation method) for the ongoing planmust be one of the funding methods forone of the two plans (disregarding anydifference attributable to a change infunding method for which automatic ap-proval is provided without regard to thissection 5.03). (c) The interest rates used for the plan after the merger must be the interest rates that would have been used for one of thetwo plans. However, the interest rates maybe changed if the plan sponsor of theongoing plan elects an alternative interestrate available under \u00a7 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) orrequests approval under the procedures setforth in Rev. Proc. 2017-57 to revoke aninterest rate election that was in effect forone of the two plans. (d) All amortization installments that were maintained for the two plans continueto be maintained for the ongoing plan, ex-cept as provided under \u00a7 430(c)(6). (8) If the date of the merger is the rst day of the plan year of the ongoing plan,the following calculations are made asif the merger had occurred on the last dayof the preceding plan year of that plan: (a) The minimum required contribution for the plan that is not the ongoing plan isdetermined for the short plan year as de-scribed in paragraph (4) of this section 5.03. (b) The minimum required contribu- tion for the ongoing plan for the plan yearof the merger fully reflects the merger inthe manner described in paragraph (7) ofthis section 5.03. However, as there is nointerim period, the calculations describedin paragraph (5) of this section 5.03 arenot made. (9) The following examples illustrate the application of this section 5.03.Example 1. Mid-year merger of two plans with same plan year (a) Plan A has a plan year that begins on January 1 and ends on the following December 31. The valuation date for PlanA is January 1, the rst day of the planyear. (b) Plan B has a plan year that begins on January 1 and ends on the followingDecember 31. The valuation date for PlanB is January 1, the rst day of the planyear. (c) Plan B is merged into Plan A (so that Plan A is the ongoing plan) on April1, 2018. Thus, the interim period runsfrom April 1, 2018, to December 31,2018, and for Plan B, there is a short planyear that runs from January 1, 2018, toMarch 31, 2018. (d) The actuarial valuation for Plan A as of January 1, 2018, based on a 12-month plan year, results in a target normalcost of $200,000 and a shortfall amortiza-tion installment for 2018 of $116,852, at-tributable to a shortfall amortization baseestablished January 1, 2018. There are noother shortfall or waiver amortizationbases for Plan A as of January 1, 2018. (e) The actuarial valuation for Plan B as of January 1, 2018, based on a 12-month plan year, results in a target normalcost of $110,000 and a shortfall amortiza-tion installment for 2018 of $185,000, at-tributable to a shortfall amortization baseestablished January 1, 2018. There are noother shortfall or waiver amortizationbases for Plan B as of January 1, 2018. (f) The minimum required contribution for Plan B for the short plan year de-scribed in paragraph (4) of this section5.03 (January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2018)is determined as follows: (i) The target normal cost for the short plan year is redetermined to reflect thatthere is a short plan year. The new calcu- lation shows that the target normal costfor the short plan year (based on the ac-cruals for that short plan year) is $25,000. (ii) In accordance with \u00a7 1.430(a)- 1(b)(2)(ii)(A), the shortfall amortizationinstallment is prorated to reflect the threemonths covered by the short plan year.Accordingly, the shortfall amortization in-stallment for the short plan year is$46,250 (that is, $185,000 multiplied by3/12). Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 471(iii) The total minimum required con- tribution for the short plan year is $71,250 (that is, the sum of the target normal costof $25,000 plus the shortfall amortizationinstallment of $46,250). A nal ScheduleSB is led for Plan B for this short planyear based on these results. Pursuant toparagraph (4) of this section 5.03, to beeligible for the automatic approval in thissection 5.03, by 8\u00bd months after the dateof the merger of March 31, 2018 (that is,December 15, 2018), sufcient contribu-tions must have been made to Plan B toeliminate any unpaid minimum requiredcontribution for any plan year that endedprior to January 1, 2018, and to satisfy theminimum required contribution for theshort plan year that ended on March 31,2018. (g) The target normal cost and amorti- zation installment attributable to Plan Bfor the interim period (April 1, 2018, toDecember 31, 2018, which is the periodfrom the date of the merger to the end ofthe plan year of the ongoing plan) are determined as follows: (i) The target normal cost attributable to Plan B for the interim period is $85,000(that is, $110,000 for the 12-month planyear minus $25,000 for the short planyear). (ii) The shortfall amortization install- ment attributable to Plan B for the interimperiod is $138,750 (that is, $185,000 forthe 12-month plan year multiplied by9/12). (h) Following the rules of paragraph (6) of this section 5.03, the total minimumrequired contribution for Plan A for theplan year from January 1, 2018, to De-cember 31, 2018, is $540,602. This is thetotal of the target normal cost of $285,000(the total of the target normal cost for PlanA disregarding the merger of $200,000and the target normal cost attributable toPlan B for the interim period of $85,000)plus the total amortization installment of$255,602 (the total of the amortizationinstallment for Plan A disregarding themerger of $116,852 plus the amortizationinstallment attributable to Plan B for theinterim period of $138,750). A ScheduleSB is led for Plan A reflecting themerger. Pursuant to paragraph (4) of thissection 5.03, to be eligible for the auto-matic approval under this section 5.03,Plan A must not have any unpaid mini-mum required contribution and must sat- isfy the minimum required contributionfor the 2017 plan year as of the contribu-tion deadline of September 15, 2018 (8\u00bdmonths after the close of the 2017 planyear). Example 2. Mid-year plan merger of two plans with different plan years. (a) Plan C has a plan year that begins on July 1 and ends on the following June30. The valuation date for Plan C is July 1,the rst day of the plan year. (b) Plan D has a plan year that begins on January 1 and ends on the followingDecember 31. The valuation date for PlanD is January 1, the rst day of the planyear. (c) Plan D is merged into Plan C (so that Plan C is the ongoing plan) on Feb-ruary 28, 2018. Thus, the interim periodruns from March 1, 2018, to June 30,2018, and for Plan D, there is a short planyear that runs from January 1, 2018, toFebruary 28, 2018. (d) The actuarial valuation for Plan C as of July 1, 2018, based on a 12-monthplan year, results in a target normal cost of$200,000 and a shortfall amortization in-stallment of $116,852, attributable to ashortfall amortization base establishedJuly 1, 2018. There are no other shortfallor waiver amortization bases for Plan C asof July 1, 2018. Thus, the minimum re-quired contribution for Plan C withoutregard to the merger is the $316,852 (thatis, $200,000 plus $116,852). (e) The actuarial valuation for Plan D as of January 1, 2018, based on a 12-month plan year, results in a target normalcost of $110,000 and a shortfall amortiza-tion installment for 2017 of $185,000, at-tributable to a shortfall amortization baseestablished January 1, 2018. There are noother shortfall or waiver amortizationbases for Plan D as of January 1, 2018. (f) The minimum required contribution for Plan D for the short plan year de-scribed in paragraph (4) of this section5.03 is determined as follows: (i) The target normal cost for the short plan year is redetermined to reflect that there is a short plan year. The new calcu-lation shows that the target normal costfor the short plan year (based on the ac-cruals for the period from January 1,2018, through February 28, 2018) is $20,000. (ii) In accordance with \u00a7 1.430(a)- 1(b)(2)(ii)(A), the shortfall amortizationinstallment is prorated to reflect the twomonths covered by the short plan year.Accordingly, the shortfall amortization in-stallment for the short plan year is$30,833 (that is, $185,000 multiplied by2/12). (iii) The total minimum required con- tribution for the short plan year is $50,833(that is, the sum of the target normal costof $20,000 plus the shortfall amortizationinstallment of $30,833). A nal ScheduleSB is led for Plan D for this short planyear based on these results. Pursuant toparagraph (4) of this section 5.03, to beeligible for the automatic approval in thissection 5.03, by 8\u00bd months after the dateof the merger of February 28, 2018 (thatis, November 15, 2018), sufcient contri-butions must have been made to Plan D toeliminate any unpaid minimum requiredcontribution for any plan year that ended prior to January 1, 2018, and to satisfy theminimum required contribution for theshort plan year that ended on February 28,2018. (g) The target normal cost and amorti- zation installments attributable to Plan Dfor the interim period (March 1, 2018, toJune 30, 2018, which is the period fromthe date of the merger to the end of theplan year of the ongoing plan) is deter-mined as follows: (i) Based on a determination that the present value of benets earned from Jan-uary 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, is $58,000,the target normal cost attributable to PlanD for the interim period is $38,000 (thatis, the difference between $58,000 and the$20,000 amount determined in paragraph(f)(i) of this Example 2 based on accruals for the period from January 1, 2018, toFebruary 28, 2018). (ii) The shortfall amortization install- ment for the interim period is $61,667(that is, $185,000 multiplied by 4/12). (h) Following the rules of paragraph (6) of this section 5.03, the total minimumrequired contribution for Plan C for theplan year from July 1, 2017, to June 30,2018, is $416,519. This is the total of thetarget normal cost of $238,000 (the totalof the target normal cost for Plan C dis-regarding the merger of $200,000 and the October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 472target normal cost attributable to Plan D for the interim period of $38,000) plus thetotal amortization installment of $178,519(the total of the amortization installmentfor Plan C disregarding the merger of$116,852 plus the amortization install-ment attributable to Plan D for the interimperiod of $61,667). A Schedule SB is ledfor Plan C reflecting the merger. Pursuantto paragraph (4) of this section 5.03, to beeligible for the approval under this section5.03, Plan C must not have any unpaidminimum required contribution and mustsatisfy the minimum required contributionfor the plan year ending June 30, 2017, asof the contribution deadline of March 15,2018 (8\u00bd months after the close of thatplan year). Example 3. Mid-year plan merger of two plans using different asset valuation methods. (a) The facts are the same as in Exam- ple 2. Both Plan C and Plan D use an actuarial asset valuation method that de-termines the value of plan assets as theaverage of fair market value on the valu-ation date and adjusted fair market valuedetermined for two prior determinationdates which are 12 months and 24 monthsbefore the valuation date. The methods arethe same in all respects, except that, forPlan C, the determination dates are July 1of each year and, for Plan D, the determi-nation dates are January 1 of each year(corresponding to their respective valua-tion dates). The expected rates of returnthat were used to determine the actuarialvalue of assets for the plan years begin-ning in 2016, 2017, and 2018 were 6.0%for Plan C and 6.5% for Plan D. (b) The determination dates for Plan D are changed to correspond to the valuationdate of the ongoing plan. Therefore, thedetermination dates for the July 1, 2018,valuation (the rst valuation after the dateof the merger) will be July 1, 2016, andJuly 1, 2017, and the cash flows for PlanD will need to be reconstructed to corre-spond to the periods from July 1, 2016,through June 30, 2017, and from July 1,2017, through June 30, 2018. (c) The expected earnings for the pe- riod from July 1, 2016, through June 30,2017, and for the period from July 1,2017, through June 30, 2018, are calcu-lated separately for the reconstructed cashflow for Plan D (using Plan D's expectedearnings rate of 6.5%, lim ited so that it does not exceed the applicable third seg-ment rate under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iii)) and forthe cash flow from Plan C (using Plan C'sexpected earnings rate of 6.0%, limited sothat it does not exceed the applicable thirdsegment rate under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iii)). Theresulting expected earnings are then addedand used to determine the adjusted fair mar-ket value as of July 1, 2016, and July 1,2017, as described in \u00a7 430(g)(3) and Notice2009-22 (or subsequent guidance). (d) For plan years beginning July 1, 2018, or later, the expected earnings forthe ongoing plan will be determined usinga single expected earnings rate, equal tothe actuary's best estimate of the antici-pated rate of return on the combined as-sets of Plan C and Plan D, limited so thatit does not exceed the applicable thirdsegment rate under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iii).The actuarial value of assets for the ongo-ing plan as of July 1, 2019, will reflect theexpected earnings for the period from July1, 2017, through June 30, 2019, deter-mined using: (i) The expected earnings for the pe- riod July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018,based on the combined expected earningsfrom Plan C and Plan D, determined asdescribed in paragraph (c) of this exam-ple, and (ii) The expected earnings for the pe- riod from July 1, 2018, through June 30,2019, based on the single expected earn-ings rate described in this paragraph (d). SECTION 6. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF AUTOMATIC APPROVALUNDER THIS REVENUEPROCEDURE .01 This revenue procedure does not apply unless the plan administrator (within the meaning of \u00a7 414(g)) or anauthorized representative of the plansponsor indicates on the Form 5500 seriesreturn led for the plan for the plan yearfor which the change is effective that theplan administrator or plan sponsor agreesto the change in funding method. In thecase of special approval for a change infunding method described in section 4 ofthis revenue procedure (other than the ap-proval for fully funded terminating plansin section 4.04 of this revenue procedure),and approval for a change in fundingmethod in connection with plan mergers described in section 5 of this revenue pro-cedure, the requirement that the plan ad-ministrator or authorized representative ofthe plan sponsor agree to the change issatised if the plan administrator or anauthorized representative of the plansponsor is made aware of the change be-fore the Schedule SB is led (or, in thecase of a plan for which Schedule SB isnot required to be led, by the time theSchedule SB is delivered to the em-ployer). .02 This revenue procedure does not apply for a plan year of a plan if a mini-mum funding waiver under \u00a7 412(c) hasbeen granted and there is a waiver amor-tization charge for the plan year or a fu-ture year, or a plan sponsor has applied fora funding waiver under \u00a7 412(c) for theplan and the waiver application is pend-ing. .03 This revenue procedure does not apply if the plan is under an EmployeePlans examination for any plan year, or if the plan sponsor, or a representative, hasreceived verbal or written noticationfrom the Tax Exempt and GovernmentEntities Division of an impending Em-ployee Plans examination, or of an im-pending referral from another part of theIRS for an Employee Plans examination,or if the plan has been under such anexamination and is in Appeals or in liti-gation for issues raised in an EmployeePlans examination. .04 This revenue procedure does not apply if the change in funding method isbeing made in connection with a planmerger (unless the change is made as pro-vided in sections 5.01 through 5.03 of thisrevenue procedure) or in connection witha plan spin-off. .05 This revenue procedure does not apply if the change in funding method isbeing made in connection with a planmerger if any of the following conditionsapply: (1) The adjusted funding target attain- ment percentages (AFTAPs), as dened in\u00a7 436(j), immediately before the planmerger, are not within the same range forall of the plans to be merged. For thispurpose: (a) The AFTAPs are the AFTAPs that have been certied as provided in \u00a7 1.436-1(h)(4) for the plan year of the change (or if Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 473no certication has been made, the pre- sumed AFTAPs for the year of change).However, if no certication for the preced-ing year was issued during the precedingplan year, the deemed percentage continuesas described in \u00a7 1.436-1(h)(1)(iii). (b) The ranges are the ranges described in \u00a7 1.436-1(h)(4)(ii) (less than 60%, or higher), except that anAFTAP of 80% or higher is treated asbeing in the same range as an AFTAP of100% or higher. (2) As of the most recent valuation date for each of the plans, one of the plansinvolved in the plan merger has a fundingshortfall described in \u00a7 430(c)(4) and an-other of the plans involved in the planmerger does not have a funding shortfall. (3) The asset valuation method is being changed and the asset valuation methodwas changed in any of the four precedingplan years for any of the plans involved inthe merger. (4) The valuation date is being changed and the valuation date was changed ineither of the two preceding plan years forany of the plans involved in the merger. .06 Except as provided in section 4.04 of this revenue procedure, this revenueprocedure does not apply to a change thatis made for a plan year in which the planis terminated. .07 This revenue procedure does not apply to a change that is made for a planfor which an election has been made pur-suant to section 402(a) of the PensionProtection Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109-280(120 Stat. 780) (including a change in-volving a merger of such a plan with aplan that has not made such an election). SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE This revenue procedure is effective for plan years commencing on or after Janu- ary 1, 2018. However, taxpayers mayelect to apply this revenue procedure forearlier plan years. SECTION 8. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS This revenue procedure modies Rev. Proc. 2000-40 to provide that the auto- matic approvals set forth in Rev. Proc.2000-40 do not apply to plans that aresubject to section 430. This revenue procedure modies An- nouncements 2010-3 and 2015-3 to pro-vide that the automatic approvals set forthin those announcements do not apply to achange in funding method for a plan yearbeginning on or after January 1, 2018. Forearlier plan years, taxpayers may use ei-ther the automatic approvals set forth inthose announcements or the automatic ap-provals set forth in sections 4.01 and 4.02of this revenue procedure.

SECTION 1. PURPOSE The purpose of this revenue procedure is to update Rev. Proc. 2000-41, 2000-2 C.B. 371, to take into account the enact-ment of subsequent legislation. This rev-enue procedure sets forth the procedurefor obtaining approval of the Internal Rev-enue Service (IRS) for a change in thefunding method used for a dened benetplan, as provided by 412(d)(1) of theInternal (\"Code\") and sec-tion 302(d)(1) of the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974, PublicLaw 93-406 (88 Stat. 829 (1974)), asamended (ERISA). This revenue proce-dure also sets forth the procedure for ob-taining approval of the IRS to revoke anelection relating to interest rates pursuantto \u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) ofthe Code and the corresponding sectionsof ERISA.SECTION 2. BACKGROUND .01 Sections 412 (minimum funding standards), 430 (minimum funding stan- dards for single-employer dened benetpension plans other than CSEC (minimum funding standards for mul-tiemployer plans), and 433 (minimumfunding standards for CSEC plans) of theCode set forth funding rules for denedbenet plans. 175Under \u00a7 412(d)(1), a change of funding method for a plan maytake effect only if the change is approvedby the IRS. A funding method is a recog-nized actuarial technique utilized for es-tablishing the amount and incidence of theannual actuarial cost of pension plan ben-ets and expenses. .02 Section 430(h)(2) provides the re- quirements for the interest rates that areused under \u00a7 430. Unless the plan sponsorelects to use interest rates under the cor-porate bond yield curve, the interest ratesthat must be used are based on the threesegment rates for the applicable month.Under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(E), the applicablemonth is the month that includes the val- uation date, unless the plan sponsor electsto use a different permitted applicablemonth. As provided under \u00a7\u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) and 430(h)(2)(E), an election touse the corporate bond yield curve, as wellas an election of a permitted applicablemonth other than the month that containsthe valuation date (if use of the corporatebond yield curve is not elected), may berevoked only with the consent of the IRS. .03 Rev. Proc. 2000-41 provides pro- cedures for obtaining the IRS's approvalfor a change in funding method, but itdoes not take into account the changes tothe minimum funding requirements en-acted in legislation after it was issued,including the Pension Protection Act of2006, Pub. L. 109-280, the Cooperativeand Small Employer Charity PensionFlexibility Act, Pub. L. 113-97, and theMultiemployer Pension Reform Act of2014, which was enacted as part of theConsolidated and Further Continuing Ap-propriations Act, 2015, Pub. L. 113-235. .04 Rev. Proc. 2017-4, 2017-01 I.R.B. 146, sets forth the current general proce-dures of the IRS relating to the issuance ofrulings, determination letters, and opinion 175Sections 302, 303, 304 and 306 of ERISA contain parallel funding rules for dened benet plans. October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 474letters on employee plans and exempt or- ganization matters (including user fees).These general procedures are updated an-nually. Sections 6.02(11) and (12) of Rev.Proc. 2017-4 set forth Proc. 2017-56, 2017-44 I.R.B. xx, method forsingle-employer dened certainchanges in funding method for denedbenet plans that are not subject to therequired minimum funding rules of \u00a7 430. SECTION 3. SCOPE OF THIS REVENUE PROCEDURE ANDAPPLICABLE DEFINITIONS .01 This revenue procedure applies to any dened benet plan that is subject to \u00a7 412 of the Code or section 302 ofERISA. Pursuant to \u00a7 412(d)(1) of the Codeand section 302(d)(1) of ERISA, anychange in funding method must be ap-proved by the IRS. Section 433(c)(5)(B) ofthe Code and section 306(c)(5)(B) ofERISA also provide that a change of fund-ing method for a CSEC plan must be ap-proved by the IRS. Thus, this revenue pro-cedure applies for purposes of all of thosesections. See sections 4 and 5 of this reve-nue procedure. This revenue procedure alsoprovides for approval of the revocation of anelection relating to interest rates pursuant to\u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) or 430(h)(2)(E) of theCode and section 303(h)(2)(D)(ii) or 303(h)(2)(E) of ERISA. See section 6 of this rev-enue procedure. .02 A funding method is used for a plan year if it is used to determine the mini-mum required contribution for the planyear as reflected in the Schedule SB(Single-Employer Money Purchase Plan Actu-arial applicable, that isattached to the Form 5500, \"Annual Re-turn/Report of Employee Benet Plan.\" Aplan's funding method includes not onlythe overall actuarial cost method used by the plan but also each specic method ofcomputation used in applying the overallmethod. Any change in a plan's currentmethod of computing the minimum fund-ing requirement under \u00a7 412 of the Codeis a change in funding method. This in-cludes any change in the determination ofthe value of plan assets or liabilities that is not the result of changes in data or actu-arial assumptions. A change in fundingmethod includes any changes in the selec-tion of data elements that are used in thevaluation. Data elements are types of data,such as compensation, dates of birth orhire, or gender, used to value the planliabilities. For example, a change fromusing assumed data to using actual datafor purposes of determining plan liabili-ties (such as changing from assuming thateach male participant's spouse is threeyears younger than the participant to usingthe actual age of each male participant'sspouse) is a change in the selection of dataelements. However, if actual data gener-ally was used for the prior plan year ex-cept that assumed data was used to ll infor some data that was missing or incom-plete, then the use of actual data for thecurrent plan year (because there is no lon-ger a need to ll in for missing or incom-plete data) would not be a change in theselection of data elements. (a) The following are examples of changes in funding method: 176 Example 1 \u2014 The method of valuing liabilities is unchanged, but the method of valuing assets is changed from one method to another method. Example 2 \u2014 The plan year is not changed, but the valuation date for the plan is changed from thedate that is the rst day of the plan year to the datethat is the last day of the plan year. Example 3 \u2014 The valuation date for the plan has been the date that is the rst day of the plan year. Theplan year is changed, and the valuation date ischanged to the date that is the rst day of the newplan year. Example 4 \u2014 The plan's enrolled actuary ceases using Vendor A's software to determine the plan'sminimum funding requirement, and begins usingVendor B's software, with the result that some com-putations are not the same after the change in valu-ation software. Example 5 \u2014 The plan year is the calendar year and the valuation date is January 1. For the prior planyear, the data element used to project future com-pensation was the actual annual compensation (asreported on Form W-2, \"Wage and Tax Statement\"), for the plan year preceding the valuation date. Forthe current plan year, the data element used to proj-ect future compensation is the monthly rate of pay asof the valuation date. Example 6 \u2014 The plan year is the rst plan year of a plan that is the result of a spin-off to which thede minimis rule of \u00a7 1.414(l)-1(n)(2) does not applyand the funding method is not the same as thefunding method used prior to the spin-off. Example 7 \u2014 The plan year is the rst plan year following a merger of two or more plans and thefunding method is not the same as the fundingmethod used by all of the merging plans prior themerger. (b) The following are examples of changes in funding method for plans with respect to which \u00a7 430 does not apply(such as multiemployer plans): Example 1 \u2014 The actuarial cost method used to determine the minimum funding requirement is changed from the entry age normal method to theunit credit method. Example 2 \u2014 The method used to determine the minimum funding requirement is changed from the aggregate method under which the normal cost islevel as a percentage of compensation to the aggre-gate method under which the normal cost is level asa dollar amount. Example 3 \u2014 The method for determining the cost of ancillary benets is changed from onemethod to another method. (c) The following are examples of changes in actuarial assumptions, rather than changes in funding method:177 Example 1 \u2014 For the prior plan year, projected static mortality tables were used for the plan and for the current plan year, generational mortality tablesare used for the plan. Example 2 \u2014 The plan is subject to the require- ments of \u00a7 430, and the determination of the valueof plan assets uses averaging of fair market valuesas provided in \u00a7 430(g)(3)(B). For the prior planyear, the expected earnings were based on anassumed earnings rate of seven percent. For thecurrent plan year, an assumed earnings rate of sixpercent is used. (In both cases, the assumed earn-ings rates are limited to the third segment rateapplicable under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iii).) Example 3 \u2014 For the prior plan year, the com- pensation used to project future compensation wasequal to the compensation for the plan year preced-ing the valuation date increased by three percent. Forthe current plan year, the compensation used to proj-ect future compensation is equal to the compensationfor the plan year preceding the valuation date in-creased by four percent. (d) The following are examples of in- terest rate elections (for which approval is not required), as well as revocations ofinterest rate elections for single-employer 176Rev. Proc. 2017-56 and Rev. Proc. 2000-40 provide automatic approval for certain of the changes in funding method illustrated in these examples. 177Although a change in actuarial assumptions does not constitute a change in funding method, certain changes in actuarial assumptions may not be made without approval of the IRS pursuant to \u00a7 430(h)(5) and \u00a7 433(c)(5)(C). See Rev. Proc. 2017-4, or its successor, for procedures on how to request approval for such a change in actuarial assumptions. Bulletin No. 2017-44 October 30, 2017 475plans subject to the requirements of \u00a7 430 (for which approval is required and maybe requested pursuant to section 6 of thisrevenue procedure), rather than changes infunding method: Example 1 \u2014 Plan liabilities are valued using the corporate bond yield curve for the 2016 plan year, the segment rates for the 2017 plan year, and thecorporate bond yield curve for the 2018 plan year.The change from interest rates under the corporatebond yield curve for the 2016 plan year to thesegment rates for the 2017 plan year is made througha revocation of an election to use the corporate bondyield curve, which requires the approval of theIRS, in accordance with \u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) and\u00a7 1.430(h)(2)-1(e). The change from segment ratesto the corporate bond yield curve for the 2018 planyear is an election to use the corporate bond yieldcurve, which does not require the approval of theIRS, in accordance with \u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) and\u00a7 1.430(h)(2)-1(e). Example 2 \u2014 The applicable month used to determine the segment rates is changed from thefourth month preceding the valuation date to the rstmonth preceding the valuation date. This change ismade through a revocation of an election pursuant to\u00a7 430(h)(2)(E) and \u00a7 1.430(h)(2)-1(e) (which re-quires the approval of the IRS) combined with a newelection under those provisions. .03 Approval will be given to a change in funding method only if the proposed method is permitted under applicablefunding rules and the transition to the pro-posed method is acceptable. In addition, achange in funding method that has a sig-nicant effect on a plan's minimum re-quired contribution, maximum tax deduct-ible contribution, operations under \u00a7 436for the year of change, or status under\u00a7 432(b) (in the case of a multiemployerplan) may be reviewed to assess the ap-propriateness of the change in light of thateffect. SECTION 4. APPLICATION PROCEDURES .01 A plan administrator, plan sponsor, or the authorized representative of either, that seeks to obtain approval for a changein funding method must make a writtenrequest for that approval that satises allthe requirements of Rev. Proc. 2017-4 (orits successor). Attention is called to sec-tions 6.02(10) through (14) of Rev. Proc.2017-4 (or the corresponding portions ofits successor) concerning signatures, au-thorized representatives (such as attorneysand enrolled actuaries), a power of attor-ney and declaration of representative, anda penalties of perjury statement. However,a statement of proposed deletions pursu-ant to \u00a7 6110(c) is not required to be furnished. All signatures must be accom-panied by the typed name and title (ifapplicable) of the signer. Refer to Appen-dix A of this revenue procedure for achecklist of the information that must beincluded with the request for approval.Any information described in this revenueprocedure that is unduly burdensome tofurnish need not be included, but the re-quest for approval must include a state-ment indicating why this material is notbeing furnished. .02 The request should generally be made no later than 2\u00bd months followingthe close of the plan year for which thechange is to be effective. Requests madeafter 2\u00bd months following the close of theplan year generally will not be consideredunless the request involves a plan merger.In the case of a request for approval for achange in funding method that involves aplan merger, the request should be madeno later than 4 months before the Form5500 ling deadline for the ongoing plan for the plan year in which the merger tookplace. .03 The information specied in this section 4.03 must accompany the request: (1) The employer identication num- ber, the plan name and number, and thename, address, and phone number of theplan administrator or plan sponsor. (2) A statement of the plan year rst affected by the proposed change. (3) A copy of the actuarial valuation report for the plan year preceding the yearof change, and, if available, a draft of theactuarial valuation report for the year ofchange. (4) A copy of the most recently led Schedule SB or Schedule MB, as applica-ble, of Form 5500 including attachmentsthereto. (5) A description of the current funding method, the proposed funding method,and the transition between the two fund-ing methods. For this purpose, a fundingmethod may be described by reference toa funding method contained in Rev. Proc.2000-40, Rev. Proc. 2017-56, or otherpublished guidance. The description of afunding method should include sufcientdetails so that two independent actuariesapplying the described method would ar-rive at the same valuation results using thesame assumptions for a given plan.If applicable, the description must in- dicate how the proposed method applies differently in the rst year of the changethan it applies in the subsequent years. Forexample, a proposed asset valuationmethod may start at market value in theyear of change and phase in gains andlosses in subsequent years. Additionally,if either of those asset valuation methodsis not described in Rev. Proc. 2000-40 orRev. Proc. 2017-56 (as applicable), a nu-merical illustration demonstrating the cal-culation of the actuarial value of assetsunder the current method and the pro-posed method must be included. (6) A brief statement of the reason for the proposed change and a statement whyautomatic approval under Rev. Proc.2000-40 or Rev. Proc. 2017-56 (as ap-plicable) may not be used to make thechange. (7) A statement of whether a change in funding method was made (or whetherapproval for a change of funding methodwas requested, but the change was not made) for any of the 5 plan years preced-ing the year of change. If the fundingmethod was changed, or a change wasrequested, in any of the 5 preceding planyears the following information must beprovided: (A) If the change in funding method was automatically approved, (i) the plan year of the change(ii) the details of the change in fund- ing method, and (iii) the specic provision of the statute, regulation, revenue procedure, orother authority providing for the auto-matic approval. (B) If approval for the change in fund- ing method was requested and granted, acopy of the approval letter. (C) If approval for the change in fund- ing method was requested and denied, acopy of the denial letter. (D) If approval for a change in funding method was requested and the requestwithdrawn, a summary of the request andthe reason for the withdrawal. (8) A statement of whether a waiver of the minimum funding standard was re-quested for any of the 5 plan years pre-ceding the year of change. Also, provide astatement of whether a request for awaiver is currently pending or is expectedto be submitted in the near future. If a October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 476waiver was requested in any of the pre- ceding 5 plan years, the following infor-mation must be provided: (A) If the waiver was approved, a copy of the letter granting the waiver. (B) If the waiver was denied, a copy of the letter denying the waiver. (C) If the waiver request was with- drawn, a summary of the requestand the reason for the withdrawal. (9) A statement of whether an exten- sion of any amortization period is cur-rently in effect or whether an amortizationextension was requested for any of the 5plan years preceding the year of change.Also, provide a statement of whether arequest for an amortization extension iscurrently pending or is expected to besubmitted in the near future. If an amor-tization extension was requested in any ofthe preceding 5 plan years, the followinginformation must be provided: (A) If the amortization extension was approved, a copy of the approvalletter. (B) If the amortization extension was denied, a copy of the denial letter. (C) If the amortization extension re- quest was withdrawn, a summary of the request and the reason forthe withdrawal.

In lieu of including a copy of the application with this request, ref-erence may be made to the Departmentof Treasury website (www.treasury.gov)if the benet suspension application hasbeen posted on that website when the re-quest for the change in funding method isled. .04 In the case of a change in funding method involving a plan merger, the in-formation described in section 4.03 of thisrevenue procedure must be provided forall merging plans as of the date of themerger. In addition, the technical informa-tion described in the sections 4.03(12)through (14) of this revenue procedure, asapplicable depending on the plan, for theongoing plan must be provided taking intoaccount the merger. .05 In the case of a change in funding method involving a spin-off, the informa-tion described in section 4.03 of this rev-enue procedure must be provided for theoriginal plan as of the date of the spin-off.In addition, the technical information de-scribed in the sections 4.03(12) through(14) of this revenue procedure, as appli-cable depending on the plan, for the orig-inal plan and all spun-off plans must beprovided taking into account the spin-off.With respect to a plan that, following thespin-off, is not maintained by a member ofthe controlled group of the plan sponsorrequesting the approval for the change in funding method, this information may beprovided using the assumption that thereare no changes following the spin-off. .06 The IRS may request additional information as needed. For example, theIRS may request detailed valuation resultsfor test lives that illustrate the effect of thechange. See section 27 of Rev. Proc.2017-4 (or the corresponding portion ofits successor) for timing to respond to arequest for additional information. .07 If a conference has been requested, a conference will be granted only in ac-cordance with section 28 of Rev. Proc.2017-4 (or the corresponding portion ofits successor). If the IRS proposes an ad-verse holding, the taxpayer will be offereda conference in accordance with section28 of Rev. Proc. 2017-4 (or the corre-sponding portion of its successor). .08 If the request for the change in funding method is approved, the instruc-tions to Schedule SB or Schedule MB, asapplicable, of Form 5500 should be fol-lowed in reporting the change. SECTION 5. CLASS RULINGS .01 In a case in which approval is sought for a change in funding method for a group of plans, a \"class ruling\" provid-ing approval of that change for all planswithin that class may be requested. Aclass consists of a group of at least 40plans (1) that receive actuarial servicesfrom the same insurance company, con-sulting rm, or business organization, orwhose actuarial valuations are producedusing the software of the same vendor,and (2) for which an identical change infunding method is proposed. A class rul-ing will provide approval for all plans inthe class. .02 An enrolled actuary may request a class ruling on behalf of an insurancecompany, consulting rm, or businessorganization that provides actuarial ser-vices to the plans within the class. Anenrolled actuary may also request a classruling on behalf of a software vendor,and the ruling would apply to all plansfor which the actuarial valuations areproduced using that vendor's software(both before and after the change infunding method). .03 The enrolled actuary making the request must state the period for which the October 30, 2017 Bulletin No. 2017-44 478class ruling is proposed to be effective, and a plan covered by the class ruling ispermitted to use the approval for a planyear that begins within the stated period.The stated period may not begin prior to12 months before the month in which therequest is made. Generally, the periodmay not exceed 36 months. .04 In lieu of the plan-specic informa- tion otherwise required under section 4 ofthis revenue procedure, the request for aclass ruling must contain the followinginformation: (1) The name and enrollment number of the actuary making the request. (2) The name and address of the insur- ance company, consulting rm, businessorganization, or software vendor de-scribed in section 5.02 of this revenueprocedure. (3) A statement indicating that the ap- plicant believes that the class ruling willbe applied to at least 40 plans and anestimate of the number of plans that areexpected to change the funding method in accordance with the class ruling. (4) The information described in sec- tions 4.03(5), 4.03(6), and sections4.03(12) through (14), as applicable de-pending on the plans within the class, ofthis revenue procedure, except that thenumerical results requested in sections4.03(12) through (14) of this revenue pro-cedure should be illustrative examplesrather than actual numerical results. .05 If the change in funding method is approved, a class ruling will be issued tothe insurance company, consulting rm,business organization, or software ven-dor on whose behalf the ruling is re-quested. The change in funding methodwill apply to a plan within the class ifthe plan sponsor or plan administratorconsents to the change. In such a case,the instructions to Schedule SB orSchedule MB, as applicable, and Sched-ule R (Retirement Plan Information) ofForm 5500 should be followed in report-ing the change for the plan. However,the plan administrator or plan sponsor ofany plan need not agree to the change infunding method, and, if neither the planadministrator nor plan sponsor of a planagree to the change in funding method,then the change in funding method ap-proved in the class ruling will not beapplied for the plan..06 If a request for a class ruling is approved, at least 30 of the plans covered by the ruling must make the approvedchange in funding method in order for theclass ruling to become effective. If thechange in funding method is not made forat least 30 of the plans covered by theruling, then the class ruling is not effectivewith respect to any plan, and the changemay not be made for any plan unless thechange is approved by the IRS separatelyfor that plan. .07 The IRS may, in its discretion, limit the period for which a class ruling will beeffective, impose conditions on the use ofthe class ruling, or decline to issue a classruling. SECTION 6. REQUESTING APPROVAL FOR REVOCATIONOF AN INTEREST RATEELECTION .01 A plan sponsor (or the authorized representative of the plan sponsor) of a plan subject to \u00a7 430 that is requestingapproval for a revocation of an interestrate election must make a written requestfor that approval that satises all the re-quirements of Rev. Proc. 2017-4 (or itssuccessor). Attention is called to sections6.02(10) through (14) of Rev. Proc.2017-4 (or the corresponding portions ofits successor) concerning signatures, au-thorized representatives (such as attorneysand enrolled actuaries), a power of attor-ney and declaration of representative, anda penalties of perjury statement. However,a statement of proposed deletions pursu-ant to \u00a7 6110(c) is not required to befurnished. All signatures must be accom-panied by the typed name and title (ifapplicable) of the signer. Refer to Appen-dix A of this revenue procedure for achecklist of the information that must beincluded with the request for approval.However, items 8 and 11 of the checklistare not applicable to a request for ap-proval of a revocation of an interest rateelection. Any information requested thatis unduly burdensome to furnish need notbe included, but the request for approvalmust include a statement indicating whythis material is not being furnished. .02 The rules of sections 4.02, 4.03, and 4.06 through 4.08 of this revenue pro-cedure apply to a request to revoke aninterest rate election. For purposes ofthose rules, the revocation of an interestrate election is treated as change in fund-ing method. SECTION 7. EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS 01 Rev. Proc. 2000-41, 2000-2 C.B. 371, is superseded. .02 Rev. Proc. 2017-4 is modied by substituting references to this revenue procedure for references to Rev. Proc.2000-41. SECTION 8.

Thus, ifan earlier ruling held that a principle ap-plied to A, and the new ruling holds thatthe same principle also applies to B, theearlier ruling is amplied. (Compare withmodied, below). Claried is used in those instances where the language in a prior ruling isbeing made clear because the languagehas caused, or may cause, some confu-sion. It is not used where a position in aprior ruling is being changed. Distinguished describes a situation where a ruling mentions a previously pub-lished ruling and points out an essentialdifference between them. Modied is used where the substance of a previously published position is beingchanged. Thus, if a prior ruling held that aprinciple applied to A but not to B, and thenew ruling holds that it applies to both Aand B, the prior ruling is modied becauseit corrects a published position. (Comparewith amplied andclaried, above). Obsoleted describes a previously pub- lished ruling that is not considered deter-minative with respect to future transac-tions. This term is most commonly used ina ruling that lists previously published rul-ings that are obsoleted because of changesin laws or regulations. A ruling may alsobe obsoleted because the substance hasbeen included in regulations subsequentlyadopted. Revoked describes situations where the position in the previously published rulingis not correct and the correct position isbeing stated in a new ruling. Superseded describes a situation where the new ruling does nothing more thanrestate the substance and situation of apreviously published ruling (or rulings).Thus, the term is used to republish underthe 1986 Code and regulations the sameposition published under the 1939 Codeand regulations. The term is also usedwhen it is desired to republish in a singleruling a series of situations, names, etc.,that were previously published over a pe-riod of time in separate rulings. If the newruling does more than restate the sub-stance of a prior ruling, a combination of terms is used. For example, modied and superseded describes a situation where the substance of a previously published rulingis being changed in part and is continuedwithout change in part and it is desired torestate the valid portion of the previouslypublished ruling in a new ruling that isself contained. In this case, the previouslypublished ruling is rst modied and then,as modied, is superseded. Supplemented is used in situations in which a list, such as a list of the names ofcountries, is published in a ruling and thatlist is expanded by adding further namesin subsequent rulings. After the originalruling has been supplemented severaltimes, a new ruling may be published thatincludes the list in the original ruling andthe additions, and supersedes all prior rul-ings in the series. Suspended is used in rare situations to show that the previous published rulingswill not be applied pending some futureaction such as the issuance of new oramended regulations, the outcome ofcases in litigation, or the outcome of aService study.
