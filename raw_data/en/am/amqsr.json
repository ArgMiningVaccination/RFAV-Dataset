It Shouldn't Be. Dr. Ileana Leyva BY WAYNE BRACKIN If you are over 40, we likely have something in common, namely a small, faded scar on our upper arm, a relic of the war on smallpox. Our children haven't had to face this menace because we grew up in a society that trusted sci-ence and our leaders to guide us toward the elimination of crippling diseases. There were lamentable exceptions such as the T uskegee Study . And yet, many childhood diseases including measles, diphtheria and rubella were eradicated. Even polio's twisted limbs are part of the past, not our future. Today , we relive the tragic scenes of a surge, the anguish and the exhaustion of healthcare workers. Both adult and pediatric cases are at an alarmingly high volume, and infants with COVID-19 are filling our NICUs. Too many of us have been influenced by the unending bom-bardment of health misinformation on the internet. The Surgeon General of the United States, Vivek Murthy , M.D., had to issue a report titled \"Confronting Health Misinformation.\" Given this real-ity , I find that a core of people in every organization are in decision paralysis about the COVID-19 vaccine.

According to Medical Malpractice and Workers Compensation Specialist Tom Murphy at Danna-Gracey , the largest independent medical malpractice insur-ance agency in Florida, OSHA 's Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) has 15 key requirements designed to help employers use multiple overlapping con-trols in a layered approach to protect workers. Though a number of labor groups have recommended that these same requirements be extended to those in other high-risk employment fields such as manufacturing and retail, the current ETS only applies to the health-care industry . One of the requirements of the updat- ed ETS is that healthcare facilities with 10 or more employees must conduct a hazard assessment and create a safety plan in writing. \"Employers are required to assess the risk in their healthcare facilities for COVID and to create a safety plan that spells out what steps they'll take to counter any exposure or risk,\" said Murphy . \"The ETS sets forth rules for when to require masking, distancing and physical barrier requirements, and also addresses other personal protection equipment (PPE), health screenings, ventilation, employee training, vaccina-tions, record-keeping and paying quaran-tined employees.\" The new regulations require employers to provide workers with paid time off to get vaccinated as well as time to recover from any vaccine side effects. Covered employees who have COVID must work remotely or be separated from other workers or be given paid time off up to $1,400 per week. In addition to brick-and-mortar loca- tions, the standards also apply to employees who work in ambulatory care settings and to emergency responders who treat suspected or confirmed coron-avirus patients. While the new regulations may seem onerous to employers suffering from shifting COVID rules, there is a bright side. \"One of the benefits of this is that most health-care practices with less than 500 employees can expect to receive tax credits from the American Rescue Plan,\" said Murphy , adding that OSHA expects the ETS to protect roughly 10 mil-lion healthcare workers. Vaccinated or Unvaccinated? While the ETS does pro- vide for some exemptions from the guidelines for fully vaccinated employees, as COVID continues to spread, these exceptions may change as well. \"Before the Delta variant started spreading, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) was saying that if people were vaccinated, they could go anywhere without a mask,\" said Murphy . \"But because COVID cases are increasing, they are now recommending that vacci-nated people in enclosed places like restaurants and bars should wear masks. These guidelines may continue to change as new variations appear.\" The ETS does include guidance for working with unvaccinated employees in high-risk settings, including the use of physical barriers and working off-hours. In terms of compliance, Murphy said that any healthcare employers who have not yet followed the new ETS regulations are out of compliance, which could put their businesses at risk. \"Anybody in a healthcare management position needs to continually monitor the OSHA website and the ETS guide-lines,\" he said, warning of upcoming fines and penalties for noncompliance. \"Right now , OSHA is trying to get people aware of the new guidelines and get them motivated to do what they need to do, but the website also says that the Department of Labor is in the process of determining what kinds of fines and penalties will be assessed. Any employee could go online to see what is required, and if their company is not complying, report them to OSHA.\" He adds that things may continue to change over the next days or weeks, which is why it's important to remain vigilant. \"These rules are a moving target because of what's going on with the Delta variant, so healthcare leaders have to stay up-to-date on the latest changes,\" he said.

Here is what to expect: The process to apply for privileges in a hospital is as fol- lows: 1. Request - Send the medical staff office (MSO) for the facility a letter, along with a CV , requesting an application packet for your specialty . 2. Application - The medical staff office will then send you an application packet with instructions and forms, including an application, a conflict of interest form, a release of information form, a form where you agree to abide by the hospitals rules and regulations, maybe even a confidentiality agreement, and there will be questions about your license(s) such as: the specialty certification, DEA #, Tax ID, Board Certifications, professional liability insurance. 3. Full and Complete Information is Required - Next you will complete the requested information. Important: if you have issues in your history , such as a: prior law suit, licensing complaints, a potential conflict of interest, a pending law suit or a pending complaint, or any other certification or licensing issue like something that shows up on the National Provider Data Bank (NPDB), or issues where your privileges were reduced or revoked due to behavior or competency issues; you should probably consult an attorney to help you frame the application truthfully and accurately , and to help you maximize your chances of getting approved. Remember, if this information is not accurate, it means that the institution can terminate your privileges at any time. You will likely have to attach a copy of your graduation certificates and licenses with the application. 4. Application Verification - Your application will then be verified by the medical staff office, all licenses, certifications, and prior work history will be checked. The MSO will inquire into your state license, National Practitioners' Data Bank, Medicare/Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Lists, and all sources where a physician's disci-plinary actions and claims are reported. 5. Department Chair Review - Next your application will go to the Department Chair for review of the file to see if it meets the qualification standards. Important: The approval or disapproval at this step is key . Most applications that are denied are denied at this stage, and the reason stated is \"incomplete record or file\"; however, if the application proceeds to the next level and is then denied it is a reportable event that you were \"denied privileges\". So be very deliberate and careful in the application process. If the application goes bad, it will likely have other professional ramifications. 6. Medical Staff Committee or Credentialing Committee or the Medical Executive Committee will then review your application for its approval. 7. Board of Governors or Board of Trustees or the presiding governing body of the hospital system will then have the last opportunity to review the file and decide whether to grant the appointment and privileges. If and once you are approved, you will receive a written confirmation letter, and you may be placed on the \"Call\" schedule; you may also be asked to serve on a medical staff committee. Roughly every 2 years after this appointment, you will likely have to go through a similar disclosure and verification process. If you would like to find out more about what the power, role, and obligations of a Medical Executive Committee are, or if you would like to find out more about how the peer review process works, please visit www.MirzaHealthLaw.com. If you have questions or issues you need answered by an attorney , please reach out to your select healthcare hospital attorney who has experience in handling these issues; if you don't, then feel free to call us for we have the experience to guide you through this process.

BY BEN ASSAD MIRZA, ESQ., LLM, CPA, MPHA, CHC In July 2020, CMS un - veiled the Outpatient Pros - pective Payment System pro- posed rule for 2022. It addressed the Price Trans - parency rule which be came effective on January 1, 2021 and has proposed sanctions for hospitals that remain non-compliant with the fed-eral mandate. The rule requires hospitals to post a machine-readable file with the negotiated rates for all items and services and dis-play the prices of 300 shoppable services in a consumer - friendly format on their websites. CMS will consider a hospital as having met the requirement of posting a con-sumer-friendly list of standard charges if the hospital has an online price estimator tool that provides out-of-pocket cost esti-mates in real time. Most hospitals are still not fully com- pliant with the federal mandate. Some have opted to pay the maximum $300 per day noncompliance fee rather than face the potential costs of price disclo-sure. Some have made attempts to com-ply but are not in full compliance. Several hospitals, particularly critical access providers, are not in compliance because of the tremendous amount of resource and time con-straints required to imple-ment the rule for their organizations. Ramifications for Non-Compliance For hospitals that vio- late the rule, CMS will request a corrective action plan. If a hospital remains non-compliant after sub-mitting an action plan, further penalties will be assessed which may include the assessment of civil monetary penalty of up to $300 per day . They may also publicize the penalty on a CMS web-site. CMS has said the penalty and publi-cization is likely to occur if the hospital fails to respond to its request to submit a corrective action plan. To boost compli-ance, CMS proposed increasing the min-imum fine for price transparency viola-tions to up to $2m per year. Hospitals with more than 30 beds in violation of the rule would pay $10 per day for each bed, up to $5,500 per day . Hospitals with 30 beds or fewer would continue to pay up to $300 per day . This would make the annual penalty at least $109,500, or as high as $2M a year for large hospitals that fail to make prices public. BDO Solution BDO has the technology , expertise, and resources to help your organization obtain compliance status as quickly as possible to avoid civil penalties and pub-lic humiliation.

Aside from the lasting personal toll, sonographer injury intensifies work-force shortages, which can cause unex-pected operational and financial chal-lenges for an ultrasound department. An injured sonographer's direct and indirect costs have been estimated at $771,500 for employers, which includes worker's compensation, the average cost of medical expenses, lost revenue and recruiting a new or tempo-rary sonographer. An injured sonographer can be detri- mental to institutions and clinics facing financial strain and lack of workforce readiness due to COVID-19, notes Jennifer Diaz, an Account Executive in the Equipment Sales Department of Med-Lab, an Advanced Partner of Siemens Healthineers in South Florida. One of the biggest causes of WRMSD is patient obesity . It is the most signifi-cant barrier to practicing ergonomic scanning techniques according to a recent publication on the ergonomic scanning techniques for sonographers. Although equipment position changes and modifications of work postures can reduce injury risk, one factor in which sonographers have no control over is patient body habitus. Sonographers often need to exert excessive transduc-er pressure while scanning to provide diagnostic-quality images of obese patients. \"A main key trend in ultrasound technology is a lack of diagnostic imag-ing quality for obese patients,\" says Diaz. \"This is due to a lack of depth in transducers, and it is leading to another key trend - high occurrence of injury for sonographers. Due to lack of depth, sonographers need to apply extra pres-sure to the abdominal area of obese patients, which leads to a high inci-dence of shoulder, hand, and wrist pain.\" Throughout a sonographer's career, the additional force required by tradi-tional transducers will have a cumula-tive negative impact on the arm and shoulder muscles. When this force is added to the muscle firing required to maintain arm abduction or excessive reach to the patient, the injury risk increases significantly . \"When speaking with ultrasound experts, we hear time and time again that as patients get larger, they are chal-lenged to get reliable and diagnostic images in an ergonomic and economic way ,\" says Diaz. \"The deeper the ultra-sound signal needs to penetrate; the more attenuation occurs resulting in image quality degradation and some-time results in an inconclusive image or repeat exams, sometimes in another modality .\" The ACUSON Sequoia, the flagship ultrasound system from Siemens Healthineers, is able to address this challenge. \"The ACUSON Sequoia seeks to solve this problem by powering the patented and industry exclusive Deep Abdominal Transducer (DAX), enabling unprecedented imaging of 40 cm depth through an advanced form of Multi-D beam formation,\" says Diaz. \"This level of penetration is a 30 per-cent improvement compared to con-ventional ultrasound. This novel approach enables the DAX to obtain clinically relevant information on high body mass index (BMI) patients when conventional transducer technology fails.\" In an ergonomic assessment by Sound Ergonomics, an analog pull-push force gauge by M&A Instruments, Inc., was used to provide a quantitative estimation of the amount of transducer pressure exerted while scanning. The DAX transducer required approximate-ly 70 percent less force than the con-ventional transducer on a large model patient. Using the ACUSON Sequoia with DAX transducer can help to reduce the transducer pressure and decrease muscle strain when scanning high BMI patients compared to conven-tional transducer technology . A patient's varied physical character- istics user dependent variabilities can negatively impact a clinician's abil-ity to deliver an accurate diagnosis. \"With the ACUSON Sequoia, Siemens Healthineers provides users with a solution to confidently image varying patient types, including those with high BMI,\" notes Diaz. \"In addi-tion, it enables powerful automation in each major mode to reduce user vari-ability and deliver high quality imaging with no user interaction. In order to address these challenges, ACUSON Sequoia was built from the ground up with a new architecture called Bio - Acoustic imaging technology; designed to deliver more image clarity and pene-tration than the conventional ultra-sound system.\" The ACUSON Sequoia is also equipped with AutoDoppler technolo-gy . Immediately upon freeze, Auto - Doppler will automatically optimize relevant Doppler parameters with no user interaction and all those parame-ters, including the scale, can be adjust-ed in post-processing. Finally , the ACUSON Sequoia also has the advantage of being early in its product lifecycle. According to Diaz, this helps to maximize return on investment as there will be a pathway of sustained innovation and upgrad-ability for years to come. \"It's about confident imaging in the most challenging cases,\" Diaz says. \"Our DAX transducer is just one exam-ple of how the ACUSON Sequoia can help deliver diagnostic confidence often limited by conventional technolo-gy . Another major focus is on reducing ultrasound variability . Powerful automation helps to reduce variability amongst users and improve image qual-ity with no user interaction. Remember, ease of use not only pertains to the con-trol panel, buttons and probe place-ment; but also, the ease and ergonomics of acquiring the image. ACUSON Sequoia ushers in a new era in 'ultra-sound ergonomics'.\" For more information, visit med-lab.com.

Both have been working through the COVID-19 pan-demic and therefore have needed to alter their approach to patient care. A recent Harvard Business Review article on this subject speaks about the incredible change that has occurred in the workplace for both new and veteran employees. The fundamentals which organizations took for granted as part of the culture (and the way business was done) in many areas has eroded. This is very true when it comes to patient care. It is nobody's fault, but let's face it, when folks needed even routine medical care over the past 18 months, the atmos-phere was just plain different. Between the masks, the temperature checks, the questionnaires, the social distancing, and everything else, even a trip to the dentist for a routine cleaning felt more like going in for a root canal. There is a big need to get back to basics when it comes to how we approach patients and their families. Our people either have trouble remembering a time before COVID-19 or were not even part of the team when it started. When you add the stress that they (and everyone) have been under, clearly there is an opportunity to reset things. So, meet as a team. This is nobody's fault but gain agreement on the path forward as it relates to creating alignment on the ground rules. What will be the plan to get everyone in a great place when it comes to execution and consistency? How can we get everybody trained (or retrained) the right way? The organization and health systems that deliver the best patient experience complimented by high staff engagement will win. Others will struggle or worse so make a commitment today to execute the fundamentals. Your patients and teams will thank you. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

BY JAY JUFFRE When It Comes T o Patient Care, Reorient Your T eamThe Battle Over T ransparency in Health Care Continues There is ample evidence to suggest the battle for health care transparency for consumers is going to be a long strug-gle. The Federal Government under the previous adminis-tration passed a series of regulations designed to make hos-pital and insurance carrier prices transparent to the public. The current administration is moving forward with imple-mentation. As health care consumers and patient advocates, we need to continue to support their efforts. The New York Times had a piece in August that discussed the data being made public for the first time as hospitals comply with the Federal Regulations. That data illustrates the wide variation in the price of services that insurance companies have been able to negotiate with hospitals for patients receiving the same services. The headline of the story was their inability to negotiate favorable rates with some hospitals and health systems that leave patients \"getting prices that are higher than they would if they pretended to have no coverage at all\". Given patients are footing the bill for a much larger percentage of the overall cost of care through increasing co-payments, consumers deserve to know how much they have to pay for health care services and whether their insurance company is negotiating favor-able terms on their behalf or not. Yet compliance with the hospital transparency rule that took effect in January has been extremely low and efforts remain afoot to prevent this sort of data from ever seeing the light of day . Bloomberg Law reported that 94.4% of hospitals haven't met one or more of the require- ments since the hospital transparency rule took effect January 1, 2021, according to a sur-vey conducted by Patient Rights Advocate. The Wall Street Journal also recently reported that \"the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association have filed separate lawsuits to block portions of a federal rule mandating that insurers and employers disclose prices they pay for health care services, the newest legal challenges to the health care price transparency rule.\" The significant impact of health care debt on American families is well documented. We should no longer tolerate the veil of secrecy that surrounds the price of health care services. A transparent marketplace will enhance competition, drive up quality , and lower costs for all to benefit.

BY FRASER COBBE 8 September 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News In a newly published study physician- scientists at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have shown that the flu vaccine may provide vital protection against COVID-19. The study , titled \"Exam ining the potential benefits of the influenza vac-cine against SARS-CoV-2: A retrospective cohort analysis of 74,754 patients,\" was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PLoS One. This was the largest study of its kind and analyzed deidenti-fied patient records from around the world strongly suggesting that the annu-al flu shot reduces the risks of stroke, sepsis, and DVT in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 who had been vaccinated against the flu were also significantly less likely to visit the emer-gency department and be admitted to the intensive care unit. The study was conducted using patient records from countries including the U.S., U.K., Germany , Italy , Israel and Singapore. The team screened de-identi-fied electronic health records on the TriNetX research database for more than 70 million patients to identify two groups of 37,377 patients. The two patient groups were then matched for factors that could influence their risk of susceptibility to severe COVID-19, including but not limited to age, gender, ethnicity , smoking, and health problems such as diabetes, obesity , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Members of the first study group had received the flu vaccine two weeks and six months prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Those in the second group also had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis but were not vaccinated against the flu. The incidence of 15 adverse outcomes (sepsis; strokes; deep vein thrombosis or DVT; admission; ICU admission; and death) within 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of testing positive for COVID-19 were then compared between the two groups. The analysis revealed that those who had not had the flu shot were significant-ly more likely (up to 20 percent more likely) to have been admitted to the ICU. They were also significantly more likely to visit the emergency department (up to 58 percent more likely), to develop sep-sis (up to 45 percent more likely), to have a stroke (up to 58 percent more likely) and a DVT (up to 40 percent more likely). The risk of death was not reduced. The investigators were also able to cal- culate how many COVID-19-positive patients would need to receive an influenza vaccine in order to avoid one adverse outcome. Notably , they found that only 176 patients needed to have received a flu vaccine in order to prevent one ED visit within 120 days of testing positively for COVID-19. Additionally , only 286 patients needed to have received their flu vaccine to prevent one case of sepsis, which is known to be the most expensive condition to treat in the U.S. healthcare system. Lastly , for every 440 patients who were up-to-date on their flu shot, one ICU admission was prevented. Although it isn't exactly known yet how the flu vaccine provides protection against COVID-19, most theories speculate that the flu shot may boost the innate immune system - general defenses we are born with that are not specialized to protect against any one specific illness. The results, said study authors, strongly suggest that the flu vaccine may protect against several severe effects of COVID-19. However, they strongly recommend that people receive COVID-19 vaccines as well their annual influenza vaccine. They add that more research, in the form of prospective randomized control trials, is needed to prove and better understand the possible link but, in the future, the flu shot could be used to help provide increased protection in countries where the COVID-19 vaccine is in short supply or even aid in the ongoing struggle against breakthrough cases in those indi-viduals already vaccinated against COVID-19.shot, then I'll get it.\" You see, in healthcare, rules and pro- cedures keep the patients and us safe. Any wishy-washy language is a red flag. Unfortunately , market interests have an impact here, too. What healthcare exec-utives and lay leaders are most worried about is losing employees during a time of staffing shortages and burn-out brought on by COVID-19-related exhaustion. That could compromise the fundamental mission of care. Furthermore, in south Florida, hospi- tals and medical practices compete for nurses, doctors, technologists, and social workers. The pandemic disruption has also created demand for medical assis-tants, environmental service techs, and patient transporters. These support workers are opting for jobs in the hospi-tality and food service industries, which have been compelled to escalate starting salaries. This human resource shortage has cre- ated a pervasive fear that mandating vac-cines will cause an exodus of staff to healthcare organizations that don't require them. Yet there is a huge corol-lary risk of the unvaccinated healthcare staff falling acutely ill and exacerbating both the staffing and capacity problems, which is already happening in Louisiana and other states. In addition, hospital care and elective procedures are already limited due to bed and staff shortages. KIDZ Medical Services, which serves children in seven South Florida coun-ties, implemented a mandatory vaccine policy in August. We believe this deci-sion reflects our commitment to our patients, respect for our dedicated - and stressed - caregivers, and our role in pro-tecting the public health. We join several local healthcare organizations and renowned institutions such as Yale-New Haven, Mayo Clinic, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and St. Jude in adopting this mandatory COVID-19 vaccine. There is a saying, often attributed to Winston Churchill, that describes how we as a culture behave, \"Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing, after they have exhausted all other possibilities.\" Antibacterial wipes, extended social isolation, masks, etc. We breathed a collective sigh of relief when the vaccines were created and proven effective without compromising safety . The fix was in - until it wasn't. We had - and have - a pathway to take the power away from this virus. As with most types of combat, allies win togeth-er. If we do not lead, the community will not have an example to follow. We need the whole healthcare village engaged and vaccinated to win the war on COVID-19.

South e available to r og grams ar l prUM Researchers Reveal that the Flu Shot Protects Against Severe Effects of COVID-19South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com September 2021 9Our brave frontline healthcare heroes continue to courageously respond to this significant surge in COVID patients in our hos-pitals. It is indescribable the level of stress and strain they have been under for more than 17 months and the heartbreaking losses they have experienced. Between increasing numbers of COVID patients and unusu-ally high patient volume of extremely ill non-COVID patients, our hospitals are working to maximize their available staff and beds, including the use of conference rooms and cafeterias. Many hospitals across the state currently sit at or above their previ-ous peak in COVID cases, sometimes caring for two to three times the number of COVID patients served during the July 2020 previous peak. As our hospitals fight to save every life possible, one thing about this current peak in the pandemic is absolutely clear, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Florida effectively prioritized the vac- cination of our senior citizens and those most vulnerable when the vaccines first arrived for the public. More than 80% of our seniors are vaccinated. Now the same urgency we demonstrated in pro-tecting the most vulnerable must be shown for vaccinating every eligible Floridian. While some Floridians cannot yet get vaccinated, too many of those who are eligible are opting out. This must change. Like polio and smallpox before it, COVID-19 is now a vaccine-preventable disease. While no vaccine is 100 percent effective at preventing illness, the COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be remarkably effective at preventing seri-ous illness, hospitalizations, and deaths. Nearly 100 percent of fully vaccinated individuals (99.99 percent) have not had a severe breakthrough case of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unfortunately , today , our hospitals and physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals are experiencing the all-too-familiar tragedy , stress, and strain of caring for an exponentially growing number of patients with COVID-19. As of August 15, more than 15,600 Floridians were hospitalized with COVID-19; our previous highest peak in July 2020 of confirmed COVID hospitalizations was slightly more than 10,000. Of those hospital-ized today , many are younger than 55. Almost all are unvaccinated. Unlike last year when COVID-19 disproportion-ately affected the elderly and those with chronic conditions, the current peak is affecting younger, healthy people who are at greatest risk not only of contracting COVID-19 but also of being hospitalized with severe illness. More than 78 percent of those age 60 and older are fully vaccinated, but among those age 30 and younger, the rates hover around 42 percent. This tragedy is avoidable. In contrast to the early months of vac- cine rollout, the vaccines now are widely available and easily accessible. Most pharmacies, clinics, and other health care sites have vaccines ready to admin-ister. And, the vaccines are free. In addi-tion, while temporary side effects, such as fever, chills, and injection site sore-ness, are common after vaccination, they do not appear to be long lasting or life threatening. This is in stark contrast to \"long COVID,\" a condition that afflicts a yet-unknown number of people and causes symptoms ranging from fatigue and joint pain to heart and lung damage that linger well after an individual is first infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccines are the gold standard of biomedical research, repre-senting collaboration and cooperation among scientists around the world who have worked for years on RNA vaccines (the technology behind the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines) and other types of coro-naviruses. The U.S. Food and Administration authorized the vaccines only after rigorous clinical trials. More than 40,000 Floridians have died of COVID-19. Vaccination can prevent more losses. The end to the pandemic and preventable suffering depends on all of us doing our part, rolling up our sleeves, and getting vaccinated.

Box 19268 Plantation FL 33318 Well, the \"real\" news is that many of the 346 Floridians that died last week from complications associated with COVID-19 infections, died needlessly as most were unvaccinated. Included in this number is one child under the age of 16. Their life ended even before they had a chance to make their mark. Do you really think this is a joke and that you are not susceptible? That your kids aren't susceptible? It is time to change the channel you have been listening to! Recently , about 75 physicians gathered in Palm Beach County to plead with residents in Palm Beach and the surrounding areas to get vaccinated. What ulte-rior motive will the internet doctors come up with to mute those physicians' pleas? Here are the Palm Beach County physicians' motives. They are exhausted, their resources are running low , and 90 percent of the COVID-19 patients they are seeing, probably wouldn't be in the hospital at all if they had been vaccinated. The physicians can't understand the stupidity . You want graphic, \"It is impacting the lungs quicker. It's eating away at the lungs. It's causing more problems. These people are dying. It's real, it's happening, and the only way we know to prevent it is to get vaccinated,\" said Ahmen Elhaddad, the ICU medical director at Jupiter Medical Center. In other articles, this virus is reportedly simultaneously attacking all five lobes in the lung, nothing is spared. We can add thousands of infusion chairs to administer monoclonal antibody treatments to try and minimize the symptoms of COVID-19, but, that is treatment after the fact. Hasn't the horse already left the barn before we shut the doors? What about preventing or limiting your symptoms by getting vaccinated? It is time to set aside the polarizing politics of medical treatment and listen to the educated and experienced medical community . They are begging you to get vaccinated. The last-ditch treatment option for COVID-19 patients, when other treatment options fail, is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This treatment requires the removal of your blood, cleaning it of carbon dioxide, oxygenating it, and then bring-ing it up to body temperature before it is added back to your circulatory system. Science is now showing greater success for this treatment if it is started earlier in the disease process. Sadly , initially seen as a last resort, COVID-19 patients were usually already in deep trouble when a referral was made to begin this treat-ment. To let you know , as of late August, there were no ECMO machines available in the state of Florida! The ones we have are caring for patients and there are waiting lists for the machines when they become available. A better decision, because COVID-19 vaccines are plentiful, is to get vaccinat- ed and avoid the desperate search for availability across the U.S. P .S., there aren't any available in the contiguous states of Georgia or Alabama either. Think about this, you mistakenly decide not to get vaccinated or to get your loved ones vac-cinated and now they have to be flown thousands of miles away , to another state with no family , to get care. Does that make sense to you? What was your reason again? The Pfizer vaccine has received full approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One more common excuse has fallen by the wayside, and it is no longer an excuse. In fact, the FDA stated that they have never had as much data upon which to judge a vaccine's safety . No joke, just the truth! Please, go and get vaccinated today! Jaime CaldwellA message from our President You Still Think This COVID-19 Thing Is a Joke?

Marcella Gravalese South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com September 2021 13Let's Connect: ACHE of South Florida Spotlight BY VANESSA ORR Kristen Palanza knows the impor- tance of finding common ground between different groups of healthcare professionals. As the vice president of development for Park Shore Drug Inc., a privately owned long-term care pharmacy , she straddles the line between internal pharmacy operations and external client affairs. As a board member of the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) for the past nine years, she also understands how inter-connected every aspect of the health-care field is. \"I love working with the team at the pharmacy while also serving as the out-ward-facing person for nurses and own-ers of long-term care facilities,\" she explained. \"My job is to make things better and easier for our clients, and in this role, I also serve as a patient advo-cate. \"The long-term facilities look out for their residents, many of whom can't speak for themselves, and we do, too,\" she continued, noting that many of the people they serve have intellectual or developmental disabilities. \"That's why reducing medication errors is one of our top priorities; everything we do is in the best interest of the residents.\" Palanza earned her undergraduate degree in speech pathology at the University of Florida and her master's in Healthcare Administration from Florida Atlantic University . \"I always knew that I wanted to serve in a healthcare capacity but learned through a series of different internships that my skill set was much better suited for an administrative role\u2014my goal is to eliminate obstacles for the internal team in order to enable our best exter-nal, patient-centric performance,\" she said. One example of this is a technician training program that Park Shore recently initiated for employees to ensure appropriate staffing ratios. \"Finding the right people with appro-priate certifications in this COVID envi-ronment is excruciating,\" said Palanza of the positions that require staff to pay to attend classes to receive certification. \"We decided to eliminate that obsta- cle by registering our own technicians and offering our own educational pro-gram,\" she added. \"Once they graduate, they can file for technician license reg-istration within the state of Florida and work within the full scope of their new license. It's been extremely beneficial.\" Palanza joined ACHE while finishing her master's degree and believes that it has helped her excel in her position. \"My ACHE membership is the most valuable thing I've ever done,\" she said. \"For me, it's not about career advance-ment\u2014it's about learning. My ACHE colleagues make me a better leader. \"When I first joined ACHE, it was more hospital-centric/hospital-driven, so people wondered why a long-term care pharmacy would want to be a part,\" she added. \"But healthcare is more interconnected than it appears\u2014every single facet, from hospitals to home care to acute care settings\u2014depends on each other. So knowing about what other operations are doing is essential to us doing our best job.\" She added that being aware of what's happening in the larger healthcare pic-ture can help companies stay ahead of the pack. \"One of the things that keeps us on our toes is the intensely competi-tive landscape in Florida; if you're not on the cusp of technological advance-ment, customer service and best clinical practices, you stand to lose,\" she said. \"We are constantly motivated to improve\u2014there is no snooze button at Park Shore,\" she added. \"And working with other dynamic leaders helps keep us at our best.\" ACHE of South Florida Member Spotlight: Kristen Palanza, Vice President, Development Park Shore Drug Inc. Kristen Palanza Michael Greco Receives AANA's 42nd Annual Helen Lamb Outstanding Educator Award The American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA) presented Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) Michael Greco, PhD, DNP , CRNA, with the 42nd Annual Helen Lamb Outstanding Educator Award during its 2021 Virtual Congress. The Helen Lamb Outstanding Educator Award, established in 1980, is presented to a CRNA who has made a significant contri-bution to the education of nurse anesthetists. The award recognizes the indi-vidual's commitment to the profession of nurse anesthesia and to the advance-ment of educational standards that further the art and science of anesthesiology and result in high-quality patient care. Greco is the founding program director at the Hofstra University-Hofstra- Northwell graduate program in nurse anesthesia in Hempstead, NY. In this position, he developed the Doctor of Nursing Practice, Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner/Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program. It is the first and only program in the United States preparing Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNPs) to become dual-certified as CRNAs and Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioners (AGACNPs), providing the educational back-ground for them to function at the highest level in clinical practice and increas-ing access to care and cost-saving to healthcare facilities. The inaugural cohort will be starting in September 2021. Prior to starting that program, he served for many years as program director of the nurse anesthesia graduate program at Columbia University School of Nursing in New York. Greco also is a reviewer for accreditation for CRNA pro-grams through the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs, and he chaired the AANA Professional Development Committee from 2018-2020. He practices clinically at Northwell Health in New York, where he is assistant vice president for System Nurse Anesthesia Services. Greco is a graduate with a PhD in nursing from Barry University in Miami Shores, FL. He earned a Doctor of Nursing Practice from the University of Alabama in T uscaloosa and completed his master's degree in nurse anesthesia at SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn. He received a bachelor's degree in nursing from Niagara University in Niagara Falls, NY. Delray Medical Center Is the First Hospital in South Palm Beach County to Use the CORI Surgical System for Knee Replacement Surgery Delray Medical Center is the first hospital in South Palm Beach County to use the CORI Surgical System for knee replace-ment surgery . Dr. Curtis Kephart is the first orthopedic surgeon to use this new technology at the hospital. The CORI Surgical System uses handheld robotics-assisted technology that helps the surgeon plan and perform the procedure. It also gives surgeons a three-dimensional view to help finalize and verify the selection of the knee implant and create a plan for surgery without the need for either a CT scan or MRI. Robotics-assisted knee replace- ment surgery using the CORI TM Surgical System can lead to the following patient benefits: \u0081 Quicker, smoother recovery \u0081 Regain function faster and return home sooner \u0081 A unique 3D digital model to get a surgical plan customized to the patients' unique anatomy . The surgeon can perform the procedure more accurately than tradi-tional knee replacement surgery . \u0081 A natural fit: Using these technologies patients can keep more of their natural bone and ligaments, including the ACL. 6 That helps maintain more of a natural rhythm and step. \u0081 A wide selection: The surgeon is able to choose from the widest selection of implants available, so implants can be precision-matched to feel more like a patient's own knee. E-mail Your Editorial Submissions to editorial@southfloridahospitalnews.com 14 September 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsConstruction for healthcare facilities must be well-thought out and planned, and then exe-cuted per the plan. With the advent of COVID-19, it's even more critical to follow strict guidelines when it comes to con-struction within an existing healthcare facility . One way to ensure that con- struction design adheres to the strict policies and needs of a healthcare environment is the use of an infection control risk assessment (ICRA) at the begin-ning of a project. These types of assessments started over 50 years ago and have become even more important to deal with the challenges of COVID-19. COVID-19 is most easily transmitted via air droplets, as well as on surfaces. This means a wide range of precautions and steps need to be taken when it comes to construction within existing healthcare facility . Interventions to prevent disease trans- mission may include: \u0081 Barriers, such as plexiglass dividers, at building entry points and at various com-munication points with patients. \u0081 Air filtration systems that address the airflow in HVAC sys- tems, to capture and eliminate airborne path - ogens, \u0081 Isolating/pressuriz- ing specific areas so that untreated air doesn't mix with clean/treated air. Health Facilities Man - age ment magazine out- lines strict protocols for construction design requirements that in - cludes addressing: \u0081 the number, loca- tion, and type of air- borne infection isolation and protective environment rooms needed \u0081 special HVAC needs \u0081 water and plumbing systems Other health risks to be addressed dur- ing construction include: \u0081 dust and debris (compromising the air quality) \u0081 the circulation of airborne microbes or pathogen through the ventilation system \u0081 water contamination \u0081 waste reservoirs \u0081 dustproof barriers \u0081 the transportation of waste \u0081 contaminated workers If an ICRA (infection control risk assess- ment) is created by a healthcare facility , prior to construction work, construction-related requirements need to be specified and included into the contract documents so they can be reviewed, prepared for, and implemented during construction. Facility protocols outlined by the Facility Guidelines Institute include the following considerations before starting a healthcare construction project: \u0081 Patient placement and relocation plans \u0081 Protection from airborne contami- nants and pathogens (protective meas-ures, such as barriers) \u0081 Demolition \u0081 Emergencies (e.g., planned and unplanned utility outages and evacua-tion). \u0081 Phasing or temporary provisions for construction or modification of HVAC and water systems \u0081 Training for staff, visitors, and con- struction personnel \u0081 Construction worker procedures and protocols such as: - construction worker routes - elevator use (personnel and materials) - cleanup and debris - bathroom and food facility use CDC Guidelines for the construction industry also include the following proto-cols: Wearing cloth face coverings in areas - such as healthcare facilities - where there is significant community-based transmission of COVID-19. Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, such as shared tools, machines, vehicles and other equipment, as well as handrails, ladders, doorknobs, and portable toilets. Cleaning and disin-fecting should occur within shifts as well as: \u0081 at the beginning and end of every shift \u0081 after anyone uses a vehicle, tools, or a workstation Practicing proper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure for COVID-19. With the appropriate hand hygiene practices, it's not necessary to wear gloves to protect from COVID-19 infection. When possible, workers should wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol. Key times to clean hands include: \u0081 Before and after work shifts and breaks \u0081 After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing \u0081 After using the restroom \u0081 Before eating and before and after preparing food \u0081 After touching objects handled by coworkers, such as tools and equipment \u0081 Before putting on and after taking off work gloves \u0081 After putting on, touching, or remov- ing cloth face coverings \u0081 Before putting eye or face protection (safety glasses, goggles, etc.) Finally , it's important that construction workers don't touch their eyes, nose, or mouth at work, if possible. And that they use tissues when coughing, sneezing, or touching their face, with used tissues thrown in the trash and hands washed or sanitized. In sum, it's critical that a wide variety of mitigating considerations and procedures take place while doing any construction within a healthcare facility , especially while COVID-19 and its variants are being transmitted in the local area.

Call (954) 229-2006, Facilities During COVID-19 BY DEBORAH DEIOMA DANTO, MBA, LEED AP , CGC HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com September Design HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION, DESIGN & FACILITY PLANNING BY DANIEL CASCIATO Today , hospitals and other healthcare facilities in South Florida are being built to survive the strongest hurricanes. With the threat of hurri- canes, along with the accompanying winds, flooding, and systemic ero-sion, Charles Michelson, AIA ACHA LEED AP , President of Saltz Michelson Architects in Fort Lauderdale, FL, an architect of both new hospital projects and renovations, stresses that the design community is always prepared to design and engineer the proper solutions in the right loca-tions. \"We are trained professionals prepared to respond to the need and protect the medical facilities within our communi-ties,\" he says. \"There has been ongoing work for years hardening existing med-ical facilities to the essential service crite-ria outlined in the building code. Recent FEMA money availability has reinvigo-rated this effort to protect the buildings through impact windows and doors, structural grills and louvers and the protection of our infrastructure; gen-erators; chiller plants and oxygen tank farms.\" Building according to Florida code will allow hospitals to withstand hurricane strength winds of 185 miles per hour. While hurricanes are a common occurrence in South Florida, Michelson notes that structural reinforcement is only one part of the protection formula for the protec-tion of medical facilities. \"Protection includes the redundancy of all systems; alternate sources of power before the generators kick on, as well as multiple forms of communication,\" he says. \"For existing buildings that fall below new flood criteria, there are water-proofing and opening protections that can be added to a building and site to protect against flooding. Many new prod-ucts are on the market over the past few years to respond to this need.\" One of the new design/building trends that is playing an important role in build-ing hurricane-resistant buildings is that they are being constructed at a higher elevation to avoid any flooding issues. \"In addition, all infrastructure is con- structed well above flood criteria, so that not only is the structure protected, all systems that run the building are elevat-ed; making them safe and secure as well,\" adds Michelson. \"Part of the site considerations include the access to the hospital since a protected building that the public can't get to in an emergency won't provide the necessary services it was designed to provide the public.\" Following devastating hurricane dam- ages, there's always talk of improving the resiliency of facilities in an effort to pro-tect them from increasingly damaging storms. In the wake of recent hurricanes, this is an issue on the minds of just about everybody who lives in a hurricane-prone area such as South Florida. Michelson says that some of the les- sons learned over time demonstrated the importance of protecting ancillary sys-tems that allow the hospitals to function. \"When the power goes down, hospitals have generators, but when the city utili-ties go down, how do you run a chiller plan when the city is no longer providing water?\" he says. \"What's the plan when the city sewer plan stops for two or three days?\" Since more companies now want to build with resilient design in mind, col-laboration with subcontractors and other vendors, who may not have experience with resilient design, becomes even more important. \"Construction is a team activity ,\" says Michelson. \"When new systems are being designed and constructed, design-ers, contractors, owners, vendors, and industry representatives work together to analyze and respond to each unique situ-ation. No two medical facilities are alike and as such, there are no cookie cutter designs that take care of every unique condition. We remained informed and adaptable to create new and updated solutions to our environmental issues.\" For more information, visit www.saltzmichelson.com.

The medical team also provides caregiver education so that families feel confident caring for a loved one at home. A hospice social worker, chaplain, and bereavement specialist provide emo-tional and spiritual support to families and caregivers. The Medicare hospice benefit covers up to 100% of the costs of care related to a patient's Alzheimer's/dementia diagnosis. It also delivers comfort-focused medications and supplies, including hospital beds, bedside commodes, and over-bed tables, to the patient and family . With nearly 70% of Americans saying they would prefer to die at home (2017 Kaiser Family Foundation survey), hospice care for Alzheimer's/dementia honors patients' wishes and provides the resources their families and caregivers need to honor those wishes. Hospice can have a profound impact Studies show that hospice for Alzheimer's/dementia patients leads to: \u0081 50% reduction in hospitalizations; fewer care transitions near the end of life \u0081 Increased satisfaction with care \u0081 Improved pain and symptom management \u0081 Less depression/anxiety and improved overall health for patients' families and caregivers (Mitchell, S., et al. (2009); Shega, J., et al. (2008)) Studies also show that hospice care can prevent costly , unnecessary , or unwanted care transitions in a patient's final months: fewer admissions to the emergency depart-ment, intensive care unit, or a skilled-care facility . A 2017 study (Wang, S., et al.) found that 80% of Medicare beneficiaries 66 and older experienced at least one healthcare transition in the last six months of life; 33% had four or more disruptive transitions. Look for signs and symptoms of hospice eligibility Hospice should be considered if a patient spends more than 50% of their time in bed, or if family members are considering ordering a hospital bed at home. Clinically , patients with Alzheimer's or dementia are eligible for hospice if these two factors are present: \u0081 Functional disability in three of six activities of daily living \u0081 Any one of these complications: pneumonia, pyelonephritis/urinary tract infec- tion, sepsis, febrile episode, difficulty eating or swallowing, poor nutritional status, feeding tube decision, pressure sores, hip fracture, delirium at time of hospital dis-charge, or recurrent hospitalization for disease-related complications. Clinicians can play an important role in decision-making by initiating advance care planning conversations with patients and their families with a few simple questions early in the disease: \u0081 What do you understand about your loved one's prognosis? \u0081 What does a good day look like? \u0081 What are your/your loved one's preferences for care as the end of life approaches? \u0081 Are you interested in healthcare that meets those goals?

Investing in quality video production is a must to ensure you create powerful and compelling videos. The good news is, you don't need to hire a video pro- duction team in-house because we know that will cost you more money . Instead, you can entrust the task to a reliable video production company . If it's your first time working with a video production company , don't worry; we can help you navigate this brand-new process for you. Here's a quick guide on how to find the right video production company to work with. 1. Make Sure They Understand the Video's Purpose The first thing to do is to be clear about the purpose of your video content. Who is it for? What results do you want to get from it? Identify the answers to these ques-tions and discuss them with a potential video production company . From there, you can determine if the company does understand the purpose of your video content. 2. Get to Know the Equipment They Use One of the perks of hiring a video production company is that they have the equipment to support it. However, not all companies have the same equipment. A professional video production company has access to drones, camera people, spe-cialty editors, lighting equipment, audio, and high-quality cameras. When doing your initial interview , don't hesitate to ask the types of equipment they will use for your project. 3. Ask for Their Portfolio An effective way to determine if the video production company is a good choice is to view their portfolio. Here you will see the brands they've worked with. Consider it a \"green\" flag when the company has worked with huge brands. That only means they have enough experience to move forward with your project and help you achieve your expected outcome. 4. Ask About Their Insurance Coverage Video production companies need to carry specific insurance policies. At the very least, there needs to be an existing commercial general liability coverage of at least a million dollars. This is crucial, especially when drones are involved. The compa-ny's insurance coverage protects you as well. 5. Determine If They Have a Physical Studio A video production company , as much as possible, should have a studio that you can visit. Even if you plan to shoot outdoors for the video, being able to visit the stu-dio or office is great for proper assessment. Conclusion Taking the time to find the right video production company is crucial, especially if it's your first time. It's likely you need a company you can work for on a long-term basis; therefore, it only makes sense to ensure you find the right one for you. Use these tips to help you find the best video company that will suit your needs. The ini-tial consultation is crucial as it will help you understand if the company is the right fit for you.

A year ago, Dr. Stewart and his staff were making adjustments to place the campus in a good position during the pandemic. He explained they worked on how to get students caught up on clinical rotation. \"A year ago, our nursing stu-dents were doing everything virtually . The governor of Florida had approved for all their clinicals to be virtual so we purchased a software package that allowed us to do online clinical rotations. It's been really great. But now , the gover-nor's order ended, so all of my nursing students have to be back on campus this fall.\" Dr. Stewart said the College also con- tinues using a new teaching modality called MDC Live that started this past year and provides for virtual teaching. He described it as a flexible environment where the class is scheduled for a specific time, and the student can either be in the classroom or be virtual with their faculty . He also talked about two new pro- grams that are starting at the school. One is a surgical technology Associate in Science degree that he said has been in the making for a couple of years. \"I've met with leadership at several hospitals and they tell me how desperate they are for surgical technicians. It's a two-year degree and it's going to be one of our most popular programs in the fall.\" Dr. Stewart said the technician is essential to executing a successful surgery - they maintain a sterile field, and handle all the equipment, instruments, supplies, med-ications, and anything else a physician needs during a surgical procedure. \"They really play a vital role.\" The second program is a one-year cer- tificate to become a central sterile proces-sor, which is a stackable credential for the surgical technician degree. \"Those are the individuals who clean the instru-ments, so they can start as a central ster-ile processor and work their way up. There's just as much need for that, and some students may want to start in that position and gain confidence before they get into surgical technician,\" he said. With all of this in place, Dr. Stewart said not only is the overall application pool up 81%, but even more impressive is that the quality of the pool is also up. In past years, about half of the applica-tions didn't meet qualifications or weren't ready to be taken into the pro-gram, whereas this year more than 80% of the pool could be selected. \"You can tell we have a really strong group of stu-dents who will start here in the fall.\" Unfortunately , as is happening every- where, the College may be facing a new challenge in coming months: the delta variant of the coronavirus. Dr. Stewart said that as part of the planning process, \"We're trying to be creative on how to deal with this delta variant. We're still going to be open 100%, but we're going to be careful to follow the CDC guide-lines.\" In addition, he said that certain hospitals have a policy requiring all stu-dents in their clinical rotations to be vac-cinated. Baptist and Jackson Health System have both expressed how valuable the students are. \"Both told us that when the pandemic happened, they weren't sure what to do, so they took no students on the hospital campus,\" Dr. Stewart said. They realized, though, that the students do many things that allow the hospital employees to work in other areas. \"The pandemic can be a strategic teaching opportunity , and I think we all learned a lot. I don't think we're going to follow the same traditions that we did with this one, by saying the doors are closed. I think the hospitals have realized how valuable our students can be to support the network of the hospitals.\" In summarizing the past year, Dr. Stewart said, \"The campus is looking really strong for fall; I think it's an excit-ing time. People who want to help are able to see the medical field as a great opportunity , and jobs are plentiful. \"I think we figured it out pretty well.\" For more information, call (305) 237-4141 or visit mdc.edu.

Baccalaureate nursing degrees like Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) programs are designed to provide students with a solid educational foundation that pre-pares individuals for entry into the nursing profession. Graduates are able to incorporate the concepts of caring, com-munication, critical thinking, professionalism, and holism to provide care for individuals, families and communities. The comprehensive theoretical and clinical practice components aim to allow BSN graduates to make a smooth transition into profes-sional nursing practice. Nursing program graduates are encour-aged to continue the educational process and are prepared for the challenges of graduate study (SouthUniversity .edu, 2021). At South University , West Palm Beach, the BSN degree pro- gram is designed for the non-registered nursing student. Students may complete prerequisite courses in as few as six quarters and then apply for admission to the nursing program, which is taught over seven quarters. The program allows highly motivated full-time students to complete the program of study in nursing in a concentrated period of time. After successful completion of the nursing program, the graduate must pass the National Council Licensure Examination Registered Nurse (NCLEX-RN) in order to obtain licensure and begin practice as a registered nurse. Dr. Priscilla Bartolone has been the South University BSN Program Director for the past twenty years. She has continually witnessed hundreds of nursing graduates with something \"special\" to offer. The following individuals are two examples of outstand-ing nursing graduates practicing nursing in Palm Beach County . Coincidentally , both of these nurses opted to follow the career path of their mothers. Geena Singh, MSN, RN, graduated from the South University , West Palm Beach with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 2007 and from the Master of Science in Nursing program in 2013. Geena has worked extensively in hospitals throughout Palm Beach County and credits her education at South University with preparing her to think critically , solve problems, make appropriate clinical decisions and nursing judgements when caring for acutely and critically ill patients. Singh added that her education taught her to integrate caring, cultural sensitivity and to view patients holistically while providing patient-centered care. While working as a staff RN in var-ious hospitals, Geena worked with South University nursing students and realized her passion for teaching. This led to her being hired as Clinical Faculty where she continues to inspire students with her compassion, competence, dedication and pro- fessionalism. Geena believes that nursing is a \"work of the heart\". She added, \"I pride myself on the philosophy that helping my com- munity at the most vulnerable times is a privilege.\" Bradly Bartlett, BSN, RN, graduated from South Uni - versity , West Palm Beach with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in June 2020. Bradly started his career in healthcare as a Paramedic but realized that he wanted to do more. Immediately upon graduation, Brad started to work on a high acuity nursing unit in Palm Beach County . Sharing his perspective of nursing education, Mr. Bartlett said, \"Early on in the program the basic pillars of Nursing were pounded in our heads and built upon to make us the best nurses we could possibly be. The clinical rotations that perfectly coincided with what we were learning in lecture solidified in our minds the skills necessary to care for our patients. As a new grad I consistently get compliments on a daily basis on how great my skills are. I can only attribute this to South University and the ability of their staff to not just teach us to be nurses but for us to critically think on our patient's behalf. I am forever grateful to South University and its staff for teaching me how to be the best nurse I can be.\" For more information, visit www.southuniversity.edu.

Physical deconditioning and weakening of the upper limbs make essential daily activities such as wheelchair propulsion and body transfers more difficult to perform, thus challenging the activity and independence that persons with physical disabilities require throughout their lives. During the past few decades, attention has also focused on so-called cardiometabol- ic risk factors, including five critical health hazards: overweight/obesity , insulin resistance, hypertension, and lipid abnormalities. Evidence now suggests that these health risks appear soon after discharge from initial rehabilitation, tend to cluster, and in doing so represent more severe health hazards. They are also more challenging for stakeholders with SCI/D, their caregivers, and health care professionals to manage within the first year of living with a SCI/D and after that throughout their lifespans. Current health guidelines designed for persons with SCI/D all recommend incorporating physical activity to a level per-mitted by their ability . Outdoor exercise is an option to fulfill this need. However, it may expose the individual to tempera-ture extremes and uneven rolling surfaces that risk a fall from the wheelchair and ensuing injury . Thus, recent evidence sug-gests that home-based exercise is preferred for those with SCI. Home-based exercise also circumvents exercise barriers involv-ing transportation, lack of physical access, and exercising in facilities that serve, have staff trained for, and use equipment designed for persons without a disability . Equipment that satisfies the broad health needs of persons with SCI/D is challenging to find. Selected specialized exercise systems have used surface electrical stimulation to initiate the contraction of paralyzed muscles located below the injury level. These muscle contractions can be sequenced under microprocessor control to create purposeful movement such as cycling, although generally with poor motor efficiency and coordination. These electrically stimulated devices often exclude persons with injuries below the T10 spinal level and require special medical clearance and ongoing supplies such as electrodes and wire leads. Those with injuries and disorders that spare their sensation often find the electrical current uncomfortable, if not painful. While generally considered safe for home use, there is a need for electrode placement before each session. Risks of use include lower extremity fracture or bouts of autonomic dysreflexia. Importantly , there is limited transfer of lower extremity electrically stimulated exercise to benefit upper limb conditioning. It has long been clear that vol-untary contractions of muscles above the injury level result in higher physical conditioning levels, and better risk reduction for cardiometabolic disease. The arm crank ergometer has been a longstanding staple of upper extremity exercise for those with SCI/D. Essentially a table or platform mounted arm cycle, the device typically uses a rudimentary forward propulsion motion against resistance, with the upper limbs propelling the device while 180 degrees out of phase with one another. Few arm crank devices allow adjustment of the axis of rotation, meaning there is one set length for motion. Even fewer devices allow reverse propulsion against resistance. The continuous forward cranking imposes imbalanced forces that condition and tightens the anterior shoulder and chest while not similarly benefitting the posterior shoulder. The imbalance of the anterior and posterior shoulder actions may represent a cause of shoulder pain for persons with SCI/D. As the upper limbs of persons with SCI/D are essential for maintaining daily activities, the pain caused by cycle ergometry may exceed the benefit of physical conditioning. To meet the complex needs of upper extremity conditioning without the hazards imposed by standard arm ergometry , the newly upgraded and technologically advanced Vitaglide better serves as an exercise mode after SCI/D. The device is a recipro-cating ergometer with the arms moving near horizontally instead of in a cyclical pattern. The movement of the limbs are balanced between a forward pushing motion on one side of the body and a pulling action on the other side. In this way , the device maintains the anterior and posterior muscle balance for conditioning of the chest, shoulders, and back. Its features also permit synchronous rowing where both limbs move together in the same forward and backward direction. Unlike a cycling ergometer, the resistance for each arm can be set independently and spans work intensities that will develop both endurance and strength. The side arms allow the user to determine their preferred range of exercise motion instead of the device. The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami Health System has used the Vitaglide for several years as part of our comprehensive SCI/D lifestyle program and has been preferred by our program participants, so much so that they seldom use our cycle ergometers. The individualized resistance adjustment permits us to select optimum exercise intensities when the strength and endurance of the arms may be unequal. We have also found it easier to customize exercise programs and maintain records of performance incorporating time and work performed. Our ultimate goal is to encourage health-sustaining physical activity after SCI/D without injury . Dr. Mark S. Nash is Associate Scientific Director for Research, Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.Voluntary Exercise after Spinal Cord Injuries: Equipment and Process that Develops and Sustains Fitness and Health BY MARK S. NASH, PH.D., FACSM, FASIA \"To meet the complex needs of upper extremity conditioning with-out the hazards imposed by standard arm ergometry, the newly upgraded and technologically advanced Vitaglide better serves as an exercise mode after SCI/D.\" 24 September 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsHealth Care District of Palm Beach County Launches \"Connect PBC\" and Integrates Epic Electronic Health Record System for Patients The Health Care District of Palm Beach County has launched a premier Epic electronic health record (EHR) system that now links thousands of primary care clinic and rural hospi-tal patients to a single, shared platform for quality , integrated care. The new \"Connect PBC\" patient portal ensures patients within the Health Care District's safety net system, many who are under-served, have convenient and secure digital access to their health information. \"Our new Epic-based integrated platform pro-vides best-in-class technol-ogy to meet the needs of our patients, many of whom have complex con-ditions and find it chal-lenging to navigate the healthcare delivery sys-tem,\" said Belma Andri , M.D., MPH, the Health Care District's Chief Medical Officer. \"With Epic, our providers now have a more complete picture of their patients' health across the continuum of care right at their fingertips.\" After going live on July 1st, 2021, the new software now serves the more than 50,000 unique C. L. Brumback Primary Care Clinics' patients at nine locations in communities of need, as well as over 27,000 patients a year at Lakeside Medical Center, the Health Care District's rural, acute-care teaching hospital in Belle Glade. The Epic system provides medical staff with immediate access to test results, the abil-ity to place orders remotely and seamlessly communicate with other providers and Health Care District departments. The EHR system also helps to promote population health by identifying health trends, which can lead to initiatives that improve the overall health of the community . \"A consolidated patient medical record across clinical areas allows informed deci- sions to be made more quickly and efficiently ,\" said Karen A. Harris, the Health Care District's VP of Field Operations. \"Epic is a scalable system that allows us to effective-ly manage our volume of patient care across our programs, provide continuity of care, reduce duplication, and improve patient outcomes for years to come.\" Hollywood-based Memorial Healthcare System extended its clinical, professional and technical integration to the Health Care District through its strategic Epic Connect program, which extends Epic EHR software with community physicians and other hospitals. The year-long implementation process in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic was a monumental achievement. The Epic Community Connect project team worked virtually to design and build applications, conduct test-ing and training, and roll out the technology on schedule. \"Memorial Healthcare System and the Health Care District of Palm Beach County are committed to maintaining the health and well-being of our communities by empowering physicians and patients with all the resources required to proactively address medical issues in the context of population health through an optimal infra-structure that helps elevate the delivery of care,\" said Jeff Sturman, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, Memorial Healthcare System. \"A partnership through Epic Connect, which Memorial offers, brings all healthcare providers - hos-pitals, community physicians and other points of care - into a single, comprehensive longitudinal patient record that stimulates joint collaboration, significantly benefit-ing the hosting organization, community physicians who are part of the extended network, and especially the patients they serve.\" Holy Cross Health Announces OB/GYN Hospitalist Program To continue bringing consistent care to patients in the hospital, Holy Cross Health in Fort Lauderdale has introduced an OB/GYN hospitalist program, the only hospital in Broward County to have a certified Ob Hospitalist team, partnering with Ob Hospitalist Group, the industry's largest dedicated OB/GYN hospitalist provider. As part of the program, board certified OB/GYN physicians are immediately avail- able on-site 24 hours a day , 365 days a year to focus on providing consistent care, as well as emergent care to those arriving in labor and delivery . The mission is to elevate the standard of care by ensuring expectant mothers are evaluated and treated by a physician regardless of time of day , complication or circumstance. The OB-GYN hospitalist program is staffed with an experienced team of board-cer- tified obstetricians and gynecologists on-site at Holy Cross Health 24 hours a day , 7-days a week. The patient's physician will make sure that the OB/GYN hospitalist on-site has all patient medical records. In the event the patient's physician is unavailable, an OB/GYN hospitalist has access to the patient's medical records and will be there to care for her, address any evolving issues and provide the mother and baby with a safe delivery . The hospitalist team at Holy Cross is highly skilled in a variety of different delivery techniques and are required to maintain high levels of clinical performance and professional standards. They have additional training in neonatal resuscitation, advanced cardiac life support and OB emergency care and are also available for consultations in the hospital and for emergency care in the Emergency Department. Broward Health First U.S. Hospital System Using Innovative VirtaMed Laparoscopic Simulator Broward Health Medical Center, home to the Broward Health Graduate Medical Education Simulation Lab in Fort. Lauderdale, FL, has become the first United States medical institution to receive the VirtaMed LaparoS surgical training simulator. This mixed reality laparoscopic simulator pro-vides resident doctors with a simulated environment to prepare for clinical practice safely and efficiently . Broward Health will use the LaparoS for general sur-gery training with an emphasis on patient safety . First installed in June 2021, the LaparoS has left an impression on residents and professors alike. \"We chose the LaparoS because if offers our residents a more realistic simulation of what they will encounter in the operating room,\" said Dr. Ivan Puente, General Surgery Program Director at Broward Health Medical Center.\"We feel very strongly that this will not only enhance their skill development and also contribute to patient safety\" The LaparoS training simulator is from VirtaMed, the world leader in medical sim- ulation training. In contrast to other forms of medical training with simulators, LaparoS training modules capture the whole procedural preparation, including posi-tioning of the patient and placement of tools. The simulator offers real-time learning in the form of haptic feedback, complication training and guided procedures. \"Simulation is a great way to enhance medical skills,\" says Kimberly Mazili, Business Development Manager for VirtaMed. \"After years of with success with our orthopaedics simulator the next logical step was for Broward to be the first to get our new LaparoS so they could exetend the capacity of their simulation center and their residency programs.\" Broward Health has a long history of using simulation to train its next generation of surgeons. Medical students at Broward Health Medical Center have access to a medical skills simulation lab with a variety of simulators, including the VirtaMed ArthroS simulator for arthroscopic skills training. The addition of the LaparoS expands the resources available for skills development in a risk-free training environ-ment.What's New... What's New... What's New... Janet D.

The TCAR procedure is suit-ed for patients who are at a higher risk of surgical complications due to age, medical co-morbidities, or anatomical issues. Snapshots Medical Towers and the Park Plaza West garage on the Jackson Memorial campus. This mandate will continue throughout all risk levels until the end of the pan-demic period. Fit-tested N95s will be provided by Jackson. \u0081 In order to avoid the risk of spread- ing this highly contagious virus when eating or drinking - and potentially pass-ing it on to patients - unvaccinated employees and physicians will not be allowed to eat or drink in any Jackson cafeteria, dining room, or coffee shop, nor will they be able to remove their N95 mask to eat or drink inside of any of its facilities. Meals and snacks may be pur-chased inside but must be eaten outside of a Jackson facility . Outdoor open-air tents have been added at all campuses. \u0081 Unvaccinated employees and physi- cians will not be allowed to remove their N95 mask in any area, including employ-ee and physician break rooms/lounges. \u0081 During all risk levels, unvaccinated employees and physicians will be restricted from attending in-person meet-ings, other than staff huddles on patient units. All other meetings must be attend-ed virtually via Zoom. \u0081 A mandatory virtual educational course will be required, including an attestation of completion of the course. To identify which employees are vacci- nated, Migoya says their badge will have a sticker that says \"COVID-19 Vaccinated.\" \"As people walk around with their badge, that's easy enough to see if they've been vaccinated or not,\" he adds. In addition to the bonus and the restrictions in place, Migoya says that the hospital is planning to educate employ-ees who are still resisting getting a vac-cine. \"We're trying to fight a lot of misinfor-mation around vaccination, and we're discussing all different kinds of alterna-tives at this point in time,\" he says. Nearly 69% of Jackson's 13,000+ employees have been vaccinated so far, according to Migoya. \"We think we'll exceed 75%, and hopefully , it goes to 80.\" To help increase those numbers, Jackson has been conducting vaccination pop-ups for its employees at all of its main campuses: Jackson Memorial Hospital, Jackson North Medical Center, Jackson South Medical Center, and Jackson West Medical Center, which is the new hospital that opened in the City of Doral. The big challenges that Jackson faces, along with other hospital systems in South Florida, were several-fold, notes Migoya. \"One was the fear of losing nurses and doctors who would go to another health system that would not be mandating the vaccine,\" he says. \"Obviously , we're short-staffed at this point, so that's an issue. But I would tell you that my deci-sion was based on this\u2014if I had to lose 10 employees to another health system versus losing a life because people are vaccinated, I choose a life.\" Another challenge was employees who wanted to wait until the FDA formally approves the vaccination, which took place August 23. \"My answer to that is, we've already vaccinated 1.7 billion people in the world, and there hasn't been any real negative outcomes from anything, or otherwise the media would have already taken care of that,\" Migoya says. \"I think we have enough formal approval of the vaccination by having that number of people vaccinated in the world.\" For more information, visit jacksonhealth.org.

The benefits I see for patients throughout Florida is having access to adjunct or alternative therapies to address common symptoms of anxiety , depression, chronic pain, and insomnia vs. constantly relying on prescription meds that have a host of undesirable side effects when used over time. Opioid/Fentanyl addiction has shat-tered families across our country , but with cannabis-derived products, especially those that are derived from hemp, there are no psychoactive effects, and the potential for addictions practically non-existent. What motivates you to be a part of the cannabis Industry? There are different aspects of this industry that motivate me. For one, all the mis- information out there motivates me because we have the awesome responsibility of properly educating the public and our customers about the truths of Cannabis Sativa L. When a person knows the real story and history of cannabis (marijuana and hemp) in the United States, the support and acceptance for the plants are over-whelming. What field are you in within the cannabis space? PrWell is a vertically integrated hemp company that works with healthcare pro- fessionals to formulate products that address symptoms of specific disease states, and we market our products exclusively through healthcare and medical professionals, which allows them to introduce their patients to premium organic products that many are already using, while providing practitioners with another way to build revenue in their practices. How can people in Florida benefit from the company you represent? Our products are designed to help people address symptoms related to the four main physical/emotional conditions: 1) Chronic Pain 2) Anxiety 3) Insomnia and 4) Depression, so if they are experiencing any of these or other types of symptoms, there is the potential that our product may help to alleviate and reduce some of those symptoms. Moreover, people who may be looking for the benefits of marijuana without the \"high\" can confidently use our products with no psychoactive effects (unless it is P r8, our Delta-8 THC branded products.) Also, people are becoming more con-cerned about products made with GMOs, artificial sugars, and coloring etc ... but at PrWell, we use all natural ingredients. Our products are manufactured in GMP cer-tified labs from USDA certified organic industrial hemp. Our products are non-GMO, Gluten-Free, Vegan, Kosher certified, and all our products are 3rd party lab-tested for potency and safety . How did you get started within the cannabis industry? I learned about CBD from a friend of mine that uses marijuana regularly . I had been asymptomatic for 17 years all the while having spinal stenosis and herniated/bulging discs in my spine. One day about 7 years ago, the symptoms presented themselves for the first time and it was AWFUL. I was in so much pain I quickly realized how people can get hooked on pain pills and other detrimental substances. My friend who uses marijuana regularly suggested I try \"CBD.\" I said to him, \"what the heck is CBD?\" and his answer is the reason I am where I am today . He said, \"it is part of the marijuana plant, but it doesn't get you high.\" That one statement intrigued me so much I responded and said, \"how does it NOT get you high?!\" and his brilliant response was \"Just Google it!\" So, I did, and the rest is history! Are you personally a MJ card holder? Yes, I have been a proud card holder for 2 years. Do you see Florida moving forward with recreational Marijuana/cannabis and how will that affect your business I see Florida and the entire country moving forward with recreational cannabis laws, and I think it will only make our hemp business and our Sales Consultants more relevant and valuable because people are going to be exposed to marijuana around every other corner and they are going to want to get accurate information and answers about what the difference between marijuana and hemp is and what products would benefit them most. I honestly think most of the senior citizens will lean toward hemp-derived prod- ucts over medical marijuana, and PrWell will be ready to educate medical profes-sionals and the public about the beneficial properties of cannabis (marijuana and hemp). 30 September 2021 cannabisnewsflorida.com Cannabis News Florida Cannabis Spotlight Joshua Hoffman T alking Points for the Provisions of the FMMPG Compassionate Care Clarification Bill Which Amends s. 381.986 Medical Use of Marijuana 1. Defining \"Telehealth\" The definition proposed in the bill is consistent with the statutory definition in s. 456.47, with the addition of allowing audio-only telephone calls if audiovisual technology has been attempted and fails, which can happen for technical reasons with any patient, and because of a lack of technological knowledge with senior citi-zens. There was an unsuccessful attempt to amend 456.47 (SB 700) which would have lowered the standard for telehealth technology by allowing e-mails and FAX's to be considered \"telehealth\". Florida medical cannabis specialists feel that a higher standard of communications\u2014real-time two-way communication between a physician and patient\u2014is needed for effec-tive doctor-patient communications and want to maintain that standard for medical cannabis recertification visits, which is why it is being codified in s. 381.986. 2. Adding an additional Qualifying Medical Condition: \"A chronic medical condition for which the patient has taken opioids or benzodiazepines\" Opiates (prescribed for pain) and benzo- diazepines (prescribed for anxiety and insomnia) both reduce a person's drive to breathe. That's why overdoses of these substances can result in death. Cannabis does not reduce the drive to breathe, which is why no one has ever died from a cannabis overdose. In addition, these med-ications cause a physical addiction. Cannabis used in medical doses does not. Florida, as well as rest of the country , is working to reduce the legal and illegal use of these substances. Cannabis is very effec-tive for pain, anxiety and insomnia, and even for helping patients decrease, and in many cases completely discontinue using these medications to which they have become addicted. A review article pub-lished in July 2020 which looked at the results of nine studies showed \"There was a 64-75% reduction in opioid dosage when used in combination with medical cannabis.\" Florida's medical cannabis spe-cialists' practices have also seen a reduc-tion in opioid dosage, with many patients being able to discontinue opioids com-pletely . Florida's opioid dispensing rate per 100 in 2016 (before the medical marijua- na program was established) was 66.6. It went down to 45.4 in 2019 (the most recent year for which the CDC published data). 3. Requiring qualified physicians to provide clinical education about med-ical marijuana to patients for whom they issue a certification Currently , physicians in Florida who are approved to certify patients to use medical marijuana are not required to have any clinical knowledge of cannabis medicine, nor are they required to edu-cate the patients they certify about how to use medical cannabis properly . The only requirement is that a qualified physician have knowledge of the admin-istrative rules of the statute, which is the subject matter in the mandated course and test which physicians are required to com-plete to become qualified to certify patients for medical marijuana use. Most patients have either no knowledge or experience with medical cannabis use, or only recreational knowledge or experi-ence. How are they to know how to prop-erly use cannabis for medical treatment if they are not educated, especially if the physician certifying them to use medical cannabis may not possess that knowledge. Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers are not required to have certified medical cannabis educators or to provide educa-tion. For a physician to certify a patient to use medical marijuana without providing edu-cation about the proper dose, means of administration, and frequency of adminis-tration, would be like a physician certify-ing that a patient has diabetes and leaving it to the patient to figure out if they should use insulin or tablets or both, and what strength, and how often to administer the medication. That is not acceptable medical practice and certifying patients to use medical marijuana without education about how to use it properly , and possibly not even having the knowledge to do so, is not acceptable medical practice either. 4. Permitting a telehealth encounter for recertification of a physician's exist-ing patient Telehealth has been a means to provide and receive healthcare for decades. Its use increased exponentially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It proved to be an effective and efficient means to pro-vide and receive medical care for many medical conditions, including during the 15 months it was used for recertification evaluations of medical marijuana patients, which focuses primarily on the patient's history rather than on their physical examination. However, the authority to perform and receive medical marijuana recertification evaluations via telehealth expired with the expiration of the Governor's Executive Order 20-52 on June 26, 2021. Medicare and almost all private insur- ers have recognized the value of tele-health and continue to permit it as a means to provide and receive medical care. No payors, including the state of Florida, pay for medical cannabis servic-es, therefore payment authorization for telehealth recertification visits is not at issue. Because the vast majority of other patients are permitted to receive their healthcare via telehealth, so should med-ical cannabis patients who require recer-tification. And especially since a signifi-cant number of medical cannabis patients have mobility issues due to severe pain, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or other physically debilitating conditions, or may be immunosuppressed and at risk of infec-tion due to cancer or may have severe anxiety when they have to leave their home due to PTSD, it is even more important that medical marijuana patients be able to receive their recertifi-cation evaluations via telehealth. The eligibility criteria for medical mar- ijuana recertification via telehealth is exactly the same as those established by the state Surgeon General in Emergency Order DOH No. 20-002: Telehealth may be used for recertification visits only (not for initial certification visits), and may only be used if the patient has previously been certified (seen in person) by the qualified physician. 5. Waiving the fee for issuance and renewal of Registry identification cards for honorably discharged military veter-ans Most military veterans who seek med- ical cannabis certification are doing so for debilitating physical or emotional injuries they sustained in the line of duty . Even if their medical condition is not service-related, they have served our country and made sacrifices that very few other Floridians have. Certain other state initial and renewal fees are waived by the state of Florida for honorably dis-charged veterans by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Out of state tuition fees are waived at state universities, col-leges and career centers. Military veter-ans who have served our country honor-ably also deserve to have the $75 annual fee waived for the issuance and renewal of their OMMU Registry identification card. 6. Establishing employment protec- tion parity for medical marijuana patients with patients taking other pre-scription medications When taken medically , medical cannabis causes less sedation than opi-ates such as Vicodin or Percocet, less than benzodiazepines such as Ativan or Xanax, and even less than over the counter antihistamines such as Benadryl. If employees are permitted to take those medications, they should be permitted to take medical cannabis. The employment protection provisions would still protect employers who could lose a monetary or licensing-related benefit under federal law or federal regulations. It also does not restrict an employer from taking adverse employment action against an employee who is impaired by marijuana on the job, just as they are able to take adverse employment action against an employee who is impaired by any pre-scription medication, alcohol or any other substance. 7. Establishing reciprocity for visiting out of state qualifying patients and care-givers Medical marijuana is medication. For many people it is the only medication they take. Florida attracted over 130 mil-lion tourists in 2019. In addition, a lot of people come to Florida to visit relatives. These people need to be able to get their medication. And if they can't, they are less likely to visit Florida. At least 7 other states recognize med- ical cannabis certifications issued by other states and permit these patients to purchase medical cannabis products in their state. Florida statute has a provision for people from out of state who reside in Florida for 31 consecutive days (Seasonal Residents) to become certified to obtain medical cannabis, but not for people who visit for 30 days or less. The proposed reciprocity provision would utilize the current procedure of patients being entered into the OMMU Registry by a qualified physician. Having an unexpired medical cannabis certifica-tion from another state would be their qualifying condition for Florida. This could be done in advance of their visit via telehealth so that the OMMU could process their application before the visi-tor arrives in Florida. The visiting quali-fying patient would be subject to the same dosing limit as Florida residents, prorated for their 30-day visiting patient certification period. Cannabis News Florida cannabisnewsflorida.com September 2021 31 Legislative Priority StatementFlorida Marijuana Physicians Group (FMPG) 32 September 2021 cannabisnewsflorida.com Cannabis News Florida According to Pietrangelo, GrowSaver products can eliminate up to 99.9 percent of airborne powdery mildew every hour, and reduce fungicide use by up to 90 per-cent. The units also reduce labor costs related to the use of fungicides, help enrich terpenes and enhance aromas, and improve microbiological state testing compliance. \"Not only do growers save a lot of money by not having botrytis grow on plants, but they're also making sure that there are no other biological contaminants in the building,\" said Pietrangelo, noting that the same products that eliminate fungi also eliminate the COVID virus, which is spread through airborne aerosols that can stay suspended in the air for more than 16 hours. \"This is the exact same product that we use in hospital operating rooms to keep patients safe,\" he added. \"The same prod-uct that protects patients protects plants.\" Not only are the units useful for grow- ers, but dispensaries can benefit from their installation as well. In addition to remov-ing airborne contaminants, Sanuvox's products also provide odor removal, dras-tically reducing cannabis odors from leav-ing grow buildings or dispensaries. \"We just did an installation at Aurora Cannabis' 212,000 sq. ft. grow room in Canada, eliminating smells with the GrowSaver Odor Wall,\" said Pietrangelo, noting that the local airport was com-plaining of the smell three miles away . Return on Investment The units are relatively easy to install; after cutting a rectangular hole in the ductwork, the UVC devices are placed inside and turned on. Freestanding units can also be mounted on walls. \"Then you just plug and play ,\" said Pietrangelo, adding that lamps need to be replaced every two years. The units themselves are custom- designed, based upon the volume of air being moved and a facility's square footage. \"We do not do cookie-cutter installations; one size doesn't fit all,\" said Pietrangelo. \"The units have to be calcu-lated properly to work; otherwise you're just losing money .\" Units can be built into existing building management systems, and can be designed for any type of facility from cul-tivation centers to medical offices. Sanuvox products are used extensively in Canada and the U.S. Midwest, though this is the company's first foray into the Florida market. \"Our products are 99.999 percent effec- tive and are designed for first-pass effi-ciency , destroying everything in the airstream,\" said Pietrangelo, adding that air changes occur 12 to 20 times an hour in grow facilities. \"As for return on investment, the first harvest will probably pay for it in increased yield, increased terpene strength, and decreased use of fungicide,\" he added. \"That's in addition to the health savings that occur when people aren't get-ting sick from airborne contaminants.\" T o learn more about Sanuvox's medical and grower product lines, visit www.sanuvox.com.

One of the breakout sessions was about Medical Cannabis Updates for Ob/Gyns. Dr. Melanie Bone, a board-certified OB/GYN and med-ical cannabis provider spoke about this topic. She highlighted current attitudes about using medical cannabis in women's health. Given the current state of research on the topic, she advised practitioners to follow ACOG guidelines which suggest that there is no acceptable use for cannabis in pregnant women. This follows the current guidelines on alcohol and other illicit substances. Dr. Bone did mention that there are groups of women who are using cannabi-noids, both CBD and THC, to self-manage hyper-emesis gravidarum, the nausea and vomiting that accompany pregnancy . Their use cannot be condoned at this time, although these women could and should be followed prospectively to look for data to analyze that might give better insight into cannabis and its impact on pregnancy . Dr. Bone spoke about the use of cannabinoids in gynecological conditions as well. She pointed out that cannabinoids can be used in conjunction with allo-pathic medicines to manage complaints including dysmenorrhea, PMS/PMDD, endometriosis and other causes of pelvic pain, as well as menopause. \"At this time, we lack data to justify eschewing allopathic medicine in favor of cannabis, but more and more observational data support utilization of an integration of cannabis with traditional approaches to these common ailments,\" she said. \"This is a case where the science is slowly catching up to the grass roots practice.\" Dr. Bone reports a great deal of success using cannabis to treat anxiety , pain, insom-nia, and sexual health, all of which are highly correlated with diseases such as endometriosis and are part and parcel of menopause for a high percentage of women.

Understanding hemp flowering behav- ior, or how it responds to light and varying daylengths in tropical and subtropical cli-mates has a boost thanks to new research from UF/IFAS published in Frontiers in Plant Science. Hemp needs sufficient time for vegeta- tive growth to take place before the pho-toperiod hits, causing the plant to flower. Planting a hemp crop too late or planting a variety that is incompatible with the day length of the region could cause the plants to flower too soon and lead to an unsuc-cessful crop. Some plants, including hemp, are highly sensitive to the amount of day length they receive. Modern hemp cultivars tend to originate from temperate regions where the longest day length is around 15.5 hours. In Apopka, average daylength is closer to 14 hours. Key Largo only gets 13.5 hours on the longest day . \"Identifying cultivars that can tolerate Florida's environmental conditions is key to optimizing the performance of hemp,\" said Brian Pearson, UF/IFAS assistant pro-fessor of crop management. \"Florida's short day lengths are one of the greatest challenges to hemp success and we wanted to dig deeper to better understand how to grow hemp successfully here since a large amount of our hemp acreage is outdoors.\" Hemp has shown to have optimal pho- toperiods ranging from 12 hours to 18 hours dependent upon the variety , leaving more questions than answers regarding optimal photoperiod. \"Hemp grown in Florida faces a lot of challenges,\" Zachary Brym, agronomy assistant professor said. \"From pest and disease pressure to the high temperatures and humidity , there are a lot of factors that can make growing hemp here difficult. The short daylengths present one of the greatest challenges that this research helped address.\" The research team studied 15 cultivars of essential oil hemp and 12 fiber/grain cultivars grown in controlled growth chambers. The goals were to identify criti-cal photoperiod needed to induce flower-ing, compare photoperiod thresholds to flowering dates within a subtropical out-door environment, and quantify how hemp cultivars respond under different photoperiods. Most of the essential oil cultivars and some of the fiber or grain cultivars were found to be suitable for Florida's daylight hours, but some were sensitive enough that just 15 minutes made a difference in their productivity . So, planting date becomes a critical factor for cultivation outdoors. The study also found that hemp is very sensitive to low levels of light. Light avail-able just prior to sunrise and just after sun-set, also known as civil twilight, is influen-tial to the flowering of hemp. Thus, daylength estimations should include the civil twilight period when determining the photoperiod of a location. Despite great diversity observed in pho- toperiod response, the study identified several essential oil, fiber, and grain hemp varieties that responded favorably to daylengths experienced throughout Florida. \"Careful variety selection is extremely important for Florida growers,\" Brym said. \"It will be important that Florida growers select hemp varieties from southern lati-tudes and avoid those from the north. Growers should also consider day neutral or \"autoflower\" hemp that can withstand the heat and humidity of Florida.\" For more information on UF/IFAS hemp research, visit the hemp resources site at https://programs.ifas.ufl.edu/hemp/resources/.

ARPA provides a 100% subsidy if the employee's work reduction or termination was involuntary . Those subsidies end September 30, 2021. This is an important time for business owners to consider compliance. Business owners should consider working with their COBRA administrator to ensure employees pay their insurance premium October 1st. There are notification deadlines business owners are responsible for sending out. Employees who do not want to pay the premiums will need to be terminated from the plan. This is the employer's responsibility . Most carriers will not allow you to remove them at a future date. This is the year businesses should really consider a third-party administrator. It is the employer's responsibility to sign up and pay for these services. These companies typically offer compliance for ACA reporting, ERISA, COBRA, HIPAA, and SPD. Businesses that do not remain in compliance risk facing penalties. For each of the seven years of ACA employer reporting, the IRS granted an automatic extension and provided a \"Good Faith\" understanding. This means that as long as employers could show they were acting in the best interest of their employees, the IRS would acknowl-edge that any errors represented in reporting were made in good faith, reducing penal-ties and fines. We are anxiously waiting for an announcement from the IRS. It is still possible that we will have another automatic extension, but \"Good Faith\" is in jeop-ardy . As reporting continues in 2021 and 2022, we must all make an effort to remain in compliance and be 100% accurate with IRS filing and reporting. This is also a good time to focus on other compliance services. Are you sending out BY VANESSA ORR As we've all become aware over the past couple of years, airborne contaminants can cause irreparable harm. This is some-thing that medical cannabis growers have long known, as one of the most difficult parts of keeping plants healthy is prevent-ing the spread of powdery mildew , botry-tis, penicillium and other fungi that can be spread though the air as well as venti-lation systems. While some growers have attempted to use ozone to deal with these contami-nants, it unfortunately depletes terpene strength. The secret, according to Bob Pietrangelo, vice president, Southeast United States, Sanuvox, is to use UVC radiation instead. \"Using UV radiation in the C band pro- duces zero ozone, and at the proper inten-sity , can destroy any biological contami-nant,\" he explained. \"It can eliminate powdery mildew , botrytis and more, while at the same time allowing terpenes to maintain maximum strength.\" By utilizing Sanuvox's GrowSaver products in their ventilation systems, growers can eliminate the need for fungi-cides as well. Freestanding units are also available, and all of the units are custom-designed to fit the space involved.
