We analyzed protein content and protein composition of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S by biochemical methods and by mass spectrometry. Four out of four tested lots of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 contained significantly higher than expected levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) and of free viral proteins. The most abundant contaminating HCPs belonged to the heat-shock protein and cytoskeletal protein families. The HCP content exceeded the 400 ng specification limit per vaccine dose, as set by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for this vaccine, by at least 25-fold and the manufacturer's batch-release data in some of the lots by several hundred-fold. In contrast, three tested lots of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine contained only very low amounts of HCPs. As shown for Ad26.COV2.S production of clinical grade adenovirus vaccines of high purity is feasible at an industrial scale. Correspondingly, purification procedures of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine should be modified to remove protein impurities as good as possible. Our data also indicate that standard quality assays, as they are used in the manufacturing of proteins, have to be adapted for vectored vaccines. Editor's evaluation This research shows that a commonly used commercial vaccine for COVID-19 harbors contaminating proteins derived from the human cell line in which it is produced. The health significance of these contaminants (if any) remains unknown. This paper is important because lot purity and processing of vaccines is rarely scrutinized in the scientific realm, and instead is typically analyzed only by the companies themselves. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78513.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.78513.sa0) Introduction Beside mRNA vaccines, adenoviral vector-based vaccines have turned out to be an essential mainstay of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222, Vaxzevria, ChAdOx1 nCov-19 ( [Dicks et al., 2012](#bib7)) . The Johnson & Johnson Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is based on Human Adenovirus type 26 (HAdV-D26) ( [Bos et al., 2020](#bib3)). Both vaccines express the full-length Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of adenovirus-based vaccines to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses and their overall safety record had made them strong candidates to successfully fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This has turned out true, with billions of adenovirus-based vaccine doses administered to vaccinees and with very low rates of serious adverse events observed. In the past, and before the COVID-19 pandemic, adenovirus-based vaccines have not been produced even close at the scale required to supply billions of doses. Thus, for all vaccines including for adenovirus-based vaccines scale-up of production processes in a very short period of time has been a significant challenge. Results Protein impurities detected in the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine We initially analyzed three different lots of ChAdOx1 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by silver staining, comparing the staining pattern of the proteins with those of HAdV-C5-EGFP, an HAdV-C5-based adenovirus vector expressing EGFP, purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation. The vaccine is produced in human T-REx-293 cells to prevent expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during vector production. The vaccine is then purified by a combination of filtration steps and anion-exchange chromatography ( [European-Medicines-Agency, 2021a](#bib9); [Fedosyuk et been shown, that simian adenovirus vectors including ChAdOx1 can be purified at high yield and purity using such technology for purification ( [Fedosyuk et al., 2019](#bib11)). To meet global needs and to enable commercial manufacturing of clinical grade material at a very large scale, some modifications and simplifications, respectively, had been introduced both into the upstream and downstream processes, as has been described in detail ( [Joe et al., 2022](#bib19)). Although in our experiment the same number of viral particles was loaded, the staining pattern of ChAdOx1 looked very different, when compared to the adenoviral vector control ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). While staining of HAdV-C5-EGFP proteins resulted in the expected band pattern, representing distinct major capsid proteins of HAdV-C5 including Hexon, Penton Base, IIIa, and Fiber, protein staining of three different lots of ChAdOx1 showed many more bands than could be explained by proteins from viral particles. Additionally, despite loading the same number of particles, band intensities varied between the ChAdOx1 lots. We also analyzed the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 lots at the DNA level by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results confirmed the exclusive presence of viral DNA, while genomic DNA of the host cell was not detected (data not shown). Detection of substantial amounts of host cell proteins in the vaccine To determine the protein composition of the vaccine, we performed mass spectrometry (MS) analyses from either tryptic in-solution digest directly from the vaccine ( [Figure 2](#fig2)) comparisons of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) signals, we estimate that in lot ABV5811 about 70% of the detected protein content was of human and only 30% of virus origin. In lots ABV4678 and ABV7764 approximately 50% of detected proteins were of human origin ( [Figure 2A](#fig2)). Beside the expected structural viral proteins forming the virion (Hexon, Penton base, IIIa, Fiber, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and others) also several nonstructural viral proteins were detected at high abundancy, although they are not part of the mature viral particle ( [Figure 2B,C](#fig2) and [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/78513/figures#fig2s2)). To the detected nonstructural viral proteins belong, for example, the 100K protein, a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in the trimerization of Hexon, and the DNA-binding protein, which plays an essential role in the replication of the viral genome during infection. In lot ABV5811 nonstructural proteins represented 30% of detected adenoviral proteins ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). Since in the assembly process during virus propagation only a part of the available viral capsid proteins is used for particle formation, we assume that in the vaccine product also significant amounts of structural proteins were present as monomers, oligomers, or incomplete viral capsid assemblies. Not being part of the mature viral particle, both nonstructural viral proteins and nonencapsidated structural proteins are referred to as product-related impurities. Peptides from more than 1000 different human proteins, derived from the human production cell line, were detected ( [Figure 2\u2014source data 1](#fig2sdata1)). They were derived from different cellular compartments including cytoplasm, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and others. Relative amounts of human versus viral proteins were variable between lots ( [Figure 2A](#fig2)), as was already assumed based on the silver-stained gels ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). Among the human proteins found in the vaccine and beside several cytoskeletal proteins including Vimentin, Tubulin, Actin, and Actinin, the group heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and chaperones stood out in abundancy. Among the top as cytosolic HSPs (9.5% of the proteins, respectively) of endoplasmic reticulum 2\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/78513/figures#fig2s2)). Proteins from Bos taurus from fetal calf serum used for growth of T-REx-293 producer cells, Spike protein SARS-CoV-2 and T-Rex-293 cell-derived proteins (E1B from HAdV-C5, Tet-Repressor) or negligible levels ( [Figure 2\u2014source data 1](#fig2sdata1)). Lack of host cell proteins in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine A second approved adenoviral vaccine, based on HAdV-D26, is also purified using filtration and chromatography steps ( [European-Medicines-Agency, 2021b](#bib10)). To our knowledge, more detailed information on the purification process is not publicly available. We compared again a CsCl-purified HAdV-C5-EGFP adenovirus vector with three lots of Ad26.COV2.S (lots 21C10-01, XD955, XE395) and ChAdOx1 (ABV9317) ( [Figure 3](#fig3)) and found very data - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig3-data1-v2.xlsx](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig3-data1-v2.xlsx) - Figure 3\u2014source data 2 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig3-data2-v2.pdf](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig3-data2-v2.pdf) - Figure 3\u2014source data 3 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig3-data3-v2.pdf](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig3-data3-v2.pdf) Mass spectrometry confirmed that more than 93% of proteins detected in HAdV-C5-EGFP were of HAdV-C5 origin ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 98% detected in Ad26.COV2.S (lot XD955) were of HAdV-D26 and less than 1% of human origin. In contrast, in lot ABV9317 of ChAdOx1 70% of proteins were of human and origin ( [Figure 3B,C](#fig3) 2](/articles/78513/figures#fig3s2)). Determination of structural and nonstructural viral proteins revealed viral structural to nonstructural protein ratios of 92% versus 8% and of 70% to ChAdOx1, respectively ( [Figure 3D](#fig3)). The top human host cell proteins (HCPs) in Ad26.COV2.S, although present only at very low abundancy, were histones and ribosomal proteins, rather than the found ChAdOx1 ( [Figure 1](#fig3sdata1)). Quantification of HCPs present in different ChAdOx1 vaccine lots According to European Medicines Agency (EMA) quality specifications for ChAdOx1, 400 ng is the maximally allowable HCP content per single dose (5 \u00d7 1010 vector particles). Since the quantification of total protein amounts in inhomogeneous protein mixtures is inherently afflicted with uncertainty due to differences in biophysical properties of the individual proteins, we used three standard methods to determine the HCP content in the tested ChAdOx1 lots ( [Table 1](#table1)). We took into account the 12.8 \u00b5g protein amount contained in 5 \u00d7 1010 vector particles, that can be calculated based on the known 150 MDa molecular weight of adenovirus particles ( [Sweeney and Hennessey, 2002](#bib38)). As expected, and as apparent from [Table 1](#table1), total protein contents varied with the method used for analysis. However, independent of the method used and as already expected from inspection of [Figure 3A](#fig3), protein amounts contained in the vaccine significantly exceeded the 400 ng specification limit by a factor of 25 or higher, and the manufacturer's batch-release data by an even much larger (several hundred-fold) extent. In vivo study to analyze potential effects of process- and product-related impurities on anti-Spike immune responses To test whether the process- and product-related impurities in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine might influence immune responses against the encoded SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein upon vaccination, we performed an in vivo immunization experiment in mice. We amplified ChAdOx1 nCov-19 in HEK293T cells and purified this vector to more than 90% purity (renamed UUlm ChAdOx1 by data 1 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig4-data1-v2.xlsx](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig4-data1-v2.xlsx) - Figure 4\u2014source data 2 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig4-data2-v2.pdf](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig4-data2-v2.pdf) - Figure 4\u2014source data 3 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig4-data3-v2.pdf](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/78513/elife-78513-fig4-data3-v2.pdf) T-cell responses (against one tested T-cell epitope) were 1.3-fold lower after vaccination using compared to vaccination using AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov-19. Similarly, total antibody titers were also 1.3-fold lower after vaccination using UUlm ChAdOx1 nCov-19 compared to vaccination using AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov-19. However, differences between the two groups were not statistically significant in both parameters, indicating that in this limited study performed in mice there was no indication for obvious interference in induced immune responses related to the HCPs in the original AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. Detection of ATPase activity in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine Since HSPs and chaperones, found at substantial levels in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine are equipped with ATPase activity and because ADP is a strong activator of platelets, we analyzed, whether ATPase activity was detectable in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (lot ABV9317) was incubated with ATP and the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP was determined using a commercial assay. Results confirmed the presence of ATPase activity in the vaccine ( [Figure 5A,B](#fig5)). Discussion When analyzing the protein composition of ChAdOx1, a vaccine with an overall good safety record and with high efficacy in preventing or ameliorating COVID-19, we found that the HCP content in ChAdOx1 exceeded the 400 ng/dose specification limit, as set by the EMA, by at least 25-fold in all tested lots, in some of the lots substantially more ( [Table 1](#table1)). Compared to the manufacturer's batch-release data the difference between actual and assumed HCP content, respectively, was even several hundred-fold in some of the lots. The substantial lot-to-lot variation in HCP content in a total of four tested samples ( [Figure 1](#fig1) and [Table 1](#table1)) also indicated a lack of robustness of the process used for purification of the vaccine, a process, which recently has been described in detail ( [Joe et al., 2022](#bib19)). In contrast, in three tested lots of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, contamination with HCPs was negligible, confirming that excellent purification of clinical grade adenovirus vaccines is possible at an industrial scale. One can assume that the vast majority of the more than 1000 different proteins detected, most of which present at low abundancy, will not cause any adverse effects. We note that the most abundant proteins do not belong to the group of 'high risk' HCPs such as cytokines, proteases, and lipases, as they have been described in the context of protein therapeutics ( [Jones et al., 2021](#bib20)). Whether or not some of the detected human and/or viral protein contaminants might enhance early clinical vaccine reactions such as flu-like symptoms, very often observed within 1 or 2 days after intramuscular injection of vaccines, is a question that cannot be easily addressed. There is a possibility that some of the proteins, in particular those with higher abundancy, might be more than inert bystanders. For example, extracellular HSPs are known to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, can exacerbate preexisting inflammatory condition, have been associated with autoimmunity and can even become targets auf autoimmune responses themselves ( [Binder, 2014](#bib2); [Routsias and Tzioufas, 2006](#bib33); [Tamura et al., They very efficiently initiate specific immune responses by receptor-mediated uptake of HSP-peptide complexes in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), CD91 receptors 2014](#bib2); [Binder et al., 2000](#bib1)). Since the HSPs present in the vaccine are derived from T-REx-293 cells, in principle they could mediate the transfer to APCs of peptides derived from the 293 cell source, of autologous peptides from vaccinated individuals and also of viral proteins. Like many viruses, adenovirus has been reported to induce HSPs during amplification in production cells ( [Santoro et al., 2010](#bib34)), likely to accommodate for a need in help by HSPs in the folding and production of large amounts of structural and nonstructural viral proteins and in virion assembly. Thus, virus infection-mediated induction of HSPs could explain the abundancy of HSPs in the vaccine product in case of insufficient purification. Because HSPs are endowed with ATPase activity, we searched for and detected ATPase activity in ChAdOx1 ( [Figure 5](#fig5)), raising the possibility that local ADP generation in the ATP-rich skeletal muscle tissue after injection might contribute to activation of platelets following ADP receptor binding. Shortly after receiving conditional marketing authorization in Europe, cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia were observed, an unusual and, if untreated, often fatal syndrome of thrombosis of the cerebral venous sinuses and other large vessels together with low platelet counts. Occurring between 5 and 28 days after vaccination ( [Othman et al., 2021](#bib29)), this syndrome, now thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) or thrombosis heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( [Greinacher et al., 2017](#bib14)), was found linked to vaccination with ChAdOx1 ( [Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021](#bib30)), and has been described to be mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) ( 2021](#bib40); [Wolf ( [Muir et al., lower frequency ( [Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2022](#bib31)). It has recently been speculated that impurities in ChAdOx1 could be causally involved in the pathogenesis of VITT ( [Greinacher et al., 2021a](#bib15)). Since VITT has been found associated with both ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S, at a lower frequency in the latter ( [Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021](#bib30)), and because, according to our data, ChAdOx1 but not Ad26.COV2.S contained high amounts of human and free viral proteins, our findings support the notion that the protein impurities present in ChAdOx1 at least are not the primary trigger for the induction of VITT. Incidentally, PF4 itself was not found in our analyses as a contaminant. Whether the impurities might increase the likelihood and frequency of its occurrence in case of ChAdOx1, for example by serving as an inflammatory or immunological cofactor remains a possibility. Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have indicated that RNA vaccines are associated with thromboembolic events but not with VITT ( [Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, 2021](#bib30)). We speculate that differences in duration and/or levels of Spike protein expression, as to be expected in adenoviral vectors versus mRNA vaccines, might also be a relevant factor in the pathogenesis of VITT, as well as the secretion of the Spike protein due to aberrant splicing events, as recently observed with adenovirus-based vaccines, more so with ChAdOx1 than with Ad26.COV2.S ( [Kowarz et al., 2022](#bib22)). However, it is important to stress that the frequency of severe thromboembolic events occurring after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 is much higher than after vaccination with any of the vaccines in use including ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S ( [Lau et al., 2021](#bib23); [Nopp et 2020](#bib28)). We also considered that intramuscular injection of contaminating free viral or nonviral proteins might influence the quality of the immune response and potentially affect activity and efficacy of the vaccine. In a pilot in vivo immunization experiment performed in mice, anti-Spike antibody and T-cell responses were not significantly altered following immunization with ChAdOx1 compared to an identical vector without HCP contamination ( [Figure 4](#fig4)), suggesting that the protein impurities did not interfere with the induction of immune responses against the Spike antigen. However, we acknowledge that our study was limited by testing recognition of only a single T-cell epitope. In the biopharmaceutical industry, the removal of HCPs from the biological product is a critical quality attribute, since residual HCPs pose a risk to patient safety ( [Vanderlaan et al., 2018](#bib41); [Wang et al., 2009](#bib42); [Zhu-Shimoni et al., 2014](#bib45)). The main risks generally discussed relate either to the biological activity of the contaminant, to effects of the impurities enhancing immune responses against the therapeutic protein (antidrug antibodies) or to inducing antibodies against the impurities ( [Vanderlaan et al., 2018](#bib41)). These concerns are relevant as they have been observed clinically. Overall, problems with HCPs are rare events and classical protein biopharmaceuticals have an excellent safety record ( [de Zafra et al., 2015](#bib6)). In cases, in which problems have been observed, therapeutic proteins have been produced in heterologous (i.e., nonhuman) production systems such as E. coli, yeast, and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines ( [de Zafra et al., 2015](#bib6)). For example, antidrug antibodies were generated in patients against human growth hormone ( [Vanderlaan et al., 2018](#bib41)), produced in E. coli, apparently due to a contaminating protein that had been missed by an unsuitable HCP assay. Another case, more closely related to the topic of this report, is bovine neonatal pancytopenia, a severe vaccine-induce alloimmune disease in young calves that is caused by alloreactive maternal antibodies present in the colostrum of cows that had been vaccinated against bovine viral diarrhea ( [Kasonta et al., 2018](#bib21)). Bioprocess impurities in the vaccine, originating from the bovine i.e. autologous, production cell line, used for virus propagation and vaccine production, induced these alloreactive antibodies present in the colostrum of vaccinated cows that were directed to polymorphic bovine leukocyte antigen I (BoLA class I) alleles and became symptomatic in the offspring ( [Kasonta et al., 2018](#bib21)). In principle, for biopharmaceuticals used in humans one can expect lower immune-related risks linked to HCP impurities when they are produced in human cell lines ( [de Zafra et al., 2015](#bib6)). Guidance documents by the US Pharmacopeia (USP) and the European Pharmacopeia emphasize that HCP impurities should be as low as technically feasible ( [Vanderlaan et al., 2018](#bib41)). For 'classical' biopharmaceuticals such as antibodies the allowable HCP content generally is in a range of 1-100 parts per million (1-100 ppm), corresponding to 1-100 ng 2009](#bib42); [Vanderlaan et al., 2018](#bib41)). The HCP content in more complex biotherapeutics such as viral vectors will be higher than in protein therapeutics, since production processes are more demanding. Therefore, HCP specifications are individually determined by the regulatory bodies. One of the likely reasons, why in the case of ChAdOx1 the specification limit of 400 ng HCP content per dose was largely exceeded ( [Table 1](#table1)), has to do with the assays used for HCP determination in the purified product. Standard assays to monitor removal of HCPs during 2018](#bib41); [European Directorate for the Quality of Medicine and Health Care, 2020](#bib8)), based on polyclonal antibodies isolated from larger animals, preferentially goat, sheep, and rabbit, after immunization with cell lysates or supernatants from the producer cell. For production of secreted recombinant proteins, such assays are a 'workhorse' in quality control ( [Vanderlaan et al., 2018](#bib41)), routinely used and together with other methods to assure and document the absence of HCPs in the final product. The apparent lack of detection by the manufacturer of HSPs and cytoskeletal proteins in ChAdOx1 with an ELISA could be explained by the close to 100% homology at the protein level of HSPs and cytoskeletal proteins between human and sheep or goat, so that in immunized animals no or low-level antibodies against these protein classes were generated. Thereby, these proteins could be missed, if quality control was solely based on such a polyclonal ELISA, in particular, if it was not complemented by orthogonal analytical methods such as staining of protein gels, capillary electrophoresis, or mass spectrometry. With the many different contaminant proteins detected in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine the question imposes itself, whether or not (some of) the impurities might have long-term immune-related side effects in some of the vaccinees. In order to reduce potential risks as good as possible it will be necessary to reduce the level of contamination with process- and product-related impurities by an improved purification process. The establishment of robust assays for detection of HCPs can be complicated and time consuming ( [Wang et al., 2009](#bib42)), in particular if processes for new and complex biopharmaceuticals have to be developed, time that maybe is not always available in times of a pandemic. However, the here reported identification of specific process- and product-related impurities in ChAdOx1 should guide and accelerate the next steps to improve purity and quality of this and similar vaccines in the future. Materials and methods Adenoviral vectors and vaccines [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap78513?item=s4-1) All vaccine lots analyzed in this study were obtained in original vials from the Pharmacy of the University Hospital Ulm between March 2021 and September 2021, as they became available in the course of the ongoing vaccination campaign. According to the manufacturer, ChAdOx1 (lots ABV4678, ABV5811, ABV7764, and ABV9317) has a physical titer of 1 \u00d7 108 VP/\u00b5l and is dissolved in 10 mM histidine, has a physical titer of 1 \u00d7 108 VP/\u00b5l and is dissolved in citric acid monohydrate (0.14 mg), trisodium citrate dehydrate (2.02 mg), ethanol (2.04 mg), 2-hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (25.50 ( [Janssen-Pharmaceutical-Companies, 2021](#bib18)). HAdV-C5-EGFP vector particles used in this study are E1-deleted replication-incompetent vector particles of human adenovirus species C type 5 (based on GenBank AY339865.1, sequence from nt 1 to 440 and from nt 3523 to 35,935). HAdV-C5-EGFP carries a CMV promoter-controlled lot ABV4678. ( [Schiedner et al., 2000](#bib35)) or HEK293T respectively, as previously described ( [Nilson et al., 2021](#bib27)). In brief, 2 \u00d7 108 cells were transduced with 6 \u00d7 1010 total vector particles from stock solution. Forty-eight hours post-transduction cells were harvested, resuspended in 3 ml buffer (50 mM 4-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and lysed by three consecutive freeze/thaw cycles. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10 min, and vector particle-containing supernatants were layered on a CsCl step gradient (density bottom: 1.41 g/ml; density top: 1.27 g/ml, 50 mM HEPES, mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 176,000 \u00d7 g for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. Vector particles were further purified by a consecutive continuous CsCl gradient (density: 1.34 g/ml, 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 176,000 \u00d7 g for 20 hr at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, vector solutions were desalted by size exclusion chromatography (PD10 columns, 17-0851-01; GE Healthcare). Physical vector titers were determined by optical density measurement at 260 nm as described earlier ( [Mittereder et al., 1996](#bib24)). UUlm in-house, had physical of 2.9 \u00d7 109 and 1.65 \u00d7 108 VP/\u00b5l, respectively, and were dissolved in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4. 2.4G2 cells (ATCC, HB-197) HEK293T CRL-3216) were and maintained in alphaMEM medium (Gibco, 22561-021). All media were supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine and cells were cultivated in cell culture dishes (Nunc, 168381) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 95%. CAP-T cells ( [Fischer et al., 2012](#bib12)), kindly provided by CEVEC Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Cologne, for research purposes, were cultivated in Protein Expression Medium (PEM) (Gibco, 12661-013) with 4 mM Glutamax in polycarbonate plain flasks at 185 rpm and 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 with a relative humidity of 95%. Cells were split 2\u00d7/week to a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml. All cell lines used in this study were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination (VenorGeM Classic Minerva Biolabs, 11-1025). [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap78513?item=s4-3) 3 \u00d7 109 vector particles dissolved in 30 \u00b5l were mixed with SDS-loading buffer (30 mM Tris, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, bromophenol blue, pH 7.5) containing 0.2 M -mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 min at 96\u00b0C. Reduced and denatured proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently stained in gel by Coomassie or silver staining. For Johnson & Johnson Ad26.COV2.S vector storage buffers were exchanged before SDS-PAGE using 30 kDa cutoff amicons (Millipore, MPUFC5030BK) according to the manufacturer's instructions after heating samples for 5 min at 96\u00b0C. Silver staining: proteins were fixed (50% MeOH, 12% AcOH, 0.05% HCHO) for 30 min and washed for 15 min with 50% EtOH. Subsequently, proteins were equilibrated for 1 min (0.8 mM Na2S2O3), washed with dH2O, impregnated for 20 min (11.78 mM AgNO3, 0.05% HCHO) and washed again with H2O.

Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Process- and product-related impurities in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by myself as a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Klimkait (Reviewer #1); Roland Wagner (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: We will not require further experiments, but you can see from the reviews that many questions arose throughout. Given the interest that the paper will garner, we ask you to address and clarify as many of these points as possible. In particular, please add a description of how these lots were chosen. Please also add as much detail as possible regarding what is known about the differences in the purification process of ChAdOx1 versus Ad26.COV2.S. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): The manuscript provides strong evidence for a surprisingly high heterogeneity in protein content when comparing 3 preparations of a commercial vaccine preparation. The authors appropriately use widely used and standardised methods for the elucidation of the protein composition of several Aden-based vaccine preparations. After the somewhat unexpected finding of high protein contamination levels in ChAdOx1, they apply different ways to verify exceedingly high levels of contamination with host cell protein. As perplexing as a 70% contamination may sound, the authors plausibly discuss possible reasons for the massive under quantification. It is highly astonishing that no response by authorities (EMA) or manufacturer (Astra) is found in the manuscript. To the reader, this indicates that those bodies either are not aware of the study data or that they did not respond. It might therefore be of high general interest to add a short statement to the discussion. Overall, the study has been carefully designed and conducted, and the latter part including platelet-related ATPase experiments adds important detail to the discussion about potential product-induced side effects after vaccination. The manuscript is clearly structured and the analyses are straightforward. The detailed discussion of a possible side-effect potential caused by contaminating cell proteins adds important information. Also the information about why certain proteins, i.e. HSP could have been missed although present at extreme levels, provides very useful information for the non-expert audience. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): This is a simple study looking at the impurities of two widely used Covid-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S. The result that all four lots of ChAdOx1 analyzed contained impurities above the maximum allowable level was surprising and important. 1) I would like to see the authors include as much detail as possible regarding what is known about the differences in the purification process of ChAdOx1 versus Ad26.COV2.S. It would be tremendously helpful for the field to understand what part of the ChAdOx1 purification process is responsible for the high levels of impurities. 2) Why is the Penton base band for ChAdOx1 not visible in Figure 1 and Figure 3A? 3) I would have liked to have seen all of the analyses performed in Figure 3 to have been conducted on HAdV-C5-EGFP and on UUlm ChAdOx1. To improve the usefulness of the manuscript, the authors should discuss in more detail the possible reasons for the high levels of impurities so that this can be avoided in the future. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): The elimination of endogenously produced host cell proteins is one of the most challenging operations in guaranteeing the compliance of critical quality attributes in the production of biological drug substances. Realization of process robustness sufficient enough to consistently keep it at the highest standard is a time-consuming part of the process development. Hence, it is of utmost importance to have a very critical view of drugs that had been developed and produced under conditions of a propagating disease wave and an increasing political and social pressure. Compromising the purity of a drug with host cell proteins is most probable when the product is produced by the biological system of a cell. This is especially the case for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection based on adenoviruses as vectors because the virus has to be produced by means of animal cells. Therefore, the authors investigated the two approved vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson. The manuscript is clearly written and the methods used for analyzing the impurities are industrial standard methods used in the process development of therapeutic bioproducts. The authors have long-term expertise in adenovirus production and development. The conclusive results are highly reasonable. Very important investigation and very important results that have to be published as fast as possible. The manuscript is clearly written and the methods used for analyzing the impurities are reliable standard methods used for identifying impurities in drug-producing bioprocesses. The conclusive results are highly reasonable and such that I recommend the manuscript for publication without reservations. Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. I did not find a description of how these lots were chosen. Ie: I am guessing there are many lots out there and these three a random choice? (why only 3?). There are then statements like (line 319) 'ChAdOx1 but not Ad26.COV2.S contained high amounts of human and free viral proteins'. When I understand that one Ad26 contained less than 3 AZ. Some statistical comparison of a larger number of randomly sampled lots would seem appropriate? 2. The immunological analysis seems pretty superficial and also subject to type 2 error. Surely the statement should be 'responses to AZ were 3%, and to control 2%, although this was not significant (stating p-value and test, not currently stated)' (rather than ignoring difference). Same for spike binding antibodies. Similarly, the discussion pointed out a trend of high antibodies + T cells that was not significant. Overall this is a very superficial look at immune responses. 3. There is a lot of excessive speculation in the discussion. Eg: a) Line 281: \"we assume....might enhance early clinical vaccine reactions\". b) Line 'might be more than inert bystanders...' c) 296: peptides'. d) 307 onwards: speculation on VIIT. Shouldn't this just say no PF4 was found... e) Line 33 onwards - very little immune data, and the data they have suggests higher immunogenicity (but not significant). f) Lines 341: They speculate on antibodies to the impurities. It is pretty easy to check - so not sure why speculation? g) The speculation about the possible effects of contaminants cites reference 29 extensively (which looks at the impact of contaminants). My reading of this is that (i) most of the documented cases come from bacterial contaminants (that act as adjuvants). (ii) the major effect is immune responses that reduce the circulation time/effects of a drug. (iii) there seem few documented cases where this occurs, and none where there are autoimmune consequences? h) (line 349) bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP): no citations provided, but also not clear it is relevant (ie: it needs a statement that no MHC molecules found in the vaccines, no evidence for alloreactivity, etc - so this does not seem relevant to the case at hand) I feel it is written in a way to enhance speculation on the role of contaminants, whereas in fact there seems no plausible link with any side effect (and the most obvious mechanisms - such as contamination with PF4) can be eliminated by the study... I think the manuscript would be greatly enhanced if the authors could: 1) to show clear evidence of whether there is a difference in contamination between this and other vaccines (esp JnJ). Eg: sufficient (randomly chosen) batches to show statistical significance (or a clear statement that based on 1 batch versus 3 this is purely anecdotal). 2) Before speculating on auto-antibodies etc, this should be directly examined (eg: look at antibodies from AZ / JnJ vaccinated and control individuals to cell lysate (western blot? Immunoprecipitation?). These are very easy. Also, make recombinant versions of the top 5 contaminants and see if antibodies to these are detectable in AZ vaccinated vs. control vs. JnJ vaccinated). 3) It should clearly state that although there is a theoretical risk potential contaminants could have an effect, no relevant examples are known in the literature (not my area - but going off reference 29) and no relevant proteins were found. Eg: no PF4 (relevant to HIIT), no MHC (relevant to bovine neonatal pancytopenia).

Given the interest that the paper will garner, we ask you to address and clarify as many of these points as possible. In particular, please add a description of how these lots were chosen. Please also add as much detail as possible regarding what is known about the differences in the purification process of ChAdOx1 versus Ad26.COV2.S. We have addressed/clarified the reviewers' questions, as detailed in the specific comments to the reviewers below. Lines 377-380: description, how the lots were obtained Lines 78-81: a comparison between the purification processes of ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S is not possible, since only in case of the AZ vaccine, detailed information on the manufacturing is available (new reference Joe et al., 2022). On the manufacturing of the JJ vaccine no details of upstream and downstream processes are publicly available. However, reference Joe et la., 2022 provides important information on the process in case of ChAdOx1. Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): The manuscript provides strong evidence for a surprisingly high heterogeneity in protein content when comparing 3 preparations of a commercial vaccine preparation. The authors appropriately use widely used and standardised methods for the elucidation of the protein composition of several Aden-based vaccine preparations. After the somewhat unexpected finding of high protein contamination levels in ChAdOx1, they apply different ways to verify exceedingly high levels of contamination with host cell protein. As perplexing as a 70% contamination may sound, the authors plausibly discuss possible reasons for the massive under quantification. It is highly astonishing that no response by authorities (EMA) or manufacturer (Astra) is found in the manuscript. To the reader, this indicates that those bodies either are not aware of the study data or that they did not respond. It might therefore be of high general interest to add a short statement to the discussion. The regulatory bodies (EMA, PEI) and the manufacturer (AZ) were immediately informed on the results of our analysis of the AZ vaccine, as soon as the data were obtained. Since this is not scientific information, we prefer not to introduce this information into the manuscript. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): This is a simple study looking at the impurities of two widely used Covid-19 vaccines, ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S. The result that all four lots of ChAdOx1 analyzed contained impurities above the maximum allowable level was surprising and important. 1) I would like to see the authors include as much detail as possible regarding what is known about the differences in the purification process of ChAdOx1 versus Ad26.COV2.S. It would be tremendously helpful for the field to understand what part of the ChAdOx1 purification process is responsible for the high levels of impurities. Lines 78-81: a comparison between the purification processes of ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S is not possible, since only in case of the ChAdOx1 vaccine detailed information on the manufacturing is available (new reference Joe et al., 2022 is now cited). We note that compared to a previous publication (reference Fedosyuk et al., 2019) a TFF step was omitted prior to the anion-exchange chromatography step to facilitate scale-up. However, without more detailed information it would be too speculative to link this modification to the high HCP content observed in the vaccine. Therefore, we have just indicated that modifications of the process have been introduced. The interested reader can look up reference 5 for more details. On manufacturing of the JJ vaccine no details of upstream and downstream processes are publicly available, only what can be found at the EMA (Reference European-Medicines-Agency, 2021b). 2) Why is the Penton base band for ChAdOx1 not visible in Figure 1 and Figure 3A? Very good observation. Same is true for the Ad26.COV2.S Briefly: Penton Base of HAdV-C5 is larger than of ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S, and the disorder of the RGD-containing loop in HAdV-C5 is more disorders. Lines 784-792: Detailed explanation has been introduced in the legend of Figure 3. 3) I would have liked to have seen all of the analyses performed in Figure 3 to have been conducted on HAdV-C5-EGFP and on UUlm ChAdOx1. All analyses are now shown also for the additional 2 lots of Ad26.COV2.S (Figure 3 \u2014figure supplement 2), for HAdV-C5-EGFP (Figure 3 \u2014figure supplement 1) and for UUlm ChAdOx1 (Figure 4 \u2014figure supplement 1). The corresponding source data are also included. To improve the usefulness of the manuscript, the authors should discuss in more detail the possible reasons for the high levels of impurities so that this can be avoided in the future. Lines 78-81: a comparison between the purification processes of ChAdOx1 and Ad26.COV2.S is not possible, since only in case of the ChAdOx1vaccine detailed information on the manufacturing is available (new reference Joe et al., 2022 is now cited). We note that compared to a previous publication (reference Fedosyuk et al., 2019) a TFF step was omitted prior to the anion-exchange chromatography step to facilitate scale-up.

On manufacturing of the JJ vaccine no details of upstream and downstream processes are publicly available, only what can be found at the EMA (Reference European-Medicines-Agency, 2021b). Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors): 1. I did not find a description of how these lots were chosen. Ie: I am guessing there are many lots out there and these three a random choice? (why only 3?). There are then statements like (line 319) 'ChAdOx1 but not Ad26.COV2.S contained high amounts of human and free viral proteins'. When I understand that one Ad26 contained less than 3 AZ. Some statistical comparison of a larger number of randomly sampled lots would seem appropriate? Choice of lots: All vaccine lots analyzed in this study were obtained in original vials from the Pharmacy of the University Hospital Ulm between March 2021 and September 2021, as they became available in the course of the ongoing vaccination campaign There has been misunderstanding: a total of 4 AZ (not 3) vaccines and 3 JJ (not 1) vaccines were analysed and all data, including source data, are now presented in the manuscript. This has been explained now in a clearer way in the manuscript. 2. The immunological analysis seems pretty superficial and also subject to type 2 error. Surely the statement should be 'responses to AZ were 3%, and to control 2%, although this was not significant (stating p-value and test, not currently stated)' (rather than ignoring difference). Same for spike binding antibodies. Similarly, the discussion pointed out a trend of high antibodies + T cells that was not significant. Overall this is a very superficial look at immune responses. As we mention in the manuscript, the study was meant as a pilot study. Lines 214 - 222. We have now modified the wording according to the reviewer's suggestion to more accurately describe our findings. 3. There is a lot of excessive speculation in the discussion. Eg: a) line 281: \"we assume....might enhance early clinical vaccine reactions\". b) Line 'might be more than inert bystanders...' c) 296: peptides'. d) 307 onwards: speculation on VIIT. Shouldn't this just say no PF4 was found... e) Line 33 onwards - very little immune data, and the data they have suggests higher immunogenicity (but not significant). f) Lines 341: They speculate on antibodies to the impurities. It is pretty easy to check - so not sure why speculation? g) The speculation about the possible effects of contaminants cites reference 29 extensively (which looks at the impact of contaminants). My reading of this is that (i) most of the documented cases come from bacterial contaminants (that act as adjuvants). (ii) the major effect is immune responses that reduce the circulation time/effects of a drug. (iii) there seem few documented cases where this occurs, and none where there are autoimmune consequences? h) (line 349) bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP): no citations provided, but also not clear it is relevant (ie: it needs a statement that no MHC molecules found in the vaccines, no evidence for alloreactivity, etc - so this does not seem relevant to the case at hand) We thank the reviewer for the careful reading and critic. Lines 241, 247-257, 258, 291-292, 308-311, 319-335: in the revision we have addressed most of the reviewer's concerns by clarifications and better explanations in the text, by partial rewriting of the discussion, by removing any overt speculation and by adding additional information, discussion and references. I feel it is written in a way to enhance speculation on the role of contaminants, whereas in fact there seems no plausible link with any side effect (and the most obvious mechanisms - such as contamination with PF4) can be eliminated by the study... I think the manuscript would be greatly enhanced if the authors could: 1) to show clear evidence of whether there is a difference in contamination between this and other vaccines (esp JnJ). Eg: sufficient (randomly chosen) batches to show statistical significance (or a clear statement that based on 1 batch versus 3 this is purely anecdotal). As Above: Choice of lots: All vaccine lots analyzed in this study were obtained in original vials from the Pharmacy of the University Hospital Ulm between March 2021 and September 2021, as they became available in the course of the ongoing vaccination campaign There has been misunderstanding: a total of 4 AZ (not 3) vaccines and 3 JJ (not 1) vaccines were analysed and all data, including source data, are now presented in the manuscript.

Immunoprecipitation?). These are very easy. Also, make recombinant versions of the top 5 contaminants and see if antibodies to these are detectable in AZ vaccinated vs. control vs. JnJ vaccinated). Performing additional experiments, for example to screen for the presence of autoantibodies etc. or involving generating recombinant proteins for the top 5 contaminants would have gone far beyond, what reasonably could have been done within a few months of additional experimental work. 3) It should clearly state that although there is a theoretical risk potential contaminants could have an effect, no relevant examples are known in the literature (not my area - but going off reference 29) and no relevant proteins were found. Eg: no PF4 (relevant to HIIT), no MHC (relevant Lines 241, 247-257, 258, 291-292, 308-311, 319-335: in the revision we have addressed most of the reviewer's concerns by clarifications and better explanations in the text, by partial rewriting of the discussion, by removing any overt speculation and by adding additional information, discussion and references. Absence of PF4 and other \"high risk\" HCPs is mentioned. The relation to bovine neonatal pancytopenia is explained in a better way. Not an immune response to MHC is the issue, rather potential immunogenicity in vaccinees of HEK293-derived HCPs that have polymorphic alleles (resulting in sequence differences at the protein level).

However, most single-cell studies of infection quantify the expression of viral transcripts and proteins, rather than the amount of progeny virions released from infected cells. Here, we overcome this limitation by simultaneously measuring transcription and progeny production from single influenza virus-infected cells by embedding nucleotide barcodes in the viral genome. We find that viral transcription and progeny production are poorly correlated in single cells. The cells that transcribe the most viral mRNA do not produce the most viral progeny and often represent aberrant infections that fail to express the influenza NS gene. However, only some of the discrepancy between transcription and progeny production can be explained by viral gene absence or mutations: there is also a wide range of progeny production among cells infected by complete unmutated virions. Overall, our results show that viral transcription is a relatively poor predictor of an infected cell's contribution to the progeny population. - - Epidemiology and Global Health - Microbiology and Infectious Disease eLife has published a special issue containing articles that examine how cancer prevention, control, care and survivorship were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
