Chiropractic History (The following contains excerpts from the article entitled: [Chiropractic: An American-Born Science](https://cherubhealth.com/chiropractic-an-american-born-science/) by - Dr Ron Cherubino) Throughout history, people have recognized a connection between the health of the spine and the health of the body. Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine was quoted around 400 B.C. as saying \"Look well to the spine for the cause of disease\". Modern chiropractic was discovered in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer, a self educated teacher and healer, performed the first spinal treatment on Harvey Lillard, a janitor who worked in Palmer's building. Lillard was nearly totally deaf and mentioned to Palmer that he had lost his hearing many years ago when he was bending over and felt a \"pop\" in his upper back. Palmer, who was quite knowledgeable in anatomy and very interested in how the spine interacted with the rest of the body's systems, felt strongly that the two events were somehow related. Upon examination, a misaligned vertebra was identified in Mr. Lillard's spine, its position was corrected and an amazing result was witnessed. Harvey Lillard's hearing was restored! In the years that followed, chiropractic physicians have studied the relationship between the spine, the nervous system and a person's health. What was initially viewed as a treatment for specific spinal maladies is now capable of helping treat a wide variety of complex spinal conditions as well as effect many other symptoms and diseases of the human body. Chiropractic Philosophy (It's All about Cause and Effect) Chiropractic is the largest natural health profession in the world. It is holistic by nature and is based on the knowledge that the body is a self-healing and self-regulating organism, it works with the body's master control system (the nervous system). In fact the nervous system controls and regulates all of the functions of the body. Therefore Chiropractic physicians work to improve the function of the body's nervous system and are concerned with its intimate relationship to the health and function of the spine. Chiropractic was discovered in 1895 by Dr. D.D. Palmer who founded the profession on the basic principle that all living organisms are born with the ability to heal. Every organ, tissue and cell is controlled by electrical nerve impulses that travel, with the help of the nervous system, to and from the brain and all other parts of the body. Nerves make possible all movement, thought, sensation and function that the human body is capable of. Circulation, immunity, muscle tone, digestion, respiration, to name but a few, are all controlled by the nervous system. Nerves control all tissues and organs including the liver, lungs, spleen, pancreas, colon and kidneys, etc. The Important Relationship Between Your Nervous System And Your Spine The spinal column (of bones) houses and protects your spinal cord (bundle of nerves). From here nerves leave the spine through openings between movable spinal bones called vertebra. Various stresses and traumas can cause spinal malfunction which can interfere with normal nervous system function. Abnormal function of spinal segments is known as dysafferentation or subluxation and can result in a condition known as NID (Nerve Impulse Deficiency). Doctors of chiropractic are concerned with the identification and removal of these areas of dysfunction and the resulting nervous system interference and imbalance. Chiropractors are focused on identifying the root cause of the symptoms and diseases that people suffer from. The fact is that many symptoms can be caused by spinal and nervous system dysfunction. A chiropractic evaluation and spinal examination is the best way to identify spinal dysfunction and uncover the cause of related symptoms. Chiropractic Research There are a wealth of ongoing chiropractic research studies involving scientific investigation into the many benefits of chiropractic care. Under the Links section of this website, you will find a variety of helpful links, articles and reports which are available for further study. Research Articles Compiled by the Massachusetts Chiropractic Society Here just a few examples of the results of these studies: Spinal Function and Its Relationship to Lower Blood Pressure A pilot study conducted at the University of Chicago found that a one-time specialized chiropractic adjustment, delivered to patients suffering from high blood pressure and concurrent misaligned C1 vertebrae, resulted in significant reductions in diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The decrease in blood pressure was equivalent to that seen in patients who had been administered two blood pressure medications. In this study, none of the patients were taking any antihypertensive medications during the study period. A pilot study. Journal of Human Hypertension, March 2, 2007 Chiropractic and the Improvement of Athletic Performance A research study, conducted by Dr. Anthony Lauro and Dr. Brian Mouch, indicated that chiropractic care was shown to improve athletic performance by as much as 16.7% over a two week period. The report also found that subluxation-free athletes reacted faster, demonstrated better coordination and executed fine motor movements with improved accuracy and precision. The study concluded that athletes under chiropractic care demonstrated improved athletic performance. Published in the Journal of Chiropractic Research and Clinical Investigation, 1991 Education of the Chiropractic Physician Doctors of chiropractic \u2014 are licensed to practice chiropractic medicine in all 50 states and in many nations around the world. A Chiropractic Dr completes a rigorous and extensive education in the healing sciences. Education is quite similar to that of medical doctors however in many areas, such as anatomy, physiology, and rehabilitation, Chiropractic physicians receive more intensive education than most medical doctors. Doctors of Chiropractic are primary health care doctors and in preparation chiropractic students spend a significant portion of their curriculum studying clinical subjects related to diagnosis and treatment of patients. As part of their professional training, chiropractic students complete a minimum of a one-year clinical-based program dealing with patient care. The curriculum includes a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory and clinical experience. For more than three decades, this course of study has been approved by an accrediting agency which is fully recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Before Chiropractic physicians are allowed to practice, they must pass national board examinations and become state-licensed. Chiropractic colleges also offer post-graduate and continuing education programs in specialty fields including sports injuries, occupational health, orthopedics and neurology to name but a few. These programs allow the Chiropractic Doctor to specialize in a specialized healthcare discipline and/or meet state re-licensure requirements. Doctors of Chiropractic diagnose, treat and refer patients to other health care practitioners when appropriate.
