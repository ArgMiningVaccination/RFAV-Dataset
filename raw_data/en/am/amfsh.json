New York state law requires all students entering school grades kindergarten through 12 to be vaccinated, or to have a valid waiver, for the following: - Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis Booster (DTap for kindergartners, TdaP when the child turns 10) - (IPV or OPV) - Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) A & B - Varicella (Chickenpox) The meningitis vaccine is also recommended for children at age 11, with a second meningitis vaccine at the age of 16. The vaccine is a must, especially for students thinking about heading off to college or a U.S. basic military training center. The [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/) (AAP) also recommends children get the HPV vaccine to protect against the human papillomavirus. The latest data suggests children can begin receiving the vaccine as early as nine, with two doses providing the necessary protection. Parents should discuss vaccine updates with their child's pediatrician at every annual well child visit, as the recommendations from the AAP change annually. It is important to remember: - Vaccines are safer and more effective today than ever before. One reason is the naturally occurring additives that help sterilize vaccine fluids. - While children today are getting more vaccinations than in the past, the overall amount of immunologic agents in these vaccines is smaller. Two shots given to children in 1980 had more immunologic agents than the antigens in the entire childhood vaccination series given today. - Delaying vaccinations \u2014 or spreading them out over time \u2014 increases the risk of exposing your child to a serious and possibly life-altering illness. - Vaccines don't weaken the immune system; they boost it. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) released an analysis of the childhood immunization schedule that revealed following the recommended vaccination timeframe will prevent more than 21 million hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 years. Parents should heed the advice of their pediatricians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
