Don't let the fact that I don't fit into a box put you off, or that I don't have a perfect \"one answer for all\" sales pitch or a narrow niche (I'll bet that you are a pretty complex person also). If I appear to have a less refined, perfected and beautiful sales pitch that is because I cannot define all that I do in a small cliched sentence. I spend my time studying and working with people to find the best ways for them and as a result of this I have racked up quite a lot of experience over the past 20 years and I could tell you so many amazing stories of healing and transformation. I meet you, where you are. I see where you want to get, and we achieve this together as a team. There is no one way to heal; there is however a multitude of options and the ones that count are what will resonate with and work for you. I dip into the toolkit based on you, your goals, your personality, your beliefs and what you are ready for.
