Shake well before use 2. Give the recommended dose as indicated by the weight-based chart. Be sure to weigh your dog before starting the treatment. (Find the chart on the bottle and on the box) 3. Dose directly into your dog's mouth, for maximum absorbability. Warnings: Don't exceed the recommended dose. Do not use in conjunction with a heartworm preventative or flea/tick preventatives, as these medications toxify the kidneys, liver, blood, and body, which suppresses the immune system. Is HWF safe? While HWF is safe to use, it is not recommended for use in pregnant animals or animals intended for breeding. An examination from a veterinarian is also recommended prior to using this product. Please Note: - Do not administer to dogs of 6 weeks or younger - For animal use only - Keep out of reach of children and other animals - In case of accidental overdose, contact a health professional immediately What else can I do to make sure my dog gets rid of his heartworm? HWF will help your dog eliminate his heartworms all by itself. However, there are natural supportive measures you can include to strengthen and boost your dog's immune system: - Feed your dog raw food like raw heart (replenishes vital nutrients in your dog's heart), raw liver and kidneys (nourish and cleanse the liver and kidneys; iron in raw liver can also help prevent anemia). - Light exercise to stimulate circulation. - Don't vaccinate your dog, especially if he has heartworms. - Weigh your dog regularly; heartworms can cause lack of appetite and therefore weight loss. Giving HWF can help him get his appetite back and gain weight. Use the recommended HWF dose base on your dog's current weight to safely continue with the remedy. How Long Will HWF Last? Once opened, HWF has a four-year expiration date. Regulations prevent Amber Naturalz from extending the four years but the company has found that their tinctured products last "}
