The party will be 1-4 p.m. Saturday, April 21, with free refreshments, health screenings, kids' activities and tours of some departments. While events will be held throughout the hospital grounds, the main staging area will be between Pomerado Hospital and Pomerado Outpatient Pavilion. The hospital is at 15615 Pomerado Road in Poway. Nina Kim, Palomar Health's marketing and new media manager, said among the free offerings will be acupuncture demonstrations and chair massages; skin cancer, blood pressure, blood glucose and body mass index screenings; a germ glow activity \u2014 likely to be popular among kids; grip strength testing; addiction and depression screenings; and ask a doctor or nurse tables; and various giveaways. These include a limited supply of free children's bicycle helmets, Kim said. The helmets will be fitted on youngsters by Poway Fire Department personnel and provided by the hospital's emergency department. Other attractions for youngsters will include a clown, face painting, balloon figures, temporary tattoos and finger casting. E-waste can be brought for recycling. There will be at least 21 exhibitors representing Palomar Health departments and others, such as Arch Health Partners, Poway Fire Department, Villa Pomerado and the Women's Health Connection Boutique. At 2 p.m. dignitaries will take to the stage, with Carol LeBeau serving as master of ceremonies. The anniversary cake will be served around 2:30 p.m., Kim said. Pomerado Hospital opened on June 29, 1977, with 130 patient beds, 200 employees and more than 50 physicians. Its first baby, Adam Michael Johnson, was born that day at 1 p.m., officials said. The 150,000-square-foot hospital cost $17.5 million for construction and equipment. Ground was broken on Feb. 28, 1975; with now Palomar Health board President Ted Kleiter serving as Pomerado's first administrator during its construction. The grand opening dedication ceremony was on May 14, 1977. Over the past 35 years, additional facilities have been added. These included an expanded birthing center in 1984, Villa Pomerado skilled nursing facility in 1988, Pomerado Outpatient Pavilion in 2007 \u2014 it includes Arch Health Partners and various Palomar Health departments, and the Jean McLaughlin Women's Center for Health and Healing in 2008. Projects in the planning stages include a bridge connecting Pomerado Hospital and Pomerado Outpatient Pavilion. Dr. David Tam, Pomerado Hospital's administrator, said the hospital's 35th anniversary is important to celebrate because it is \"a long time in the life of a hospital\" and much has changed in medicine since the hospital opened. A community party also recognizes the partnership between the hospital and those it serves, he said. \"The hospital has come through a lot (with) the support of the community and it benefits ... the community,\" Tam said. \"We really see how Pomerado Hospital is really important to the community,\" Tam said, adding this is an important year in Palomar Health's history due to Palomar Medical Center West's upcoming opening in Escondido. That facility was just granted its occupancy permit, so the move-in process began this week. It is set to open in August. While the public hospital district \u2014 formerly known as Palomar Pomerado Health \u2014 recently dropped Pomerado from its name, Tam said the anniversary celebration also shows the community that Pomerado Hospital remains a key component of Palomar Health. \"2012 is a really big year for us,\" Tam said. \"We made sure Pomerado Hospital's celebration came first (of the events). This is ... a season of celebration. \"It's an opportunity to show where we are and where we are going for the next 35 years,\" Tam added. "}
