Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Main results We included five studies with /uni00A0a total of 3343 participants./uni00A0All studies were parallel RCTs, assessing the eects of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab/uni00A0every month up to five months compared to placebo or no intervention in an outpatient setting, although one study also included hospitalised infants. Most of the included studies were conducted in children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital heart disease. The risk of bias of outcomes across all studies was similar and predominately low. Palivizumab/uni00A0reduces/uni00A0hospitalisation due to RSV infection/uni00A0at two years' follow-up (risk (CI) 0.30 to 0.64;/uni00A05 studies, 3343 participants; high certainty evidence). Based on 98 hospitalisations per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 43 (29 to 62) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no dierence mortality/uni00A0at years' studies, 3343 participants;/uni00A0moderate certainty evidence). Based on 23 deaths per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 16 (10 to 27) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in little to no dierence in adverse events at 150 days' follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39;/uni00A03 studies, 2831 participants;/uni00A0moderate certainty evidence). Based on 84 cases per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 91 (71 to 117) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab probably results in a slight reduction/uni00A0in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness at 95% to 0.97;/uni00A05 studies, certainty evidence). Palivizumab/uni00A0may result in a large reduction/uni00A0in RSV infection at two years' follow-up (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55;/uni00A03 studies, 554/uni00A0participants;/uni00A0low certainty evidence). Based on 195 cases of RSV infection per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 64 (39 to 107) per 1000 participants in the palivizumab group. Palivizumab also reduces the/uni00A0number of wheezing days at one year's follow-up (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.44;/uni00A01 study, 429 participants; high certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab/uni00A0reduces/uni00A0hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no dierence in mortality or/uni00A0adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab/uni00A0results in a slight reduction/uni00A0in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness and may result in a large reduction/uni00A0in RSV infections. Palivizumab/uni00A0also reduces the/uni00A0number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. Further research is needed to establish the eect of palivizumab/uni00A0on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low- and middle-income countries, tropical regions, children/uni00A0lacking breastfeeding, living in/uni00A0poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Respiratory viruses are the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hospitalisation in infants and young children (Nair 2010; Nair 2011)./uni00A0Globally, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the infectious agent every year in this population (Nair 2010; Shi 2017). Over the past 15 years, there has been a significant reduction in child pneumonia mortality and morbidity due to the successful implementation of new vaccine schedules for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Shi 2017). In this context of scale-up in vaccines, the burden of RSV disease continues to increase (Shi 2017). RSV, now reclassified as a member of the Pneumoviridae family and Orthopneumovirus genus (Amarasinghe 2019), was first identified in 1956 (Chanock 1957 ). Its viral genome, a single-stranded and negative sensed ribonucleic acid (RNA), codes for 11 proteins (nine structural proteins and two non-structural proteins) (G\u00e1lvez 2017; Hacking 2002 ). Transmission of the virus occurs mainly due to contact with contaminated secretions, including surfaces (where RSV can survive for several hours), hands, and direct contact with respiratory secretions. Inoculation develops in the upper respiratory tract, with subsequent infection of the respiratory epithelium, triggering the main infectious mechanisms to survive. Once infected, the incubation period may last four to five days (Lessler 2009). The seasonality of RSV infection varies according to the location, with considerable fluctuations each year (Mullins 2003 ). Understanding RSV seasonality has become essential in order to determine the month in which to start immunoprophylaxis for vulnerable populations. In temperate climates, there is a clear ainity for colder seasons (Northern Hemisphere: November to April; Southern Hemisphere: April to September). However, in regions with tropical and subtropical climates, RSV may be present throughout the whole year, probably correlating with rainy seasons (Brady 2014; Hall 2009). In the USA, RSV is one of the main causes of hospitalisation, in particular amongst infants aged less than two months, with an estimated hospitalisation rate of 1970 per 100,000 population (95% confidence interval (CI), 1787 to 2177) (Arriola 2019 ). Furthermore, RSV infected children in the USA, present a higher average of all-cause cumulative hospitalisations rates, for at least five years a/f_ter the initial infection (Sim\u00f5es 2020 ). However, the burden of the disease, the number of infected per total population, and the short- and long-term complications are considerably lower in high- income countries (HIC) (Arriola 2019 ; Shi 2017). In the Western Pacific Region, the incidence of RSV hospitalisation ranged between 4.9 and 30.9 per 1000 child-years, varying according to age group (Pangesti 2019). Globally, RSV accounts for 33.1 million (uncertainty range (UR) 21.6 to 50.3) LRTI a year in children younger than five years old, mainly during the first year of life (Shi 2017), with an estimate of 90.6% (30.0 million) of these episodes occurring in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) (Shi 2017). More than three/uni00A0million (UR 2.7 to 3.8) hospital admissions worldwide in young children are due to RSV LRTI, with the highest rate in children younger than six months old, in particular in neonates with 15.9 (95% CI/uni00A08.8 to 28.9) admissions 2017). SevereRSV LRTI (hypoxaemia) accounts for 1.0 million (UR 0.6 to 1.6) hospital admissions, and very severe LRTI (hospitalised LRTI with danger signs like cyanosis, diiculty in breastfeeding or drinking, vomiting, convulsions, lethargy, unconsciousness, head nodding or ICU admission/mechanical ventilation) for 0.6 million (UR 0.4 to 1) every year in LMIC, mostly in children younger than six months old (Shi 2017). Regarding mortality, RSV is one of the leading causes of death in the paediatric population (Scheltema 2017; WHO 2018 ), with a worldwide annual estimate of 59,600 fatalities (UR 48,000 to 74,500) in children younger than five years old (Nair 2013 ). Most/uni00A0deaths occur in previously healthy children, in particular, in LMIC (Geoghegan 2017; Hall 2009; Hall 2013). In/uni00A0HIC, mortality cases are usually in older children who have a higher prevalence of comorbidities (7.0 years interquartile range (IQR) 3.6 to 16.8 and 70%, respectively) than in upper middle-income countries (4 years IQR 2.0 to 10.0 and 47%) and LMIC (5 2.3 to 11.0 and 28%) ( Scheltema 2017)./uni00A0As expected, the case fatality rate is higher in children with comorbidities, in particular, those with chronic lung diseases, congenital heart disease, premature birth, Down's syndrome, and a diagnosis of sepsis or pneumothorax during hospitalisation/uni00A0(Geoghegan 2017; Lee 2016; Thorburn 2009 ; Welliver add to this burden of disease of RSV LRTI, there is a considerable proportion of children who die at home without being hospitalised, in particular in LMIC, a reflection of limited access to hospital care (Caballero 2019; Shi 2017). RSV infection has a significant economic burden on the health system, for example, in the USA, the total annual direct medical costs for all RSV infections in children younger than five years old is USD 652 million per year (USD 394 million from hospitalisations and USD 258 million from other medical encounters) (Paramore 2004). In LMIC, the cost of each RSV episode is less expensive, but due to the larger proportion of RSV infections, the economic burden may be more significant (Zhang 2016 ). At an individual level, almost every child has been infected with the virus by the age of two years (Feldman 2015; Holberg 1991). Signs and symptoms range from an upper respiratory tract infection (nasal congestion, fever, cough, rhinorrhoea) or a LRTI (bronchiolitis or pneumonia) with diiculty breathing, wheezing, diiculty in feeding, or apnoea (Arms 2008 ; Domachowske 1999). Severity depends on the damage inflicted by the virus and the eiciency of the triggered immune response. Most children will only require ambulatory management, and only a few will need admission to a general ward (1% to 3%)/uni00A0Boyce 2000, or an ICU (less than Bont 2016 ; Herv\u00e1s 2012; at higher risk for RSV life-threatening disease include those with congenital heart disease, preterm birth, chronic lung disease, pulmonary immunodeficiency (Damore 2008; Mansbach 2012; Purcell 2004). RSV infections in children, in particular those episodes requiring hospitalisation, are associated not only with acute complications/uni00A0but also with long-term complications such as recurrent wheezing, impaired lung function and paediatric asthma (Esteban 2020; Fauroux 2017; Sigurs 2005; the intervention Palivizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) against RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, inhibiting RSV replication (Johnson 1997). It was first licenced under the name of Synagis in the Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Ltd.6Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews USA. Trials were first conducted in 1996, published in 1998 with subsequent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, proving safety and eicacy in highly vulnerable conditions (premature children/uni00A0born before 35 weeks/uni00A0and children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia) (IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998). Following approval by the European Medicines Agency in 1999, the use of the drug became worldwide (SYNAGIS \u00ae (palivizumab)). The drug is administered intramuscularly on a monthly basis during the infant's first RSV season (up to five doses at a dose of 15 mg/kg) to prevent serious RSV LRTI. In some cases, children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease receive a second season of the drug. Monoclonal antibodies promote a response that depends entirely from the given half-life of the antibody in the host, without activating the immune system or inducing immunological memory, hence the requirement of monthly injection of palivizumab/uni00A0(Baxter 2007; Soto 2020). Candidates for immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab have changed over the past 22 years, depending on countries' public health policy. Since 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines indications have become more restrictive (Brady 2014), with results still inconclusive regarding guidelines impact, however, with a worrying trend towards an increase in the number of RSV- at least 30% of individuals who receive palivizumab/uni00A0do not fit these recommendations, probably because palivizumab is the only available pharmacological prevention strategy against RSV (Trist 2018). Since its first use, palivizumab has proved to be eective in several clinical trials in dierent settings (Anderson 2017; IMpact- RSV Study Group 1998; Moore 2019). In a Cochrane Review from 2013, a significant eect was seen for palivizumab in preventing hospitalisations when compared to placebo (risk ratio /uni00A00.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64) (Andabaka 2013). However, the cost of the medication remains high at USD 1416 per 100 mg. This is an important obstacle for its use, particularly in LMIC. This has led to a cost-eectiveness analysis in dierent countries, settings, and conditions (Andabaka 2013). Although it has been proven cost-eective in some countries (Mac 2019; Schmidt 2017 ), studies in Israel and Germany tend to disagree airming that a substantial decrease in the cost (36.8% to 83.3%) is needed in order/uni00A0to be a cost-eective strategy amongst vulnerable populations (Blanken 2013; Ginsberg 2018). As a consequence of its high economic burden, dierent studies have assessed whether a shorter course of palivizumab would provide the same eicacy and same RSV antibody levels than the regular five doses with inconclusive results (Claydon 2017; Claydon 2019; La Via 2013 ; Moore 2019; Robbie 2012). Other pharmacologic strategies have been assessed since RSV was first identified in 1956, and several are now under investigation and development (Mejias 2015 ; Sim\u00f5es 2018 ; Tripp 2017). Palivizumab was also tested as an intravenous infusion during an acute RSV episode, but showed no benefit (Alansari 2019 ), nor RSV immunoglobulin ( mAb against RSV F glycoprotein, but with a 70-fold increase in ainity compared to palivizumab was tested for preventing RSV LRTI (Fern\u00e1ndez 2010). Although it proved to be more eicient than palivizumab in preventing RSV hospitalisations, it was not approved by the FDA due to dermatological side eects (Carbonell- Estrany 2010). Other mAbs under investigation include human IgA antibody formats of palivizumab and motavizumab/uni00A0(Jacobino2018), anti RSV G glycoprotein longer half-life (Griin 2020 ; Zhu 2017). How the intervention might work Palivizumab is a humanised monoclonal immunoglobulin G1, directed against an epitope of RSV surface glycoprotein F (Johnson 1997). When binding to it, palivizumab prevents the fusion of the viral particle and host cell membrane (avoiding the entry of the viral genome used for replication and transcription) and might also suppress the syncytia formation in respiratory epithelial cells (Soto 2020; Young 2002). In addition, palivizumab diminishes viral activity and/uni00A0cell-to-cell transmission, reducing RSV virulence and its risk of developing RSV LRTI (Collins 2011 ). Why it is important to do this review In 2013, a Cochrane Review assessed the role of palivizumab in preventing/uni00A0RSV LRTI (Andabaka 2013). Since then, many trials have continued evaluating its eectiveness and defining its usefulness in dierent subpopulations. /uni00A0A non-Cochrane systematic review on the topic was published in 2014 with methodological limitations (Wegzyn 2014), such as the lack of risk of bias assessment. Given the high cost of the drug, it is essential to know if palivizumab continues to be eective in preventing severe RSV disease in high-risk children. Meanwhile, the proportion of RSV infections continues to rise, especially in LMIC; despite the probable changing landscape regarding RSV interventions, palivizumab continues to be the only approved RSV-related drug. Our main goal is to provide a high-quality review of the evidence on the eects of palivizumab in preventing severe RSV infection in/uni00A0children.

We included children with immunodeficiency/uni00A0disorders./uni00A0We excluded children with/uni00A0cystic fibrosis, as a related Cochrane Review has already been published on that topic/uni00A0(Robinson 2016). Types of interventions We included trials comparing palivizumab/uni00A0given intramuscularly or intravenously at a dose of 15 mg/kg once a month (maximum five doses) with placebo, no intervention or standard care alone (oxygen supplementation, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, etc). We included/uni00A0co-interventions (e.g. Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews corticosteroids) provided they were not part of the randomised treatment and were consistent/uni00A0across groups. Types of outcome measures The outcomes listed here were not eligibility criteria for this review but were outcomes of interest within the included studies. Primary outcomes 1.Hospitalisation due to RSV infection:/uni00A0defined as the number of children hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed infection. 2.Mortality: death due to all causes. We also reported the cause of deaths for each group (including deaths related to RSV infection). 3.Adverse events: defined as any unexpected or harmful occurrence in the participant, such as rash, pain in the injection site, fever, nausea,/uni00A0vomiting, diarrhoea, etc., reported in absolute numbers or proportions. We intended to/uni00A0report non- serious and serious adverse events (including death, disability, life-threatening events/uni00A0or/uni00A0those requiring hospitalisations) separately. Had there/uni00A0been multiple events reported within one participant, we would have reported this separately. Secondary outcomes 1.Hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness: defined as the number of children needing admission to hospital for treatment of respiratory symptoms without alternative aetiology and with negative RSV antigen test or no test done. 2.Length of hospital stay: number of days in which a child has been hospitalised due to RSV infection or or bronchodilator use reported by parents. 5.Days of supplemental oxygen. 6.Intensive care unit length of stay. 7.Mechanical ventilation days. For continuous outcomes only available in a subset of participants (length of hospital stay, number of wheezing days, days of supplemental oxygen, ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation days) we presented the data as days per 100 randomised children following the guidance in Section 6.9 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019a ). Timing of outcome measurement We considered outcomes measured up to and including 12 months a/f_ter randomisation as short term and more than 12/uni00A0months as long term. When multiple results were reported for each outcome, we included the longest follow-up in each category. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We searched the following sources from the inception of each database to the date of search with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status: 1.the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2021, Issue 10) searched 14 October 2021;2.MEDLINE (Ovid)/uni00A0from 1946 to 14 October 2021; 3.Embase/uni00A0(Elsevier.com)/uni00A0from 1947 to 15 October 2020; 4.Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS) (BIREME) from 1982 to/uni00A014 October 2021; 5.CINAHL/uni00A0(Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) from 1981 to 14 October 2021; and 6.Scopus/uni00A0from 1970 to 14 October 2021. For detailed search strategies, see/uni00A0Appendix 1 . Searching other resources We attempted to identify other potentially eligible studies or ancillary publications by searching the reference list of included studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology assessment reports. We contacted experts in the field to identify additional unpublished materials. We searched the websites of relevant manufacturers for information on trials. We sought errata or retractions of the included studies. We contacted authors of the included studies to identify other unpublished studies./uni00A0We searched for registered and ongoing trials in the following trial registers: 1.ClinicalTrials.gov (www.ClinicalTrials.gov)/uni00A0searched 14 October 2021; and 2.World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform/uni00A0(WHO ICTRP) (www.who.int/trialsearch/)/uni00A0searched 14 October 2021. For detailed search strategies, see/uni00A0Appendix 1 . Data collection and analysis Selection of studies We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to help assess the search results./uni00A0Screen4Me comprises three components: known assessments - a service that matches records in the search results to records that have already been screened in Cochrane Crowd and been labelled as an RCT or as Not an RCT; the RCT classifier - a machine learning model that distinguishes RCTs from non-RCTs, and if appropriate, Cochrane Crowd - Cochrane's citizen science platform where the Crowd help to identify and describe health evidence. For more information about Screen4Me and the evaluations that have been done, visit the Screen4Me webpage on the Cochrane Information Specialist's portal: https://community.cochrane.org/ organizational-info/resources/resources- specialists-portal. More detailed information regarding evaluations of the Screen4Me components can also be found in the Noel-Storr 2020; Noel-Storr 2021;Thomas 2020 . Two/uni00A0review authors (LG, LS) independently screened the titles and abstracts of studies we identified/uni00A0as a result of the search for potential inclusion in the review. We retrieved the full-text study reports/publications deemed potentially eligible, and two review authors (LG, LS) independently screened the full texts and identified/uni00A0studies for inclusion and identified and recorded reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third review author (JVAF) when required. We identified/uni00A0and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of the same study so that each study rather than each report was the unit of interest in the review. We/uni00A0recorded the selection process in suicient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and/uni00A0Characteristics of excluded studies/uni00A0table (Moher 2009 ). We used/uni00A0Covidence so/f_tware for study selection (Covidence)./uni00A0We did not impose any language restrictions. Data extraction and management We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that had been piloted on at least one study in the review. One review author (LG or LS) extracted study characteristics from the included studies. We/uni00A0extracted the following study characteristics. 1.Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of any 'run-in' period, number of study centres and location, study setting, withdrawals, and date of study. 2.Participants: N, mean age, age range, gender, severity of condition, diagnostic criteria, baseline lung function, RSV infection history, inclusion criteria/uni00A0and exclusion criteria. 3.Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, and excluded medications. 4.Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, and time points reported. 5.Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. Two review authors (LG, LS) independently extracted outcome data from included studies. We/uni00A0noted in the/uni00A0Characteristics of included studies/uni00A0table if outcome data were not reported in a useable way. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus or by involving a third review author (JVAF). One review author (LG) transferred data into Review Manager 5 so/f_tware (Review Manager 2020). A second review author (JVAF) double-checked that data had been entered correctly by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the study reports. The second review author (JVAF)/uni00A0spot- checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two/uni00A0review authors (LG,/uni00A0LS) independently assessed risk of bias of the results of the main outcomes (those included in the/uni00A0Summary of findings 1 , see below) in each study using a recently developed revision of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2: a revised tool to assess the risk of bias in randomised trials)/uni00A0(Higgins 2019a ; Sterne 2019). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving another review author (JVAF). We assessed risk of bias according to the following domains. 1.The randomisation process. 2.Deviations from intended interventions. 3.Missing outcome data. 4.Measurement of the outcome. 5.Selection of the reported results. Answers to signalling questions and supporting information/uni00A0collectively led to a domain-level judgement in the form of 'low risk', 'some concerns', or 'high risk' of bias. These domain-level judgements informed an overall risk of bias judgement for the outcome. We/uni00A0considered the algorithm/uni00A0proposed judgements and provided a quote from the study report togetherwith a justification for our judgement in the risk of bias table. We also provided reasons for judgments that did/uni00A0not follow the algorithm. We/uni00A0summarised the /uni00A0risk of bias judgements across dierent studies for each of the domains listed. When judging the bias due to deviations from intended interventions, we focused the analyses on the eect of assignment to intervention (Higgins 2019a)./uni00A0We/uni00A0aimed to source published protocols for the assessment of selective reporting. Where information on risk of bias related/uni00A0to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we/uni00A0noted this in the risk of bias table. We used the 22 August 2019 version of the RoB 2/uni00A0Excel tool to manage the data supporting the answers to the signalling questions and risk of bias judgements (available at/uni00A0https:// www.riskofbias.info/). All these data/uni00A0are/uni00A0publicly available as supplementary material in the Open Science Framework platform (osf.io/). For cluster-RCTs, we would have used the RoB 2/uni00A0tool and added/uni00A0an/uni00A0additional domain specific to cluster RCTs from the archived version of the tool (Domain 1b - 'Bias arising from the timing of identification and recruitment of participants'; see https://www.riskofbias.info/) with its corresponding signalling questions, following the guidance in Section 23.1.2/uni00A0and Table 23.1.a of the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2019c ). We made summary assessments of the risk of bias for each short- and long-term result for each outcome (across domains) within and across studies (Higgins 2019a ). Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic review We conducted the review according to the published protocol and reported any deviations from it in the/uni00A0Dierences between protocol and review/uni00A0section of the systematic review. Measures of treatment eect We entered the outcome data for each study into data tables in Review Manager 5 to calculate the treatment eects (Review Manager 2020)./uni00A0 We analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data as mean dierence (MD). We reported corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We entered data presented as a scale with a consistent direction of eect. We undertook/uni00A0meta-analyses only where this was meaningful, that is if the treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense. Unit of analysis issues Where multiple trial arms were reported in a single trial, we included only the treatment arms relevant to the review topic. If two comparisons (e.g. drug A versus placebo and drug B versus placebo) were combined in the same study, we would have followed/uni00A0the guidance in Section 6.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to avoid double-counting (Higgins 2019b ). Our preferred approach would have been to combine groups to create a single pair-wise comparison. For cluster-RCTs, we would have considered the cluster as the unit of analysis, not the individual participant, in order to avoid/uni00A0unit of analysis errors, as stated in Section 23.1.1 of the/uni00A0Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019b ) Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Ltd.9Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Dealing with missing data We contacted investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and to obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study was identified as abstract only). If numerical outcome data such as standard deviations or correlation coeicients were missing, and they could not be obtained from the authors, we calculated them from other available statistics such as P values according to the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019b ). Assessment of heterogeneity We used the I/two.sups statistic to measure heterogeneity amongst the trials in each analysis. If we identified/uni00A0substantial heterogeneity, we/uni00A0reported it and explored possible causes by prespecified subgroup analysis. We used the rough guide to interpretation as outlined in Chapter 10/uni00A0of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic may represent moderate heterogeneity; 3.50% represent substantial heterogeneity; and 4.75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. We avoided the use of absolute cut-o values but interpreted I/two.sups in relation to the size and direction of eects and strength of evidence for heterogeneity. We performed a random-eects/uni00A0meta-analysis, which accounts for between-study heterogeneity. Assessment of reporting biases If there were more than 10 trials, we would create and examin a funnel plot to explore possible small-study and publication biases./uni00A0If searches identified/uni00A0trial protocols, clinical trial registrations or abstracts indicating the existence of unpublished studies, we attempted to determine the status of any unpublished studies through contact with the investigators. We considered outcome reporting bias in our risk of bias assessments. Data synthesis We pooled data from studies judged to be clinically homogeneous using Review Manager 5 so/f_tware (Review Manager 2020). If more than one study provided/uni00A0useable data in any single comparison, we performed a meta-analysis. We used a random-eects model, as this is usually a more conservative approach./uni00A0We included/uni00A0all studies in the primary analysis and planned to explore/uni00A0the eect of bias in a sensitivity analysis (see/uni00A0 Sensitivity analysis ). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity We planned to carry/uni00A0out the following subgroup analyses. 1.High-risk children (e.g. children with heart disease, respiratory diseases, premature children, children with low birth weight) versus average-risk children. 2.Tropical regions versus non-tropical regions.3.High-income countries versus low- and middle-income countries We were only able to carry out the subgroup analysis for high- income countries versus low- and middle-income countries, and only for the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness. We/uni00A0used the Chi/two.sups test to test for subgroup interactions in Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2020). Sensitivity analysis We had planned to carry/uni00A0out the following sensitivity analyses: 1.Repeated the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if there were any). 2.Repeated/uni00A0the analysis/uni00A0excluding studies at an overall high risk of bias. 3.Repeated the analysis excluding small studies (if there were any). However,/uni00A0no studies fitted the criteria. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence We created/uni00A0Summary of findings 1/uni00A0using the following outcomes: 1.hospitalisation 5.RSV infection (long-term); and 6.number of wheezing days (three to six years). Two review authors (LG, LS)/uni00A0used the five GRADE considerations (overall RoB 2 judgement, consistency of eect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty/uni00A0of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified outcomes (Atkins 2004). We used the methods and recommendations described in/uni00A0Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic GRADEproGDT so/f_tware (GRADEpro GDT). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving another review author (JVAF). We assessed evidence certainty according to the GRADE criteria. We considered RCTs as high certainty evidence if the five factors above related to risk if bias (see/uni00A0Assessment of risk of bias in included studies) were not present to any serious degree, but downgraded the certainty to moderate, low or very low as needed. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence once if a GRADE consideration was serious, and twice if very serious. We justified/uni00A0all decisions to down- or upgrade the certainty of the evidence using footnotes, and made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Four of studies were multicentre/uni00A0studies (Blanken 2013; Feltes 2003; IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998; studies were also multinational studies (Feltes 2003; IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998), conducted in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Poland, France and the United Kingdom. The other two multicentre studies were conducted in the United States,/uni00A0Subramanian/uni00A01998, and the Netherlands,/uni00A0Blanken 2013. One study was a single-centre study conducted in Turkey (Tavsu 2014). All studies were reported in the English language. Participants Three studies included infants 24 months of age or younger at the start of the RSV season with a gestational age of 35 weeks or less (Blanken 2013; IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998; Subramanian/uni00A01998)./uni00A0One study included infants with a gestational age of/uni00A032 weeks or younger/uni00A0who were hospitalised in the neonatal ICU, infants 12 months of age or less at the beginning of the RSV season with a gestational age of 28 weeks, and/uni00A0infants born at 29 to 32 weeks of gestational age who were younger than six months old at the beginning of RSV season (Tavsu 2014)./uni00A0Two studies included/uni00A0children who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and were 24 months of age or younger (IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998; Subramanian/uni00A01998)./uni00A0 Finally, one study included children 24 months old or younger/uni00A0at the time of randomisation/uni00A0with documented haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD) determined by the investigator and had unoperated or partially corrected CHD (Feltes 2003). Interventions In all of the included trials,/uni00A0palivizumab was delivered intramuscularly, except for one study in which it was delivered intravenously (Subramanian/uni00A01998)./uni00A0 All studies delivered 15 mg/kg doses. One study was a dose-escalation study, testing three dierent doses (Subramanian/uni00A01998); only data for the recommended approved dose of 15 mg/kg were included in our analyses. Four studies compared palivizumab against placebo palivizumab versus no intervention (Tavsu 2014). Outcomes All studies reported the eect of the intervention on hospitalisation due to RSV infection, all-cause mortality, and hospitalisations due to respiratory-related illness. Three studies reported adverse events (Feltes 2003; IMpact-RSV Study Group (Blanken 2013; Subramanian/uni00A01998; Tavsu 2014). Two studies reported length of hospital stay, days of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit length of stay, and mechanical ventilation days (Feltes 2003; IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998). One study reported the number of wheezing days ( Blanken 2013). Funding sources Most studies (four of five studies, 80%)/uni00A0did not specify their funding sources./uni00A0Blanken 2013/uni00A0was funded by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott International PLC (UK)) and the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development, with no restrictions for publication of the research data.Excluded studies We excluded 11/uni00A0reports a/f_ter full-text assessment. One report compared palivizumab against motavizumab (EUCTR2007-002070-61-PL). Two reports were informative summaries/uni00A0with no authors declared and no original research data reported (Anonymous 1999 ; Anonymous 2004 ). One report was a narrative review (Driver 1999). Another report was an evidence synopsis (Ignacio 2013 ). The remaining six/uni00A0reports were observational studies Pin 2002; Rajakumar 2009; Tulloh 2011). Risk of bias in included studies The risk of bias assessments for each outcome, including all domain judgements and support for judgement, are provided in the risk of bias tables within the/uni00A0Characteristics of included studies/uni00A0section and at the side of all forest plots. To access the further detailed risk of bias assessment data, visit https://osf.io/26dns/ (DOI/uni00A010.17605/ OSF.IO/26DNS). Risk of bias was similar across most outcomes, judged as 'low'. The only exception was outcomes reported by one study (Tavsu 2014) which were judged as 'some concerns'. This trial/uni00A0did not adequately describe allocation concealment/uni00A0and, unlike the other trials, it compared palivizumab to 'no intervention', which/uni00A0raised concerns due to/uni00A0deviations from intended interventions, as this was not adequately described. This study reported hospitalisations (due to respiratory illness and RSV infection), mortality and RSV infection. However, this did not aect our GRADE judgement for these results considering the trial's relative contribution to the overall estimate.

D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results We included five studies with a total of 3343 participants assessing the eect of palivizumab/uni00A0compared to placebo or no intervention/uni00A0for preventing severe RSV infection in children. The certainty of the evidence for most outcomes was moderate to high. Palivizumab/uni00A0reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection (high certainty evidence) and probably results in a slight reduction/uni00A0in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness/uni00A0at two years' follow-up (moderate certainty evidence)./uni00A0Palivizumab probably results in little to no dierence in mortality and adverse events and may/uni00A0result in little to no dierence in length of hospital stay, days of supplemental oxygen, length of stay in the ICU, and mechanical ventilation days at 150 days' follow-up (low to moderate certainty evidence). Palivizumab may result in a large reduction/uni00A0in RSV infection at two years' follow-up (low certainty evidence)./uni00A0Palivizumab reduces the/uni00A0number of wheezing days at one year's follow-up (high certainty evidence). Overall completeness and applicability of evidence Participants in the included studies were similar to those that would be found in clinical practice, that is with a higher risk of severe RSV infection. The studies were conducted mainly in children and infants from six to 12 months old at the beginning of the RSV season. Two studies/uni00A0included participants with/uni00A0bronchopulmonary dysplasia and one study included participants with/uni00A0CHD, which might introduce a source of clinical heterogeneity. We deemed this not important for most outcomes./uni00A0Most of the included studies delivered palivizumab intramuscularly, which is the current preferred route of administration (only one study delivered palivizumab intravenously). Most studies reported all of the outcomes of interest in this review./uni00A0We found heterogeneity in outcomes definitions amongst studies. Some outcomes reported hospitalisations under adverse events. Nevertheless, we were able to extract and analyse the available data/uni00A0accordingly./uni00A0 Consistent with the 2013 Cochrane Review (Andabaka 2013), palivizumab reduced the risk for RSV-related hospitalisation, presenting similar statistical results. This conclusion reinforces the safety and eicacy of its use in high-risk children, in line with the dierent existing guidelines recommending its use (Brady 2014). Furthermore, these updated findings are of paramount significance in the context of the changing landscape of RSV Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Ltd.16Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews preventive interventions, including a new single-dose monoclonal antibody against RSV fusion protein (nirsevimab) that successfully diminished the incidence of RSV-associated/uni00A0lower respiratory tract infection episodes and hospitalisations (Griin 2020 ). Interestingly, we found that palivizumab resulted in a higher reduction in/uni00A0hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness in/uni00A0LMIC than in HIC. This finding is aligned with the higher burden of RSV disease described in LMIC (Shi 2017). Moreover, a recent randomised clinical trial using a single intramuscular dose of RSV fusion protein nanoparticle vaccine in pregnant women showed a higher vaccine eicacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in LMIC than in HIC (Madhi 2020 ). The eect of palivizumab on mortality was downgraded due to imprecision, which may also be due to the fact that the included studies were not from LMIC, and the overall mortality was low. Palivizumab also resulted in a reduction in the number of wheezing days during the first year of life, in line with similar probe studies assessing this outcome (Yoshihara 2013). Being able to prevent recurrent wheezing is of great impact in preschoolers since it is one of the most frequent chronic pathologies in that age range (Stein 1999). Despite these encouraging results, in two follow-up studies, no dierences in the diagnosis of asthma were seen at age six a/f_ter the use of palivizumab (Mochizuki 2017; Scheltema 2018), although the eects of palivizumab on the subsequent diagnosis of asthma may be dier depending on the atopic status of the studied individuals ( Sim\u00f5es 2010 ). Quality of the evidence The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate to high./uni00A0Most outcomes reported in the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. A common problem found in several of the included studies/uni00A0was the incomplete reporting of dispersion measures that were not provided, leading us to calculate standard deviation converted from P/uni00A0values and thus making us less/uni00A0confident about the precision of the results. Some studies were very small and had few events which led to important imprecision. We were unable to assess publication bias due to the scarcity of studies per outcome. Potential biases in the review process We rearranged/uni00A0the mortality outcome to maximise the use of available data. We took precautions to avoid bias in this process by documenting all changes in the Dierences between protocol and review section of the review. We found that several outcomes were reported in a subset of patients, such as hospitalised patients. As/uni00A0there were no data regarding all randomised participants /uni00A0in these cases, we decided to consider them as trials' exploratory analyses. We followed the guidelines in/uni00A0Section 6.5/uni00A0of the CochraneHandbook to obtain the standard deviation converted from P/uni00A0values (Higgins 2019c). We assumed a normal distribution of the available data. However, the probability of non-normal distribution of data remains, as no precise evidence of normal distribution could be found in the trial reports. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews A previous Cochrane Review incorporating most of the studies included in our review found/uni00A0that palivizumab prophylaxis waseective in reducing the frequency of hospitalisations due to RSV infection and reducing the incidence of severe lower respiratory tract RSV disease in children with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease/uni00A0or/uni00A0those born prematurely (Andabaka 2013). However, the comparators considered/uni00A0in/uni00A0Andabaka 2013/uni00A0diered from those in our review. A previous non-Cochrane systematic review included all of the studies in our review (Wegzyn 2014). Although our review did not include any new studies, we expanded the available knowledge related to the eect of palivizumab on dierent outcomes not considered in the previously mentioned review (Wegzyn 2014), such as the number of wheezing days. Furthermore, our review adds the risk of bias and certainty of the evidence assessments, which may be useful for decision-makers in the clinical setting and may also guide the design of future research. One review found similar results regarding all-cause mortality and RSV hospitalisation amongst preterm infants at high risk (Checchia 2011); however, it included observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, and found mortality and hospitalisation/uni00A0rates lower than those found in our study. Another review found that prophylaxis with palivizumab/uni00A0reduced hospital admissions in preterm infants with or without chronic lung disease (Wang 2008). It also found that palivizumab/uni00A0reduced hospitalisation rate due to RSV amongst children with congenital heart disease./uni00A0None of these non-Cochrane systematic reviews were/uni00A0of high quality, and none of them incorporated GRADE methods in assessing the certainty of the evidence. We found additional systematic reviews and health technology/uni00A0assessments concluding that palivizumab is eective in reducing hospital stay and risk of admission in children with congenital heart disease (Harris 2011 ),/uni00A0 prematurely born infants, infants with lung complications, and infants from remote communities (Mac 2019), but did not provide value for money because of its exceptionally high cost (Harris 2011 ). In this regard, a/uni00A0previous Cochrane Review found inconsistencies in palivizumab's cost-eectiveness, due to wide variations in incremental cost- eectiveness ratios (ICER), arising from dierent mortality rates, time horizons, and stakeholders' perspectives used in economic models/uni00A0(Andabaka 2013). No previous review reported results for the number of wheezing days. This is a major issue, given the spreading hypothesis and studies suggesting that RSV infection is a risk factor for recurrent wheezing amongst infants and young children/uni00A0(Schauer 2002 ). A U T H O R S ' /uni00A0 C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab/uni00A0reduces/uni00A0hospitalisation due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and results in little to no dierence in mortality or/uni00A0adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab/uni00A0results in a slight reduction/uni00A0in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness and may result in a large reduction/uni00A0in severe RSV infections. Palivizumab/uni00A0also reduces the/uni00A0number of wheezing days. Despite our aim to determine the eect of palivizumab/uni00A0for preventing severe RSV infection in all children, no studies were found on healthy children without/uni00A0a higher risk for RSV life-threatening Palivizumab for preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Further research must consider the cost of the intervention in relation to the potential benefits arising from extended use and the subsequent impact on equity.

We included one trial administrating palivizumab intravenously in order to maximize the use of available information (Subramanian/uni00A01998). We highlighted this in the results section. Change in the outcomes Mortality: we broadened this definition to/uni00A0\"death due to all causes\" as it would result in better use of the available information, considering that the trials had not systematically reported this information. Nevertheless, we/uni00A0also reported the cause of deaths for each group (including deaths related to RSV infection) when this information was available. Length of hospital stay:/uni00A0based on input from the Cochrane Methods Support Unit this outcome was removed from the summary of findings table/uni00A0as it is reported in a subset of patients, which breaks randomisation and is considered a post hoc analysis in the trial that does not include all randomised participants and therefore does not comply with the/uni00A0analyses on the eect of assignment to intervention. We considered it an/uni00A0exploratory outcome and reported it accordingly. We changed the order of the outcomes in the review. We changed the primary outcome to prevention of RSV hospitalisation and moved hospitalisation due to any respiratory infection to a secondary outcome, as suggested by peer reviewers. Number of wheezing days: considering that the single included study providing datat for this outcome reported multiple analyses (including the total log days and the total symptoms days), we chose to display the relative reduction in the rate of daily wheezing to avoid any unit of analysis errors. Search strategy The search strategy was first performed on 15 October, 2020, and updated in October 2021. However, we did not update the Embase search strategy as we lacked access to the database this year, although the Embase records can be retrieved through CENTRAL. Methods not implemented/uni00A0/uni00A0 /uni00A0 We did not use the search filter for randomised controlled trials (Lefebvre 2019), since we used Screen4Me to identify trials. Primary outcomes We intended to report serious adverse events separately, however, the included studies reported the global incidence of adverse events. Nevertheless, we disaggregated some of these events (such as hospitalisation due to respiratory illness and overall mortality). Subgroup analyses We were not able to carry out two of our prespecified subgroup analyses (high-risk children/uni00A0versus average-risk children and tropical regions versus non-tropical regions) as we found no/uni00A0studies with these characteristics. We were able to carry out the remaining subgroup analysis (high-income countries versus low- and middle-income countries) only for the outcome hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness. Sensitivity analyses We moved the specifications regarding sensitivity analysis from the/uni00A0Data synthesis/uni00A0section of the protocol to/uni00A0Sensitivity analysis /uni00A0section in the full review.
