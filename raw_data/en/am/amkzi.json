It is very contagious, and spreads quickly. Most people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory symptoms that feel much like a cold or flu. But it can be much more serious for older adults, people with underlying medical conditions, and those who haven't been vaccinated and fully boosted against COVID-19. Some people may go on to suffer from post-COVID conditions, known as \"long COVID.\" Vaccines against COVID-19 are very safe and effective. They are the best defense against the virus, as they protect against serious disease, hospitalization, and death. Two doses and a booster of the updated bivalent mRNA vaccines are recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older, even those who have already had COVID-19. People over 65 years and some people who are immunocompromised are eligible for a second booster. Even if you have been vaccinated, you will want to follow public health guidelines. That may mean temporarily wearing masks indoors or avoiding large gatherings if COVID-19 levels are high in your area. The good news is these steps will also reduce your risk of developing other respiratory viruses, like colds or flus, too. We know a lot more about COVD-19 than we did in 2020 and yet we're still learning. We will continue to provide important updates.

[Terms to know] aerosols: infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Aerosols are emitted by a person infected with coronavirus \u2014 even one with no symptoms \u2014 when they talk, breathe, cough, or sneeze. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. Aerosolized coronavirus can remain in the air for up to three hours. A mask can help prevent that spread. antibodies: proteins made by the immune system to fight infections. If the antibodies later encounter the same infection, they help prevent illness by recognizing the microbe and preventing it from entering cells. antibody test: also known as a serologic test, an antibody test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. An antibody test can indicate if you were previously infected but is not a reliable way to determine whether you are currently infected. antigen: a substance displayed on the surface of a microbe that stimulates the body to produce an immune response. antigen test: a diagnostic test that detects specific proteins on the surface of the virus. booster: an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine given after protection from the initial vaccine series begins to decline. A homologous booster is the same brand as the initial vaccine; a heterologous booster is a different brand than the initial vaccine. community spread (community transmission): is said to have occurred when people have been infected without any knowledge of contact with someone who has the same infection contact tracing: a process that begins with identifying everyone a person diagnosed with a given illness (in this case COVID-19) has been in contact with since they became contagious. The contacts are notified that they are at risk, and may include those who share the person's home, as well as people who were in the same place around the same time as the person with COVID-19 \u2014 a school, office, restaurant, or doctor's office, for example. Contacts may be quarantined or asked to isolate themselves if they start to experience symptoms, and are more likely to be tested for coronavirus if they begin to experience symptoms. containment: refers to limiting the spread of an illness. Because no vaccines exist to prevent COVID-19 and no specific therapies exist to treat it, containment is done using public health interventions. These may include identifying and isolating those who are ill, and tracking down anyone they have had contact with and possibly placing them under quarantine. diagnostic test: indicates whether you are currently infected with COVID-19. A sample is collected using a swab of your nose, your nose and throat, or your saliva. The sample is then checked for the virus's genetic material (PCR test) or for specific viral proteins (antigen test). effectiveness: indicates the benefit of a vaccine in the real world. efficacy: indicates the benefit of a vaccine compared to a placebo in the context of a clinical trial. epidemic: a disease outbreak in a community or region flattening the curve: refers to the epidemic curve, a statistical chart used to visualize the number of new cases over a given period of time during a disease outbreak. Flattening the curve is shorthand for implementing mitigation strategies to slow things down, so that fewer new cases develop over a longer period of time. This increases the chances that hospitals and other healthcare facilities will be equipped to handle any influx of patients. false negative: a test result that mistakenly indicates you are not infected when you are. false positive: a test result that mistakenly indicates you are infected when you are not. herd immunity: herd immunity occurs when enough people become immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely. As a result, the entire community is protected, even those who are not themselves immune. Herd immunity is usually achieved through vaccination, but it can also occur through natural infection. immunity: partial or complete protection from a specific infection because a person has either had that infection previously or has been vaccinated against it. incubation period: the period of time between exposure to an infection and when symptoms begin isolation: the separation of people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick long-haulers: people who have not fully recovered from COVID-19 weeks or even months after first experiencing symptoms. mitigation: refers to steps taken to limit the impact of an illness. Because no vaccines exist to prevent COVID-19 and no specific therapies exist to treat it, mitigation strategies may include frequent and thorough handwashing, not touching your face, staying away from people who are sick, social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and regularly cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects at home, in schools, at work, and in other settings. mutation: A change to a virus's genetic material that occurs when the virus is replicating. The change is passed on to future generations of the virus. monoclonal antibodies: laboratory-produced proteins designed to mimic naturally occurring antibodies that target specific antigens on viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. mRNA: short for messenger ribonucleic acid, mRNA is genetic material that contains instructions for making proteins. mRNA vaccines: mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 contain synthetic mRNA. Inside the body, the mRNA enters human cells and instructs them to produce the \"spike\" protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. The body recognizes the spike protein as an invader, and produces antibodies against it. If the antibodies later encounter the actual virus, they are ready to recognize and destroy it before it causes illness. pandemic: a disease outbreak affecting large populations or a whole region, country, or continent physical distancing: also called social distancing, refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough physical distance (a minimum of six feet) between yourself and another person to reduce the risk of breathing in droplets or aerosols that are produced when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test: a diagnostic test that detects the presence of the virus's genetic material. post-viral syndrome: the constellation of symptoms experienced by COVID-19 long haulers. These symptoms may include fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, chills, body ache, headache, joint pain, chest pain, cough, and lingering loss of taste or smell. presumptive positive test result: a positive test for the virus that causes COVID-19, performed by a local or state health laboratory, is considered \"presumptive\" until the result is confirmed by the CDC. While awaiting confirmation, people with a presumptive positive test result will be considered to be infected. quarantine: separates and restricts the movement of people who have a contagious disease, have symptoms that are consistent with the disease, or were exposed to a contagious disease, to see if they become sick SARS-CoV-2: short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 is the official name for the virus responsible for COVID-19. social distancing: also called physical distancing, refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough physical distance (a minimum of six feet) between yourself and another person to reduce the risk of breathing in droplets or aerosols that are produced when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. It is possible to safely maintain social connections while social distancing, through phone calls, video chats, and social media platforms. spike protein: a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that binds to and allows the virus to enter human cells. variant: A virus containing one or more mutations that make it different from a version of the virus that has been circulating. variants of concern: SARS-CoV-2 viruses with mutations that make them more likely to spread, evade vaccines, or make people sicker. vector: a harmless capsule. In a vaccine, a vector may be used to deliver a substance into the body in order to prompt an immune response. virus: a virus is the smallest of infectious microbes, smaller than bacteria or fungi. A virus consists of a small piece of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein shell. Viruses cannot survive without a living cell in which to reproduce. Once a virus enters a living cell (the host cell) and takes over a cell's inner workings, the cell cannot carry out its normal life-sustaining tasks. The host cell becomes a virus manufacturing plant, making viral parts that then reassemble into whole viruses and go on to infect other cells. Eventually, the host cell dies.
