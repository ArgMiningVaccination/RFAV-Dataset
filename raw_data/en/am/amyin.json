At this time, people who already had monkeypox during this outbreak are not recommended to get vaccinated. What is the JYNNEOS vaccine? The JYNNEOS vaccine has been auth orized for emergency use in the U.S. for the prevention of monkeypox and smallpox. The vaccine contains vaccinia virus, which is a virus related to the monkeypox and smallpox viruses, that has been weakened, cannot copy itself in human cells, and cannot sp read to other parts of the body or people. The vaccine can help protect people against monkeypox when given before exposure to the virus, reduce the risk of infection if given within four days after exposure, and reduce the risk of serious illness if given within 14 days after exposure. When should JYNNEOS vaccine be given after an exposure? JYNNEOS vaccine should be given within 4 days from the date of exposure, if possible, to help prevent onset of the disease. If given between 4 -14 days after the date of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease, but may not prevent the disease. If monkeypox rash has already appeared , JYNNEOS vaccine is not recommended. How is the JYNNEOS vaccine given? For an intradermal injection, a small needle is used to inject vaccine in to the skin on the forearm. For people under 18 years old and people of any age with a history of developing keloid scars , the injection is given under the skin. What are common side effects of the vaccine? Side effects are common but usually mild. Most people have redness, swelling, itchiness and pain where they got the shot. Tiredness, headache , muscle pain and nausea can also occur after vaccination. How many doses do I need? The JYNNEOS vaccine is a two- dose vaccine. People should get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. A person will start to build protection after their first dose but will not have greatest protection until two weeks after the second dose . How well does the vaccine work? Clinical trial data shows the vaccine should be effective in preventing monkeypox. We do not have real- world data on vaccine effectiveness and do not know how well the vaccine will prevent monkeypox in the current outbreak. For thi s reason, it is important to continue other prevention measures until two weeks after your second dose , such as taking a break from activities that may increase exposure to monkeypox . What should I do if I have a serious health problem after vaccination? Signs of a severe allergic reaction include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. If you think you are having a severe allergic reaction, call 911 or go to the hospital. Call your health care provider if you have other side effects that concern you. If you do not have a provider, call your local public health center to be connected to care. 8/16/22 Your provider is required to report serious adverse reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Sy stem (VAERS), but you can also report to VAERS at vaers.hhs.gov or by calling 800 -822- 7967. VAERS staff members do not give medical advice. Can people with HIV, a weakened immune system or skin conditions get vaccinated? Yes. JYNNEOS has been studied in people with HIV and atopic dermatitis (eczema), and no severe adverse reactions were identified. People with these conditions or a weakened immune system may have more severe disease if infected with monkeypox, making vacci nation especially important. However, people with a weakened immune system may be less likely to build an effective immune response following vaccination, so it is important to continue other prevention measures even after vaccination. Can people with a heart condition get vaccinated? Clinical trials did not show an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) following vaccination. However, because there is an increased risk from other vaccines, it is possible there is an increased risk from JYNNEOS in people who have risk factors for heart conditions. Can people who are pregnant or breastfeeding get vaccinated? Yes. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding and had a recent exposure to monkeypox can get vaccinated. There is limited information on the use of JYNNEOS in people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Studies on animals have shown no evidence of harm to a developing fetus. Who cannot get vaccinated? People who had a severe allergic reaction to a prior dose of JYNNEOS or an ingred ient in the vaccine (such as gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or egg protein) should not get vaccinated. Should people who previously received a smallpox vaccine get vaccinated? People who were vaccinated against smallpox prior to this outbreak should get the JYNNEOS vaccine if exposed to monkeypox, as protection from the smallpox vaccine may lessen over time. Can I get monkeypox or smallpox from the JYNNEOS vaccine? No. The virus in the vaccine is weakened and cannot copy in human cells. The vaccine cannot cause monkeypox, smallpox or vaccinia in the person getting vaccinated or those around them. Can I get the vaccine at the same time as other vaccines? The JYNNEOS vaccine may be given before, after or at the same time as other vaccines. The exceptions are the Pfizer , Novavax, and Moderna COVID- 19 vaccines. People at increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), particularly young adult males, might consider waiting four weeks after their JYNNEOS vaccine to get a dose of a COVID -19 vaccine. However, if vaccination is recommended due to a known exposure to monkeypox, you should get the JYNNEOS vaccine even if you recently got a COVID- 19 vaccine.
