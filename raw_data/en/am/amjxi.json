MVA has been tested in several 'prime-boost' regimens with high immunogenicity. Both humoral and cell-mediated responses have been induced by vaccination. Smallpox (Bavaria Nordic) and Ebola (Janssen) vaccines are approved MVA based vaccines. IDT started MVA vector production in 1997 Major published projects with Oxford University, Bavarian Nordic, Geovax and Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, CEPI IDT evaluated and developed several technologies and scales for manufacturing of rec.
