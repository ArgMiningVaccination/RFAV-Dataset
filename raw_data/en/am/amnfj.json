Spiritual baths are not just for those lucky enough to have a bathtub. Remember, water has been sacred for a lot longer than we've had bathtubs. Follow all the same steps in the guide above. The only difference is instead of running the water in a bathtub, fill a large bowl or pitcher with your water, and pop your spiritual bath ingredients into it. Give it a little stir. Take a shower, bring your bowl with you, and gently pour it over yourself when ready. Think of your intention as you do this. "}
