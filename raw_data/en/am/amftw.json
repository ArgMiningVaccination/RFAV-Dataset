Call to Order Chair Ed Morton convened the meeting at 4:15 p.m. on November 5, 2014, with the following members present and answering roll call: Governor Webster, Governor Beard, Governor Carter, and Governor Robinson. A quorum was established. 2. Meeting Minutes Governor Carter moved that the Committee approve the minutes of the September 17, 2014 meeting, as presented. Governor We bster seconded the motion and members concurred. 3. Health-Related Research: A Survey of the State University System Governor Morton provided a brief introducti on to a presentation by Associate Vice Chancellor R. E. LeMon, noting the impo rtant role of research in the SUS. Dr. LeMon presented highlights from the firs t report stemming from an environmental scan conducted in 3 broad areas: health-rel ated research, health education, and healthcare delivery. The report on health -related research identifies common threads and themes for the 12 SUS institutions, as ne arly all of the universities are engaged in health-related research of some type. He described the report as a synthesis of university responses to a survey on health- related research. In the survey, the universi ties were queried as to the magnitude of their research, their top priority areas of research, their general research challenges, their facility challenges and opportunities, their technology transfer challenges and opportunities, their research compliance challe nges and opportunities, their veterinary resources challenges and opportunities, their current collaboration with peer SUS institutions, their opportunities for further collaboration in areas where more research needs to be done, and their contri butions to translational research. 412 Dr. LeMon presented on the magnitude of SU S health-related research, noting that $431 million dollars came into the SUS from the federal Department of Health and Human Services in 2012-2013 and a total of $600 million from all federal sources was dedicated to health-related research that year. Funding at the University of Florida and the University of South Florida represented nearl y 80% of the overall SUS health-related research funding. Dr. LeMon stated that a national compariso n of medical science R&D expenditure data in 2011-2012 showed Florida ranked 6th in the nation. Governor Morton asked how those comparisons would break down on a per capita basis, considering Florida's large population. Several themes from the report were highlighted, including: the need to recruit already-funded faculty and the high cost of adequate startup packages a range of facility needs, including a teac hing hospital, renovated lab space, and some animal facility needs the increasingly competitive nature of grants and the need for strategic partnerships resource needs for tech transfer an d grants for proof-of-concept studies existing collaboration between SUS institut ions and a desire to partner more to increase competitiveness for research funding overlap among the universities in some high-priority research areas, including aging research and a role for the Board in creating shared research infrastructure that could benefit the institutions, such as organi zing a streamlined IRB process and data- handling and storage capabilities for greater SUS collaboration. On this last theme, Provost Joe Glover suggested that current data infrastructure investments such as SSERCA could benefit health researchers, but it would require better communication with the Chief Inform ation Officers of the universities. Dr. LeMon concluded by highlighting the instit utions' willingness to collaborate on grants in high-priority areas and to work together in gap areas provided that they have the expertise and resources to do so. He noted the Centers of Excellence model as one mechanism for partnership. Governor Morton asked the Committee for qu estions or comments. Governor Carter said tracking the magnitude is important fo r gauging how the System is performing in health-related research. Governor Robinson noted the importance for translational research, going beyond generating new know ledge and putting knowledge we have to work for people in the community. It is important for students to have skills in translational research. Governor Morton agreed and offered an example of the 423 importance of applied knowledge in nutrition and disease prevention and management. 11. Closing Remarks and Adjournment Chair Morton thanked members for their pa rticipation and adjourned the meeting at 4:40 p.m. Ed Morton, Chair Amy Beaven, Director, STEM and Health Initiatives 431 MINUTES STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS HEALTH INITIATIVES COMMITTEE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH FLORIDA JACKSONVILLE, FL JANUARY 21, 2015 Video or audio archives of the meetings of the Board of Governors and its Committees are accessible at http://www.flbog.edu 1. Call to Order Chair Ed Morton convened the workshop at 8:45 a.m. on January 21, 2015, with the following members present and answering roll call: Governor Beard, Governor Carter, Governor Doyle, Governor Levine and Govern or Robinson. A quorum was established. Chair Morton introduced the workshop as a joint meeting of the Health Initiatives Committee and the Committee's Advisory Gr oup members, who represent business and clinical perspectives in health care. He noted that the workshop agenda would be divided into three parts, beginning with a presentation from researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, on me dical school admission criteria, training and assessment of future healthcare professionals. The second and third items of the agenda would address supply and demand data on workforce gaps, as well as emerging and evolving trends in healthcare and ways of measuring demand. 2. Holistic Admissions for Medical School Candidates: Assessing IQ, EQ, and CQ Governor Morton recognized Dr. Jan Woik e of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development to present research on medical school and health program admission criteria, communication training, a ssessment, and life-long learning. Dr. Woike presented current figures on pati ent care and outcomes and suggested that an improvement in communication and shar ed-decision making between providers and patients could improve outcomes. He sugge sted that educators can improve on the identification and development of these skills for their students, principally by linking program selection, training, practice outc omes, and lifelong learning in a reflective feedback loop. Some points from his presentation were: 442 Currently there is insufficient eviden ce to support emotional intelligence measurements as part of the admissions criteria. Selection should not be the only area of focus as students' attitudes and abilities, including communication skills, change during the course of study. There is a need for more training in stat istical literacy and risk. Statistical figures are often misunderstood and misreprese nted because of poor training but communicating accurately about probability can improve shared decision- making. Currently there is overutilization of services based on patient demand and expectations, which can lead to over-diagnosis and overtreatment. Physicians are reluctant to provide less treatment due to a desire to meet patient demand, a fear of litigation, and financial incentives to provide treatment. If communication is working, there is a true understanding of risks and benefits, which builds trust between the doctor and patient. Communication training and shared decision-making skills should be incorporated into other courses, ongoin g and formative, provided incrementally and allowing for feedback, and practiced wi thin a team of healthcare trainees. There is a need to improve the proce ss for life-long learning for healthcare providers. One role for universities is the maintenance of alumni networks to support the dissemination of new kn owledge in accessible and easy to understand forms. There is a need to re-frame physicians as health communicators rather than experts and to capture and communicate how well they are doing by using data in a learning loop. Universities can accumulate best practices; look at the selection process as it is and always seek to improve it; focus on training; and continue communicating with practicing physicians and feed this back to the selection process. Governor Morton asked Dr. Woike if he is seeing changes in Germany's selection process and degree of inter-professional trai ning. Dr. Woike responde d that institutions should select medical school candidates base d upon their motivation to learn and abilty to benefit the most from the training, rathe r than selecting candidates based upon the final desired characteristics. Governor Morton also asked if there are changes to medical board certification to address the need for continuing education in Germany. Dr. Woike replied that currently any changes are in th e form of initiatives and not any binding regulations that he is aware of. Members of the Committee and Advisory Grou p (Dr. Andres Gil, Governor Robinson, Dr. Celeste Philip, Governor Carter, and Dr. John Fogarty) provided additional questions and comments. Governor Morton recognized Dr. Deborah German, Dean of the UCF College of Medicine, for a comment. She noted that educators see a change in the second or third year in a student's ab ility to communicate, and she suggested that problems actually arise when students are th rown into real-world practice settings. Dr. 453 Woike confirmed that a shift to much shorte r patient visits could lead students to greater disillusionment with real-world p ractice, but he noted that communication within the confines of practice is still important. Yet, this disillusionment and disconnect with patient care should prompt reflections on the design of practice. Governor Morton thanked Dr. Woike for his ti me and travel to speak on the topic. 3. Gap Analysis for Designated Health Occupations Governor Morton provided an introduction to a presentation by Amy Beaven on the health workforce supply and demand data to be considered as part of the Committee's environmental scan. Ms. Beaven presented two overarching ques tions for the Committee's health workforce gap analysis. Which health occupations are currently undersupplied? Where is the workforce supply not meeting the occupational demand in Florida? She then explained the gap analysis methods of the 2012-2013 Board of Governor's Access and Attainment Commission and noted where the health analysis overlapped and differed. Ms. Beaven provided details on the meth odology for assessing demand and supply, calculating the initial gap, and considering contextual factors. She presented several data limitations, as well as additional data so urces to consider for context. She provided information on the Classification of Inst ructional Programs (CIP codes) and the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC codes) and how they are linked through a crosswalk of educational programs to job openings. Governor Levine asked for clarification on the difference between the size of the demand and the size of the workforce gap. Ms. Beaven answered that the gap would be unmet demand after considering all source s of workforce supply. Governor Carter, Governor Beard, and several Advisory Group members discussed capturing the availability of medical residencies (graduate medical education) and other internships that may influence the availability of supply. Dr. Glen Finney noted that availability of physician residencies and fellowships could ea ch influence the decision of trainees to stay in Florida for practice. Governor Levine and Advisory Committee me mber Mary Lou Brunell raised concerns that the use of licensing data could over state supply (underestimating any gap) unless license-holders who are not working in Florid a, or working in a limited capacity in the occupation, were backed out of the supply es timates. Dr. Alma Littles commented that healthcare is seeing transitions that ma y change the number and type of health professionals that are needed in the wo rkforce. Mary Lou Brunell announced a partnership with CareerSource Florida to convene a Health Leadership Council to identify some of these shifts and their pote ntial impact. Governor Morton agreed that 464 changes in reimbursement structure will ch ange the mix of services and types of treatment from what is current practice. The Committee and Advisory Group prov ided additional suggestions around contextual factors to be considered in the ne xt round of analysis. Of particular interest were in-migration, out-migration, adequate demand estimates with consideration of retirements, and the number of medical residencies in Florida. 4. Emerging and Evolving Health Occupations Governor Morton introduced the second half of Ms. Beaven's presentation covering emerging and evolving health occupations. He also listed three doctoral proposals in evolving health occupations that would be coming to the Board of Governors for approval in March and on which he wanted to seek comments today from the Advisory Committee members. Ms. Beaven provided definitions for emerging occupations (few jobs currently but fast growth) and evolving occupations (existing o ccupation but job skills are changing). She noted the difficulty for measuring the demand for emerging and evolving occupations under the current gap analysis methodology. She suggested several resources to gauge demand for emerging and evolving occu pations, including short-term demand estimates and feedback from industry partners. Governor Morton asked about proteomics an d genomics as an emerging area for the training of additional geneticists and ge netic counselors. Dr. Glen Finney responded that advances in these fields show most factors are polygenetic and have complicated interactions. Therefore, the workforce may shif t to require more lab professionals to do appropriate, rigorous lab studies, but a lot of the counseling will still come back to the physician to interpret the results. The fut ure of personalized medicine requires improved quality, through research, and then increased sophistication in the knowledge of healthcare providers and co mputer-aided decision and risk tools. Governor Robinson agreed there is a need to expand clinical training in epigenetics for many professionals. Mary Lou Brunell sugge sted the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity projections are likely behind in estimating emerging and evolving occupations and supported bringing in dustry leaders into the discussion. As specific cases of potentially evolving occupations, the Committee was asked to discuss the demand for three professional pr actice doctorates to be considered for approval in March. Each of the three pr oposed professional doctorates was an education level above what was currently re quired for licensure and practice in the occupation. Therefore, demand estimates using the Bureau of Labor Statistics established typical education level did not necessarily represent the demand for the doctorally-prepared students. The Committee was asked to consider whether there is 475 evidence of hiring preference, promotion potential, or higher earnings with the advanced degree and if the program would be sustainable given student demand. Amy Beaven introduced each of three profe ssional doctorates: a Do ctorate in Clinical Nutrition at UNF, a Doctor of Nursing Practice at FGCU, and a Doctor of Social Work at FAU. Governor Levine asked if Florida need s doctorally-prepared professionals to train others and fill the need for clinical facu lty. He also asked if the professional organizations are driving the higher degree op tions to drive up pay and noted that for some occupations he is not seeing the demand for providers with this high degree level. He expressed concerns that supply is driving the demand rather than the demand driving the supply. Governor Morton asked how we measure the marginal utility of moving to the higher degree level. Representatives from each of the three univ ersities noted the design of their programs in response to regional demand and the abili ty to fill clinical faculty positions in the future. Dr. Celeste Philip noted that advanced dietitian education would be beneficial and appeal to hospitals, health departme nts, and public health wellness programs. Governor Robinson said a range of degrees are needed in the workforce, but this advanced professional would be able to a pply and interpret the latest knowledge into the practice setting in a way that profession als at other degree levels are not trained to do. Governor Cavallaro added that, from a student perspective, the Board and the programs have a responsibility to make sure that students who invest in the program will actually see a return in the marketplace. Dr. Andres Gil asked to what extent this demand can be filled by existing programs and suggested looking at where graduates, includin g PhD graduates, are going to see if they currently fill clinical demand. Govern or Morton and other Committee members continued to express general concern that increases in degree requirements, once formalized by licensing, would only constrai n the supply of healthcare practitioners. 5.

Call to Order Chair Ed Morton convened the workshop at 1:07 p.m. on May 18, 2015, with the following members present and answering roll call: Governor Beard, Governor Carter, Governor Levine and Governor Robinson. A quorum was established. 2. Gap Analysis for Health Occupations Governor Morton introduced a presentation by Amy Beaven on an update to the findings of a health-related gap analysis fo r the state of Florida. The presentation was a summary of a 165 page report covering 23 occupations and their aligned health programs. Ms. Beaven informed the Committee that feedba ck on contextual factors at the January 2015 workshop had guided further analysis . The updated results had also been reviewed by the Committee's Advisory Group members in the previous weeks of May 2015 and their suggestions had been incorpor ated into the latest draft report. The findings of the report could be grouped into four categories of occupations: occupations most likely undersupplied, occupations suffi ciently supplied by annual license-holders, occupations sufficiently supplied by new or overlapping sources of supply, and occupations sufficiently supplied by Florida's graduates. Governor Robinson asked if the new findings accounted for out-migration. Ms. Beaven responded that FETPIP data was included in the report to show the number of graduates found working in the state within one year of graduation or continuing education. Those not found were assumed to be not working or to have moved out of the state. As another source of out-migratio n data, the status change for license-holders was evaluated for multiple years to assess how many professionals no longer hold a Florida practice address and are assumed to move out of state each year. 492 Ms. Beaven presented the occupations grouped into each of the four categories. Physicians and nurses (including register ed nurses, nurse practitioners, and nurse anesthetists) are most likely undersupplie d. Ms. Beaven noted that the supply estimates for nursing were refined with data provided by Mary Lou Brunell from the Florida Center for Nursing and with surv eys to the SUS nursing programs. However, questions remain about the accuracy of th e nursing demand estimates without the consideration of additional contextual fa ctors. The Florida Center for Nursing will convene healthcare industry leaders over the next year and will produce reports that offer finer detail on the nursing demand. Governor Morton commented that shifts in healthcare will require additional skills and critical thinking qualifications and demand for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Currently the preponderance of nursing graduates comes from colleges and private schools and earn degrees at the associates degree level. Ms. Beaven referenced information gathered on physician supply and demand and the conclusions of a report by IHS Global on behalf of the Florida Safety Net Hospital Alliance. The Committee discussed these conclusions and the implications for additional graduate medical education (G ME). Governor Beard asked how the Board can influence the availability of GME in the st ate. Dr. Alma Littles provided information on the match rate for this year's medical sch ool graduates, and she noted that Florida's medical schools are key resources and can offe r infrastructure assistance to hospitals who have never before offered GME. Presid ent Hitt of UCF agreed that UCF's medical school was serving that role by providing st ructure, administration, and faculty support in efforts to create 200 new residency positions. Ms. Beaven identified pharmacists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and veterinarians as the occupations sufficien tly supplied by annual license-holders. Currently, the number of licenses issued each year to Florida's graduates as well as to professionals migrating into th e state exceeds the projected annual openings for each of those occupations. Slightly less in-migrat ion or increased demand could mean an under-supply in physical therapy or occupa tional therapy and these occupations should be monitored over the next few years. The third category includes occupations with sufficient supply due to the establishment of new programs, which significantly increa se the number of graduates, such as dentists. Some occupations also draw pr ofessionals from overlapping sources of supply, such as therapists and counselors. Elev en occupations fell into the last category and had a sufficient number of program graduates in Florida to meet the projected number of job openings. Several Committee members commented on the regional distribution of healthcare occupations and the geographic and financial barriers to access of some practitioners, 503 especially dentists. Dr. Jan Ignash commented that thes e questions came up during the Access and Attainment Commission's work. Specifically, are we producing enough, not keeping them, or not keeping them where they are needed? The Health Initiatives Committee can consider these questions as part of the second year's work. Are the occupations of interest sufficiently supplie d everywhere and what can we do about it? Dr. Ignash also noted that the gap analysis was a large effort to go through but it sets a foundation for good policy. The findings of being sufficiently supplied for many of the health occupations means we may be right-si zed in many areas and the SUS has done a good job in meeting demand. Governor Tripp expressed interest in the in equality of care across the state and looking at program incentivizes to get graduates to fill unmet needs in underserved areas. Governor Morton and Governor Levine suggest ed that the gap analysis be revisited in the future and incorporate workforce shifts that are due to changes in healthcare delivery. 3.

The Committee has since co ncluded the first phase of its work by conducting a year-long environmental scan en compassing three areas: health-related education, health care delivery impacted by the health care academic experience, and health-related research. The Committee's findings from the environmental scan will lead to the development of a strategic plan that will guide the State University System in both the foreseeable future as well as in the long-term when Florida is expected to experience even more stress on its health care delivery system. The Health Initiatives Committee will meet to consider themes that emerged from university responses to a survey on healthc are delivery, as well as feedback from its Advisory Group on the topic. The SUS them es have been incorporated with a wider context of state and national trends, which were presented to the Committee in September 2014, and make up the Committee' s third environmental scan report. The Committee will hear a presentation on highlights from the report, Board of Governors Health Initiatives Committee Report on Issues in Healthcare Delivery in the State University System, along with the key findings from the Committee's reports on health education and research. A summ ary of findings from the completed environmental scan are included in a broc hure featuring the Health Initiatives Committee's work to date. 52 Supporting Documentation Included: 1.

Prior to initiating the Environmental Scan, the He alth Initiatives Committee agreed on a Work Plan that would focu s on three health-related areas: health education, health care delivery and health-related research. This report focuses on health care delivery. It documents the results of a review of several reports regarding current and future health care practices, incorporates the advice and counsel of the Health Initiatives Committee Advisory Group, and presents the results of a survey administered to each of the twelve SUS institutions regarding health care delivery. It should be noted that the majority of the responses to the survey of the SUS institutions came from the six instit utions with a medical school, and were focused on activities of the colleges of me dicine in those institutions, even when other colleges within the institutions may be providers of health care. This report attempts to answer six key questions with regard to health care delivery. The questions and the key find ings from the body of the report are provided below. Question One: What are the emerging and evolving trends in health care delivery? How will they affect the State University System? A review of the literature on emerging an d evolving health care, combined with input from the survey results from the SUS institutions and counsel from the Health Initiatives Committee Advisory Gr oup, suggests that there are at least eight key trends: (1) an increase in collabo rative models of practice that require a patient-centered, team-based approach; (2 ) a change in training settings from traditional hospital-based to community settings; (3) a greater employment of physicians in practices owned or manage d by hospitals or other organizations; (4) a greater emphasis on values-based c are and less on the fee-for-service model of reimbursement; (5) an expanded role for Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners, physicians' assistants, an d other health care delivery personnel other than physicians; (6) an expanded ro le of technology in the delivery of health care services; (7) the increasing acknowledgement of dental health as a key contributor to the overall health of the community and (8) the emergence of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomi cs. In addition, payment reform is an underlying theme for each of th ese health care delivery trends. 564 Health care in the United States has evolved from the days of the solo physician practice to more collaborative models of practice. Advances in technology, the complexity and prevalence of chronic disease management, and the complicated health care reimbursement process have a ll led to the need for a more systematic approach to the provision of health care. Almost all of the new models of care require a more values/outcomes-based, patient-centered, team-based approach to health care, using emerging technolo gies. More and more physicians are employed in practices owned and/or managed by hospitals, managed care organizations, or some other entity. Areas of change among SUS institutions in cluded greater use of electronic health records, the use of telemedicine, increasing opportunities for inter- professional/interdisciplinary training and care, new faculty practice plan development, and the expansion of pr imary and specialty care services. Electronic health records, which may be shared among those with a need to know, improve the coordination and deliv ery of efficient, cost-effective and quality care. SUS institutions identifi ed a wide array of changes or planned changes to their educational programs to better prepare graduates for the changing health care delivery system. Question Two: What health care deliv ery is currently provided within the State University System? What factors affect that delivery? In the 2013-14 fiscal year, universities reported nearly 3,000,000 inpatient and outpatient visits. Approximately 2.6 m illion were outpatient visits, and nearly 300,000 were inpatient visits. This number is likely to grow as the newer medical schools expand their health care services. Another reason for growth is that the health care delivery model is changing to one based on preventative and preemptive care (i.e., chronic disease management). Half of the institutions reported having a faculty practice plan, which is the entity that serves as the structure for receiving clinical practi ce revenues generated from services provided by faculty clinicians. Two schools currently with neither faculty practice plans nor medical schools report ed that they are having preliminary discussions or are considering starting a faculty practice plan. Regarding the health care delivery servic es, SUS institutions tend to provide health care services close to home; extend ing services beyond the local area is the exception rather than the rule. Health c are services are provided in a number of settings in close vicinity to the parent inst itution, as well as in the towns, cities, and communities immediately surrounding the institution. Some institutions extend services statewide and even out-of-s tate. Sites of services exhibit a wide variety of settings, including outpatient c linics, federally qualified health centers, county health departments, private phys ician practices, community hospitals, 575 correctional facilities, academic health ce nters, VA hospitals and clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, and student health centers. When asked to identify the top five areas of specialized health care delivery they provide, the institutions identified a diverse group of specialized services ranging from those with state, nation al, or international reputations for excellence; those with the greatest succe ss in generating clinical revenues; and those identified as most ur gently needed. When asked to describe the greatest areas of health care needs, access to c are was the area most often identified. Other needs identified included preventive and acute health care services to the underserved, mental health care/substan ce abuse services, primary and specialty care physicians, and population health. In addition, two institutions referenced dental care. The latter is particularly impo rtant because of its role as a causative or contributing factor in several health conditions. According to the Florida Department of Health's website, Oral health is vitally important to overall health and well-being. Research has shown a link to diabetes, heart an d lung disease, stroke, respiratory illnesses and conditions of pregnant women including the delivery of pre- term and low birth weight infants. Dental disease is largely preventable through effective health promotion and dental disease prevention programs. Collaboration with medical partners to provide compelling messaging and preventive care is key to improving the overall health of all Floridians.1 The most often identified perceived barriers to patient care delivery were lack of adequate numbers of clinical facul ty, increased workload requirements, Graduate Medical Education funding, an d the availability of preceptors for health care programs. The most often cite d critical areas of health care delivery that are not currently or sufficiently addressed by Florida universities were mental health, access to affordable health care and physician shortages, lack of residency positions, care of the elderl y, and access to dental care for the uninsured. Question Three: How is the delivery of h ealth care emerging and evolving in ways that will have an impact on the preparation of health care workers by Florida universities? With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the concepts of Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) and Patient-Cente red Medical Homes (PCMH) became much more widespread. The Patient-Centered Medical Home is a model of 1 Dental Health (n.d.). Retrieved August 13, 2015 from the Florida Dept. of Health, http://www.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-serv ices/community-health/dental-health/index.html 586 primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, team-based, coordinated, accessible, and focused on quality and safety. An Accountable Care Organization is a network of doctors and hospitals that share financial and medical responsibility for providing coordi nated care to patients in hopes of limiting unnecessary spending. There has been significant growth in the number of practices that qualify as Patient-Centered Medical Homes as well as the number of Accountable Care Organizations over the past three to four years. Orlando has 17 Accountable Care Organizat ions. Only two institutions (UF and UCF) indicated that they are currently a Patient-Centered Medical Homes model, and only one (UF) indicated that it is p art of an Accountable Care Organization. However, an additional five institutions indicated that they plan to become Patient-Centered Medical Homes models, an d three institutions plan to become part of Accountable Care Organizations in the next five years. It is possible that the delayed response of SUS institutions in entering this health care delivery model is because the traditional structure of academic health centers already had some of the elements of Accountable Care Organizations (network of doctors and hospitals that share financial and medical responsibility for providing coordinated care to patients). Six institutions are already using electronic health records and an additional institution pl ans to begin use in the coming years. With the increasing focus on prevention and health of the population, Florida's SUS institutions are well-positioned to research and promote the ways to address health disparities and chronic disease prevention. The SUS institutions can potentially benefit from the successes in th is area by other entities in the United States, such as the Centers for Disease Control. As noted by Lee and Paxman, The three main determinants of health include: behavior and lifestyle, environmental exposure, and health care. It has been noted behavior and lifestyle accounts for 80 percent of premature mortality, environmental exposure for 20 percent and health care for 10 percent.2 Another trend that should be noted is the call from several health care organizations to eliminate unnecessary proc edures and treatments in the name of \"defensive medicine.\" The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's \"Choosing Wisely\" program is one such initiative. It \"aims to promote conversations between clinicians and pati ents by helping patients choose care that is: (1) Supported by evidence, (2) Not duplicative of other tests or procedures already received, (3) Free from harm and (4) Truly necessary.\"3 There is evidence that employing thes e behaviors reduces cost and reduces morbidity from unnecessary medical interv entions; however, the risk and fear of malpractice are barriers to full acceptance of these initiatives. 2 Lee P. & Paxman D. 1997. Reinventing Public Health. Annual Review of Public Health 18:135. 3(n.d.). Retrieved August 13, 2015 from http://www.choosingwisely.org/about-us/ 597 Question Four: How, if at all, are accrediting bodies for health care programs altering their standards to align with em erging and evolving changes to health care delivery? Among the ways in which accrediting bodi es are aligning their standards with emerging and evolving changes in heal th care delivery are the addition of standards requiring inter-professional collaborative training for students, changes in curriculum and pedagogy that affect the way faculty teach, an emphasis on outcomes measures in student evaluation over process, and the provision of faculty development and support for student evaluation. The Liaison Committee on Medical Educa tion (LCME) now has a standard requiring inter-professional training wi thin the medical education program of accredited medical schools. SUS medi cal schools referenced several Liaison Committee on Medical Education standards th at directly relate to changes being made in the curriculum. These includ e Standard 7.9 on Inter-professional Collaborative Skills, as well as the stan dards regarding curriculum content, specific skills, attitudes and behaviors students must demonstrate, types of patients and clinical settings students mu st encounter, and faculty qualifications. Also mentioned are standards that directly impact faculty members, such as the move to more small group learning, in corporation of quality improvement and safety education into the curriculum, and the increasing use of simulation. Question Five: Given that health care de livery is changing, should the current mix of didactic versus clinical in health-related curricula be modified? The quick answer is \"yes.\" The reasons why include changes in curricula and its delivery, the needs of a more diverse st udent body, and the eventual placement of graduates in a variety of communities and settings that will require understanding of the needs of underserve d populations. Curriculum reform is prevalent throughout the country, and Fl orida schools are part of the trend. Review of the medical school curricula in th e state reveals that more education is occurring in small groups, clinical learning centers, simulation centers, and in clinical preceptorships in the community. Therefore, the question is no longer \"should,\" but \"how quickly\" curricular mo dification is occurring and what the improved outcomes of the changes will be. Question Six: What technological change s in health care delivery will require concomitant changes in health care education? It is well recognized that greater inter-op erability of electronic health records is needed to allow increased sharing of me dical information with teams of health professionals in order to facilitate data retrieval for quality and billing purposes, 608 and to help alleviate patient safety concerns. Increased use of telemedicine allows interactive communication bet ween the patient and the physician or practitioner at a distant site. This type of interaction can lead to greater efficiencies, including improved access to care and overall health. Telemedicine represents a change in the health care delivery method, but not necessarily in how physicians practice. The lack of reimbursement has limited the use of telemedicine services in Florida. It is premature at this time to know how much of an emerging or evolving influence te lemedicine will have in Florida. Four institutions are already using telemedicine , and three others plan to begin using it in the next five years. Summary Health care is provided by SUS faculty members in academic health centers, community hospitals, VA hospitals, outp atient clinics and physician offices, health departments, and community health centers. Each medical school has a faculty practice plan. The structure of th ese plans differs based on the nature of affiliated partnerships (VA hospitals, pr ivate hospitals, public hospitals, and community health centers) and stage of development. The newer medical schools are still developing practice plans, while the older schools have mature plans which contribute significantly to th e education of students and residents, as well as to the revenue streams of th e medical schools. The practice plans within the SUS face the same challeng es as practices in the community. Combining the increased use of teams to provide care, expanding the use of technology (electronic health records, tele medicine), and providing care to more groups and underserved populations will likely shift the types of providers, setting of services, and payment struct ure for health care in the future. Florida's particular demographics will, in and of themselves, affect health care delivery in the future. First and foremost, Florida is continuing to grow, and this growth will increase the stress on Florida' s health care infrastructure. Florida's demographics are not expected to stabilize or to decrease, as other states project. Instead, all projections show continued incr eases in population as far out as these projections are made. Further, while the hi storical trend of retirees moving to Florida is continuing, pre-retirees are now also moving to Florida in greater numbers. Florida is trending toward a population that is bimodal, with large percentages of the population aged 24 and below, and large percentages aged 65 and above. In addition, Florida's health care needs are not evenly distributed throughout the state. Rural areas, in particular, can be under-supplied, even though the state as a whole may have a su fficient supply in any given health care occupation. Florida's health care deliver y infrastructure will be challenged by these demographics in the years to come, and it will be imperative that the SUS 619 institutions best position themselves as part of the solution to the challenges ahead. 6210 Introduction In 2015 the Board of Governors Health Initiatives Committee undertook an Environmental Scan in order to better unders tand the status of health care as it pertains to the twelve institutions of th e State University System (SUS). Prior to initiating the Environmental Scan, the He alth Initiatives Committee agreed on a Work Plan that would focu s on three health-related areas: health education, health care delivery, and health-related research. This report focuses on health care delivery. There are various models for health c are delivery within the SUS. While acknowledging that the environment of he alth care delivery SUS graduates enter will have an impact on their practices, there are some best practices that should be shared among the SUS institutions. As graduates of SUS programs move into the workforce, these practices should follow them. Purpose of the Report The purpose of this report is to docu ment the results of a review of several reports regarding current and future health care practices, to incorporate the advice and counsel of the Health Initia tives Committee Advisory Group, and to present the results of a survey admini stered to each of the twelve SUS institutions regarding health care delivery. To inform the report and survey as part of the Environmental Scan, the following questions were developed for exploration: 1. What are the emerging and evolving trends in health care delivery? How will they affect the State University System? 2. What health care delivery is curr ently provided within the State University System? What factors affect that delivery? 3. How is the delivery of health care em erging and evolving in ways that will have an impact on the preparation of health care workers by Florida universities? 4. How, if at all, are accrediting bodies for health care programs altering their standards to align with emerging and evolving changes to health care delivery? 5. Given that health care delivery is changing, should the current mix of didactic versus clinical in health-related curricula be modified? 6311 6. What technological changes in health care delivery will require concomitant changes in health care education? Description of the Survey The purpose of the survey was to assist in the Environmental Scan conducted this year to inform the Board of Govern ors' Health Initiatives Committee about the opportunities and challenges associated with health care delivery in the State University System. For the purpose of the survey, emphasis was placed on health care services provided by faculty and staff of the twelve SUS institutions. This included those services provided within, but not necessarily limited to, academic health centers, community hospitals, faculty practice plans, affiliated physician practices, health departments, community health centers, and surgery centers. Survey Methods To gauge the level of health care deliv ery currently being provided by faculty members in the State University System, a 16 question survey was sent to each of the 12 SUS institutions. Of the 11 schools re sponding to the survey, five reported none to very limited activity in the area of health care delivery (University of West Florida, New College, Florida Gulf Coast University, University of North Florida, Florida Agricultural and Mechan ical University). Florida Polytechnic University did not respond, given its short time of existence. It should be noted that the majority of th e responses to the survey came from the six SUS institutions with a medical school , and were focused on activities of the Colleges of Medicine in those institutio ns, even when other colleges within the institutions may be providers of health c are. Four of the universities reporting have relatively new or very small practice plans, mainly due to the fact that their medical schools have been in existenc e 15 years or less (Florida Atlantic University, Florida International Univ ersity, University of Central Florida, Florida State University). Two of the un iversities have very mature faculty practice plans and reported significant activity (University of South Florida, and the University of Florida - Gainesville and Jacksonville campuses). Because of the evolving nature of health care delivery in the nation, state, and within the SUS, the survey questions di d not flow directly from the questions developed for the Environmental Scan. Summarized results from the survey are included in the information presented be low. An appendix including summary 6412 data tables and individual responses from the institutions is included at the end of this report. Although there is overla p between the subject matter in several of the sub-questions, an attempt was made to address each question individually. Question One: What are the emerging and evolving trends in health care delivery? How will they affect the State University System? A review of the literature on emerging an d evolving health care suggests that there are at least eight key trends: An increase in collaborative models of practice that require a patient- centered, team-based approach A change in training settings from traditional hospital-based to community settings A greater employment of physicians in practices owned or managed by hospitals or other organizations A greater emphasis on values-based care and less on the fee-for-service model of reimbursement An expanded role for Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners, physicians' assistants, dentists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, social workers, Certified Nurse Midwives, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, and patient navigators An expanded role of technology in th e delivery of health care services The increasing acknowledgement of dent al health as a key contributor to the overall health of the community The emergence of personalized medici ne and genomics. Table 8 in the SUS Survey Summary shows that two in stitutions responded that they are currently using personalized medicine and three others are planning to use it in the next five years. Health care in the United States has evolved from the days of the solo physician practice to more collaborative models of practice. Advances in technology, the complexity and prevalence of chronic disease management, and the complicated health care reimbursement process have a ll led to the need for a more systematic approach to the provision of health care. Almost all of the new models of care require a more patient-centered, team-b ased approach to health care, using emerging technologies. Typically, training of physicians and other health care professionals tends to lag behind practice reform, partly because their training is focused in traditional hospital-based se ttings. In 2001, Green, et al. highlighted the fact that most health care is pr ovided in the community setting. Green's article pointed out that, in a given mo nth, only 8 of 1,000 patients will be hospitalized, and less than one of them will be hospitalized in an academic 6513 health center. The other patients wh o seek treatment do so in community settings.4 Trends show that the practice style of phys icians is changing significantly. More and more physicians are employed in practices owned and/or managed by hospitals, managed care organizations, or some other entity. In 2010, Medical Group Management Association found that more than 65 percent of established physicians and 49 percent of physicians coming out of training were placed in hospital-owned practices. Health c are delivery has become more and more complex over time. Reasons suggested includ e the fact that inpatients tend to be much sicker and there is an increa sed burden of chronic disease. An emphasis on quality is linked to ch anges in technology that are (1) giving patients more access to medical informat ion, including their own records as well as vast internet resources, and (2) incr easing transparency around care outcomes (via such tools as provider report cards). The quality of one's care can increasingly be gauged by the health outcomes across a population (population health). As a result, the health care in dustry will continue to see growth in the patient-centered medical home, need for patient navigators to help get them through the system, and the need to me asure and report health outcomes. Students need to be prepared to practice in a climate where patients and their families demand access to information, shared decision-making, and transparency. Physicians will be operating in a world of many experts and will need to coordinate and communicate with providers at different levels, as well as patients and their families. As techno logy improves the ability to compare and contrast outcomes, formalize best practice s, and establish more standardization of care, providers will not be able to hide or continue poor practices. Providers will need to better understand population health, to understand and respect the need for communication, and to have th e ability to coordinate, advocate, and manage patient care. Addressing the impact of electronic commu nications also requires a focus on the pros and cons of such communication. Th e role of privacy and what it will mean in the future has to be considered. On the \"pro\" side, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can provide a means of efficient communication with patients. In addition, examples are em erging of the formation of worldwide communities of patients with rare chronic diseases. Examples also exist of patients who are having rare diseases diagnosed on social media simply by posting pictures or listing of symptoms and receiving feedback from others. On the \"con\" side, the risk and fear of medical malpractice have to be part of the 4 L.A. Green, G.E. Fryer, Jr., B.P. Yawn, D. Lanier, and S.M. The Ecology of Medical Care. NEJM. 344(26):2021NEJM. 2021-5, 2001 Jun 28. 6614 equation with increased use of electronic communication. Also, adherence to the patient's and society's definition of privacy and confidentiality must be maintained. The expanded roles of Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners and physician assistants in patient care are much be tter recognized as key providers in the delivery of patient care. The roles of other health care personnel (physical therapists, occupational therapists, pharmac ists, dentists, social workers, patient navigators, Certified Nurse Midwives, and Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists) are also essential. In addition to the role of new technolo gies in communicating with patients and other providers, advanced technologies in the direct treatment of patients will also impact health care delivery in the future. Use of new devices and technology such as robotics is leading to sh orter hospital stays, and in some cases (e.g. orthopedic procedures) is moving tr eatments from inpatient to outpatient settings. Pharmacogenetics is also part of an emer ging trend in the provision of health care called Personalized or Precision Medicine. This technology will allow health care providers to direct diagno stic and therapeutic modalities to the individual patient. With the knowledge of the specific genetic make-up of the patient, it is possible to target diagnost ic decisions, devise treatment options and monitor the effects of treatment in a mu ch safer, efficient and cost-effective manner. As Dr. Francis Collins describes in the Journal of the American Medical Association , this \"moves clinicians away fr om making patient care decisions based on the experiences of the average patient to more precise decisions based on the individual patient.\"5 Early work using pharmacogenomics has focused on cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addi tion, the costs of genetic testing and the lack of insurance coverage for it put this technology out of reach for most patients in the early stages. However, the price of testing has been steadily declining, and this statement from the Mayo Clinic sums up the current status of pharmacogenomics: Although pharmacogenomics has much promise and has made important strides in recent years, it's still in its early stages. Clinical trials are needed not only to identify links between ge nes and treatment outcomes but also to confirm initial findings, clarify th e meaning of these associations and translate them into prescribing guidelines. Nonetheless, progress in this 5 Collins, FS. View From the National Institu tes of Health. JAMA. 2015;313(2):131-132. doi:10.1001/jama.2014.16736. 6715 field points toward a time when pharmacogenomics may be part of routine medical care.6 The SUS institutions will need to en sure that they are producing the professionals with the appropriate skill sets to meet the demands of the future health care delivery system.7 Five institutions responded that the delivery of health care in their facilities had changed in recent years. Areas of change among the five institutions included: greater use of electronic health records, including Computerized Physician Orders; expanded use of telemedicine; increasing opportunities for inter-pr ofessional/interdisciplinary training and care; expanded and enhanced relation ships with community partners; new faculty practice plan development; expanded clinical training sites, including community health centers; expansion of primary and specialty care services; increased emphasis on metric-driven continuous improvement in clinical quality and service outcome; and increased emphasis on value, i.e., optimal care without unnecessary costs. Institutions were also asked if they ha d changed or planned to change any of their educational programs to better prep are graduates for the changing health care delivery system. Responses included: more opportunities for inter-profe ssional training and care teams; implementation and/or services; promotion of values-based , patient-centered care; renewed emphasis on quality and sa fety and including residents in the initiative; the need to expand experiences in geriatrics, rehabilitative medicine, and primary care; and formal training in the use of the el ectronic health records and medical informatics; 6How does pharmacogenetics work in pr actice.

Payment reform is of significance in each of these trends. As alternative payment models are deployed, providers of health care, including those in the SUS, must ensure that their practice structure meets the requirements to participate in these new models. These new payment reforms are based on provider performance, particularly in the areas of quality care, patient safety, efficiency and reduction of unnecessary spending. According to th e Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, \"eighty-six percent of all heal th care spending in 2010 was for people with one or more chronic medical conditions.\"8 Preventive care and early diagnosis will be critical in managing chronic diseases and in managing resources. Advanced practice nurses, ph ysician assistants and other health care professionals will be part of the teams providing this care. Florida's medical schools play a vital role in caring for patients served by Florida's Medicaid program. Faculty physicians and practitioners provide essential primary and specialty medical care in clinics, teaching hospitals, health departments and other health care facilit ies, providing annually more than two million office visits and encounters to pati ents served by the Medicaid program. Florida's medical school physicians and practitioners have received Medicaid supplemental funding since 2004-05.

Budget authority for medical school physicians is currently provided in the amount of $204.5 million under the physician supplemental payment program. Florida's medical schools contribute a substantial amount of medical resources to care for underserved, uninsured, underi nsured, rural and inner-city patients. Medical schools further provide signific ant services for high-risk patients, including high-risk neonates, the elderl y, and other persons having complex medical needs. Appropriate Medicaid fundi ng is key to the ability of the medical schools to continue providing care that is needed. Services to the state's Medicaid population by medical schools having we ll-established faculty practice plans have continued to grow, and medical schools with new and emerging faculty practice plans are building additional programs that can enhance the state's capability to provide access and serve patients in the Medicaid program. Question Two: What health care deliv ery is currently provided within the State University System? What factors affect that delivery? A number of models of heal th care delivery exist in the SUS. To specify the scope of these models, SUS institutions were asked to (1) describe the nature of their faculty practice plans if they had on e; (2) define their health care delivery service area; (3) describe the communities th ey serve; (4) describe the settings in which they provide health care services; (5) identify the top areas of specialized health care delivery they provide; (6) provide the number of outpatient and inpatient visits to institutions served by the institution's health care providers; (7) describe the greatest health care de livery needs in their service area and statewide; (8) describe their perceived barri ers to patient care delivery; (9) state the biggest challenges/opportunities with regard to health care delivery; (10) provide a list of resources they use to track health care delivery needs in their service area, as well as resour ces they plan to use in th e future; and (11) describe critical areas of health care delivery that are not currently or sufficiently addressed by Florida universities or their affiliated partners, and should be. The results of the survey indicated that: Half of the institutions reported having a faculty practice plan, which is the entity that serves as the struct ure for receiving clinical practice revenues generated from services provided by faculty clinicians. These plans are set up as 501C.3 not-for-profit entities per Florida Statutes Section 1004.28, and are under the control of the Boards of Trustees of the universities. Of the six schools with a faculty practice plan, three of them only serve the Colleges of Medicine, while the other three include other 7018 units within the university. All six of the universities with Colleges of Medicine have faculty practice plan s. Two of the universities that currently have neither a faculty practice plan nor a medical school reported that they are having prelim inary discussions or are considering starting a faculty practice plan. FGCU reports that it has \"begun preliminary discussions on establishing a faculty practice plan that would focus in the areas of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and athletic training, and would represent an in tegrative partnership between the identified Department, College and the University's central administration. No specific timeline has been identified for developing this initiative.\" FAMU reports that the \"Division of Physical Therapy in the School of Allied Sciences is e xploring opportunities to establish a faculty practice plan in 2017-18. Init ial conversations have begun between the University/Division of Physical Therapy and Bond Community Health Specialty Clinic and Outdoors Disabled Association/Goodwill Industries to offer physical therapy se rvices at their Tallahassee locations.\" Regarding health care delivery services, SU S institutions tend to provide health care services very close to home; extending services beyond the local area is the exception rather than the rule. Health c are services are provided in a number of settings in close vicinity to the parent inst itution, as well as in the towns, cities, and communities immediately surrounding the institution. Some institutions extend services statewide and even out-of-s tate. Sites of services exhibit a wide variety of types of settings, including outp atient clinics, federally qualified health centers (FQHC), county health departments, private physician practices, community hospitals, correctional facilit ies, academic health centers, VA hospitals and clinics, nursing homes, re habilitation centers, and student health centers. Table Five in the Appendix in dicates the settings and services included in the provision of health care in the universities. In describing the communities they se rve, the SUS sites of care noted above are located in urban, inner-city, suburban and rural areas of the state. There was little distinction amon g the institutions in this regard, as each of them reported providing se rvices in multiple geographic areas with diverse populations served. It should be noted, however that FIU's Green Family Foundation Neighborh oodHELP program places students in interdisciplinary, community-based outreach teams, supervised by faculty members, where they particip ate in home visits and work with families to implement a household-centered approach to clinical care. In addition, FSU faculty and students provide care to patients in community settings with a focus on primary care, underserved and rural populations. 7119 When asked to identify the top five areas of specialized health care delivery they provide, the institutio ns identified a diverse group of specialized services ranging from those with state, national, and international reputations for excellence; those with the greatest success in generating clinical revenues; and th ose identified as most urgently needed. Table Four in the Appendix shows the range of these services as reported by the institutions. The universities were asked to prov ide the number of outpatient and inpatient visits to institutions serv ed by the institution's health care providers. For the 2013-14 fiscal year, universities reported a total of 294,304 inpatient visits with a range of 0 to 213,257 visits, and 2,601,067 total outpatient visits, with a range of 981 visits to 1,915,931 visits. Visits to other sites numbered 29,712. The gran d total of all visits was close to three million-- 2,925,083. The majority of this health care provision is associated with the University of Florida and the University of South Florida. In sum, nearly 3,000,000 visits is a formidable number, and one that is likely to grow as the newer medical schools expand their health care services. In describing the greatest areas of heal th care needs, the results were as follows: o Six institutions identified access to care. o Five institutions identified preventive and acute health care services to underserved and ment al health care/substance abuse services. o Three institutions identified primary care physicians, specialty care physicians, and population health. o Two institutions identified chronic disease management, affordable care, dentists/dental care, and health literacy. o Only one institution among the eleven respondents identified nurses, physicians assistants, the rapists, health disparities, health care for the elderly, system of care for patients on Medicaid/uninsured, interoperability of health information systems, telemedicine, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, prostate cancer, musculoskeletal care, and rehabilitative services. The most commonly perceived barriers to patient care delivery identified by the institutions or by faculty members were: o lack of adequate numbers of clinical faculty (8 institutions), o increased workload requirements (6 institutions), o Graduate Medical Education funding (6 institutions), 7220 o availability of preceptors for health care programs (6 institutions), o need for more technologically advanced equipment (5 institutions), o need for more cultural diversity among faculty (4 institutions), o increasing numbers of under-insu red and uninsured patients (4 institutions), and o competing needs of clinical faculty (4 institutions). With regard to other barriers, the passage of legislation creating a permanent fix to the Sustainable Growth Rate in the Medicare program in 2015 was a welcomed relief to the Colleges of Medicine and to practicing physicians in the state be cause the lack of that fix had a negative impact on faculty practice plans that re ly upon the Medicare program for reimbursement for services to elderly pa tients in the state. In addition, medical schools in the SUS worked hard to maintain the Supplemental Physician Payment Program, a Florida Medicaid enhanced payment program which began in 2004. The pr ogram was jointly funded through federal matching funds in the form of enhanced payments for services provided by faculty physicians to patients in the Medicaid program, in the fee for service model. With the move of the overwhelming majority of Medicaid payments to a managed care system, this program has been placed in jeopardy. While this funding remains intact for the 2015-16 fiscal year, there is no assurance that it will remain beyond that time. The expansion of Medicaid eligibility would result in hundreds of millions of additional dollars for the SUS. Institutions were asked to state their biggest challenges/opportunities with regard to health care delivery. Five institutions listed access to care, while two listed telemedicine. All other items were checked by only one institution. Table 10 in the Appendix indicates the entirety of responses by SUS institutions. When asked to provide a list of reso urces to track health care delivery needs in their service area, as well as resources they plan to use in the future, universities listed the following sources: o Florida statistics from state agencies, o Florida statistics from national agencies, o hospital surveys, and o independent surveys to institutions. Regarding university responses to inde pendent surveys, the University of Florida, in particular, provided a detailed listing of key health data resources utilized to track health care delivery, including UF Health internal data to 7321 identify patterns and trends among patients from the community treated at its facilities. In response to the question regarding critical areas of health care delivery that are not currently or sufficiently addressed by Florida universities or their affiliated partners, and should be, institutions responded as follows: o Four institutions identified mental health, access to affordable health care, and physician shortages. o Three institutions identified lack of residency positions, and care of the elderly. o Two institutions identified fun ding for uninsured/indigent patients, public/population health, telemedicine, dental care and primary care. o Among the eleven respondents, single institutions identified veteran's health, the Affordable Care Organization model, health care literacy, wellness and dise ase prevention, chronic disease management, health disparities, supply of nurses, rural medicine, infectious disease, FQHC affiliations, threat to children's medical services funding, home health pr ograms, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and home health programs. One area of critical health care delive ry that is not currently sufficiently addressed by Florida universities or their affiliated partners bears special mention. Funding for Graduate Medical Education represents a substantial revenue source for SUS institutions, and has been among the top three legislative issues for the Florida Council of Medical School Deans for the past eight years. Growth in Graduate Medical Education programs and funded positions was sign ificantly halted with the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which capped Medicare reimbursements for Direct and Indirect Medical Education (DME and IME) at the number of residents in training as of December 31, 1996. Additionally, the amount of Indire ct Medical Education funding has decreased since that time. Although there has been some growth in both Graduate Medical Education programs and slots due to several factors, including a small number of redistributed residency slots, a few programs established in new settings that had no previous Graduate Medical Education of any kind, a limited nu mber of VA-funded positions, and some above-the-cap hospital funded- programs, many believe that the increases have not been sufficient to meet the projected physician workforce needs for the country. As part of the survey, institutions were queried regarding past, current, and future plans for Graduate Medical Education programs or positions within existing programs. Results of the survey showed that since 2012-13, on ly two programs were discontinued, 7422 a Transitional Internal Medicine program and a Geriatrics program. None of the institutions had plans for any further discontinuation of programs. On the other hand, as noted in Ta ble 7 in the Appendix, several new programs have been developed, with some increase in positions in existing programs at certain of the schools. Also, as noted in Table 8 in the Appendix, several institutions, partic ularly the ones with newer medical schools, have plans to start addition al programs in the near future. Notwithstanding these additions, an adequate number of residency slots is apt to remain an issue due to the magnitude of the current shortage. Question Three: How is the delivery of h ealth care emerging and evolving in ways that will have an impact on the preparation of health care workers by Florida Universities? In order to better understand the univer sities' responses that were given to the above survey question, some addition al information regarding a major new development, the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and its effect upon health care delivery needs to be provided. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the concepts of Accountable Care Organizations and Patient-Centered Medical Homes became much more widespread. A study in the June 3, 2014 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine10 shows that when practices use a Patient-Centered Medical Home model that relies on electronic health re cords, they achieve a higher quality of care than non-Patient-Centered Medical Ho me models that use electronic health records or those that use paper health records. The Patient-Centered Medical Home is a model of primary care that is patient-centered, comprehensive, team- based, coordinated, accessible, and focused on quality and safety. An Accountable Care Organization is a networ k of doctors and hospitals that share financial and medical responsibility for providing coordinated care to patients in hopes of limiting unnecessary spending. Each patient's care is directed by a primary care physician. The Accounta ble Care Organization is eligible for bonuses when its members deliver care more efficiently and is liable for penalties when they do not. There has been significant growth in th e number of practices that qualify as Patient-Centered Medical Homes as well as the number of Accountable Care 10 Kern, L.M.; Edwards, A.; & Kaushal, R. (2014, June 3). The Patient-Centered Medical Home, Electronic Health Records, and Quality of Care. Ann Intern Med .: 160 (11): 741-749. 7523 Organizations over the past three to four years. According to Leavitt Partners Center for Accountable Care Intelligence, in July 2012:11 California led all states with 58 Accountable Care Organizations followed by Florida with 55 and Texas with 44. Accountable Care Organizations are primarily local organizations, with 538 having facilities in only one state. At the Hospital Referral Region level, Accountable Care Organizations now are present throughout much of the United States, though some regions, primarily rural areas in the northern Great Plains and Southeast still have limited Accountable Care Organizations activity. Los Angeles (26), Boston (23) and Orlando (17) have the most Accountable Care Organizations. The Leavitt Partners Center for Accountable Care Intelligence report indicated that 88 more medical groups had been added to the Accountable Care Organizations list all over the nation, incl uding ten groups from Florida. Health care providers in Florida, most of them physicians, totaled nearly 1,300 doctors who earned the Accountable Care Organiza tions designated title by the federal government. Given the involvement of this many providers throughout the state, it is likely that many more Medi care beneficiaries in Florida will be using this kind of care. SUS institutions were asked to describe the settings or services included in the provision of care in the organization and their perceived importance now and over the next five years. As described ab ove, the passage of the Affordable Care Act is a major influence upon evolving and emerging trends in settings and services: Only two institutions (UF and UCF) indicated that they are currently a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, and only one (UF) indicated that it is part of an Accountable Care Organization. However, an additional five institutions indicated that they plan to become a Patient-Centered Medical Home model, and three instit utions plan to become part of Accountable Care Organizations within the next five years. Each institution that was or was pl anning to become a Patient-Centered Medical Home model or part of an Accountable Care Organization placed a high importance on these organizational structures. Six institutions are already using electronic health records and an additional institution plans to start using one within the next five years. 11 Muhlestein, D, (2014, January 29). Leavitt Partne rs Center for Accountable Care Intelligence. Accountable Care Growth In 2014: A Look Ahead. Health Affairs Blog . Available at http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/01/29/accou ntable-care-growth-in-2014-a-look-ahead/ 7624 Question Four: How, if at all, are accrediting bodies for health care programs altering their standards to align with em erging and evolving changes to health care delivery? Among the ways in which accrediting bodi es are aligning their standards with emerging and evolving changes in health care delivery are the addition of a standard requiring inter-professional co llaborative training for students, changes in curriculum and pedagogy that affect th e way faculty teach, an emphasis on outcomes measures over process in st udent evaluation, and the provision of faculty development and support for student evaluation. In addition to hands-on clinical care deliv ery, learners must also be trained in the system of health care delivery. Th e Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) now has a standard requiring in ter-professional training within the medical education program of accredited medical schools. LCME Standard 7.912 on inter-professional collaborative skills states that: The faculty of a medical school ensure that the core curriculum of the medical education program prepares medical students to function collaboratively on health care teams that include health professionals from other disciplines as they provide coor dinated services to patients. These curricular experiences include practi tioners and/or students from the other health professions (p. 11). Similarly, the Commission on Osteopathi c College Accreditation's Standard 6.4 13 states that: The COM [College of Medicine] must help to prepare students to function on health care teams that include pr ofessionals from other disciplines. The experiences should include practitioners and/or students from other health professions and encompass the principles of collaborative practices (p. 21). 12 Liaison Committee on Medical Education.

When asked about the impact of educat ional accrediting bodies on the care provided by faculty members, medica l schools mentioned several Liaison Committee on Medical Education standards th at directly relate to changes being made in the curriculum. These includ e Standard 7.9 on inter-professional collaborative skills, as well as the stan dards regarding curriculum content, specific skills, attitudes and behaviors students must demonstrate, types of patients and clinical settings students must encounter, and qualifications of faculty. Also mentioned are standards th at directly impact faculty members such as the move to more small group learnin g, incorporation of quality improvement and safety education into the curriculum, and the increasing use of simulation. They also mentioned Accreditation Co uncil on Graduate Medical Education standards emphasizing outcomes over process measures, and the need for Graduate Medical Education to occur in an atmosphere of continuous quality improvement. In addition, survey respondents noted that there is an opportunity for universities and academic medical centers to play a role in the maintenance of certification process for physicians after residency. One institution mentioned that accrediting bodies had also impacted the care provided by its faculty members by help ing the College of Medicine utilize input from faculty members to enhance faculty development, helping to ensure that core faculty understands evaluation pr ocesses, and ensuring that residency program directors have protected time and are compensated for their role as program leaders. Two years ago, through its ACE initia tive (Accelerating Change in Medical Education), the American Medical Association provided $1 million to each of 11 schools to focus on reforming the current medical education system to one that would better prepare physicians for futur e practice. The AMA just announced an additional $1 million dollars to be split among 20 additional schools ($75,000 each) to join the initiative. In another important accreditation mo ve, as of 2020, all nursing schools in Florida will be required to underg o accreditation by a national body. Question Five: Given that health care de livery is changing, should the current mix of didactic versus clinical in health-related curricula be modified? The quick answer is \"yes.\" The reasons why include changes in curricula and its delivery, the needs of a more diverse st udent body, and the eventual placement 7826 of graduates in a variety of communities and settings that will require understanding of the needs of underserved populations. Just as accreditation standards regard ing the need for inter-professional education have increased over the past few years, it has also been recognized that a more integrated, developmentally-a ppropriate structure to health care education is needed. Curriculum reform is prevalent throughout the country and Florida schools are part of the trend. Review of the medical school curricula in the state reveals that more education is occurring in small groups, clinical learning centers, simulation centers, and clinical preceptorships in the community. Therefore, the question is no longer \"should,\" but \"how quickly\" curricular modification is occurring an d what the improved outcomes of the changes will be. In addition, university respondents were asked to describe health care delivery or educational programs, including stud ent recruitment strategies, at their institutions designed to fill gaps in delivery for underserved areas and populations. They described a number of pre-matriculation pipeline programs as well as programs within their curre nt curriculum that are designed specifically to meet the needs of underser ved populations. Some institutions also noted plans for new programs specifically to address this issue. Several examples are provided below. UNF noted that its nursing program sp ecializes in community health care delivery, which focuses on underserved are as and populations. FGCU offers a Nurse Practitioner program that focu ses on primary care, particularly in underserved areas. FGCU is also plan ning on starting a Physician Assistant Studies program that will prepare grad uates who will serve in primary care settings as well as contribute to special ty areas in critical need in southwest Florida. FAMU's School of Allied He alth and College of Pharmacy have a number of programs focused on filling gaps in delivery of health care services to underserved populations. FAMU also noted that it recruits and graduates significant numbers of under-represented students in pharmacy, with its College of Pharmacy being the number one producer of African-American pharmacists in the nation. FIU described the Green Family Foun dation NeighborhoodHELP program, which is a community classroom for applying ethical, social, and clinical competencies to educate medical studen ts on non-biological factors in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of unde rserved households. During these home visits, students work with their hous ehold members to implement a household- centered approach to clinical care. FAU described a number of programs where its medical students provide services to underserved populations and noted that 7927 its College of Nursing is redesigning clin ical practicums for nurse practitioner education to more underserved areas. FSU described its SSTRIDE (Science Students Together Reaching Instructio nal Diversity and Excellence) program, designed to assist in identifying, nurt uring, and recruiting qualified students from backgrounds traditionally under-repr esented in medical school. FSU also noted several areas in its curriculum wher e students are exposed to caring for underserved populations, including minority, geriatric populations and individuals from rural areas. USF noted that all courses and clerkships in its curriculum address concepts that pertain to the care of underserved populations. In addition, USF described the SELECT pr ogram, which consists of professional development courses that offer conceptual and skills-based instruction on cross- cultural health care. USF also described a number of targeted outreach, pipeline, and development programs already in pl ace and their efforts to expand the number of applicants to these programs of emphasis. UF, likewise, has a number of pre-matriculation pipeline programs, along with a holistic admissions process that values students' diverse backgr ounds and personal life experiences, including those who grew up in rural areas or around medically underserved populations. UF also has a number of curricular elements that address population health concepts and emphasiz e the importance of health care access and delivery across socio-demographic gr oups as well as early primary care clinical opportunities in setti ngs serving the underserved. Question Six: What technological change s in health care delivery will require concomitant changes in health care education? It is well recognized that greater inter-op erability of electronic health records is needed to allow increased sharing of me dical information with teams of health professionals in order to facilitate data retrieval for quality and billing purposes, and to help alleviate patient safety co ncerns. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has issued a roadmap for shared nationwide interoperability (http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/nationwide-interoperability- roadmap-draft-version-1.0.pdf ). Increased use of telemedicine allows interactive communication between the patient and the physician or practitioner at a distant site. This type of interaction can lead to greater efficiencies, includ ing improved access to care and overall health. Telemedicine represents a change in the health care delivery method, but not necessarily in how physicians prac tice. The lack of reimbursement for telemedicine services has limited its use in Florida. Legislation was introduced in the Florida Legislature for the past two years to alleviate this barrier; it failed 8028 to pass in either session. It is premature at this time to predict how much of an emerging or evolving influence telemedicine will have in Florida. The survey of SUS institutions revealed that four institutions are already using telemedicine and three others plan to be gin using it in the next five years. Electronic health records use in the SUS institutions has already been noted. Simulation is also playing a greate r role in SUS colleges of medicine. Conclusion The results of the survey presented in this report were primarily provided by Colleges of Medicine within the SUS. Future surveys of similar information should specifically request input from ot her colleges participating in health care delivery. Health care is provided by SUS faculty members in academic health centers, community hospitals, VA hospitals, outp atient clinics and physician offices, health departments, and community health centers. Each medical school has a faculty practice plan. The structure of th ese plans differs based on the nature of affiliated partnerships (VA hospitals, pr ivate hospitals, public hospitals, and community health centers) and stage of development. The newer medical schools are still developing practice plans, while the older schools have mature plans which contribute significantly to th e education of students and residents, as well as to the revenue streams of th e medical schools. The practice plans within the SUS face the same challeng es as practices in the community. Combining the increased use of teams to provide care, expanding the use of technology (electronic health records, tele medicine), and providing care to more groups and underserved populations will likely shift the types of providers, setting of services, and payment struct ure for health care in the future. Health care provision by SUS institutions is only likely to grow, particularly as its newer medical schools expand their services. Top areas of health care delivery are identifiable by institution, and the institutions are cognizant of barriers and opportunities in the provisio n of quality health care. Changes to accreditation standards have favorably impacted health education and, thus, health care delivery. Curriculum reform is prevalent in the health-related programs in the SUS. Finally, Florida's particular demographics will, in and of themselves, affect health care delivery in the future. Firs t and foremost, Florida is continuing to grow, and this growth will increase the stress on Florida's health care 8129 infrastructure. Florida's demographics are not expected to stabilize or to decrease, as other states project. Instead, all projections show continued increases in population as far out as th ese projections are made. Further, while the historical trend of retirees moving to Florida is continuing, pre-retirees are now also moving to Florida in greater nu mbers. Florida is trending toward a population that tends to be bimodal, wi th large percentages of the population aged 24 and below, and large percentages aged 65 and above. In addition, Florida's health care needs are not evenly distributed throughout the state. Rural areas, in particular, can be under-supplied, even though the state as a whole may have a sufficient supply in any given heal th care occupation. Florida's health care delivery infrastructure will be challenged by these demographics in the years to come, and it will be imperative th at the SUS institutions best position themselves as part of the solution to the challenges ahead. 8230 Appendix: Board of Governor s Health Initiatives Committee Survey on Health Care Delivery Introduction The purpose of the survey was to assist in the third component of this year's environmental scan to inform the Heal th Initiatives Committee as to the opportunities and challenges associated with health care delivery in the State University System. Health Care Delivery: Description For the purpose of this survey, we focuse d on health care services provided by faculty and staff of the twelve SUS instit utions. This included those services provided within, but not necessarily lim ited to, academic health centers, community hospitals, faculty practice plans, affiliated physician practices, health departments, community health centers, and surgery centers. Methods To gauge the level of health care deliv ery currently being provided by faculty members in the State University System, a 16 question survey was sent to each of the SUS institutions. Of the 11 schools re sponding to the survey, five reported none to very limited activity in the area of health care delivery (University of West Florida, New College, Florida Gulf Coast University, University of North Florida, Florida A & M University). Although Polytechnic University did not respond, given their short time of existence and the focus of their educational programs, we believe they would also fa ll in this category. Four of the universities reporting have relatively n ew or very small practice plans, mainly due to the fact that their medical schools have been in existence 15 years or less (Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, University of Central Florida, Florida State University). Two of the universities have very mature faculty practice plans and report ed significant activity (University of South Florida, University of Florida - Gainesville and Jacksonville campuses). 8331 Results Scope of Health Care Delivery 1. How do you define the health care delivery service area for your institution? The institutions that provide health c are services do so in a number of settings in close vicinity to the parent institution, as well as in the towns, cities, communities immediately surroun ding the institutions and several extend services statewide and even out-of-state. Sites of services include outpatient clinics, federally qualifie d health centers (FQHC), county health departments, private physician practices, community hospitals, correctional facilities, academic health centers, VA hospitals and clinics, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers and student health centers. 2. How would you describe the communities served by your health care providers, in terms of primary geography (urban, rural, suburban, inner city) and/or specific populations? The sites of care noted in question #1 are located in urban, inner-city, suburban and rural areas of the state. There was little distinction among the institutions in this regard, as each of them reported providing services in multiple geographic areas with diverse populations served. 3. Does your institution have a faculty practice plan? Please provide any clarifying details on (1) the owners hip structure, (2) the extent of participation of the colleges/schools/ programs or (3) anticipated changes in the institution's faculty practice plan. Half of the schools reported having a faculty practice plan, the entity that serves as the structure for receiving clinical practice revenues generated from services provided by faculty clinicians. These plans are set up as 501C.3 not-for-profit entities per Florida Statutes Section 1004.28, and are under the control of the Boards of Trust ees of the universities. Of the six schools with a faculty practice plan, th ree of them only serve the Colleges of Medicine, while the other thre e include other units within the university. Two of the schools current ly with neither a faculty practice plan nor a medical school reported that they are having preliminary discussions or are considering starting a faculty practice plan. FGCU reports that they have \"begun pre liminary discussions on establishing a faculty practice plan that would focu s in the areas of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and athletic training, and would represent an 8432 integrative partnership between the identified Department, College and the University's central administration. No specific timeline has been identified for developing this initiati ve.\" FAMU reports that the \"Division of Physical Therapy in the School of Allied Sciences is exploring opportunities to establish a faculty practice plan in 2017-18. Initial conversations have begun between the University/Division of Physical Therapy and Bond Community Health Specialty Clinic and Outdoors Disabled Association/Goodwill Indust ries to offer physical therapy services at their Tallahassee locations.\" 4. What do you perceive to be the greatest health care delivery needs in your service area and statewide?

Has the delivery of health care changed at your institution in recent years? Five institutions reported changes in th e delivery of health care in recent years. a. How has it changed? Areas of change among the fi ve institutions included: Greater use of EHR's, including CPO (Computerized Physician Orders) Telemedicine Increasing opportunities for interprofessional/interdisciplinary training and care 8836 Expanded and Enhanced relationships with community partners New Faculty Practice Plan development Expanded clinical training si tes, including community health centers Expansion of primary and specialty care services Increased emphasis on metric-driven continuous improvement in clinical quality and service outcomes Increased emphasis on value b. What have you changed or plan to change with regards to any of your educational programs to better prepare graduates for the changing health care delivery systems? Planned changes to better prepare graduates for the changing health care delivery systems included: More opportunities for interprofessional training and care teams Implement and/or expand telemedicine services Values-based, patient-centered care Renewed emphasis on quality and safety and including residents in the initiative Expand experiences in geriatrics, rehabilitative medicine, and primary care Formal training in use of the EHR and medical informatics Expanded educational focus in the areas of population health, personalized and precision medicine; and health policy More emphasis on boot camps at end of third and fourth years to prepare students for their residencies Incorporate more patient safety, epidemiology, and practice of medicine content within the educational program Provide opportunities to practice in a patient-centered medical home environment For nursing education, add community-based care in curriculum, partner for service delivery, consider new concentrations in MSN program, purchase EHR for student use, add residencies for DNP students, and evidence-based practice projects for undergraduates c. What impact has your educational accrediting bodies had on the care provided by your faculty members? 8937 Medical schools mentioned several LCME standards that directly relate to changes being made in the curriculum. These include Standard 7.9 on Interprofessional Collaborative Skills, as well as the standards regarding curriculum cont ent, specific skills, attitudes and behaviors students must demonstrate, types of patients and clinical settings students encounte r and qualifications of faculty. Also mentioned are standards that directly impact faculty members such as the move to more small group learning, incorporation of quality improvement and safety education into the curriculum and the increasing use of simulation. They also mention ACGME standards emphasizing outcomes over process measures, and the need for Graduate Medical Education to occur in an atmosphere of continuous quality improvement. It was also noted that there is an opportunity for universities and ac ademic medical centers to play a role in the Maintenance of Certifica tion process for physicians after residency. One institution mentioned that accrediting bodies had also impacted the care provided by its faculty members by helping the college of medicine utilize in put from faculty members, while enhancing faculty development; help ing to ensure that core faculty understand evaluation processes; and ensuring that residency program directors have protected time and are compensated for their role as program leaders. 11.
