William P. Moran, MD, MS, Karen Nelson, MD, James L. Wofford, MD, MS, Ramon Velez, MD, MSc, L. Douglas Case, PhD, Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Boston, Massachusetts PURPOSE: To determine whether an educational brochure or a lottery-type incentive increases influenza immunization rates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ln a prospective, Single- blind factorial design randomized trial at an urban community health center, all high-risk patients (n = 797) seen in the preceding 18 months were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a control group; a group mailed a large print, illustrated educational brochure emphasizing factors important to patients in making a decision about influenza immunization; a group mailed a lottery-type incentive announcing that all patients receiving influenza immunization would be eligible for grocery gift certificates; and a group mailed both educational brochure and incentive. Immunization was free, available without an appointment, and recorded by a computerized tracking system. RESULTS: The group mailed the brochure was more likely to be immunized than control (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.45 to 3.61), as was the group mailed the incentive (OR = 1.68, 95% Cl 1.05 to 2.68), but there was no difference between the group mailed both interventions and the control group. The effectiveness of the brochure was more striking for individuals who had not accepted immunization in the prior year (OR = 4.21, 95% Cl 2.48 to 7.14), suggesting a true educational effect rather than simply a reminder.

T here is now overwhelming evidence that a large proportion of the morbidity and mortality result- ing from influenza is preventable.'-\" In the United States, epidemics of influenza may cause 20,000 to 40,000 deaths and result in as many as 1.72,OOO hos- pitalizations. 'J Annual influenza immunization has been recommended for individuals who are most likely to die or develop serious complications from influenza. These high-risk individuals are persons aged 65 years or older, and persons under 65 with chronic cardiopulmonary disease, metablolic disease (including diabetes mellitus), hemoglobinopathies, immunosuppression, or renal dysfunction.' Influenza immunization has been shown to reduce mortality, rates of hospitalization, and the severit;y of clinical illness from influenza when the prevalent strain matches that in the vaccine.'-\",' Assuming a 70% vac- cine efficacy and 70% immunization rate of individ- uals at high risk, influenza immunization could pre- vent almost 10,000 deaths and 80,000 hospital- izations annually.',\" Despite the proven efficacy of influenza immuni- zation, the national rate for influenza immunization of high-risk individuals is estimated to be 40%, al- though the rate of influenza immunization may be over 50% for individuals age 65 and older.Y*10 Physi- cian knowledge and awareness seems not to be a critical barrier, since the majority of physicians are convinced that influenza is a serious disease, believe influenza immunization is safe and effective, and ac- cept the national recommendations for immuniza- tion. It should not be surprising that approximately 70% to 80% of all influenza immunizations are given in physicians' offices, and high-risk p,atients with physician appointments during the immunization season are likely to be immunized.\" The Public Health Service has established the \"Healthy People 2000\" goal of immunizing 60% to 80% of high-risk individuals each year.\" Primary care practices are most likely to achieve this goal if sev- eral systematic strategies are implemented.\" The practice could establish a \"standing order\" to im- munize all high-risk individuals without requiring an 0002-9343/96/$15.00 PII SOOO2-9:343(96)00327-O INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION FOR HIGH-RISK PATIENTS/MORAN ET AL The Flu Shot is FREE and available NOW at the Dorchester House!

Alerting high-risk patients with mailed reminders for influ- enza immunization is recommended in efforts to in- crease immunization among high-risk individuals.\",\"' However, in a prior study at the community health center where the current study was conducted, letter reminders appeared to have no impact on the rate of inlluenza immunization.\" To enhance the impact of outreach efforts, an ed- ucational component can be added to mailed re- minders. In an effort to develop effective educational materials, Carter et alD constructed and tested a de- cision model to determine which factors were con- sidered important to older patients when deciding to seek or decline influenza immunization. The model suggested that the avoidance of the discomfort and complications of influenza, the desire not to infect others, and a physician's recommendation favored patient acceptance of influenza immunization. Side effects and complications of the vaccine itself were the major factors against accepting immunization. A brochure addressing these concerns led to a 15% in- crease in the influenza immunization rate of older, predominantly male patients who would have been predicted by the model to refuse immunization.\"\" Thus, interventions that specifically target patients' attitudes about the side effects and complications of the influenza vaccine may improve compliance with immunization. Such interventions could have a sus- tained impact on immunization, since patients who accept influenza immunization are also more likely to accept immunization in subsequent years.'4 Offering a financial incentive to high-risk patients is an alternative to education in efforts to persuade patients to consider accepting influenza irnmuniza- tion. Financial incentives to patients have not pre- viously been used to promote influenza irnmuniza- tion. Food and other non-cash incentives have been employed to improve compliance with follow-up for a number of health care efforts,\"'12\" and cash incen- tives effectively increased adherence to first follow- up appointment for tuberculosis therapy among homeless individuals.\"' Rather than a direct financial incentive, however, in this study we offersed an in- centive in the form of a modest lottery-type prize to induce high-risk individuals to consider infhienza im- munization. Lottery-type prize incentives have been most commonly employed in smoking cessation tri- als, both in community trials and ln targeted trials in individuals with smoking-related disease.\"\"-\"' Many of the high-risk patients at this community health center participate in the Massachusetts state lottery so a lottery prize, in the form of a grocery gift cer- tificate, was thought by center staff to be an accept- able but less costly alternative to a direct cash in- centive.

The lottery-type incentive announcement. education and incentive in increasing influenza im- munization, we mailed an illustrated educational brochure and a lottery-type incentive announce- ment, alone or in combination, to high-risk patients. METHODS This study was conducted during the 1991-1992 influenza season on the adult medicine service of an urban community health center, staffed by five full or part-time physicians board certified in internal medicine or family medicine, four resident physi- cians, and one physician assistant. The service pro- vides for more than 9,000 ambulatory care visits an- nually by poor to lower income patients. All high-risk ambulatory patients seen within the preceding 18 months and entered into the computerized tracking system were included in the study. Patients were identified by a search of the tracking database using age and ICD-9 CM codes corresponding to high-risk conditions.4 A three-panel educational brochure (Figure 1) was designed to address factors shown to influence patients' decision to accept influenza immunization (the \"flu shot\") and was based on the model devel- oped by Carter et al.15,1B A statement and the line drawings in the brochure indicated that influenza (the \"flu\") is a serious disease with potentially severe consequences, and the caption present.s the choice facing the patient: \"Where will you be this winter?\" \"You decide . . .\" is intended to empower the indi- vidual, and \"Get a flu shot!\" presents the necessary action clearly. The lower panels emphasize impor- tant decision factors, and two statements addressing the immunization fears of the individuals appear on the lower second panel. The third panel contains in- formation about where and when the immunization may be obtained. The lottery-type incentive (Figure 2) announced that patients could \"win two ways\" in accepting in- fluenza immunization: (1) immunization is recom- mended by the doctors at the center to reduce the chances of getting influenza, and (2) if patients are immunized, they are eligible to win one of three gro- cery store gift certificates. The announcement lim- ited eligibility to patients with high-risk indications for the immunization. High-risk patients were randomly allocated to one of four groups. Patients in the control group received \"usual care\" and were not mailed an intervention. The three intervention groups were mailed either the educational brochure, the lottery-type i:ncentive, or both the educational brochure and the incentive. The interventions were sent by first class mail, the edu- cational brochure initially, and 1 week later the lot- tery-type incentive announcements. Twelve inter- ventions were returned by the post office as undeliverable, eight of which were readldressed and remailed, and all were included in the analysis. Since immunization is recommended at least 4 weeks prior to potential outbreaks of influenza in late January and early February, only immunizations adminis- tered from the beginning of October to the last week of December were considered for analysis. The drawing for the lottery-type incentive prizes was held during the last week of December. Health care providers and staff at the center were blind to the patients' group assignment. Influenza immunization was given at the health center free of charge during scheduled provider vis- its, at a \"health fair\" in late October, or on a \"walk- 614 December 1996 The American Journal of Medicine@ Volume 101 TABLE I Baseline Comparison of Covariates by Group Treatment Group (n = 797) Control Brochure incentive P n (%) n (%) n (%) Both n (%) value Total 202 (100) 198 (100) 198 (100) 199 (100)000-000 Age 0.143 Mean age/SD* 66/16.6 65/l 5.9 65/l 7.2 68/15.2 Median 69 71 Age range 18-99 19-92 19-92 21-95 Age 65 or older 138 (68) 139 (70) 133 (67) 153 (77) Gender 0.965 Female 134 (66) 128 (65) 129 (65) 133 (671 Risk factors Alcoholism 17 (8) 12 (6) 22 (11) 10 (5) 0.104 Cardiac disease 51 (25) 53 (27) 54 (27) 36 (18) 0.118 Diabetes mellitus 25 (12) 28 (14) 24 (12) 17 (9) 0.368 lmmunodeficiency 4 (2) 4 (2) 5 (3) 3 (2) 0.914 Liver disease 6 (3) 1 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) 0.153 Pulmonary disease 72 (36) 69 (35) 60 (30) 62 (31) 0.593 Renal disease l(l) l(l) 2 (1) - 0.567 Number of risk factors (excluding age) 0.147 None 73 (36) 79 (40) 74 (37) 101 (50) One 91 (49) 78 (39) 90 (45) 69 (35) Two 30 (14) 33 (171 24 (12) 26 (13) Three 7 (3) 8 (4) 9 (5) 3 (11 Four 1 (1) - l(l) - Prior immunization history when known (n = 328) Immunized prior year/total 37/97 (38) 25/79 (32) 38/82 (46) 27/70 (39) 0.297 ' Standard deviation. in\" basis. A nurse routinely obtained an informed consent for influenza immunization after explaining the indications, contraindications, and potential side effects to influenza immunization. Influenza immu- nization was counted only if given at the health cen- ter. The data sources for immunization data were the clinical encounter (billing) form and the informed consent. After completion of the study in early Jan- uary, a single follow-up postcard survey of 100 ran- domly selected study patients, not documented as immunized at the center, was performed to estimate the proportion of patients who were immunized at other health care sites. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess which patient characteristics individ- ually were predictive of obtaining influenza immu- nization (Table I). Logistic regression was then used to assess which variables were significant in a mul- tivariate analysis via likelihood ratio statistics. The outcome variable was influenza immunization and variables used in the logistic model included treat- ment group, age (in years), gender, alcohol abuse, cardiac disease, diabetes, pulmonary function, and \"risk,\" where \"risk\" was defined as the arithmetical sum of all individual diagnosis risk factors and ex- cluding age alone as a risk factor. Each separate risk factor included in the model was coded in such a way that absence of the factor was the reference group. The number of risk factors was indicated in the model as 0 = no risk factors, 1 = one risk factor, and 2 = two or more risk factors. Two dummy vari- ables were used to code risk in such a way that ab- sence of any risk factor was the reference group. Patients with immunodeficiency, liver disease, and renal disease were excluded from the logistic re- gression analysis because there were so few patients with these diagnoses. Both forward and backward stepwise algorithms were used to select a #subset of variables predictive of obtaining influenza immuni- zation. All two-way interactions between the patient covariates and treatment group were assessed ini- tially. Data on prior immunization were incomplete in the practice information system, so analyses both included and excluded prior year influenza. immuni- zation. Data on prior immunization status was avail- able for 328 patients in the study. Confidence inter- vals were obtained by exponentiating beta i 1.96 + SE, where beta is the estimate of a factor effect and SE is its standard error. Neither the Homer-Leme- show nor the CC Brown goodness-of-fit statistic was significant in any model, indicating good fit for the model.

EpiInfo (version 5.0, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia) was used for the initial data analysis and subsequent statistical analysis was performed using BMDP (version 1990, BMDP Statis- tical Software, Los Angeles, California). RESULTS A total of 816 patients were identified by searching the tracking database. Sixteen randomized patients were not high risk by age or medical diagnosis, a cod- ing error resulted in a single patient being assigned to two groups (n = 2), and one nonexistent medical rec- ord number was identified. After excluding these data, 797 patients remained for analysis. Influenza immuni- zation data for the prior year was available for 328 study patients. The mean age of the study patients was 66 years old with an age range of 18 to 99 years. There were 524 women (66%) and 273 men (34%). Baseline data for the four groups (Table I) showed no stat&i- tally significant differences among groups by age or gender, and no differences in the type or number of disease-related high-risk indications for patients. There was neither a significant difference among the groups in the proportion of individuals aged 65 years or greater nor the proportion of patients for whom prior immunization history was known. The main effects comparison between interven- tions and control (brochure n = 397 versus control n = 400, and incentive n = 397 versus (control n = 400) within the factorial design requires that the ef- fect of each intervention not be influenced by the presence of the other intervention factor. The bro- chure incentive first order interaction term was sta- tistically significant in the logistic regres;sion models (P = 0.0023) indicating a signiIicant subadditive in- teraction for the two interventions. Therefore, all subsequent analyses were performed as four group comparisons. Immunization rates by group stratifield by covari- ate are presented in Table II. The immunization rate for the educational brochure group was 16% higher than control whereas the incentive was 9% higher, and the group mailed both exceeded the control by only 6%. As shown in Table III, the ed- ucational brochure more than doubled the likeli- hood of influenza immunization (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 3.61), whereas the incentive had less of an effect on im- munization (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.68). Im- munization for the group mailed both interventions was not significantly different from control. For the subset of individuals for whom prior immunization status was known, the impact of the educational brochure was even more significant (OR = 3.95,95% CI 1.92 to S.lO), but the groups mailed incentive or both interventions were not significantly different from the control group. 616 December 1996 The American Journal of Medicine@ Volume 101 INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION FOR HIGH-RISK PATIENTS/MORAN ET AL TABLE Ill Factor Significantly Associated with Influenza Immunizations; All Study Patients and those Study Patients with Known Immunization History All Patients (n = 797) Patients with prior immunization history known (n = 328) Odds ratio 95% Cl p value Odds ratio 95% Cl p value Educational brochure 2.29 1.45-3.61 0.0004 0.0002 Incentive 1.68 1.05-2.68 0.0308 and incentive 1.41 0.88-2.27 0.1527 1.56 0.731-3.34 0.2460 Immunization in prior year - 4.21 2.48-7.14 0.0001 Age 1.02 1.01-1.03 0.0003 - - - Pulmonary disease 1.80 1.25-2.58 0.0015 - - - Diabetes mellitus 1.73 1.09-2.74 0.0215 - - Alcoholism 0.151-1.03* - 0.0405* ' 95% Cl IS derived from the Wald test, while the Pvalue IS derived from the likelihood ratlo.

The modeling process identifies factors that play a critical role in the patient's decision to accept or reject infhrenza immunization such as personal physician recommendation, patient's desire to avoid infecting others, and the perceived side effects and complications of the immunization itself. Further- more, the model seeks to predict patient acceptance or rejection of immunization based on these factors, and interventions were tested on patients who would have been predicted by the model to refuse immu- nization. Our study targeted a more heterogenous patient population (greater than 60% female), many of whom had accepted immunization in the past year, in the distinctly different setting of a commu- nity health center. Thus, it was possible that factors unimportant in the Carter decision model (transpor- tation, access to care, and so forth) could have been more important to the patients in our study. Fur- thermore, the decision model would have predicted that a significant proportion of our patients would seek immunization without prompting or educa- tional outreach. Nonetheless, the increase of 15% over the control immunization rate of 20% in this study was very similar to incremental increase in im- munization noted in the prior study.23 It is possible that the brochure had the effect of \"recruiting\" more patients for immunization, but we would have ex- pected such an effect from simple mailed reminders in our previous study.\" Finally, patients who had not accepted immunization in the prior year were more than three times more likely to accept im- munization in the current year when mailed the ed- ucational brochure. Thus, despite differences in study population, geographic location, health care practice, and delivery system, this study confirms that a mailed educational brochure based on a pa- tient decision model increased the rate of influenza immunization. The lottery-type incentive intervention led to a more modest increase in influenza immunization rate, which was not as clinically significant. The as- sumption underlying use of the incentive was that a noneducational means to encourage immunization might result in a short-term change in attitude and behavior regarding immunization. Since prior im- munization is strongly associated with acceptance of immunization in subsequent years, the lottery incen- tive offered the potential to change the long-term at- titude and behavior of high-risk individuals around the issue of influenza immunization. Incentives may vary from direct cash payment to groceries,37 clothing, books,26v27 or lottery tickets3' In the current study, the modest monetary value in- centive or the type of the prize (a lottery drawing for three $50 certificates for groceries) in all likelihood influenced the impact of the incentive. Thle monetary amount of the incentive was deliberately chosen as an intervention that could generalize to other health care settings if successful. Furthermore, the amount and type of the incentive were modest because of ethical concerns: the coercive influence of incentives to accept preventive care must be balanced against the risk (and perceived risks) of influenza immuni- zation. Although the safety of the immunization is well demonstrated and the health risk of influenza far exceeds the risks associated with influenza im- munization, many patients believe there may be sig- nificant health risks from influenza immunization it- self. Thus, a modest non-cash lottery incentive was chosen by the center staff and investigators to min- imize the \"coercive\" potential of the incentive among the patients of the health center, many of whom are poor. Interestingly, several patients expressed sus- picion about the concept of a lottery as am incentive for preventive health care (KN, personal observa- tion) . This type of modest financial incentive seems most effective when a discreet behavior change is targeted, but incentives have not been uniformly successful in clinical preventive studies. Incentives had a limited effect in efforts to increase the use of bicycle helmets and operating lights, and were in- effective in efforts to increase automobile seat re- straint use.38-40 Two studies used ince:ntives with limited success in worksite mammography pro- grams,41~42 yet several studies have successfully em- ployed modest incentives to increase prenatal clinic attendance.37s43 Incentives may be an effective method of initiating behavioral changes in health problems that have been more difficult to influence such as changing the attitudes of patients toward smoking cessation, weight control, and diet changes.44-46 0:n the other hand, in efforts to achieve compliance with directly observed antituberculosis therapy by health depart- ments, incentives may be as effective and less ex- pensive than coercive interventions such as court or- dered institutionalization.2\" Incentives have also been effective in populations who are traditionally difficult to reach, such as homeless individuals re- quiring tuberculosis treatmentz7 and injection drug users at risk for HIV infection,47 but apparently not for adolescents seen at a sexually transmitted dis- ease clinic.48 INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION FOR HIGH-RISK PATIENTS/MORAN ET AL 618 December 1996 The American Journal of Medicine\" Volume 101 The results of the combined brochure and incen- tive group were unexpected although not surprising in light of the reservations and suspicion expressed by some patients about the incentive. However, the effect does suggest that education and incentive in- fluence patient decisions in different ways, and in this trial, an adverse impact of the lottery incentive on patient decisions overcame any educational ef- fect of the brochure. Such subadditive effects have been seen in other studies targeting change in be- havior using education, feedback, and incentives to influence behavior,4g and suggests that educational and financial interventions may interact in other health care decisions. The strategy of using a factorial design was chosen to maximize the power to detect the effects of two distinct interventions on influenza immunization without significantly increasing the size of the study population or cost of the trial.\"' This design also al- lows measurement of an effect of one intervention on the other (ie, interaction), an occurrence that may not be measurable in any other way.51 Unfortunately, the occurrence of an interaction between the inter- ventions resulted in a dramatic decrease in the power of the study to detect an effect, and interac- tion reduced the study from a two-intervention, sin- gle-outcome factorial experiment to a four group trial. Despite the loss of statistical power, the edu- cational brochure resulted in a significant increase in immunization rate, compelling evidence that the brochure is effective. The overall influenza immunization rate was low in this study, but this rate is probably an underesti- mate for several reasons. The computerized tracking database is not always updated when a patient moves from the area, leaves the practice, or dies. The survey results indicated that a significant proportion of high-risk individuals seek immunizations at health care facilities other than their primary care site, as we have found in another study.52 These influenza immunizations cannot currently be captured by the primary care information systems, making practice- based estimates of influenza immunization rates sus- pect to significant bias. Finally, several survey re- spondents reported immunization at the health center for which there was no documentation, and this could reflect oversight by staff members. Successful influenza immunization programs re- quire a primary care centered systematic population- based approach to maximize immunization of high- risk individuals using clinician and patient prompts, education, and performance feedback.16-'\" As infor- mation systems become more common in supporting the coordination of primary care and targeting spe- cific at risk patients for preventive care and screen- ing interventions, it is important to test various out- reach strategies to assure effectiveness and cost effectiveness. In this study, the incentive had a lim- ited clinical effect at a marginal cost effectiveness of more than $8 per additional immunization. On the other hand, the marginal cost effectiveness of the educational brochure was less than $4 per additional immunization over those in the control group. Larger incentives might increase immunization rates, but it would be difficult to surpass the cost effectiveness of the educational intervention. Furthermore, edu- cational interventions are ethically less likely to be coercive and seem intuitively preferable to financial incentives. McDonald53 has suggested the most cost-effective use of mailed educational materials would result if interventions are used later in the immunization sea- son, after many patients who would accept without prompting have received immunization. The remain- ing patients would be those individuals who would not otherwise receive immunization or those who have refused in the past, both of which may respond to an educational prompt. This strategy would min- imize the cost of mailed educational prompts and effectively contribute to an overall practice strategy to maximize influenza immunization of high-risk in- dividuals.
