Their properties allow them to become potential candidates as safe, cheap, and effective vaccine adjuvants. The present study aimed to enhance the immunogenic response of a current injectable killed cholera vaccine (KCV) using chitosan and alginate KCV adjuvanted with alum, KCV adjuvanted with alum, chitosan, compared with a control unadjuvanted immunized group. Humoral, cellular, and functional immune responses were evaluated in all groups. The addition of adjuvants, particularly natural adjuvants, to KCV significantly improved the immune response as demonstrated by specific antibody increase, strong proliferation effects, and high protection rate against different challenge doses of cholera strains. Our findings demonstrate that chitosan and alginate salt are superior adjuvants for boosting the KCV immune response and highlights the requirement for further vaccine - [Alginate-coated chitosan nanoparticles act as effective adjuvant for hepatitis A vaccine in mice.](/32114177/)Int J Biol Macromol. 2020 Jun 1;152:904-912. - [A combined inactivated cholera and hepatitis A 2019 Oct Mol Sci. 2019.
