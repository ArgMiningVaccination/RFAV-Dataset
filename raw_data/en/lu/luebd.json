Purpose: Several studies have reported relationships among physical activity, healthy metabolic status, and increased natural killer (NK) cell activity. However, large-scale data thereon are lacking. Thus, the present study aimed to assess NK cell activity ac - cording to physical activity and metabolic status.Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 12014 asymptomatic examinees. Using a patented stimulatory cytokine, NK cell activity was quantitated by the amount of interferon- secreted into the plasma by NK cells. Physical activity lev - els were assessed using the validated Korean version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form. Results: The physically inactive group showed lower NK cell activity than the minimally active group (median, 1461 vs. 1592 pg/mL, p<0.001) 1461 vs. 1712 pg/mL, p =0.001). Compared to women with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.527.5 kg/m 2, those with a BMI <18.5 NK cell activity g/mL, p<0.001), and those with a BMI 27.5 kg/m2 tended to have lower NK cell activity (1356 vs. 1119 g/mL, p=0.070). Subjects with high hemoglobin A1c levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as men with high blood pressure and women with high triglyceride levels, exhibited lower NK cell activity. Moreover, physical inactivity and metabolic abnormalities were independently associated with low NK cell activity, even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: Physical inactivity and metabolic abnormalities are associated with reduced NK cell activity. Immune systems may become altered depending on physical activity and metabolic status.

Established methods that measure NK cell activity, such as the Chromium 51 ( 51Cr) release assay and CD107a degranula- tion commonly used to determine NK cell function; however, these methods are complicated and time-consuming, as they require isolation of peripheral blood mono - nuclear cells (PBMC) or NK cells. 13 Owing to these difficulties in measuring NK cell activity, large-scale data on the relation-ships between physical activity (high or low) and metabolic status (healthy or unhealthy) in relation to NK cell activity are currently unavailable. To overcome these difficulties, a rela-tively simple assay that utilizes whole blood instead of PBMC or isolated NK cells was recently developed for commercial use to measure the activity of NK cells (NK Vue \u00ae serum of ex vivo-stimulated whole blood to detect secreted interferon (IFN)- from NK cells as an indicator of NK cell activity. 3,14 We aimed to evaluate associations for physical activity and meta-bolic healthy status in relation to NK cell activity in a large sample of asymptomatic examinees using this novel and rela-tively simple blood test. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study population The Kangbuk Samsung Health Study is a cohort study of South Korean men and women, aged 18 years or older, who under - went a comprehensive annual or biennial health examination at the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Total Healthcare Center in Seoul and Suwon, South Korea. The study population consist - ed of a subset of Kangbuk Samsung Health Study participants who underwent an NK cell activity test from January 2016 to May 2017. In South Korea, the Industrial Safety and Health Law requires annual or biennial health screening examinations for all employees, which are offered free of charge. Approximately 80% of the participants were employees or their spouses of various companies and local governmental organizations; the remaining participants volunteered for the screening exami-nations. The exclusion criteria included having a history of cancer, in- flammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, and known hepatitis B or C infections, as well as prescription use of im-munosuppressive drugs, corticosteroids, and antibiotics with-in the last month, all of which may impact NK cell activity. Participants with missing physical activity data were also ex - cluded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kangbuk Samsung Hospital (IRB No. KBSMC 2017-06-007), and the requirement for informed consent was waived since only de-identified data were retrospectively assessed. Measurement and definition of variables Data on medical history and health-related behavior were col - lected through self-administered questionnaires. Physical mea - surements and serum biochemical parameters were measured by trained staff. The self-reported use of medication on a regu-lar basis over the last month was assessed through self-admin - istered questionnaires. Body mass index (BMI) was classified into the following three groups according to cut-off points for public health action, <18.5 kg/m 2 (underweight), 18.527.5 kg/m2 (normal or overweight; moderate risk), and 27.5 kg/m2 (obese; high risk).15 Physical activity levels were assessed using the validated Ko - rean version of the International Physical Activity Question-naire Short Form (IPAQ-SF). 16-18 IPAQ-SF measures the fre- quency and duration of any walking and other moderate to vigorous physical activity undertaken for more than 10 continu - ous minutes across all contexts (i.e., work, home, and leisure) during a seven-day period. IPAQ-SF enables the calculation of metabolic equivalents (MET-minutes per week) derived by as - signing standardized MET values of 3.3, 4, and 8 for walking, moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity, respectively. Phys - ical activity levels were classified into three categories, inac - tive, minimally active, and health-enhancing physically active (HEPA). These categories were derived from the following es - tablished criteria: inactive, which meets neither minimally ac - tive nor HEPA criteria; minimally active, which meets any of the following three criteria, 1) three or more days of vigorous ac - tivity for 20 min/day, 2) five or more days of moderate inten-sity activity or walking for 30 min/day, or 3) five or more days of any combination of walking and moderate intensity or vig-orous intensity activities achieving 600 MET-min/week; and HEPA, which meets one of either of the following two criteria, 1) vigorous intensity activity on three or more days per week ac - cumulating 1500 MET-min/week or 2) seven days of any com - bination of walking, moderate intensity, or vigorous intensity activities achieving at least 3000 MET-min/week. 16-18 NK cell activity measurement NK cell activity was measured using a recently developed blood test (NK Vue \u00ae Kit, ATGen). A 1-mL sample of whole blood, drawn using a direct vacutainer system from a new venipunc - ture point, was directly transferred into a specific tube for NK cell activity tests. The blood collection tube for assessing NK cell activity contains a patented stimulatory cytokine (Promo-ca TM, ATGen). The collection tube was gently and repeatedly mixed; within 30 minutes of collection, the tube was incubat - ed for 2024 hours in a 37o C chamber, according to the manu- facturer's instructions. During the incubation period, the stim - ulatory cytokine results in the secretion of IFN- into the plasma; this secretion predominantly occurs by NK cells rather than 556Natural Killer Cell and Physical Activity https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2018.59.4.554by other innate or adaptive immune cells.14 Following incubation, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 3 minutes. supernatant was im- mediately loaded onto enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Using a designed ELISA, IFN- levels were quan - titated and expressed in pg/mL. Statistical analysis Continuous variables are presented as the mean\u00b1standard de - viation or median [interquartile range (IQR)], while categori-cal variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. Comparison of baseline characteristics according to physical activity levels was performed using one-way ANOVA for con-tinuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical vari-ables. Comparison of NK cell activity levels according to phys - ical activity levels and metabolic status was performed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparison between the proportion of participants with low vs. high NK cell activity levels (<1500 pg/mL vs. 1500 pg/ mL), according to physical activity levels and metabolic sta-tus, was performed using logistic regression analysis. Vari-ables that were significant in univariable analysis were included in multivariable logistic regression models. All reported p-val- ues were two-tailed, and p -values <0.05 were considered tistically significant. SPSS software (version 18; SPSS Inc., Chi-cago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the study population We reviewed the medical records of 13595 participants that had undergone NK cell activity tests. Of these, 972 were excluded due to a history of cancer (n=488), inflammatory bowel disease (n=68), autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythemato-sus, n=6), hepatitis B infection (n=394), and hepatitis C infec - tion (n=16). Additionally, 356 participants were excluded due to the use of immunosuppressive drugs (n=25), corticosteroids (n=28), and antibiotics (n=303) within the last month. After excluding 253 participants with missing physical activity data, 12014 participants were finally analyzed. Baseline characteristics of the study participants regarding the categories of physical activity levels are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the study participants was 39.1\u00b17.7 years, and the proportion of males was 60.1%. The proportions of inac - tive, and 10.5% (n=1267), respectively. The mean age and the proportion of males and current smok - ers, as well as the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, were higher in the HEPA and minimally active groups than in the inactive group. BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure (BP) were also higher in the HEPA and minimally active groups than in the inactive group. NK cell activity according to physical activity levels and metabolic status The median level of NK cell activity for all participants was 1548 pg/mL (IQR, 6732726 pg/mL). Table 2 shows the medi-an levels of NK cell activity stratified according to physical ac - tivity levels and metabolic status. The HEPA group showed higher NK cell activity than the inactive group (1712 vs. 1461 pg/mL; p=0.001). The minimally active group also exhibited higher NK cell activity than the inactive group (1592 vs. 1461 pg/mL; p<0.001) (Fig. 1). The median level of NK cell activity was significantly lower Table 1.

There was no signifi- cant difference in the levels of NK cell activity between partici- pants with a BMI of 18.527.5 and 27.5 kg/m2 (p=0.400). Par - higher levels of hemoglobin (6.5%; 1261 women; 1426 pg/mL) had lower median levels of NK cell activity than those with lower hemoglobin A1c levels (1555 pg/mL; p =0.006), and higher HDL-C (1571 p =0.014). We then compared median levels of NK cell activity accord- ing to physical activity and metabolic status for men and wom - en separately (Table 2). In men, participants with higher levels of hemoglobin A1c (6.5%; 1450 pg/mL) and higher BP (130/ 85 1510 pg/mL) had lower median levels of NK cell activity than those with lower hemoglobin A1c levels (1731 pg/ Killer Cell and Physical Activity https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2018.59.4.554In women, the minimally active group had higher NK cell activity than the inactive group (1362 pg/mL vs. 1264 pg/mL; p=0.030), and the HEPA group also tended to have higher NK cell activity than the inactive group (1432 pg/mL vs. 1264 pg/mL; p=0.054). of NK cell activity was signifi- cantly lower in women with a BMI <18.5 kg/m 2 than in women (1024 pg/mL vs. 1356 pg/mL; p<0.001), and also tended to be lower in women with a BMI of 27.5 kg/m2 than in women with pg/mL BMI 30 kg/m2 (n=107) had significantly lower NK cell activity those kg/m2 (n=18) also showed lower NK cell activity, compared with those with a BMI of 18.527.5 kg/m 2, although the difference was not statistically significant (827 pg/mL vs. 1356 pg/mL, p =0.237). Women with high levels of fasting (100 1138 pg/mL) showed lower levels of NK cell activity than those with low levels of fasting blood glucose (1341 pg/mL; p = 0.002), hemoglobin HDL-C levels (1343 pg/mL; p=0.003). Associations for physical activity levels and metabolic status with NK cell activity The median level of NK cell activity for all participants was 1548 pg/mL; thus, we compared physical activity levels and meta-bolic status based on \"1500 pg/mL \" for convenience (Table 3). The proportion of participants with high NK cell activity (1500 pg/mL) was higher in the minimally active group [odds ratio (OR), 1.13; 95% confidence 95% <0.001) than in the inactive group. NK cell activity was also higher in par - ticipants with a BMI of 18.527.5 (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.492.24; p < 0.001) than in those with a BMI <18.5 kg/m2. Participants with higher levels of hemoglobin A1c (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.570.95; p=0.019) were more likely to exhibit low NK cell activity levels. Participants with higher levels of HDL-C were more likely to exhibit high NK cell activity levels (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.041.31; p=0.010). After adjusting for variables that were significant in univariable analysis (age, sex, smoking status, physical activity level, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, and HDL-C), the correlation be-tween physical activity level and metabolic factors (including BMI, hemoglobin A1c, and HDL-C) with NK cell activity re-mained significant. We also assessed physical activity level and metabolic status by quartiles of NK cell activity (Table 4). The proportions of the inactive group, underweight participants, and participants with high levels of hemoglobin A1c and low levels of HDL-C de-creased linearly with increasing quartiles of NK cell activity. DISCUSSION In this large-scale study that included 12014 asymptomatic participants, we found that NK cell activity differed depend-ing on physical activity and metabolic status. Minimally active and HEPA groups showed higher NK cell activity, compared with the inactive group. BMI <18.5 kg/m 2 (underweight), high levels of hemoglobin A1c, and low levels of HDL-C were asso-ciated with lower NK cell activity. Additionally, high BP in men and BMI 30 kg/m 2 and high levels of triglyceride in women were associated with lower NK cell activity. Moreover, the asso-ciation between physical inactivity and unhealthy metabolic status with low NK cell activity (<1500 pg/mL) was significant, even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and metabolic factors. Since 1968, the 'gold standard' assay for NK cell activity has been the 51Cr release assay. However, the 51Cr release assay has several important limitations, such as manipulation of hazard - ous radioactivity, isotope short half-life, high cost, and inter-laboratory variability. 13 Use of fluorescent dyes instead of radio - activity is an alternative method; however, this method is also complicated and time-consuming because it requires isolation of PBMCs and incubation with a target cell line. 13 In contrast, the NK Vue\u00ae Kit (ATGen) is simple, easy, takes less time, and requires only a 1-mL sample of whole blood. After incubation of 1 mL of whole blood with a patented stabilized cytokine for 2024 hours, a dedicated ELISA assay quantitates the amount of IFN- secreted into the plasma by both the cytotoxic and subsets of NK cells (CD56 of ex vivo cytokine- induced secretion of IFN- provides a more realistic reflection of in vivo NK cell activity than the 51Cr release assay.3 Recently, this NK cell activity test has been validated by confirming the expected difference in NK cell activity between some types of cancer patients and healthy controls. Several studies have re-ported that the sensitivity and specificity of the NK cell activity test for colorectal cancer (cut-off value 181 pg/mL) were 87% and 61%, respectively; those for gastric value 438 pg/mL) were 67% and 92%, respectively; and for 531 pg/mL) were 72% and 74%, respectively. 3,4,19 However, data on the relationship between physical activity and metabolic status with NK cell activity are limited. Using this simple test, we were able to conduct a large-scale study to determine if NK cell activity differs according to physical activity and metabolic status. Several studies have reported the effects of exercise on NK cell cytotoxicity. 20-24 Nieman, et al.20 demonstrated higher marathon runners than in sedentary con-trols, and Moro-Garcia, et al. 21 also showed higher NK cell cy- totoxicity in athletes, compared with non-athletes. A Japanese study revealed that exercise carried out three or four times a week was associated with an increase in NK cell activity. 22 An- other study reported elevated NK cell cytotoxicity in trained 559Yoon Suk Jung, et al. https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2018.59.4.554subjects in comparison with sedentary controls.23 Moreover, a randomly controlled 15-week exercise training (ET) study demonstrated that moderate ET is associated with elevated NK cell activity. 24 In line with these results, we also found that increased physical activity was associated with higher NK cell activity. Although the mechanisms behind the effects of exer - cise on NK cell activity have not been elucidated, the role of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and prostaglandins have been proposed as potential mediators of these effects. 7 Some studies have reported that increased physical activity levels are associated with improved survival rates for different cancers and that elevated NK-cell numbers in tumor tissues are associated with a better prognosis. 6-8 The enhanced role of NK cells may be responsible for explaining the positive effects of exercise on cancer patient survival.7,8 Our study included healthy participants without a history of cancer and demon- strated that physical activity improved NK cell activity, even in healthy individuals. Further longitudinal studies are needed to determine if increased NK cell activity due to increased physical activity in healthy individuals has a protective effect against cancer. Another finding in our study is that both obese and under - weight women have impaired NK cell activity. Women with a BMI <18.5 kg/m 2, as well as those with a BMI 30 kg/m2, showed lower levels of NK cell activity than women with a BMI of 18.527.5 kg/m 2. Previous animal studies have demonstrated Table 3.

Martin-Murphy, et al.26 revealed that mice lacking NK cells were more susceptible to weight gain and fatty livers following high-fat diets, and suggested that NK cells have an important role in preventing diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Additionally, obesity was reported to compromise NK cell function in humans. 11,12,27 Ex- cessive body fat elevates circulating adipokine levels, which can affect immune responses and functions. 28 Moreover, NK cell functionality can be modulated by adipokines.29,30 Long- term exposure to leptin, such as that seen in obese individuals with elevated serum leptin levels, impairs NK cell immune functions. 30 Interestingly, we found that underweight individ- uals were also associated with reduced NK cell activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that being underweight can impair NK cell activity. Several studies have reported that being underweight is a poor prog-nostic factor in patients with cancer and is accompanied by in-creased host inflammation and decreased immunity; 31,32 these results may be related to NK cell activity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism linking underweight in-dividuals with impaired NK cell activity. In the present study, unhealthy metabolic status (high lev - els of hemoglobin A1c, high BP , high triglyceride levels, and low HDL-C levels) was correlated with decreased NK cell ac - tivity. Similar to our results, some studies have reported a re-lationship between unhealthy metabolic status and reduced NK cell activity. 10-12 Kim, et al.10 showed that a metabolically unhealthy overweight group (higher BP and higher serum levels of triglyceride, glucose, glucose-related markers, and lower levels of HDL-C) had lower NK cell activity than a meta-bolically healthy overweight group. Lynch, et al. 11 also report - ed that healthy obese patients had higher levels of NK cells, compared with unhealthy obese patients, and had similar NK cell levels to lean healthy controls. Another recent study dem-onstrated that obese individuals, as well as non-obese indi-viduals with metabolic abnormalities, exhibit reduced pro-portions of invariant NK T cells. 12 Moreover, in diabetic obese mice, cancer metastasis was associated with decreased NK cell function. 33 The results of previous studies and our current study suggest that unhealthy metabolic status may result in an unfavorable immune system with lower NK cell activity. In addition, decreased activity of NK cells may have a significant role in visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to identify an as - sociation between physical activity and metabolic status with NK cell activity. Nevertheless, the current study has several limitations. First, most of the participants comprised employ-ees (and/or their spouses) of various companies and local governmental organizations; therefore, there was a potential selection bias, as most participants had a middle- or upper-class socioeconomic background. Second, other potential limitations of our study include its retrospective nature with-out measuring other cytokines, as well as the lack of elucida-tion on the mechanism by which physical activity and meta-bolic status affects NK cell activity. Third, allergic diseases (such as asthma, rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis), which could affect IFN- production by NK cells, were not considered. Fi- nally, the cross-sectional design precludes the determination of causality of the relationship between decreased NK cell ac -Table 4.

Further clinical trials are war - ranted to determine if exercise and improved metabolic health through lifestyle modifications increase NK cell activity. Despite these limitations, our results provide a better un- derstanding of the relationship between physical activity and metabolic status with human NK cell activity. Physically inac - tive subjects exhibited lower NK cell activity, compared with physically active subjects. Subjects with high levels of hemo-globin A1c and low levels of HDL-C showed lower NK cell ac - tivity. Additionally, obese and underweight women showed lower NK cell activity. Our study indicates that physical inac - tivity and unhealthy metabolic status are associated with de- creased NK cell activity. These results suggest that the immune system may be altered in relation to physical activity and met - abolic health.
