The company was established in 1849 in New York by two German entrepreneurs, [Charles Pfizer](/wiki/Charles_Pfizer) (1824-1906) and his cousin [Charles F.

[[1]](#cite_note-10K-1) In 2022, 42% of the company's revenues came from the United States, 8% came from Japan, and 50% came from other countries. [[1]](#cite_note-10K-1) Pfizer was a component of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) [stock market index](/wiki/Stock_market_index) from 2004 to August 2020.

Erhart](/wiki/Charles_F._Erhart), [[9]](#cite_note-9) two cousins who had immigrated to the United States from [Ludwigsburg, Germany](/wiki/Ludwigsburg), the year before. The business produced chemical compounds, and was headquartered on Bartlett Street [[10]](#cite_note-Citycyclopedia-10) in [Williamsburgh, New York](/wiki/Williamsburg,_Brooklyn) where they produced an [antiparasitic](/wiki/Antiparasitic) called [santonin](/wiki/Santonin). This was an immediate success, although it was production of [citric acid](/wiki/Citric_acid) that led to Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property in the area (by now the Williamsburg district of the city of [Brooklyn, New York](/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York) and beginning in 1898, the [City of Greater New York](/wiki/City_of_Greater_New_York)) to expand its lab and factory, retaining offices on Flushing Avenue until the 1960s; the Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009. [[11]](#cite_note-11) Following their success with citric acid, Pfizer (at the now-demolished 295 Washington Avenue) and Erhart (at 280 Washington Avenue) established their main residences in the nearby [Clinton Hill](/wiki/Clinton_Hill,_Brooklyn) district, known for its concentration of [Gilded Age](/wiki/Gilded_Age) wealth. Pfizer spent summers in similarly exclusive [Newport, Rhode Island](/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island) where he died in 1906.[ [citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)] In 1881, Pfizer moved its administrative headquarters to 81 Maiden Lane in [Manhattan](/wiki/Manhattan), presaging the company's expansion to [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois) a year later. [[12]](#cite_note-collection-12) By 1906 sales exceeded $3 million. [[13]](#cite_note-history-13) [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I) caused a shortage of [calcium citrate](/wiki/Calcium_citrate), which Pfizer imported from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a [fungus](/wiki/Fungus) that ferments sugar to citric acid, and they were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919. The company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the [deep-submergence mass production](/wiki/History_of_penicillin#Deep_submergence_for_industrial_production) of [penicillin](/wiki/Penicillin), an [antibiotic](/wiki/Antibiotic), during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II) in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers. [[14]](#cite_note-Fermentation-14) The company also embarked on a global [soil](/wiki/Soil) collection program related to improving production yields of penicillin which ultimately resulted in 135,000 samples. [[15]](#cite_note-15) On June 2, 1942, the company incorporated in [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware). [[1]](#cite_note-10K-1) 1950-1980: Pivot to pharmaceutical research and global expansion[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Due to price declines for [penicillin](/wiki/Penicillin), Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer discovered [oxytetracycline](/wiki/Oxytetracycline) in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of [fine chemicals](/wiki/Fine_chemical) to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a [drug discovery](/wiki/Drug_discovery) program focused on in vitro synthesis to augment its research in fermentation technology. In 1959, the company established an [animal health](/wiki/Animal_health) division with a 700-acre (2.8 km2) farm and research facility in [Terre Haute, Indiana](/wiki/Terre_Haute,_Indiana). [[14]](#cite_note-Fermentation-14) By the 1950s, Pfizer In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City) to a new facility in [Groton, Connecticut](/wiki/Groton,_Connecticut). In 1980, Pfizer launched Feldene ( [piroxicam](/wiki/Piroxicam)), a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach $1 billion in revenue. [[13]](#cite_note-history-13) In 1965, John Powers, Jr. became [chief executive officer](/wiki/Chief_executive_officer) of the company, succeeding John McKeen. [[13]](#cite_note-history-13) As the area surrounding its [Brooklyn](/wiki/Brooklyn) plant fell into decline in the 1970s and 1980s, the company formed a public-private partnership with New York City that encompassed the construction of low- and middle-income housing, the refurbishment of apartment buildings for the homeless and the establishment of a [charter school](/wiki/Charter_school).

[[17]](#cite_note-best-17) [[18]](#cite_note-18) In 1989, Pfizer scientists Peter Dunn and Albert Wood created Viagra ( [sildenafil](/wiki/Sildenafil)) for treating [high blood pressure](/wiki/High_blood_pressure) and [angina](/wiki/Angina), a chest pain associated with [coronary artery disease](/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease). In 1991, it was patented in the United Kingdom as a heart medication. Early trials for the medication showed that it did not work for the treatment of heart disease, but volunteers in the clinical trials had increased [erections](/wiki/Erection) several days after taking the drug. It was patented in the United States in 1996 and received approval by the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) in March 1998. In December 1998, Pfizer hired [Bob Dole](/wiki/Bob_Dole) as a spokesperson for the drug. [[19]](#cite_note-19) The patents for Viagra expired in 2020. [[20]](#cite_note-20) In 1991, [William C. Steere, Jr.](/wiki/William_C._Steere,_Jr.) became [chief executive of the company, succeeding [Edmund T.

Sertraline is primarily prescribed for [major depressive disorder](/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) in adult as [panic disorder](/wiki/Panic_disorder), and [social anxiety disorder](/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder) in both adults and children. In 2005, the year before it became a generic drug, sales were over $3 billion and over 100 million people had been treated with the drug. [[22]](#cite_note-22) The patent for Zoloft expired in the summer of 2006. [[23]](#cite_note-23) In 1996, [Eisai](/wiki/Eisai_(company)), in partnership with Pfizer, received [approval](/wiki/Approved_drug) from the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) for [donepezil](/wiki/Donepezil) under the brand Aricept for treatment of [Alzheimer's disease](/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease); [[24]](#cite_note-24) Pfizer also received approval for Norvasc ( [amlodipine](/wiki/Amlodipine)), an [antihypertensive](/wiki/Antihypertensive) drug of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker class. [[25]](#cite_note-25) In 1997, the company entered into a co-marketing agreement with [Warner-Lambert](/wiki/Warner%E2%80%93Lambert) for Lipitor ( [atorvastatin](/wiki/Atorvastatin)), a [statin](/wiki/Statin) for the treatment of [hypercholesterolemia](/wiki/Hypercholesterolemia). Although atorvastatin was the fifth [statin](/wiki/Statin) to be developed, clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a more dramatic reduction in [low-density lipoprotein](/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein) pattern C (LDL-C) than the other statin drugs. Upon its patent expiration in 2011, Lipitor was the best-selling drug ever, with approximately $125 billion in sales over 14.5 years.

[[32]](#cite_note-32) In July 2006, [Jeff Kindler](/wiki/Jeff_Kindler) was named [chief of the company, replacing [Henry McKinnell](/wiki/Henry_McKinnell). [[27]](#cite_note-longshot-27) [[33]](#cite_note-33) On December 3, 2006, Pfizer ceased development of [torcetrapib](/wiki/Torcetrapib), a drug that increases production of [HDL](/wiki/High_density_lipoprotein), which reduces [LDL](/wiki/Low_density_lipoprotein) thought to be correlated to heart disease. During a [Phase III clinical trial](/wiki/Phase_III_clinical_trial) involving 15,000 patients, more deaths than expected occurred in the group that took the medicine, and the [mortality rate](/wiki/Mortality_rate) of patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor (82 deaths during the study) was 60% higher than those taking Lipitor alone (52 deaths during the study). Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1 billion developing the failed drug and its stock price dropped 11% on the day of the announcement. [[34]](#cite_note-34) [[35]](#cite_note-35) [[36]](#cite_note-36) [[37]](#cite_note-37) Between 2007 and 2010, Pfizer spent $3.3 million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1 million, and had another $5 million of pending recoveries from civil lawsuits against makers of [counterfeit](/wiki/Counterfeit) prescription drugs. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts worldwide to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for [trademark infringement](/wiki/Trademark_infringement). [[38]](#cite_note-38) In July 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at its manufacturing facility in [Kalamazoo, Michigan](/wiki/Kalamazoo,_Michigan).

[[144]](#cite_note-144) Pfizer joined the partnership as an industry \"leadership organization\", and participated as a collaborator in ACTIV-led [COVAX AMC](/wiki/COVAX_AMC) 2021 Investment Opportunity Launch Event, otherwise named One World Protected, on April 15, 2021. [[147]](#cite_note-147) In Canada, Pfizer endorsed the use of a [vaccine passport](/wiki/Vaccine_passports_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic) [mobile app](/wiki/Mobile_app) developed by CANImmunize in order to record and track status of COVID-19 vaccination. [[148]](#cite_note-:3-148) COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine development[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=11)] Initial development and testing[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] As the scale of the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) became apparent, Pfizer partnered with BioNTech to study and develop [COVID-19](/wiki/COVID-19) mRNA vaccine candidates. Unlike many of its competitors, Pfizer took no initial research funds from the United States' [Operation Warp Speed](/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed) vaccine development program, instead choosing to invest roughly $2 billion of its own funds. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said that he declined money from Operation Warp Speed to avoid government intervention, stating later that \"when you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way.\" [[149]](#cite_note-149) In May 2020, Pfizer began testing four different [COVID-19 vaccine](/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine) variations using [lipid nanoparticle](/wiki/Lipid_nanoparticle) technology provided by Canadian biotechnology company [Acuitas Therapeutics](/wiki/Acuitas_Therapeutics). [[150]](#cite_note-:22-150) Vaccines were injected into the first human participants in the U.S. in early May. In July 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that two of the partners' four [mRNA](/wiki/Messenger_RNA) vaccine candidates had won fast track designation from the [FDA](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration). [[151]](#cite_note-151) The company began Phase II-III testing on 30,000 people in the last week of July 2020 and was slated to be paid $1.95 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine by the US government. [[152]](#cite_note-152) In September 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had completed talks with the European Commission to provide an initial 200 million vaccine doses to the EU, with the option to supply another 100 million doses at a later date. [[153]](#cite_note-153) [ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, tested on 43,500 people, was found to be 90% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. [[154]](#cite_note-154) The efficacy was updated to 95% a week later. [[155]](#cite_note-:1-155) Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist interviewed by the New York Times, described the efficacy figure as \"really a spectacular number.\" [[156]](#cite_note-156) The announcement made Pfizer and BioNTech the first companies to develop and test a working vaccine for COVID-19. [[155]](#cite_note-:1-155) Over the following month and a half, regulators in various countries approved Pfizer's vaccine for emergency use. The United Kingdom approved the vaccine first, on December 2, [[157]](#cite_note-157) followed by [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain) on December 4, [[158]](#cite_note-Bahrain_Approves_Covid-19_Vaccine_(Al_Jazeera)-158) Canada on December 9, [[159]](#cite_note-Canada_Approves_Covid-19_Vaccine_(NYT)-159) and Saudi Arabia on December 10. [[160]](#cite_note-Saudi_Arabia_Approves_Covid-19_Vaccine,_Bahrain_To_Distribute_Free_to_Public_(KTLA)-160) On December 10, 2020, the United States FDA held an advisory committee meeting to discuss authorization of the vaccine. [[161]](#cite_note-US_FDA_Advisory_Panel_Backs_Covid-19_Vaccine_Approval_(Reuters)-161) The next day, the US officially became the 5th country to approve use of Pfizer's vaccine under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), with an independent panel voting 17-4 in support of approval. [[161]](#cite_note-US_FDA_Advisory_Panel_Backs_Covid-19_Vaccine_Approval_(Reuters)-161) [[162]](#cite_note-162) On December 14, Singapore became one of the first in Asia to approve the vaccine through the [Health Sciences Authority](/wiki/Health_Sciences_Authority). [[163]](#cite_note-163) On December 21, the [European Medicines Agency](/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency) (EMA) recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for the vaccine in the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union), under the brand name \"Comirnaty.\" [[164]](#cite_note-164) Manufacturing and distribution[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] As of early May 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech had manufactured at least 430 million vaccine doses, which have been distributed to 91 countries and territories. The companies have said they expect to manufacture nearly 3 billion total vaccine doses in 2021. [[165]](#cite_note-165) Pfizer provided 0.9% [Sodium chloride](/wiki/Sodium_chloride_solution) use with the [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine](/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine) under the name of its subsidiary, [Hospira](/wiki/Hospira). [[166]](#cite_note-166) Pfizer also purchased large quantities of single-use medical and [surgical gloves](/wiki/Surgical_gloves) and protective bodysuits from [Ansell](/wiki/Ansell) during the process, contributing to a doubling of the supplier's manufacturing capacity. [[167]](#cite_note-167) Controversy[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] In February 2021, after a year long investigation relying on unnamed officials, Pfizer was accused by [The Bureau of Investigative Journalism](/wiki/The_Bureau_of_Investigative_Journalism) (TBIJ) of employing \"high-level bullying\" against at least two [Latin American](/wiki/Latin_America) countries during negotiations to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, including requesting that the countries put sovereign assets as [collateral](/wiki/Collateral_(finance)) for payments. [[168]](#cite_note-bullied-168) According to TBIJ, these negotiation tactics resulted in a months long delay in Pfizer reaching a vaccine agreement with one country and a complete failure to reach agreements with two other countries, including [Argentina](/wiki/Argentina) and Brazil. [[168]](#cite_note-bullied-168) On 2 November 2021, TBMJ published an article after obtaining information from a [whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower) from the Ventavia Research Group. Ventavia was hired by Pfizer as a research subcontractor. A regional director (whistleblower) who was employed at Ventavia Research Group has told The BMJ that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in [Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial](/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine#Clinical_trials). The regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. [[169]](#cite_note-169) The [European Medicines Agency](/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency) (EMA) stated in a response to the [European Parliament](/wiki/European_Parliament), that \"the deficiencies identified do not jeopardize the quality and integrity of the data from the main Comirnaty trial and have no impact on the benefit-risk assessment or on the conclusions on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine\". [[170]](#cite_note-170) [Science-Based Medicine](/wiki/Science-Based_Medicine) emphasized that Ventavia oversaw just three of the 153 clinical sites involved with Pfizer's trial and \"a small fraction (~1,000 by the time the whistleblower was fired) of the trial's over ~44,000 subjects.\" [[171]](#cite_note-171) On 10 October 2022, during a session of the [European Parliament](/wiki/European_Parliament)'s Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pfizer executive Janine Small testified that the company had not evaluated their [COVID-19 vaccine](/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine) for its ability to reduce transmission of the [SARS-CoV-2](/wiki/SARS-CoV-2) virus prior to its release to the general public. [[172]](#cite_note-172) [[173]](#cite_note-173) Dutch MEP [Rob Roos](/wiki/Rob_Roos) described the admission as \"scandalous\". [[174]](#cite_note-174) CEO [Albert Bourla](/wiki/Albert_Bourla) was slated to attend, but withdrew. [[175]](#cite_note-175) Roos' statements in turn have been described as \"misleading\". [[176]](#cite_note-176) [ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)] In November 2021, Pfizer launched a new COVID-19 oral antivirus treatment known as [Paxlovid](/wiki/Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir). In January 2022, the Pfizer CEO [Albert Bourla](/wiki/Albert_Bourla) confirmed that the trial results of a fourth dose were pending until March 2022. He said that the firm was setting up a collaboration to develop an anti-COVID pill treatment along with a French company, [Novasep](/wiki/Novasep). He also said the COVID vaccine was \"safe and efficient\" for children. [[177]](#cite_note-177) [[178]](#cite_note-178) In May 2022, reports emerged of patients experiencing \"rebound\" symptoms after completing a five-day course of Paxlovid. [[179]](#cite_note-179) The FDA responded by announcing they had performed additional analyses of the drug's clinical trial data, and decided against changing its recommendations. [[180]](#cite_note-180) U.S. President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden) and Dr. [Anthony Fauci](/wiki/Anthony_Fauci) were both reported to experience this rebound syndrome in the months that followed, while continuing to recommend the drug for those who may benefit from it. [[181]](#cite_note-181) Legal issues[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)] Aggressive pharmaceutical marketing[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] [pharmaceutical 1993, the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) approved [gabapentin](/wiki/Gabapentin) only for treatment of [seizures](/wiki/Seizures). [Warner-Lambert](/wiki/Warner%E2%80%93Lambert), which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used [continuing medical education](/wiki/Continuing_medical_education) and [medical research](/wiki/Medical_research), sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within five years, the drug was being widely used for [off-label uses](/wiki/Off-label_use) such as treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner-Lambert admitted to violating FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses. [[185]](#cite_note-185) In 2004, the company paid $430 million in one of the largest settlements to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. It was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under the [False Claims Act](/wiki/False_Claims_Act). [[186]](#cite_note-186) A Cochrane review concluded migraine prophylaxis. [[187]](#cite_note-187) The [American Academy of Neurology](/wiki/American_Academy_of_Neurology) rates it as having unproven efficacy, while the [Canadian Headache Society](/wiki/Canadian_Headache_Society) and the [European Federation of Neurological Societies](/wiki/European_Federation_of_Neurological_Societies) rate its use as being supported by moderate and low-quality evidence. [[188]](#cite_note-188) Illegal marketing of Bextra[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)] In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of [arthritis](/wiki/Arthritis) drug [valdecoxib](/wiki/Valdecoxib) (Bextra) and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement, the largest [health care fraud](/wiki/Health_care_fraud) settlement at that time. [[189]](#cite_note-189) Pfizer promoted the sale of the drug for several uses and dosages that the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) specifically declined to approve due to safety concerns. The drug was pulled from the market in 2005. [[190]](#cite_note-190) It was Pfizer's fourth such settlement in a decade. [[191]](#cite_note-Settle-191) [[192]](#cite_note-Improper-192) [[193]](#cite_note-fine-193) The payment included $1.195 billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the [Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act](/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act), and $1.0 billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the [Food and Drug Administration](/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA) leading to violations under the [False Claims Act](/wiki/False_Claims_Act) as reimbursements were requested from Federal and State programs. The criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the United States to date. [[191]](#cite_note-Settle-191) [[192]](#cite_note-Improper-192) [[193]](#cite_note-fine-193) Pfizer entered a [corporate integrity agreement](/wiki/Corporate_integrity_agreement) with the [Office of Inspector General](/wiki/Office_of_Inspector_General_(United_States)) that required it to make substantial structural reforms within the company, and publish to its website its post approval commitments and a searchable database of all payments to physicians made by the company. [[194]](#cite_note-194) Termination of Peter Rost[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=21)] [Peter Rost](/wiki/Peter_Rost_(doctor)) was vice president in charge of the [endocrinology](/wiki/Endocrinology) division at [Pharmacia](/wiki/Pharmacia) before its acquisition by Pfizer. During that time he raised concerns internally about [kickbacks](/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)) and off-label marketing of Genotropin, Pharmacia's [human growth hormone](/wiki/Human_growth_hormone) drug. Pfizer reported the Pharmacia marketing practices to the FDA and Department of Justice; Rost was unaware of this and filed an FCA lawsuit against Pfizer. Pfizer kept him employed, but isolated him until the FCA suit was unsealed in 2005. The Justice Department declined to intervene, and Pfizer fired him, and he filed a wrongful termination suit against Pfizer. Pfizer won a summary dismissal of the case, with the court ruling that the evidence showed Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to learning of his whistleblower activities. [[195]](#cite_note-195) [[196]](#cite_note-196) Illegal marketing of Rapamune[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=22)] A \"whistleblower suit\" was filed in 2005 against [Wyeth](/wiki/Wyeth), which was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, alleging that the company illegally marketed [sirolimus](/wiki/Sirolimus) (Rapamune) for [off-label uses](/wiki/Off-label_use), targeted specific doctors and medical facilities to increase sales of Rapamune, tried to get transplant patients to change from their transplant drugs to Rapamune, and specifically targeted [African-Americans](/wiki/African-Americans). According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals that prescribed the drug with kickbacks such as grants, donations, and other money. [[197]](#cite_note-197) In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to criminal mis-branding violations under the [Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act](/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act). By August 2014, it had paid $491 million in civil and criminal penalties related to Rapamune. [[198]](#cite_note-198) Illegal marketing[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=23)] In June 2010, health insurance network [Blue Cross Blue Shield](/wiki/Blue_Cross_Blue_Shield) (BCBS) filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for allegedly illegally marketing drugs Bextra, Geodon and Lyrica. BCBS alleged that Pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs. [[199]](#cite_note-199) [[200]](#cite_note-200) According to the lawsuit, Pfizer handed out 'misleading' materials on [off-label uses](/wiki/Off-label_use), sent over 5,000 doctors on trips to the [Caribbean](/wiki/Caribbean) or around the United States, and paid them $2,000 honoraria in return for listening to lectures about Bextra. [[201]](#cite_note-201) [[202]](#cite_note-202) Despite Pfizer's claims that \"the company's intent was pure\" in fostering a legal exchange of information among doctors, an internal marketing plan revealed that Pfizer intended to train physicians \"to serve as public relations spokespeople.\" [[203]](#cite_note-toobig-203) The case was settled in 2014 for $325 million. [[204]](#cite_note-204) Fearing that Pfizer is \" [too big to fail](/wiki/Too_big_to_fail)\" and that prosecuting the company would result in disruptions to [Medicare](/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)) and [Medicaid](/wiki/Medicaid), federal prosecutors instead charged a subsidiary of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Pfizer, which is \"nothing more than a shell company whose only function is to plead guilty.\" [[203]](#cite_note-toobig-203) Quigley Company asbestos[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=24)] The Quigley Company, which sold [asbestos](/wiki/Asbestos)-containing insulation products until the early 1970s, was acquired by Pfizer in 1968. In June 2013, asbestos victims and Pfizer negotiated a settlement that required Pfizer to pay a total of $964 million: $430 million to 80% of existing plaintiffs and place an additional $535 million into a settlement trust that will compensate future plaintiffs as well as the remaining 20% of plaintiffs with claims against Pfizer and Quigley. Of that $535 million, $405 million is in a 40-year note from Pfizer, while $100 million is from insurance policies. [[205]](#cite_note-205) Shiley defective heart valves[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=25)] Pfizer purchased Shiley in 1979, at the onset of its Convexo-Concave valve ordeal, involving the [Bjork-Shiley valve](/wiki/Bjork%E2%80%93Shiley_valve). Approximately 500 people died when defective [heart valves](/wiki/Heart_valve) fractured and, in 1994, Pfizer agreed to pay $10.75 million to settle claims by the [United States Department of Justice](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice) that the company lied to get approval for the valves. [[206]](#cite_note-206) Firing of employee that filed suit[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=26)] A federal lawsuit was filed by a scientist claiming she got an infection by a genetically modified [lentivirus](/wiki/Lentivirus) while working for Pfizer, resulting in intermittent [paralysis](/wiki/Paralysis). [[207]](#cite_note-207) A judge dismissed the case citing a lack of evidence that the illness was caused by the virus but the jury ruled that by firing the employee, Pfizer violated laws protecting [freedom of speech](/wiki/Freedom_of_speech) and [whistleblowers](/wiki/Whistleblower) and property[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=27)] [Brigham Young University](/wiki/Brigham_Young_University) said a professor of chemistry, Dr. [Daniel L. Simmons](/wiki/Daniel_L._Simmons), discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that led towards development of [Celebrex](/wiki/Celebrex). BYU was originally seeking a 15% royalty on sales, equating to $9.7 billion. A research agreement had been made between BYU and [Monsanto](/wiki/Monsanto), whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better [aspirin](/wiki/Aspirin). The enzyme Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems and Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A six-year battle ensued because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give Dr. Simmons credit or compensation, while Pfizer claimed that it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. In May 2012, Pfizer settled the allegations, agreeing to pay $450 million. [[209]](#cite_note-209) Nigeria Trovafloxacin lawsuit[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=28)] In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives and personnel from a contract research organization (CRO) traveled to [Kano](/wiki/Kano_(city)) to set up a clinical trial and administer an experimental [antibiotic](/wiki/Antibiotic), [trovafloxacin](/wiki/Trovafloxacin), to approximately 200 children. [[210]](#cite_note-210) Local Kano officials reported that more than fifty children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities. [[211]](#cite_note-211) The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes were similar to those historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. [[212]](#cite_note-212) In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment. [[213]](#cite_note-213) According to [Democracy Now!](/wiki/Democracy_Now!), \"[r]esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms, and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug.\" [[214]](#cite_note-DN-214) The lawsuits also accused Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. Nigerian medical personnel as well as at least one Pfizer physician said the trial was conducted without regulatory approval. [[215]](#cite_note-215) [[216]](#cite_note-216) In 2007, Pfizer published a Statement of Defense letter, stating that the drug's oral form was safer and easier to administer. Trovan had been used safely in more than five thousand Americans prior to the Nigerian trial, and mortality in the patients treated by Pfizer was lower than that observed historically in African meningitis epidemics. No unusual side effects, unrelated to meningitis, were observed after four weeks. [[217]](#cite_note-217) In June 2010, the US Supreme Court rejected Pfizer's appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits by the Nigerian families to proceed. [[218]](#cite_note-218) In December 2010, a [United States diplomatic cables leak](/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) was released by [WikiLeaks](/wiki/WikiLeaks) indicating that Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigerian attorney general [Michael Aondoakaa](/wiki/Michael_Aondoakaa) to persuade him to drop legal action. [[219]](#cite_note-219) [The Washington Post](/wiki/The_Washington_Post) reporter Joe Stephens, who helped break the story in 2000, called these actions \"dangerously close to blackmail\". [[214]](#cite_note-DN-214) In response, the company released a press statement describing the allegations as \"preposterous\" and saying that it acted in good faith. [[220]](#cite_note-220) Aondoakka, who had allegedly demanded bribes from Pfizer in return for a settlement of the case, [[221]](#cite_note-221) was declared unfit for office and had his U.S. visa revoked in association with corruption charges in 2010. [[222]](#cite_note-222) [[223]](#cite_note-223) The lawsuits were eventually settled out of court. Pfizer committed to paying US$35 million \"to compensate the families of children in the study\", another US$30 million to \"support healthcare initiatives in Kano\", and 10 million to cover legal costs. Payouts began in 2011. [[224]](#cite_note-224) Inflating Prices[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Pfizer&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] In July 2022, UK antitrust authorities fined Pfizer \u00a363 million for unfairly high priced drug that aids in controlling epileptic seizures. The Competition and Markets Authority stated that the company took advantage of loopholes by de-branding epilepsy drug Epanutin, by doing so the price of Epanutin's price was not regulated to the same standards the company are used to and therefore the price of the drug was raised.
