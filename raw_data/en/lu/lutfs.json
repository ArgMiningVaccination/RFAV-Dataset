Estimates [vaccination]program using an [inactivated vaccine](CoronaVac) on preventing symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and [hospitalizations]from August to November 2021 in the [Dominican Republic]. Participants were recruited from 10 [hospitals]in 5 provinces to estimate the [effectiveness]of full [immunization](14 days after receipt of the second [dose]) and partial [immunization](otherwise with at least 1 [dose]14 days after receipt of first [dose]).

Full [vaccination]was odds (OR, 0.51; CI, 0.30-0.86).

Conclusions:Given the ancestral and [delta]viral variants circulating during this study period, our results suggest that the inactivated [COVID-19 vaccine]offered moderate [protection]against COVID-19-related [hospitalizations]and assisted [ventilation]. This is reassuring given that, as of August 2022, an estimated 2.6 billion inactivated CoronaVac [vaccine]doses had been administered worldwide.
