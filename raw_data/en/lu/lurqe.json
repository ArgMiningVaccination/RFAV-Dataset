What is pet massage? Massage is the manipulation of body soft tissues to restore or maintain health.

There are more than 70 human massage techniques, many of which also can be used on animal patients. The most common types of pet massage include: - Swedish massage \u2014 Swedish massage, the most commonly used form, employs various techniques to relax or invigorate muscles. - Shiatsu \u2014 This form of Japanese massage involves applying finger pressure at specific points on the body to increase circulation and stimulate nerves. - Myotherapy \u2014 Also known as trigger-point massage, myotherapy involves applying direct pressure over tight and painful trigger points to push blood out of the tissue. Pressure is then released to allow blood to refill the tissue, relieving tension and pain. - Sports massage \u2014 Massage can help animals participating in sporting events maintain optimal performance and facilitate healing of injured tissues. Event massage can be used before, during, or after competition, while maintenance massage prevents injury and speeds healing between events. How can massage help my pet?
