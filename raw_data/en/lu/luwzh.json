Providers are required to notify the NDIS Commission: - if a support worker or NDIS participant is confirmed to have COVID-19 - if there are changes to the scale of their operations - any other changes related to COVID-19. Providers can do this by completing their [Notification of event - COVID-19 (registered provider)](https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/resources/covid-19-resources-and-information/notification-event-form-covid-19-registered-providers) form on the NDIS Commission's website or phoning 1800 035 544.

Disability worker COVID-19 leave grant The Disability worker leave grant will help disability workers who are unwell with COVID-19 and unable to provide supports to participants. Eligible disability workers with no leave entitlements will receive flat rates of: - $450 for workers who have lost at least 8 to 20 hours of work. - $750 for workers who have lost more than 20 hours of work. The grant is available from 1 April to 31 December 2023.

For more information, visit [our guidelines on meal preparation.](https://ourguidelines.ndis.gov.au/supports-you-can-access-menu/nutrition-supports-including-meal-preparation) NDIS participants who usually have a support worker help them with meal preparation at home or help with grocery shopping, can use these funds to pay for meal preparation and delivery support for a limited time. The cost of food is not covered by the NDIS.
