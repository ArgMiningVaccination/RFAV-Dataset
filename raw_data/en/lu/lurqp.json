Visitors Check with the main switchboard or front desk for visitation times. Two support people can be present to help you throughout your stay. Siblings of the baby, any age, may visit, but for safety reasons may not stay overnight. Children who are 12 years old or older may visit and must be accompanied by another adult at all times. All guests must be healthy with no evidence of a cold or recent exposure to communicable diseases. All guests should wash their hands thoroughly before holding your baby. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Our Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is for babies who need a higher level of care due to a premature birth or a medical complication that requires close observation and treatment. Our littlest patients have access to state-of-the-art equipment in a unit that is staffed around the clock by neonatologists, neonatal nurse practitioners and specially trained neonatal nurses. These providers have extensive experience in caring for the premature, high-risk or sick newborn. A low nurse-to-patient ratio means each infant receives superb, individualized care. Our team has a direct link to all resources and specialists that the Penn State Health network has to offer. The NICU staff understands how therapeutic skin-to-skin care can be for the healing of both baby and parents, so this will become part of each parent visit as soon as it is possible. Our goal is always to engage parents in the care of their baby - including ongoing education and support as they prepare for taking baby home. Our NICU nurses are also skilled in supporting breastfeeding mothers, and lactation services are available on a daily basis. If needed, pasteurized donor human milk is available. Meet our Neonatology Team AngelEye Camera System When a baby requires care in the NICU and parents are unable to be present, Hampden Medical Center offers the AngelEye Health Camera System. The AngelEye system is a secure, HIPAA-compliant, internet-based video solution. A camera is placed at the baby's bedside in the NICU, and a live feed is available for family and loved ones to view on a laptop, tablet or smartphone. Parents will receive their child's camera login information from the NICU staff, which they can share with family and friends, if they desire. Parents serve as the account manager and also manage their family and friends' accounts. This program was designed to facilitate bonding and peace of mind even when parents, family and friends are unable to be present in the NICU. Some of our babies remain in the hospital for weeks. With the use of AngelEye, parents can stay connected and be reassured that their baby is being well cared for in their absence. NICU staff also use the cameras for virtual rounding, which means families and staff can communicate when they cannot be present during the routine care of their baby. Support after Delivery Family-centered Care Our team of postpartum nurses are trained to support you during labor and after delivery, so you will continue to see the same familiar faces. Most families will be with us for 48 hours after delivery. The nursing staff will make sure you know all about baby care before discharge, such as bathing, diaper changing and soothing. Your baby's doctor will examine your baby after birth and once each day, unless your baby has special needs. Security is a priority. Mom, baby and partner will have bracelets with matching numbers. When baby is brought back to your room from any procedure and at the time of discharge, bands are checked. Baby will wear a \"Hugs\" transmitter, a \"baby GPS\" that monitors baby's location in the hospital. The transmitter is removed at discharge. Staff will assist you with required paperwork for your baby's Social Security card and birth certificate and will submit completed paperwork to the state. After you leave the hospital, your baby's medical records will be transferred to the pediatrician of your choice in advance of baby's first appointment. Breastfeeding support and lactation services Our lactation consultants are certified by the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners and provide a full range of lactation services to assist with normal newborn, as well as more complex feeding issues. All mothers deserve hands-on support and education to be able to meet their feeding goals. We start all families off with the information and skills they need to breastfeed successfully at home. If you plan to breastfeed and your infant requires medical supplementation, donor breast milk is available to all babies. If you have questions, you can call our Breastfeeding Warm Line at [717-981-8237](tel:7179818237). Leave a voicemail for the Hampden Medical Center lactation team to receive breastfeeding support over the phone or to schedule an outpatient visit.
