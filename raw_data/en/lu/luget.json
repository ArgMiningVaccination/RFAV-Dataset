Here, we investigated the effects of MPL, CpG, and combination adjuvants on stimulating in vitro dendritic cells (DCs), in vivo innate and adaptive immune responses, and protective efficacy of influenza vaccination. Combination of MPL and CpG was found to exhibit distinct effects on stimulating DCs in vitro to secrete IL-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and proliferate allogeneic CD8 T cells. Prime immunization of mice with inactivated split influenza vaccine in the presence of low dose MPL+CpG adjuvants increased the induction of antibodies. MPL and CpG adjuvants contribute to improving the efficacy of prime influenza vaccination against lethal influenza challenge as determined by body weight monitoring, lung function, viral titers, and histology. A combination of MPL and CpG adjuvants was effective in improving vaccine efficacy as well as in reducing inflammatory immune responses locally and in inducing cellular immune responses upon lethal influenza virus challenge. This study demonstrates unique adjuvant effects of MPL, CpG, and combination adjuvants on modulating innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza prime vaccination. Keywords: Monophosphoryl lipid A; Oligonucleotide CpG; Adjuvant; Influenza vaccine INTRODUCTION Effective vaccination is the most economical measure to prevent infectious disease such as smallpox. Influenza virus causes acute respiratory disease and is responsible for approximately 250,000 deaths worldwide annually ( 1). Non-replicating subunit vaccines are in general safe but typically require adjuvants to enhance vaccine efficacy. For protection against seasonal influenza infection, an annual vaccination is highly recommended by World Health Organization. Inactivated split influenza vaccine (Flu-shot) is the most common platform used for vaccination but its immunogenicity and efficacy need to Accepted: Oct 10, 2017 *Correspondence to Sang-Moo Kang Center for Inflammation, Immunity & Infection, Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, 33 Gilmer Street, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA.

This recognition is mediated by pathogen recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). Events of interactions between TLRs and their ligands result in the activation of transcription factors (NF- B, AP-1, IRF 3/7) which drive the production of proinflammatory cytokines and infiltration of innate immune cells ( 4). The innate immune response of TLR signaling plays a critical role in dictating the quality and magnitude of the adaptive immune responses ( 5,6). The presence of specific TLR agonists or their combinations in vaccine formulations directs the magnitude and type of immune responses ( 7). The live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine, being used for 80 years, was shown to contain TLR2, TLR7/8, and TLR9 activating signals ( 8). Mycobacterium bovis vaccine for appears ligands for TLR2 and TLR4 ( 9). AS04 adjuvant which is a combination of aluminum hydroxide and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) has been licensed to be a part of the hepatitis B vaccine (Fendrix\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) ( 10) and human papilloma virus vaccine (Cervarix\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline) ( 11). These studies provide rationale for developing vaccines with adjuvants engaging in multiple signaling pathways. MPL is an attenuated version of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a natural endotoxin and a TLR4 ligand. LPS has been extensively studied in animal models to better understand how vaccine adjuvant works ( 12). Unmethylated oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs have been utilized as a potent adjuvant biasing T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses (13,14). The inclusion of CpG in conventional oil in water emulsion adjuvants was shown to change the Th2 bias toward balanced or Th1-type response ( 15). CpG has been tested as an immunotherapeutic adjuvant in humans ( 16). Most previous studies used relatively high doses (5 to 100 \u00b5g) of CpG or MPL adjuvant, which might cause safety concerns because of undesirable side effects. We hypothesized that low doses of MPL, CpG, or combination of MPL+CpG adjuvants would be effective in stimulating dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro , and improving immunogenicity and efficacy of inactivated split influenza virus vaccine in vivo . In this study, we tested this hypothesis and presented distinct effects of individual TLR agonists and combination adjuvants on stimulation of DCs in vitro and on the in vivo efficacy of influenza vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and reagents Six-week old BALB/c mice were purchased from the Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Houston, TX, USA) and maintained in Georgia State University (GSU) animal facility. All mice experiments were followed by the guidelines of approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol. MPL was purchased DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). All reagents were prepared by following the manufacturer's protocol. Influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 [A/PR8]) was used to make Briefly A/PR8 virus was inactivated with 1% neutral formalin for 2 h and then concentrated by ultracentrifugation (123,760 \u00d7 g, 1 h). Inactivated virus pellet was resuspended in PBS and then treated with 1% Triton X-100 to disrupt virus particles. After dialysis, the protein concentration of the split vaccine was measured by DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and saved in 80\u00b0C. 327 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.orgIn vitro stimulation assays of DCs DCs were generated in vitro from femur bone marrow cells of BALB/c mice. The bone marrow cells were cultured in complete RPMI1640 (containing 10% FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin/ streptomycin) colony stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) supplementation to enrich DCs. Floating cells were removed and fresh complete media with GM-CSF were replaced every 2 days. After 6-10 days, the immature DCs were collected and seeded at 2.5\u00d7105 cells/ml in 6-well (2 ml/well) or 96-well plates (200 \u00b5l/well). Enriched immature DCs were cultured for 2 days in the presence of MPL, CpG, or MPL+CpG. Activation markers (CD40, CD80, and and factor [TNF]- ) were by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Allogeneic na\u00efve lymphocytes were harvested from spleen cells of C57BL/6 mice, labeled with CFSE and co-cultured with DCs that were pre-treated with the adjuvants (MPL, CpG, or MPL+CpG). The ratio of DC and lymphocytes was 1:20. After 5-day culture, the cells were harvested, stained with antibodies for surface markers and intracellular cytokines and analyzed by flow cytometry. Immunization and virus infection BALB/c mice (n=5) were immunized intramuscularly with sPR8 CpG (4 \u00b5g), or MPL+CpG (1 \u00b5g+4 \u00b5g, respectively). The immunization was one time (prime) only and sera were collected 2-wk later. At 6 wk after immunization, na\u00efve and immunized mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose (3\u00d7LD50) of A/PR8 virus. Body weight (BW) changes and enhanced pause (PenH) of respiration using whole body plethysmography were monitored for 7 days. According to the IACUC guideline, the mice displaying a range of 20% to 25% BW loss are considered to have reached the endpoint and humanely euthanized to avoid severe pain. ELISA for antibody and cytokine levels Immune sera were collected 2 weeks after immunization and antigen-specific antibody levels were determined by ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with inactivated A/PR8 virus (200 ng/well) and blocked with 1% and 0.05% tween20 in PBS. Immune sera were serially diluted and added to the ELISA plates. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was incubated and IgG2a antibodies. Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used as a substrate and OD measured at 450 nm by an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad). To measure cytokine and chemokine levels in lung extracts and cell culture USA) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), IFN gamma- chemokine kits (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used by following the manufacturer's manual. Lung virus titration The harvested lungs at day 7 post infection were minced mechanically with 1.5 ml of PBS per each lung and extracts collected after centrifugation. Embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with diluted lung extracts and virus titers determined by hemagglutination assay of the allantoic fluids collected after 3-day incubation. Virus titers as 50% egg infection dose (EID 50)/ml were evaluated according to the Reed and Muench method ( 17). 328 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.orgFlow cytometry To investigate inflammatory cell infiltration in the respiratory tract, lung samples were harvested at day 7 post infection and then single cells were stained with antibodies specific for CD45 (30-F11; BD Biosciences, Biolegend). Briefly, the harvested lung cells were washed with PBS and blocked Fc receptors on their surface by anti-CD16/32 antibodies (eBiosciences). The antibody cocktails were added to the cells and incubated for 30 min in 4\u00b0C. After washing, the stained cells were acquired by BD LSRFortessa and BD FACS Diva program (BD Biosciences). The data analysis was performed by FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR, USA). Intracellular cytokine staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung cells was performed after 6-hours stimulation with a mixture of 2 MHCI peptides (IYSTVASSL and LYEKVKSQL) or a pool protein transport inhibitor) was added to each sample during the stimulation. For intracellular cytokine staining, Fixation/ Permeabilization solution kit (BD biosciences) was used by following the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analysis All results were presented as means\u00b1standard error of mean (SEM). The statistical significance was determined by 1-way ANOVA and followed Tukey's multiple comparison test. p<0.05 was considered as significance. We analyzed all data with statistical Prism Software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). RESULTS Combination of MPL and CpG enhances DC activation and cytokine production Adjuvants can improve vaccine efficacy by stimulating innate immune responses. To better understand adjuvant effects of MPL and CpG, we investigated in vitro activation of bone marrow derived DCs ( Fig. 1 ). The immature DCs were harvested and then cultured with different dose combinations of MPL, CpG, or MPL+CpG. After 2-day culture, \u00b5g/ml) or CpG (0-4 \u00b5g/ml) alone in a range tested was not effective in stimulating DCs to secrete IL-12p70 (IL-12) showed stimulating DCs to secrete IL-12. These synergistic effects were suppressed or not observed with a high concentration (5 \u00b5g/ml) of MPL ( Fig. 1A ). Both MPL and CpG either alone or combinations effectively stimulated DCs to secrete IL-6 ( Fig. 1B ). Either MPL CpG alone stimulated DCs to secrete inflammatory cytokine TNF- at a moderate level regardless of concentrations whereas combinations showed additive effects ( Fig. 1C ). In vitro cultured DCs with MPL or CpG or combination of MPL+CpG were stained with DC activation markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD40 and CD86 activation markers on DCs were expressed at the highest level with combination of MPL+CpG ( Fig. 1D and F ). MPL more effectively stimulated the expression of CD40 and CD86 than CpG whereas levels of CD80 were similarly high in all stimulated DCs ( Fig. 1D-F ). Overall, compared to individual MPL or CpG, combination of MPL and CpG appears to be more effective in stimulating DCs particularly in IL-12 and TNF- production as well as CD40 and CD86 marker expressions. 329 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.orgDCs with combination MPL and CpG treatment are effective in activating T cells The stimulated DCs are known to activate allogeneic na\u00efve T cell activation and proliferation (19). To determine the antigen presentation and activation ability of DCs to T cells, CFSE- labeled allogeneic lymphocytes (from C57BL/6 mice) were co-cultured with DCs (from BALB/c mice) that were pre-treated with MPL, CpG or MPL+CpG. After 5-day co-culture, the cell proliferation (CFSE negative) and cytokine productions of T cells were measured by flow cytometry ( Fig. 2 ). MPL only and MPL+CpG pre-treated DC showed similarly higher levels of CD4 T cell proliferation than CpG alone treatment ( Fig. 2A ). Combination of MPL+CpG pre-treated DCs showed the highest levels of CD8 T cell proliferation, and IFN- producing CD4 and CD8 T cells meanwhile MPL or CpG single adjuvant treated DCs showed moderate effects ( Fig. 2B-D ). MPL alone or MPL+CpG combination treated DCs showed low to moderate effects on activating CD4 and CD8 T cells to secrete IL-4 but higher than those in DC controls ( Fig. 2E and F ). These results suggest that combination MPL+CpG stimulated DCs effectively proliferate T cells to secrete IFN- . Combination MPL and CpG adjuvants enhance IgG antibody responses to influenza vaccine To determine the adjuvant effects of combination MPL+CpG in vivo , we immunized BALB/c mice with only or sPR8 \u00b5g +4 \u00b5g, respectively) intramuscularly. After 3 weeks of prime vaccination, sera were collected and sPR8-specific antibody levels were measured by 330 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.orgA 400 300 200 100pg/mL *** *** CpG ****** ***** ****** *** ****** **** *** * Figure 1.

Higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were observed in the CpG and MPL+CpG combination groups compared to the MPL or sPR8 vaccine alone group ( Fig. 3D ). Both MPL and CpG adjuvants enhance protective efficacy of influenza vaccination At 6 weeks after single dose vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of A/RP8 virus to determine the vaccine efficacy. Na\u00efve mice upon infection showed most severe BW loss and highest levels of PenH values as a measure of resistance to air inhalation (na\u00efve infection, Fig. 4A and B ). The sPR8 vaccine alone group showed moderate but significant BW loss and increases in PenH. The combination MPL+CpG group was well protected against A/ PR8 challenge as evidenced by no changes in BW and in PenH, similar to na\u00efve uninfected mice ( Fig. 4A and B ). The MPL and CpG alone adjuvant groups displayed a transiently slight loss (3%- 7%) in BW but recovered back to normal weight and there were no significant differences among the adjuvanted groups. At day 7 post infection, lung samples of the infected mice were harvested to measure virus titers and lung histopathology ( Fig. 4C and D ). The na\u00efve infection group showed the highest levels of lung viral titers (10 Log 10) and severe histopathology with infiltrates. Also, the sPR8 vaccine group exhibited significant lung viral loads and thickening of airway epithelial layers 332 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Figure 3.

The adjuvanted vaccine groups showed significantly lower levels of virus titers near to the detection limit. Little thickening of airway epithelial layers was observed in the histology of the CpG group ( Fig. 4C and D ). These data support that MPL and CpG adjuvants in single dose vaccination enhance protective efficacy of sPR8 vaccine. Combination MPL and CpG adjuvanted vaccination prevents inflammatory innate immune responses due to virus infection For further details of protective efficacy, we collected lungs at day 7 post infection and measured cytokine levels in lung extract ( Fig. 5 ) and analyzed lung cell populations ( Fig. 6 ). The na\u00efve infection group showed the highest levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-) and chemokines (MCP-1, RANTES, KC, and IP-10). The sPR8 vaccine alone in the adjuvanted vaccine groups ( Fig. 5 ). The single adjuvant MPL and CpG groups displayed substantial levels of compared to the combination MPL+CpG group which is almost free of inflammation similar to na\u00efve uninfected mice ( Fig. 5 ). At 7 days after challenge, the lung cells were harvested and stained with the cell phenotype specific marker antibodies. Relatively high cell numbers were observed in the lungs from 333 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.org2 0 3 4 5 6 7 1A 90110 100 70% of Changes80 Days post infectionBody MPL and CpG adjuvant effects on improving protective efficacy of influenza vaccination after lethal virus infection.

The alveolar macrophage (AM) is the first defense cell in the airways. AM populations were significantly reduced in the na\u00efve infection group whereas the vaccinated groups showed similar or higher numbers of AM than the na\u00efve infection group ( Fig. 6B ). Higher numbers of monocytes and neutrophils were recruited by influenza virus infection in the na\u00efve infection and sPR8 only vaccinated groups than the adjuvanted groups ( Fig. 6C and D ). Especially, the MPL+CpG combination showed numbers of neutrophils, plasmacytoid DCs, CD103+ resident DCs, and the CpG group ( Fig. 6C-G ).

The na\u00efve and sPR8 vaccine groups induced CD4 and CD8 T cells secreting TNF- and IFN- in the BAL at higher levels than adjuvanted vaccination after infection ( Fig. 7D-G ). TNF- secreting lung CD4 and CD8 T cells were induced at the highest level in the CpG group among the groups ( Fig. 7H and I ). IFN- producing CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in the lungs from the CpG adjuvant and sPR8 vaccine alone groups compared to those in the na\u00efve, MPL adjuvant, and combination MPL+CpG groups after challenge ( 7J and K ). Interestingly, GzB+, TNF-, and IFN- expressing T cells were at the lowest levels in the BAL and lung samples from the combination MPL+CpG and MPL adjuvant groups ( Fig. 7 ). CpG adjuvanted vaccination enhances antigen-specific cytokine producing splenocytes To elucidate the cellular immune responses in the systemic sites of secondary lymphoid organs of the vaccinated mice, we harvested the spleen cells from the immunized mice at day 7 post infection and cultured the cells with inactivated A/PR8 virus. After 3-day culture, cytokine levels in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA ( Fig. 8 ). In contrast to the local sites of virus infected lungs, spleen cells from na\u00efve, na\u00efve mice with infection, and sPR8 vaccinated mice did not produce meaningful levels of IFN- and TNF- . Splenocytes from MPL or CpG levels of IFN- and TNF- cytokines. Notably, the MPL+CpG combination group induced significant levels of both IFN- and TNF- cytokines in spleen cell cultures after antigen-specific stimulation ( Fig. 8A and B ). DISCUSSION Most subunit vaccines require adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of vaccination. A strategy of combination adjuvants is expected to help develop safe and effective vaccines since replicating live attenuated vaccines stimulate multiple immune receptors. We found distinctive properties of MPL, CpG, and combination MPL+CpG TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants in stimulating DCs in vitro in the aspects of secreting cytokines and activating T cells. Influenza single dose vaccination of mice in the presence of combination MPL+CpG resulted in additive adjuvant effects on enhancing IgG and IgG2a isotype antibodies, 337 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects *** Figure 8.

This study provides new insight into correlating in vitro activities and in vivo efficacy of MPL+CpG adjuvant. We determined in vitro activities of MPL and CpG adjuvants in stimulating DCs at a range of low doses (0-5 \u00b5g). The levels of cytokines secreted by DCs were not proportionally correlated with the concentrations of MPL and CpG. Either TLR4 agonist MPL or TLR9 and TNF- . CpG but not stimulated produce IL-12p70. Combination MPL+CpG showed synergistic and additive effects on producing IL-12p70 and TNF- respectively during DC stimulation but a high dose (5 \u00b5g) of MPL significantly inhibited the IL-12p70 production. MPL (0.2 \u00b5g) was more effective in upregulating CD40 and CD86 activation markers on DCs and in activating CD4 T cells via DCs than CpG (1 \u00b5g). Combination of MPL+CpG showed additive effects on upregulating CD40 and CD86 markers on DCs and in activating CD4 and CD8 T cells via DCs. Consistent with the results in this study, the synergistic effects of combination TLR4 and 9 agonists on IL-1 production but not on IL-6 were demonstrated with stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy adults ( 20). Differential outcomes of in vitro DC stimulation and combination MPL+CpG effects might be due to a difference in the signaling pathway of MPL and CpG. Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN- (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) are known to be partially involved in the TLR4 ligand signaling in addition to MyD88 ( 21,22). The TLR9 CpG signaling pathway is mainly dependent on the MyD88 adaptor molecule ( 23). The safety of adjuvants is a critical issue of consideration in vaccination. Lower doses of adjuvants but still exhibiting adjuvanticity would be expected to reduce undesirable side effects. Based on in vitro DC stimulation results, we applied low doses of MPL (1 \u00b5g), CpG (4 \u00b5g), and MPL+CpG (1 \u00b5g+4 \u00b5g, respectively) to single-dose vaccination with inactivated split influenza vaccine. A wide range of CpG from 10-100 \u00b5g was used as vaccine adjuvant in mice ( 15,24,25). Also, high doses (5-100 \u00b5g) of MPL were applied to enhance the efficacy of vaccines ( 24,26-28). Thus, the dose of 1 \u00b5g MPL and 4 \u00b5g CpG is in a low range compared to those used in previous studies. In vivo adjuvant effects appeared to be dose dependent since 4 \u00b5g dose of MPL resulted in higher IgG antibodies after vaccination of C57BL/6 mice than those in 1 \u00b5g MPL, and combination MPL+CpG adjuvant effects were prominent (data not shown). We have not observed any abnormal reactions on the site of vaccination. The assessment of safety and side effects of vaccines and adjuvants is limited in preclinical animal studies, and should be carried out in the phase I clinical studies. Although MPL increased total IgG antibodies to sPR8 vaccine, IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were similar to those in the sPR8 vaccine only group whereas CpG and MPL+CpG adjuvanted groups induced higher IgG2a/ IgG1 ratios, suggesting that CpG is a main adjuvant biasing a Th1 pattern of IgG2a immune responses to inactivated split influenza vaccine in BALB/c mice. CpG in combination with conventional oil-based adjuvants was shown to enhance IgG2a isotype antibody TLR3+TLR9 agonist adjuvants was shown to enhance CD8 T cell responses to DNA vaccines ( 30). AMs are the major cell population and the first defense line in lung. In case of respiratory virus infection, the AMs fight against the pathogen, and are depleted in the lung during the infection, and return to normal levels after recovery. Upon influenza virus infection, AMs were reported to be reduced to lower levels correlating to disease and mortality ( 31). AMs were also known to 338 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.orgrelease inflammatory cytokines to control viral replication ( 32,33). In response to inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, innate inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and DCs are recruited to the sites of viral infection. Thus, the percentages of the AMs are decreased as well during the infection. Therefore, na\u00efve mice after influenza virus infection showed the lowest numbers of AMs. In contrast, the mice with adjuvanted vaccination maintained or increased the levels of AMs in lungs after influenza virus infection. Pathogenic influenza virus infection led to severe lung inflammation characterized as proinflammatory cytokine storm and cellular infiltrates ( 34,35). Na\u00efve infection or sPR8 vaccine alone immune mice exhibited high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrates of innate cells and lymphocytes into the lungs. These data indicate severe inflammatory disease due to virus infection and suggest insufficient protection by a single dose sPR8 vaccination. For effective protection, 2-time (prime and boost) influenza vaccination is recommended in na\u00efve individuals. The strong adaptive immune development (IgG antibodies) was developed even by single vaccination with MPL+CpG adjuvant, the replication of influenza virus was well controlled in the MPL+CpG adjuvanted mice so that there was no BW loss, lung inflammation and cytokine production as well as inflammatory innate cellular infiltration. This complete protection might be resulted from high levels of antigen-specific antibodies by MPL+CpG adjuvant combination. In contrast, the sPR8 vaccine only group or unvaccinated mice showed high levels of inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltration, which is because of ineffective control of influenza virus replication. Consistent with previous studies, influenza virus infection induces T cells with cytotoxic activity in granule exocytosis and the engagement of TNF family members ( 36). Effector T cells produce excess cytokines and chemokines contributing to cytotoxic activity of damaging the tissue, although the primary role of which is to eliminate infected epithelial cells ( 37,38). In the intracellular staining and flow cytometry analysis of BAL and lung cells post infection, we observed that high levels of GzB+ CD4 and CD8 T cells in BAL and lung samples were induced at high levels in na\u00efve mice with infection and in sPR8 alone immune mice. Also, relatively high levels of TNF- + and IFN- + BAL CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in sPR8 vaccine and na\u00efve infection mice. The high levels of GzB+ effector T cells in the airway are correlated with lung viral loads. Previous studies demonstrated that effector T cells with cytotoxic function are located in the airways (BAL) from na\u00efve infection or sPR8 vaccine alone mice. Both GzB+ and TNF- + CD4 and CD8 T cells can initiate apoptotic effects on target cells (37-40). The CpG adjuvanted mice induced a substantial level of GzB+ CD8 T cells and the highest levels of TNF- + and IFN- + CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs post infection. These results suggest that CpG adjuvant effectively primes cytotoxic T cells being recruited into the lungs upon infection. Excess cytotoxic T cells may also contribute to tissue damage as a low to moderate level of weight loss was observed in the CpG adjuvanted vaccine group. Inactivated respiratory syncytial virus vaccine with CpG adjuvant was reported to enhance pulmonary pathology of alveolitis and interstitial pneumonitis after virus challenge of CpG adjuvant vaccinated mice ( 25). Mice with combination MPL+CpG adjuvant was found to prevent inflammatory cytokines and innate immune cell infiltrates due to influenza virus infection in lungs, similar to na\u00efve uninfected mice. Vaccination with MPL+CpG is expected to induce strong DC activation and adaptive immune responses. The spleen is one of the secondary lymphoid tissues and most spleen cells are composed of lymphocytes. The purpose of using splenocytes was to determine the antigen- specific cellular responses in the systemic sites such as spleens (rather than mucosal sites) 339 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2017.17.5.326Adjuvant Effects of MPL+CpG on Influenza Vaccine https://immunenetwork.orgfrom the vaccinated groups. In contrast to effector T cells in lungs, we observed high levels of IFN- and TNF- secreting spleen cells in the adjuvanted vaccine groups. The humoral responses (high levels of antigen-specific antibodies) in the MPL+CpG combination group appeared to play a main role in the protection against virus infection. High levels of antibodies can bind the pathogen and protect the host by preventing virus attachment and controlling viral replication. Effective control of lung viral replication may contribute to preventing the induction of effector T cells in the BAL and lungs from the mice with MPL+CpG combination adjuvant vaccination.
