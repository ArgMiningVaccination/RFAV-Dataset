It's more than fixing what's wrong. It's about celebrating what's right and making sure you're on the path to a healthier, stronger you. A new study published in the journal Neurology suggests that consuming higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a larger hippocampal volume (learning and memory) and better abstract reasoning in healthy middle-aged adults. Most other research on omega-3 fatty acids has been conducted on those 65+ years old, so this is the first study to show that starting earlier in life could be impactful. So how can you boost your intake of omega-3 fatty acids? Here are some dietary inspirations to incorporate more omega-3 into your diet. Wild-Caught Salmon Eat wild-caught salmon one to two times per week. Depending on the season, wild-caught salmon can sometimes be difficult to find. If you cannot find this type of salmon in your local grocery store, you can order it from [VitalChoice.com](http://VitalChoice.com). Throw it on a salad for lunch or a quick snack. I like to top Simple Mills almond crackers with a piece of smoked salmon and a drip of mustard. Flaxseed and Flaxseed Oil Flaxseed and flaxseed oil are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Protein balls are a fun, flavorful way to add flaxseed to your diet. It's easy to find protein balls with flaxseed at the grocery store, or you can get creative and make your own.

Supplements For those who struggle incorporating omega-3 rich foods into meals, consider taking a supplement. My go-to brand is Nordic Naturals, but any omega-3 supplement will do.
