Our report includes a reference to other auditors who audited the following entities, as described in our report on the state of North Dakota's financial statements: Addiction Counselor Internship Loan Program Bank of North Dakota Job Service North Dakota Mandan Remediation Trust Medical Facility Infrastructure Loan Program PACE and AG PACE Funds Public Employees Retirement System Public Finance Authority Rebuilders Loan Program Retirement and Investment Office School Construction Assistance Revolving Loan Fund Small Employer Loan Fund State Fair Association State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation Student Loan Trust Workforce Safety and Insurance Beginning Farmer Revolving Loan Fund Building Authority College SAVE Community Water Facility Loan Fund Comprehensive Health Association of North Dakota Covid Pace Recovery Program Department of Trust Lands North Dakota Development Fund Guaranteed Student Loan Program Housing Finance Agency Housing Incentive Fund Infrastructure Revolving Loan Fund Innovation Technology Fund A - 2 This report does not include the results of the other auditors' testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and other matters that are reported on separately by those auditors. The financial statements of the North Dakota University System's foundations, that are reported as discretely presented component units, were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards . Inter nal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the state of North Dakota's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the state of North Dakota's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the state of North Dakota's internal control. A defic iency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. We did identify a certain deficiency in internal control described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings, Recommendations, and Responses as item 2020 -01 that we consider to be a material weakness. Responses to Findings The Office of Management and Budget's response to the finding identified in our audit is described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings, Recommendations, and Responses . This response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. Compl iance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the state of North Dak ota's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. B - 1 Report on Internal Control and Compliance Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed In Accordance with Government Auditing Standards The Honorabl e Doug Burgum, Governor of North Dakota Members of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly We have audited , in accordance with auditing standards general accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business -type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the state of North Dakota as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019 , and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the state's basic financial statements and have i ssued our report thereon dated December 11 , 2019. Our report includes a reference to other auditors who audited the following entities, as described in our report on the state of North Dakota's financial statements : Addiction Counselor Internship Loan Program Bank of North Dakota Job Service North Dakota Mandan Remediation Trust Medical Facility Infrastructure Loan Program PACE and AG PACE Funds Public Employees Retirement System Public Finance Authority Rebuilders Loan Program Retirement and Investment Office School Construction Assistance Revolving Loan Fund State Fair Association State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation Student Loan Trust Workforce Safety and Insurance Beginning Farmer Revolving Loan Fund Building Authority College SAVE Community Water Facility Loan Fund Comprehensive Health Association of North Dakota Department of Trust Lands Development Fund Guaranteed Student Loan Program Housing Finance Agency Housing Incentive Fund Infrastructure Revolving Loan Fund This report does not include the results of the other auditors' testing of internal control over financial reporting or compliance and other matters that are reported on separately by those B - 2 auditors. The financial statements of the North Dakota University System's foundations, that are reported as discretely presented component units , were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards . Inter nal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the state of North Dakota's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion s on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the state of North Dakota's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the state of North Dakota's internal control. A defic iency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A signif icant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant defici encies may exist that have not been identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identif ied. We did identify a certain deficiency in internal control described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings, Recommendations, and Responses as item 2019- 01 that we consider to be a significant weakness . We noted another deficiency involving internal control that we have reported to the management of the Office of Management and Budget in a letter dated December 11, 2019. Responses to Findings The Office of Management and Budget's responses to the findings identified in our audit are described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings, Recommendations, and Responses. These responses were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses. Compl iance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the state of North Dakota's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE ; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY UNIFORM GUIDANCE Independent Auditor's Report The Honorable Doug Burgum , Governor Members of the Legislative Assembly of the state of North Dakota of the state of North Dakota Mr. Joe Morrissette , Director Office of Management and Budget Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program We have audited the State of North Dakota's compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the State of North Dakota's major Federal programs f or the y ears ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . The State of North Dakota's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. Managemen t's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. Audit or's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the State of North Dakota's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirement s referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Unifor m Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) . Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the State of North Dakota's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We beli eve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our qualified and unmodified opinions on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the State of North Dakota's compliance. C - 2 Basis f or Qualified Opinion on the Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) Cluster As described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, the State of North Dakota did not comply with certain compliance requirements that are applicable to the major federal programs listed below. Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the State of North Dakota to comply with the requirements applicable to that program. Program/Cluster Title Compliance Requirement Finding Number CCDF Cluster (CFDA's 93.575 and 93.596) Special Tests and Provisions 2020-009 2020- 014 Qualified Opinion on the CCDF Cluster In our opinion, except for the noncompliance described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, the State of North Dakota complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and mate rial effect on the CCDF Cluster for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Unmodi fied Opinion on Each of the Other Major Federal Programs In our opinion, the State of North Dakota complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its other major federal programs identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . Othe r Matters The results of our auditing procedures disclosed other instances of noncompliance, which are required to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2020- 001, 2020- 002, 2020- 004, 2020 027, and 2020- 028. Our opinion on each major federal program is not modified with respect to these matters. The St ate of North Dakota's response to the noncompliance findings identified in our audit is described in the accompanying management's response and corrective action. The State of North Dakota's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Management of the State of North Dakota is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance require ments referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered the State of North Dakota's internal control over compliance with the type of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for eac h major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the State of North Dakota's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the State of North Dakota's internal control over compliance. C - 3 Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. However, as discussed below, we did identify certain deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. A defic iency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2020 -009 and 2020 -014 to be material weaknesses. A signi ficant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2020- 001, 2020- 002, 2020- 003, 2020- 004, 024, 2020- 025, and 2020 -027 to be significant deficiencies. The St ate of North Dakota's responses to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our audit are described in the accompanying management's response and corrective action. The State of North Dakota's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business -type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information for the State of North Dakota as of and for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 201 9, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the State of North Dakota's basic financial statements. We issued our report s thereon dated December 10 , 2020 and December 11, 20 19, respectively, which contained unmodified opinions on those financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounti ng and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements.

Management should also design control activities in response to the entity's objectives and risks to achieve an effective internal contr ol system. (Green Book, GAO -14-704G para 9.01, 10.02) GAS B Statement 88, paragraph 5, states \"a government should disclose in notes to financial statements summarized information about assets pledged as collateral for debt.\" GAS B Statement 62, paragraph 22, states that interest cost should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. For an accounting period in which some interest cost is capitalized, the total amount of interest cost incurred during the period and the amount thereof that has been capitalized should be disclosed. CONDITION The Office of Management and Budget does not have adequate procedures in place to ensure inclusion of required disclosures from component auditor reports in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR). The Bank of North Dakota audit report contained a note disclosure identifying $1.47 billion of securities assigned as collateral for debt which was not included in the CAFR note disclosures as required by Gov ernmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) statement 88. In addition, the North Dakota University System audit report disclosed $4 million of capitalized interest as required by GAS B statement 62 which was not included in the CAFR note disclosures. CAUSE The Office of Management and Budget has not designed adequate procedures to ensure the inclusion of required items from component auditor reports. EFFECT There is potential for incomplete note disclosure and non- compliance with GASB requirements. The Office of Management and Budget revised the note disclosures to include the identified errors of this finding. RECOM MENDATION We recommend the Office of Management and Budget improve procedures to ensure disclosure of GASB reporting requirements fro m component audit reports are included in the CAFR.

State of North Dakota Schedule of Financial Statement Findings Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 7 | SCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGSFINDING TYPE: Financial Statement Finding F20-1 Finding Title : Untimely Capitalization and Depreciation of Transportation Projects CRITERIA Construction of assets that are substantially complete and available for use on June 30 are not construction in progress. When assets are substantially complete and meet the state's capitalized threshold, the construction in progress status needs to be re moved and an asset needs to be added to asset records. This cost to acquire, construct or improve a capital asset is not recognized immediately as expense when occurred, but instead capitalized and allocated over the asset's estimated useful life in the f orm of depreciation expense. The purpose of recognizing depreciation expense is to allocate a proportionate share of the cost of the capital asset to each period that receives a benefit. No benefit is received until the capital asset is substantially rea dy to be placed into service. Sta ndards for internal control require that transactions are promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in controlling operation and making decisions. Also, management should design control activ ities so that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded.

September 2014. CONDITION The Department of Transportation did not capitalize and depreciate state oil impact projects that were substantially complete and in use. These projects were still included in construction in progress at June 30, 2020. Considering the Department's fiscal review period for project closeout which determines accurate project costs, the audit identified projects without financia l activity since June 30, 2017 and 2018 for calculating capitalizable costs and depreciation, respectively. Total costs for these projects was $332,139,681. These projects should have State of North Dakota Schedule of Financial Statement Findings Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 8 | SCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGSbeen reclassified from non- depreciable to depreciable capital assets f or reporting on the Government -wide Statement of Net Position and accrued depreciation expense of $3,727,377 during the audit period. CAUSE The Department of Transportation does not capitalize projects until a final fiscal review is completed which may take multiple years. The capitalization of a project may be delayed if there is a backlog of projects for a final fiscal review. A reporting process has not been established for the preparation of the CAFR to identify projects that are substantially complete, but not yet capitalized in the asset management records. EFFECT Potential for a material misstatement on the Statement of Net Position for Capital Assets, Depreciable (Net) and Nondepreciable. Depreciation expense is not recorded timely to be accrued for each period that the state benefits from use of the capital assets. RECOM MENDATION We recommend Office of Management and Budget ensure Department of Transportation infrastructure projects are capitalized and depreciated timely after the projec t is substantially complete and available for use.

Of that amount: o The Community Development Block Grant program was overstated by $5.5 million. o The Community Services Block Grant program was overstated by $3.2 million. o The HOME Investment Partnerships Program was overstated by $3.1 million. o The Weatherization Assistance for Low -Income Persons was overstated by $2.5 mi llion CAUSE Due to employee turnover, inexperienced staff prepared the SEFA without supervisory review EFFECT Inaccurate information was initially reported in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and detected and corrected through the audit. CON TEXT Incorrect expenditures reported on the fiscal year 2019 SEFA totaled $11.2 million and affected 14 progr ams. For fiscal year 2019, 100% (2 out of 2) of the Federal programs reviewed as major programs had incorrect expenditure amounts reported on the SEFA. These 2 programs made up 53% ($8.2 million) of the overall total corrected Federal expenditures ($14.7 million) listed on the Department of Commerce's SEFA for fiscal year 2019. RECOM MENDATION We recommend the Department of Commerce accurately prepare and perform an independent review of the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards .

State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 11 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSDepartment of Human Services FINDING TYPE: Significant Deficiency - Other Noncompliance Finding 2020 -002 Federal Program: Medicaid Cluster Federal Agency: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Compliance Requirement: Eligibility Questioned Cost: $4,782 CRITERIA 42 CFR 431.10 states the State Medicaid Agency or its designee is required to determine client eligibility in accordance with eligibility requirements defined in the approved State plan. 42 CFR 435.603 (a)(2) states that the agency must apply the financial methodologies set forth in this section in determining the financial eligibility of all individuals for Medicaid. 42 C FR 457.965 states the State must include in each applicant's record facts to support the State's determination of the applicant's eligibility for CHIP. 45 CFR 75.303 states th at the non- Federal entity must establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non -Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. CONDITION During our testing of eligibility, we noted that eligibility was not properly determined by the Department of Human Services (DHS) in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. DHS did not properly determine eligibility in 4 of 60 Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) cases reviewed. Each of the cases were missing either income verifications, a narrative to support determinations, or both. The errors resulted in improper payments totaling $4,659. When projected against the entire popula tion, the likely questioned costs total $1,119,228. DHS did not properly determine eligibility in 1 of the 60 Medicaid cases reviewed due to a lack of updated income information on the individual. As a result, auditor was unable to determine if the individual should have been eligible for Medicaid or not. The error resulted in an improper payment totaling $123. When projected against the entire population, the likely questioned costs total $695,468. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 12 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS The Department's Quality Control Unit did their own review and also identified eligibility determination errors as noted below. The e ligibility testing required by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) performed by the Department's Quality Control Unit for the calendar year 2019 for the Medicaid program identified 14 of the 200 active cases tested had eligibility determination errors, an error rate of 7%. While 35 out of the 200 negative cases tested had eligibility determination errors, an error rate of 17.5%. The e ligibility testing required by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) performed by the Department's Quality Control Unit for the calendar year 2019 for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) identified 27 of the 200 active cases tested had eligibility determination errors, an error rate of 13.5%. While 28 out of the 200 negative cases tested had eligibility determination errors, an error rate of 14%. Due to the public health emergency (Covid -19) CMS has changed its requirements for the payment review portion of act ive cases. It is no longer required to determine payment error amounts. As a result , we are unable to identify improper Federal payment amounts for the eligibility errors of the Department's Quality Control Unit testing. CAUSE The Department is not docume nting how the amount of income was determined. Also, the Department is relying on applicants to provide updated income when there are changes in employment status. These employment changes are not communicated timely to the Department. The Department verifies income with North Dakota Job Service periodically, but between income verifications the applicant is required to provide updated information when income changes. EFFECT Unallowable payments were made to providers on behalf of individuals whose eligibility for the CHIP and Medicaid was not proper. CONTEXT There were 126,060 CHIP and Medicaid cases that received over $2.6 billion in payments for fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020. IDENTIFICATION AS A REPEAT FINDING Finding 2018 -002 and 2018- 006 were reported in the immediate prior year. Finding 2016 -004 and 2016- 016 were made in previous years . RECOMMENDATION We recommend the Department of Human Services ensure eligibility determinations made for the Medicaid and CHIP programs are proper.

CONDITION The Department of Human Services (DHS) is not completing a reconciliation between PeopleSoft , the state's accounting system, and the Quarterly Children's Health Insurance Program Statement of Expenditures for Title XXI report (CMS -21 Report). DHS also did not complete a reconciliation between PeopleSoft and the grant expenditures reported on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program (CMS -64 Report). For b oth of these reports, the two quarters tested for each report did not have reconciliations completed. CAUSE The reconciliations were not completed primarily due to turnover in staff. EFFECT There is risk of fiscal year -end financial reporting being inaccurate if reconciliations between the Federal report and PeopleSoft are not completed as it could potentially misstate the reporting on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards . The auditors' testing of CMS reports did not identify any significant errors in financial reporting. CON TEXT CHIP expenditures were $46,531,367 during the audit period. After the auditor inquired about reconciliations, DHS did complete reconciliations for both grant and admin expenditures. No errors were noted. Medi caid grant expenditures were $1,451,818,930 during the audit period. Admin expenditures were reconciled and are not included in this expenditure amount. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 14 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSRECOMMENDATION We recommend the Department of Human Servi ces perform reconciliations between the Federal reports and PeopleSoft on a consistent basis.

Duplicate payments are neither necessary nor reasonable. 45 CFR 75.303 states that the non -Federal entity must establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non -Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. CONDITION Sixty potential duplicate payments were tested from the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). Testing identified 10 of these were duplicate payments from MMIS. CAUSE The Department does not have proper procedures in place to detect and prevent duplicate or improper payments from being issued EFFECT The known unallowable costs charged to the program were $8,460 and when projected against the entire population, the likely questioned costs were $74,776. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 15 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSCONTEXT 632 sets of duplicates totaling $2.1 million were identified as potential duplicate payments.

CONDITION Medicaid providers sub mitted claims for payments for which the provider did not retain the required documentation to support the service billed in 6 of 382 claims tested. This resulted in improper payments of $231. When projected against the entire population, the likely ques tioned costs totaled $4,999,047. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 16 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSThe Department of Human Service completed Medicaid adjustments that were not coded correctly in 2 of the 120 claim adjustments tested. This resulted in improper adjustments of $262. When projected against the entire population, the likely questioned costs totaled $101,665. CAUSE Medicaid providers did not retain proper documentation to support Medicaid claims and claim adjustments. In addition, the Department did not ensure providers were coding claims and adjustments properly. EFFECT Unallowable or inaccurate payments and adjustments were made to providers wit hout proper documentation. CONTEXT There were 121,684 individuals that were Medicaid eligible during our audit period of July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2020. RECOMMENDATION We recommend Department of Human Services ensure providers retain the proper documentation and are coding claims correctly for Medicaid claims and adjustments.

This section does not apply to services in hospitals and mental hospitals. For these facilities, see the following sections: 456.1 22 and 456.132 of subpart C; and 456.232 of subpart D. The N orth Dakota Program Integrity Unit Audit Oversight outlines the type and frequency of audits to be performed. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 17 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSCONDITION The Department of Human Services Program Integrity Unit did not fully execute their audit oversight document for the Medicaid Program. Per the audit oversight document the new rehabilitation provider audit and the recipient analysis are to be completed semi-annually. The new rehabilitation provider audit was scheduled to start i n the first quarter of calendar year 2019, however, it was never completed and it was determined to discontinue these audits. While the recipient analysis was completed during the second half of calendar year 2018 and all of calendar year 2019, it had not been completed yet for calendar year 2020. Additionally, the ambulance audits are to be conducted on a weekly basis. While the ambulance audits were completed for most of calendar years 2018 and 2019, there were no reviews completed for December 2018 and audits stopped after February 2020. CAUSE The new rehabilitation provider audit was not completed due to the lack of time and resources as well as upper management's decision to focus on audits that have a bigger fiscal impact. The semi- annual recipient analysis was not completed for 2020 as the compliance technician was new to the position and due to a lack of communication did not realize they needed to complete the analysis. The ambulance reviews have not been completed since February 2020 due to the c hanging of staff and procedures. EFFECT The audits completed as required by the Audit Oversight document are the primary process to identify improper use of Medicaid funds. If the audits are not being completed timely, individuals could be misusing Medicaid funds. CONTEXT The Recipient Analysis and New Rehabilitation Provider Audits are required, by the Audit Oversight document, to be performed once every six months. Additionally, Ambulance Audits are required by the Audit Oversight docume nt to be performed weekly. The Department did not perform all of these required reviews timely during the audit period. IDENTIFICATION AS A REPEAT FINDING Finding 2018 -003 was reported in the immediate prior year. Findings 2016 -003, 2014 -002, 2012- 003 were made in previous years. RECOMMENDATION We recommend the Department of Human Services ensure the Program Integrity Unit fully executes their Audit Oversight policy.

Disclosure shall not be made prior to the start of the new calendar quarter. After the start of the new calendar quarter, a Contracted Pa rty may disclose only non-confidential information contained in the Medicaid NCCI edit files that is also available to the general public foundon the Medicaid NCCI webpage. The Contracted Party agrees to use any non- public information from the quarterly state Medicaid NCCI edit files only for any business purposes directly related to the implementation of the Medicaid NCCImethodologies in the particular state. New, revised, or deleted Medicaid NCCI edits shall not be published or otherwise shared with individuals, medical societies, or any other entities unless it is a Contracted Party prior to the posting of the Medicaid NCCI edits on the Medicaid NCCI webpage. Implementation of New, revised, or deleted Medicaid NCCI edits shall not occur prior to the first day of the calendar quarter. Only a state Medicaid agency has the discretion to release additional information for selected individual edits or limited ranges of edits from the files posted on the Medicaid Integrity Institute. State Medicaid a gencies must impose penalties, up to and including loss of contract, for violations of any confidentiality agreement relating to use of the MII edit files.State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 19 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSCONDITION The Department of Human Services does not have a confidentiality agreement in place with Cotiviti in regards to the NCCI. Medicaid National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) methodologies must be applied to Medicaid fee-for-service claims submitted with, and reimbursed on the basis of, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes and Current Procedural Terminology codes. The NCCI files are to be updated on a quarterly basis as required by the Medicaid Integrity Institute. The Department of Human Services contracts with Cotiviti to implement the correct quarterly files from Medicaid Integrity Institute. The NCCI Medicaid Technical Guidance Manual requires a confidentiality agreement to be in place for any contracted party using the Medicaid NCCI files. CAUSE The Department of Human Services was unaware of the requirement to have a confidentiality agreement EFFECT The lack of a confidentiality agreement with Cotiviti could result in Cotiviti using non -public information from the quarterly state Medicaid NCCI edit files for non- business purposes without any penalties being imposed. Additionally, the lack of a confidentiality agreement with Cotiviti could lead to Cotiviti not updating the quarterly files timely. CONTEXT There were 121,684 individuals that were Medicaid eligible during our audit period of July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2020 that had claims being processed by the Department of Human Services through Cotiviti. RECOM MENDATION We recommend the Department of Human Services ensure a confidentiality agreement is in place with Cotiviti in regards to National Correct Coding Initiative.

Monitoring activities related to service organizations may include the use of work performe d by external parties. (GAO -14- 704G para 16.08) 45 CFR 75.303 states that the non -Federal entity must establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non -Federal entity is managing the F ederal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 2 CFR 200.303(e) states that the non -Federal entity must take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable information and other information the Federal awarding agency or pass -through entity designates as sensitive or the non-Federal entity considers sensitive consistent with applicable Federal, state, local, and tribal laws regarding privacy and obligations of confident iality. AU-C Section 402.08 \"Audit Considerations Relating to an Entity Using a Service Organization\" defines a services organization as an organization that provides services to user entities that are relevant to those user entities' internal control over financial reporting. CONDITION The Department of Human Services contracts with Health Management Systems to exchange Medicaid recipients information to inquire if those recipients maintain third party liability/health insurance coverage. The Department of Human Services exchanges personal recipient information, however, has not received a System and Organization Controls (SOC) report for Health Management System (HMS) since 2018, which was for the time frame of March 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018. The Child Support Division also participates in the contract with HMS to look for hits in the national health insurance database applicable to eligible child support individuals for potential 3rd party liability. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 21 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSCAUSE The HMS contract expired on September 30, 2017. Following procurement procedures, the new contract was established with HMS. After the contract was reprocured, there was miscommunication among Department of Human Services personnel on whether a SOC report was required or not with the current contract. EFFECT The lack of a SOC report for HMS, could lead to the Department of Human Services exchanging Medicaid recipients' and eligible child support individuals' information with an outside service organization with potential control weaknesses to protect personal information. CONTEXT There were 121,684 individuals that were Medicaid eligible during our audit period of July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2020. In addition, the Child Support Division submits a monthly extract file to HMS which contains approximately 50,000 children for whom there is an order for support. This extract file could include social security numbers for the children, custodial parents, and noncustodial parents. RECOM MENDATION We recommend the Department of Human Services ensures SOC reports are obtained on all outside service organizations on a regular, consistent basis.

Those health and safety provisions shall incorporate the latest recommendation for childhood immunization of the respective state. Lead agencies may exempt: (1) Children who are cared for by relatives, provided there are no other unrelated children who are cared for in the same setting. (2) Children who State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 22 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSreceive care in their own homes, provided there are no other unrelated children who are cared for in the home. (3) Children whose parents object to immunization on religious grounds. (4) Children whose medical condition contraindicates immunization. 45 CF R 98.41(iv) requires prevention and response to emergencies due to food and allergic reactions. Allergic reactions are identified on the Statement of Health for each individual child. 45 CF R 98.41 states that lead agencies must certify that procedures are in effect to ensure that child care providers, for which assistance is provided under the Child Care Assistance Program, comply with all applicable health and safety requirements. Nor th Dakota Century Code section 50 -11.1- 07 requires a licensee to maintain records as the Department prescribes regarding each child, and sh all report to the Department or the Department's authorized agent, when requested, upon forms furnished by the Department, facts the Department may require with reference to each child. CONDITION The Department of Human Services does not ensure that chil d care providers have records for enrolled children as identified by Federal health and safety requirements. Required records include immunization records and a statement of health for each child enrolled with the provider. Of 83 licenses tested, 27 were either missing records or did not have documentation identifying records were reviewed during the licensing process resulting in a 33% error rate. CAUSE Department approval of child care licenses does not include verification that county licensors reviewed required child care records and ensured missing documentation was obtained. EFFECT Children could be at risk due to unidentified health concerns. CONTEXT During fiscal year 2017 and 2018, there were 2,174 licensed providers that received payments totaling $29.4 million. IDENTIFICATION AS A REPEAT FINDING Finding 2018 -007 was reported in the immediate prior year.

Dep artment of Human Services Child Care Assistance Policy Manual section 400 -28-105-25 states that the household's provider must be licensed (including military, tribal and out -of state), self -declared, or an approved relative provider. The license must be current and have an expiration date later than the date of the Child Care Assistance Provider's application. 45 CFR 75.303 states that the non -Federal entity must establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non -Federal entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. CONDITION The Department of Human Services issued Child Care Assistance payments to providers that were improperly licensed. The Department requires that an individual is either an approved relative, self -declared, or licensed child care provider in order to receive payments. 27 of 83 provider licenses reviewed were determined to be improperly licensed, an error rate of 33%. These providers received $34,782 in payments during the period o f improper licensure. These known questioned costs were not projected to the population as not all improperly licensed providers received child care assistance payments during the period of being improperly licensed. CAUSE The Department has not designed consistent procedures to ensure licensing applications include all required documents. In addition, they rely on the licensing process and do not perform sufficient independent verifications that payments are issued to prop erly licensed providers.

Fifty -two of 520 (10%) corrective orders issued during our audit period did not identify a date the orders were determined to be corrected. In addition, 163 of 520 (31%) c orrective orders were not re -inspected within the 24 hour, 20 day, or 60 day time frame allowed for correction.

CONDITION The Department of Human Services issued duplicate and other improper payments to child care providers receiving payments from the Child Care Assistance program. We tested 60 payments and identified $1, 347 of improper payme nts. These errors projected to the remaining population of potential duplicate payments, would result in additional likely questioned costs of $ 4,113. The id entified circumstances are as follows: 3 Duplicate payments were made due to a system defect in SPACES that caused a second payment to be paid for 3 cases. This resulted in duplicate payments of $ 859. 7 Duplicate payment were made when a case worker did not notice that a payment had already beensent out. This resulted in duplicate payment of $488.

FINDING TYPE: Significant Deficiency - Other Noncompliance Finding Federal Agency: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children and Families Compliance Requirement: Eligibility Questioned Cost: $1,698 CRITERIA 45 CFR 98.68(c) states that lead agencies must have procedures in place for documenting and verifying eligibility. 45 CF R 98.45(k) states that lead agencies shall establish a sliding fee scale, based on family size, income, and other appropriate factors, that provides for cost sharing by families that receive CCDF child care services. 45 C FR 98.20(a) states that child ren must be under age 13, reside with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of State/territorial/tribal median income for a family of the same size, and reside with a parent who is working or attending a job training or education program; or are in need of, or are receiving protective services. Lead agencies may choose to provide services during period of job search. CONDITION The Department of Human Services did not properly determine eligibility in 5 of 60 child care assistance cases tested b y the auditor. Each of the cases had one or more of the following errors: improperly calculated household State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 28 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSincome, missing birth records, and missing income verifications. The errors resulted in improper payments totaling $1,698. When projected against the entire population, the projected error is $873,187. CAUSE The Department did not collect or maintain proper documentation to determine eligibility. In addition, data entry and income calculations were not being completed consistently and accurately. EFFECT Unallowable payments were made to providers on behalf of individuals whose eligibility for the Child Care Assistance Program were not proper. CONTEXT There were 5,694 cases that received over $29.3 million in payments for fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2020.

CONDITION The Department of Human Services is not ensuring child care centers, self -declared, group, preschool, and school -age providers comply with all health and safety standards as defined by North Dakota Administrative Code. The checklists used by county licensors, when conducting annual on-site licensing studies, do not contain all necessary health and safety requirements. The licensing study does not include items related to the following health and safety standard requirements: prevention and control of infectious diseases; prevention of sudden infant death syndrome and use of safe sleeping practices; administration of medication, consistent with standards of parental consent; prevention and responses to emergencies due to food and allergic reaction; building and physical premises safety, including identification and protection from hazards, bodies of water, and vehicular traffic; prevention of shaken baby syndrome, abusive head trauma, and child maltreatment; emergency preparedness and response planning; appropriate precautions if transporting children; pediatric first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and recognition of child abuse & neglect. CAUSE The Department did not update licensing materials to include verification that all required health and safety standards were met prior to licensing. EFFEC T Child care providers may be operating without complying with health and safety requirements, potentially jeopardizing the health and safety of children.

State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 31 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSCONDITION The Department of Human Services is not performing annual unannounced inspecti ons of self -declared child care providers in operation. An annual unannounced inspection was not completed on 10 of 23 self -declared providers that were tested. CAUSE The Department's procedures for ensuring unannounced visits are performed annually by county licensors are ineffective. EFFECT Child care providers are operating child care facilities without proper monitoring of whether health and safety conditions have been met. CONTEXT During fiscal years 2019 and 2020, there were 230 self -declared providers from the Child Care Assistance program. IDENTIFICATION AS A REPEAT FINDING Finding 2018 -017 was reported in the immediate prior year. Finding 2016 -027 was made in the previous year.

The D epartment's Early Childhood Services Quality Assurance Policy (620 -01-20-20) requires the region al office to perform random provider reviews on an annual basis with the authorized agent. CONDITION The Department of Human Services' monitoring procedures of the county licensors of child care providers is ineffective. The Department's Early Childhood Services supervisors perform procedural reviews of county licensor activities. The selection procedures do not include assurance that activities of all county licensors are reviewed. In addition, errors identified during our testing indicate these reviews are clearly ineffective at identifying material weaknesses and inconsistencies. These errors include nonperformance of unannounced visits, lack of monitoring of corrective orders, and improperly licensed providers. CAUSE The Department has not designed monitoring procedures to carry out the purpose of licensing early childhood service providers to safeguar d the health, safety, and development of children. EFFECT Child care providers are operating without complying with licensing requirements and proper monitoring of health and safety conditions which may jeopardize the health and safety of children. CONTEXT The Child Care Assistance program has 5 regional representatives. DHS has created county zone areas throughout the State. This structure has not been fully implemented by assigning zones and responsibilities and, until it is, this finding applies to the regional supervisor responsibilities according to DHS policy.

FINDING TYPE: Significant Deficiency - Other Noncompliance Finding 2020 -017 (2019, 2020) Federal Agency: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Compliance Requirement: Special Tests and Provisions Questioned Cost: Unknown CRITERIA 45 CFR \u00a7261.60 states: (a) A State must report the actual hours that an individual participates in an activity, subject to the qualifications in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and \u00a7261.61(c). It is not sufficient to report the hours an individual is scheduled to participate in an activity. 45 CFR \u00a7261.61 states: (a) A State must support each individual's hours of participation through documentation in the case file. In accordance with \u00a7261.62, a State must describe in its Work Verification Plan the documentation it uses to verify hours of participation in each activity. North Dakota 's Work Verification Plan outlines the use of JOBS Employment Contractors to determine the individual's hours of participation. The process includes sampling of the JOBS Employment Contractor work to ensure accuracy. 45 CFR \u00a7261.20 states: (c) If the data show that a State met both participation rates in a fiscal year, then the percentage of historic State expenditures that it must expend under TANF, pursuant to \u00a7263.1 of this chapter, decreases from 80 percent to 75 percent f or that fiscal year. This is also known as the State's TANF \"maintenance - of-effort\" (MOE) requirement.(d) If the data show that a State did not meet a minimum work participation rate for a fiscal year, a State could be subject to a financial penalty. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 34 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSCONDITION The Department of Human Services (DHS) is not in compliance with the Work Verification Plan in regards to monitoring data used to calculate the work participation rate. The w ork participation rate effects the maintenance -of-effort requirement and could result in sanctions if minimum work participation rates are not met. DHS contracts with Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Employment Contractors to verify work verification documents provided by the client in meeting their work participation hours requirements. This sampling was halted during SPACES implementation. DHS uses this information to report data on their State Work Participation Rates on the ACF -199 repo rt. CAUSE Since SPACES went live, DHS has fallen behind on sending cases to the JOBS work contractors for audit and therefore audits and results thereof are not available. EFFECT DHS's reported Work Participation Rates could be incorrectly calculated which could result in additional maintenance- of-effort requirements and Federal sanctions. CONTEXT No sampling was provided by the Department of Human Services to the JOBS contractors following the March 2019 implementation of the SPACES eligibility syst em (February 2019 was last monthly sample). RECOMMENDATION We recommend the Department of Human Services ensure compliance with the Work Verification Plan. This includes the JOBS verification of TANF cases and maintenance of results for work participation status accuracy.

CONDITION The Department of Human Services (DHS) risk assessment process of subrecipients is insufficient. DHS did complete a risk assessment for every subrecipient, but the risk assessments are not being used to determine the nature and extent of subrecipient moni toring. CAUSE The Department of Human Services has developed policies and procedures to determine the nature and extent of subrecipient monitoring to be performed but the policies and procedures do not take into account the results of the risk assessmen ts performed.

Pay ments made after the liquidation period totaled $94,081 for the 2018 grant. CAUSE The Department of Human Services, Vocational Rehabilitation Program, did not properly update speedcharts, which provide for automated coding within the State's accounting system, at its Regional Human Service Centers. This issue was noted in three of the four errors found in sampling and permitted unallowable costs to be charged to the 2018 Federal grant. The final error was due to improper coding when the payment was enter ed into the system. In addition, review of the program's internal controls regarding period of performance proved inadequate to detect payments made outside of the p eriod of p erformance as documentation of the review to ensure expenditures are applied to t he correct p eriod of p erformance was not maintained. EFFECT Unallowable costs totaling $94,081 were charged to the grant and are questioned costs. CONTEXT The Department of Human Services, Vocational Rehabilitation program, had expenditures of appro ximately $7.6 million from the 2018 grant award during the audit period. Of this amount, $94,081 was identified as a known questioned cost from 66 payments. These are all payments after the period of performance.

Pass through entity monitoring of the subrecipient must include following- up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies pertaining to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass -through entity detected through audits. Sta ndards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Green Book) require management to establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results. (GAO -14-704G para 16.01) CONDITION The Department of Public Instruction is not ensuring timely and appropriate action was taken on deficiencies noted during fiscal subrecipient monitoring of the Special Education Cluster. During testing of subrecipient monitoring, we noted 3 of the 8 subrecipients tested ea ch had one monitoring finding, but no timely follow -up procedures were completed by the Department to ensure the findings were resolved. CAUSE The tracking spreadsheet for fiscal subrecipient monitoring only includes when the audit was completed or when it is planned. There is no tracking of the results, if there were recommendations, and if any follow -up was completed on those recommendations.

These payments were made after the 90 day payment period following the end of the applicable grant awards. There is also a payment of $12,839 which lacked documentation to determine if the underlying obligations occurred within the period of performance and did not comply with the Federal period of performance liquidation period requirements for the Child Nutrition Cluster. The projection on the known questioned costs of $32,523 is an additional $1,153 in payments made after the period of performance. CAUSE For 2 out of 5 items tested, the Department of Public Instruction's system, NDFoods , and PeopleSoft, the state's accounting system, did not properly communicate payment of claims. Two separate payments of the 5 items tested were in error due to untimely identification of an incorrect reimbursement rate being applied to meals which lead to a subsequent correction payment made after the period of performance. Finally, 1 additional payment separate from the errors already identified, was an error due to a lack of documentation of the transaction. EFFECT The Department of Public Instruction charged unallowable costs to the grant. CONTEXT 26 of the 6,636 disbursements that were made by the Department of Public Instruction for the Child Nutrition Cluster for grants that ended during fiscal years 2019 and 2020 were paid outside of the 90 day period of performance. IDENT IFICATION AS A REPEAT FINDING Finding 2018 -039 was reported in the immediate prior year. RECOM MENDATION We recommend the Department of Public Instruction ensure Child Nutrition Cluster obligations occur within the period o f performance and that payments are not made after the period of performance.

Sta ndards for Internal Control in the Federal Government\" (Green Book) requires manag ement assign responsibilities and perform ongoing monitoring of the design and operating effectiveness of the internal control as part of the normal course of operations. Management must also communicate policies and procedures to personnel so that personnel can implement the control activities for their assigned responsibilities and ensure corrective actions. (Green Book, para. 3.07, 12.02, 12.04, 16.05, 17.05) CONDITION The North Dakota Department of Transportation failed to adequately track which subrecipients require d Uniform G uidance audits and review audit reports for findings within 6 mont hs. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 47 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS CAUSE The client inadvertently failed adequately follow -up with subrecipients to determine if a Single Audit report was required and also failed to adequately review the reports that were reported for any issues related to Department grants. EFFECT Subrecipients spending more than $750,000 from all sources including the Department of Transportation may not be obtaining audits as required and issues related to Department of Transportation funding may be unresolved. CONTEXT The Department of Transportation's subrecipient audit tracking spreadsheets following state fiscal years 2018 and 2019, the Department identified 131 and 117 subrecipients, respectively, each year. The Department's tracking for fiscal year 2018 identified certifications and all further audit documentation was not received for 9 subrecipients as well as 4 additional audits which were noted to have been completed, but no review by the Department of Transportation's Audit Services was completed within 6 months . For fiscal year 2019, certifications and all further audit documentation was not received for 11 subrecipients as well as 10 additional audits which were noted to have been completed but no review by the Department of Transportation's Audit Services was completed within 6 months. RECOMMENDATION We recommend the Department of Transportation identify annually, based on the subrecipient's fiscal year, all subrecipients that spent $750,000 or more in Federal awards from all sources through developed certifi cation procedures. We also recommend the Department of Transportation ensure the certification tracking method is completed, to ensure all required audits are completed within nine months of the subrecipient's fiscal year end, management decisions are issued within six months of receiving the audit report, and timely and appropriate corrective action of all findings.

Sta ndards for Internal Control in the Federal Government\" (Green Book) requires management identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. (Green Book, para. 7.01) CONDITION The Department of Transportation is not evaluating each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Fede ral statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward for purposes of determining appropriate subrecipient monitoring. CAUSE The Department of Transportation indicated the cause was client oversight due to the fact the requirement was not included in the previous state plan. However, the Department has since developed a risk assessment tool to evaluate subrecipient's risk of noncompliance starting in 2021. EFFECT High- risk subrecipients may not be subjected to adequate monitoring procedures to ensure Federal funds were used for authorized purposes in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. CONTEXT The Formula Grants for Rural Areas had 30 subrecipients in the audit period.

When some of this information is not available, the pass -through entity must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award and subaward. Required informationincludes: (1) Federal award identification. (i) Subrecipient name (which must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier);(ii) Subrecipient's unique entity identifier;(iii) Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN); (iv) Federal Award Date (see the definition of Federal award date in \u00a7200.1 of this part) of award to the recipient by the Federal agency;(v) Subaward Period of Performance Start and End Date;(vi) Subaward Budget Period Start and End Date;(vii) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action by the pass -through entity to the subrecipient;(viii) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the subrecipient by the pass -through entity including the current financial obligation;(ix) Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass -through entity; (x) Federal award project description, as required to be responsive to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA);State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 50 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS (xi) Name of Federal awarding agency, pass -through entity, and contact information for awarding official of the Pass -through entity; (xii) Assistance Listings number and Title; the pass -through entity must identify the dollar amount made available under each Federal award and the Assistance Listings Number at time of disbursement; (xiii) Identification of whether the award is R&D; and (xiv) Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is charged) per \u00a7200.414. CONDITION The Department of Transportation did not provide the subrecipient unique entity identifier, Federal award identification number, and Federal award date as required by 2 CFR 200.332(a) related to Federal award identification to subrecipients. CAUSE The previous grant agreements used for the Formula Grants for Other than Urbanized Areas program did not contain the necessary information. EFFECT Subrecipients may not have the required information. CONTEXT The Formula Grants for Rural Areas had 30 subrecipients in the audit period.

CONDITION The State Treasurer's Office (STO) did not ensure that all subrecipients were audited under OMB 2 CFR 200 Subpart F as applicable. For three of the four subrecipients tested who received a total of $18,978,662 in Federal funds from the State Treasurer's Office during Fiscal Year 2018, the STO did not ensure that the necessary audits were completed, issue management decisions within a timely manner, or ensure corrective action was taken on any deficiencies identified. State of North Dakota Schedule of Federal Findings and Questioned Costs Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2019 and 2020 D - 52 |SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTSFor three of the four subrecipient s tested who received a total of $45,815,902 in Federal funds from the State Treasurer's Office during Fiscal Year 2019, the STO did not ensure that the necessary audits were completed, issue management decisions within a timely manner, or ensure corrective action was taken on any deficiencies identified. CAUSE The State Treasurer's Office does not have all the necessary monitoring procedures in place to ensure all the subrecipient audit requirements are being met. The annual certification form that the State Treasurer's Office utilizes does not have the subrecipient indicate if they spent $750,000 or more in Federal awards from all sources during their fiscal year. EFFECT Subrecipients spending more than $750,000 from all Federal sources including the State Treasurer's Office may not be obtaining audits as required or implementing a corrective action plan in a timely manner if findings are noted in audits that were completed. CONTEXT The State Treasurer's Office (STO) did not receive audits for subrecipients that received a significant amount of Federal funds from the STO. The State Treasurer's Office disbursed Federal dollars to a total of 26 subrecipients during Fiscal Year 2018 and 21 subrecipients during Fiscal Year 2019 for a total of 47 su brecipients given $86,704,892 for the two years. We sampled the audit report monitoring of 8 of these subrecipients. We found noncompliance with monitoring for 6 of the 8 subrecipients tested for an error rate of 75%. These six subrecipients that were mis sing audit reports had received $64,794,564 from the STO which is 75% of all dollars paid out to all subrecipients for the 2 years ($64,794,564 / $86,704,892 = 75%). RECOMMENDATION We recommend the State Treasurer's Office identify annually, through a certification process, all subrecipients that spent $750,000 or more in Federal awards from all sources during their fiscal year. We also recommend the State Treasurer's Office enhance their existing tracking procedures to ensure all required audits are completed within nine months of the subrecipient's fiscal year end, management decisions are issued within six months of receiving the audit report, and timely and appropriate corrective action is taken on all applicable findings.

80STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS For the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 E - 81 NOTE 1. PURPOSE OF THE SCHEDULE The Schedul e of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Schedule) is a supplementary schedule to the State's basic financial statements ( BFS) and is presented for the purposes of additional analysis. The Schedule is required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POL ICIES A.Basis of Presentation Federal Financial Assistance - Pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984 (Public Law 98- 502), the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (Public Law 104- 156), and OMB Uniform Guidance, federal financial assistance is defined as assistance provided by a federal agency, either directly or indirectly, that non- federal entities receive or administer, in the form of grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, loans, loan guarantees, property interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Accordingly, nonmonetary federal assistance, including food commodities, food stamps, vaccines, and donated surplus property is included in federal financial assistance and, therefore, is reported on the Schedule. Federal financial assistance does not include direct federal cash assistance to individuals. Contracts between the state and federal government for which the federal government procures tangible goods or services are not considered to be federal financial assistance. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance - Uniform Guidance requires the Schedule to show the total expenditures for each of the State's federal financial assistance programs as identified in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). The CFDA is a government -wide compendium of individual federal programs . Each program included in the CFDA is assigned a five- digit program identification number (CFDA number), the first two digits designat e the federal agency and the last three digits designat e the federal assistance program within the federal agency. Federal financial assistance programs that have not been assigned a CFDA number are indicated using the federal agency's two digit code as the prefix and using a \"U\" followed by a two- digit number (e.g., U01, U02, etc.) for the last three digits. If the Feder al program is part of the Research and Development (R&D) cluster, \"RD\" is used as the CFDA extension. Clusters of Programs - Closely related programs with different CFDA numbers that share common compliance requirements are to be considered a cluster of programs. The only program clusters presented on the Schedule are those mandated by OMB in the 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix XI, Compliance Supplement . STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS For the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 E - 82 B.Type A and Type B Programs The Unif orm Guidance establish es the levels of expenditures to be used in defining Type A and Type B federal financial assistance programs. Type A assistance programs for the State of North Dakota are those programs that exceeded $ 13,255,999 in federal expenditures, distributions, or issuances for the two- year period ended June 30, 2020. C.Reporting Entity The Schedul e includes all federal financial assistance programs administered by those State departments and entities included in the State's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, except the departments audited by independent public accounting firms that file their own single audit with the federal clearinghouse. The departments not included in the Schedule are: Housing Finance Authority , Bank of North Dakota, Job Service North Dakota, and Public Finance Authority . D.Basis of Accounting Federal financial assistance expenditures included in the Schedule are reported using the modified accrual basis of accounting, except for the following: colleges, universities, and enterprise entities reported expenditures on the accrual basis; the Department of Public Instruction, Division of Emergency Services , Secretary of State, Information Technology Department, Insurance Department, State Historical Society, Council on the Arts, Attorney General's Office, State Auditor's Office, Industrial Commission, Department of Labor, School for the Blind, State Water Commission, State Treasurer , Governor's Office, Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Human Services reported expenditures on the cash basis; and the Health Department reported expenditures on the cash basis plus accrued payroll and accrued indirect costs. Indirect Costs - The State has elected not to use the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform Guidance except for the following three agencies: Depart ment of Veterans Affairs Aeronautics Commission State Auditor 's Office (2020) Valley City State University Matching Costs - The Schedule does not include matching expenditures. Nonm onetary Assistance - The Schedule contains values for several nonmonetary assistance programs. The Commodities and Vaccine programs are presented at the fede rally assigned values of the products distributed by the state. The Surplus Property program is p resented at the fair market value of property received. The fair market value was estimated to be 23.34 % of the property's original federal acquisition value. STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS For the Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 E - 83 Loan and Loan Guarantee Programs - Information on federal loan and federal loan guarantee progr ams is included in the Notes to the Schedule instead of on the Schedule itself. Federal Transactions Between State Entities - Some state entities transfer federal assistance to other state entities (i.e., a pass -through of funds by the primary recipient s tate entity to a subrecipient state entity). In this case, the expenditures are recognized by the primary state entity on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. Purchases of services between state entities using federal moneys are reported as expenditures by the purchasing entity and as revenues for services rendered by the providing entity. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Expenditures - The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is presented at the dollar value of food stamp electronic benefit transfers authorized and used by recipients. Negati ve amounts shown on the Schedule represent adjustments or credits made in the normal course of business to amounts reported as expenditures in prior years. NOTE 3. NONMONETARY ASSISTANCE INVENTORY As described previously in Note 2, nonmonetary assistance is reported in the Schedule based on the amount disbursed.

DHS has now filled the vacant Medicaid Accountant position. This position will be responsible to complete the administrative portion of the Quarterly Children's Health Insurance Program Statement of Expenditures for Title XXI report (CMS -21 Report). Part of the quarterly reporting process will be to reconcile the amounts reported to PeopleSoft, as the PeopleSoft system is the system of record for DHS ad ministrative expenses. As noted above DHS did not perform the reconciliation's timely due to turnover in staff but reconciliations were provided once requested and no errors were noted. DHS anticipates reconciliation's will be done timely since the posit ion has been filled. The Med ical Assistance expenditures reported on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program (MAP) (CMS -64 Report) are based on payment data from MMIS. This data is summarized and grouped according to CMS reporting requirements. MAP expenditure data at this detail does not exist in PeopleSoft, therefore the PeopleSoft system is not used for federal reporting, however part of the federal reporting process includes balancing PeopleSoft check write amount s to MMIS 64 reports generated from MMIS. DHS wishes to clarify that there is not a risk of federal reporting being inaccurate for the MAP if reconciliations between the federal report and PeopleSoft are not completed. MMIS is the system of record for federal reporting and calculations for collection adjustment are part of the federal reporting process and can only made in PeopleSoft once the federal reporting process is complete. DHS will ensure timely adjustments are made to PeopleSoft to ensure MAP expenditure amounts reported on the CMS -64 are properly reflected in PeopleSoft, this will also ensure that fiscal year- end financial reporting is reflective of what has been reported, and therefore reduce the risk of misstatement on the Schedule of Expen ditures of Federal Awards.

The Program Integrity Unit has revised the language in the Audit Overview Oversight document to better reflect the new rehabilitation provider process. It is not a formal audit but rather an educational review process meant to assist the providers in billing correctly. The Program Integrity Unit has reassigned the layperson ambulance reviews to the Utilization Review team due to no longer having a layperson in the PIU. The PIU will pull the applicable claims data for the UR team to conduct the review. Prior to reassigning to the UR team, a temporary enrollment staff helped get the late ambulance claim reviews caught up. Requests for the sample of ambulance claims for 4 th quarter 2020 went out and we are currently receiving responses and are current with the reviews. The semi -annual recipient analysis for first half of 2020 was completed in October of 2020. The second ha lf of 2020 will be reviewed this month.

Early Childhood Services has received Technical Assistance from the regional office (OCC) regarding childcare records. Their recommendations according to CCDF requirements, were to update our compliance checklist (see below) and to eliminate the childcare record (SFN 1426) which is not a required form. All specialists will be using the updated compliance checklist by May of 2021. CHILD CARE RECORDS WORKSHEET Review of no less than 30 files must be conducted on site.

The State initiated a process redesign for early childhood licensing in August 2019. The redesign was intended to improve consistency of reviews, ongoing monitoring, and corrective action across all 19 Human Service Zones. The bulk of the redesign work took place in advance of the former county -employed early childhood licensors becoming state employees (January 2020). As part of Redesign, DHS piloted the use of a streamlined on -site visit ch ecklist to identify opportunities for efficiencies. Thirteen counties utilized the abbreviated form during pilot, the remaining counties continued to utilize the existing form. It was determined that the abbreviated form would not adequately capture inform ation needed so, in June 2020 all licensors reverted to utilization of the full- length Compliance Checklist to assure all Health and Safety standards are being met. In September 2020 DHS began the work of implementing a comprehensive Early Childhood Licens ing database that will greatly improve the ability to properly license providers. The system is anticipated to be complete by March 2022. Contact Person: Carmen Traeholt, Early Childhood Services Statewide Manager 2022 Services Response/Corrective Action Plan: The Department agrees with the recommendation. During the audit timeframe, County Licensors were inconsistent in how they followed up on corrective orders. As part of Earl y Childhood Services Redesign (completed by March 2020), all Licensing Specialists are assigned a specific provider case load, which will help Licensing Specialists keep track of any correction orders and follow -up expectations that affect providers they a re assigned to work with.

The Lead Agency receives a monthly report that contains payments that could be considered duplicate that were made for three months prior to the current month . The report contains payments that meet the following criteria: Same child Same caretaker Same provider Same service month Department staff reviews identified payments on this report and maintains a log and notes on each situation and any follow up that was completed with Eligibility workers. The consolidated eligibility system, SPACES, where payments are issued, does have checks validations in place to ensure payments to no exceed the state maximum rate. An additional warning message is in place and is received when a payment already exists for the child and provider for a service month and a new payment with the same criteria is entered. Workers are able to by-pass this warning message as there are instances where a second payment may be needed. The department will explore a system enhancement to make this warning message more prominent in an effort to reduce duplicate payment situations. Contact Person: Emily Hakanson, Child Care Assistance Program Administrator Anticipated Completion Date: There is no anticipated completion date for system enhancements as all enhancements have to be prioritized and scheduled based on need.

This effort is done in collaboration with the Policy and System Support (PaSS) unit in Economic Assistance. The PaSS unit will begin conducting CCAP New Worker Training annually beginning the winter of 2022. The training will cover all aspect s of CCAP eligibility. In March 2019, the department implemented a new eligibility system, SPACES. The implementation of this new system has made processing of cases less error prone as the system calculates all aspects of CCAP eligibility such as countable income amounts, countable households members, allowable child care hours, etc. The department is continually making improvements to the system through change requests. Quality Assurance reviews are completed monthly and the results of those reviews are used to determine training needs, corrective active, etc. to mitigate errors.

During the audit timeframe County Licensors were inconsistent in rates of completion for unannounced visits. This was due, in par t, to the difference in how each County chose to administer and staff this function; licensors were not consistently required to maintain certain caseloads which contributed to uneven application of this part of the regulation. A major focus of the redesi gn effort was to ensure that the system was structured to ensure early childhood specialists time was organized to maximize time spent on visits. As part of redesign all Licensing Specialists are assigned a specific case load so they can schedule and follo w through with unannounced visits for their assigned providers. This new distribution of work accompanied the transition from county to state employment (Jan 2020) and was being implemented by mid -2020. Early Childhood Services is currently in the process of designing a database to ensure all required documents and licensing visits are complete prior to issuing licenses and certificates to providers. The data base will be complete in April of 2022. Cont act Person: Carmen Traeholt, Early Childhood Services 2022 Services Response/Corrective Action Plan: The Department agrees with the recommendation. Early Childhood Services Redesign moved all County Licensors to State employment (Jan 2020) and Early Childhood Services Regional Representatives to a Supervisor status (March 2020). These steps will change how a QA visit is completed. QA visits starting in 2021 will include both standard performance reviews of licensors as well as quality assurance review of outputs and outcomes. This includes review of how licensors conduct visits and complete their core work related to license compliance and health and safety practices of child care programs.

The Child and Family Services (CFS) policy Foster Care Eligibility Quality Assurance Reviews 447 -10-18 is under revision to accommodate the changes of eligibility unit implementation and how to apply review for high risk of agencies. The fiscal office compiles the county/zone risk assessment on a yearly basis. CFS sends NDDHS Fiscal the required information (results of Foster Care reviews, OCR reviews, etc). The request to take the resul ts of that combined risk assessment into account when selecting foster care reviews is embedded into the new draft policy. For example: If a zone is deemed high risk during the risk assessment and is not due for a file review, the high- risk knowledge will be considered in future sampling. It is imperative to mention that the North Dakota Department of Human Services, the North Dakota Association of Counties, and local human service zone leaders, with the support of Gov. Doug Burgum and state lawmakers continue to redesign social services. This collaborative effort began with the passage of Senate Bill 2206 in 2017, continued with the passage of Senate Bill 2124 in 2019 and is currently being heard as Senate Bill 2086 during the 2021 legislative assembly. D ue to redesign efforts, the Centralized Foster Care & Subsidized Adoption Eligibility Unit, absorbed as a function of Children and Family Services (CFS), went live February 1, 2021. The overall goals are to implement standardized procedures which offer con sistency and efficiencies for workers, providers, and families, while reducing financial errors and overpayments for the state. The unit will manage the oEligibility determinations for foster care cases, while authorizing eligible foster carepayments. oEligibility determinations for children seeking prevention services, also known as candidates for foster care. oSub-adopt negotiation process, while authorizing all eligible subsidy payments. oOpening and closing of ND Medicaid for all foster and sub-adopt cases. Effec tive, February 1, 2021 much of the review is about our own NDDHS employees and error rate with payments or eligibility determinations. However, we will be able to notify the Zones/agencies if they are not getting information to the unit timely resulting in fiscal error.

Status: This recommendation was partially implemented. The Program Integrity Unit has revised the language in the Audit Overview Oversight document to better reflect the new rehabilitation provider process. It is not a formal audit but rather an educational review process meant to assist the providers in billing correctly. The Progr am Integrity Unit has reassigned the layperson ambulance reviews to the Utilization Review team due to no longer having a layperson in the PIU. The PIU will pull the applicable claims data for the UR team to conduct the review. Prior to reassigning to the UR team, a temporary enrollment staff helped get the late ambulance claim reviews caught up. Requests for the sample of ambulance claims for 4th quarter 2020 went out and we are currently receiving responses and are current with the reviews. The semi -annual recipient analysis for first half of 2020 was completed in October of 2020. The second half of 2020 will be reviewed this month. Due to the declaration of the Public Health Emergency as of March 2020, State Medicaid Agencies were encouraged to halt auditing to allow healthcare facilities to focus on treating patients associated with the pandemic.

Methods should include addressing identified risks, ensuring each county is reviewed over a specified time, and determining sample size based on prior errors. Status: This recommendation was implemented. On the first working day of each month, ITD generates a data extract containing child care subsidy payments for the three months prior. Using an analytics software, ITD generates a random sample by dividing the number of cases listed in the monthly sampling frame by the number of cases to be selected for the sample. Prior to the end of the federal fiscal year, AQ staff review sampled cases and creates a listing of the 53 counties in ND not yet represented in any of the monthly samples. Utilizing the entire universe created for the fiscal year, cases from the missing counties are selected for review using a simple random sample from the analytics software.

Status: This recommendation was implemented. The Department uses speed charts to determine coding for each expenditure. As of October 10 (this date is used so that payroll for September clears before the speed chart is changed) all speed charts are updated to the new grant coding. Any expenditures received related to the prior year are manually coded to the correct grant year. Both of these grants in question have a 90 day window to get expenditures paid after the grant closes. Correspondence was sent to all program accountants to ensure that the speed charts were updated in a timely manner.

Status: The recommendation was partially implemented. The State initiated a process redesign for early childhood licensing in August 2019. The redesign was intended to improve consistency of reviews, ongoing monitoring, and corrective action across all 19 Human Service Zones. The bulk of the redesign work took place in advance of the former county - employed early childhood licensors becoming state employees (January 2020). As part of Redesign, DHS piloted the use of a streamlined on- site visit checklist to ident ify opportunities for efficiencies. Thirteen counties utilized the abbreviated form during pilot, the remaining counties continued to utilize the existing form. It was determined that the abbreviated form would not adequately capture information needed so, in June 2020 all licensors reverted to utilization of the full- length Compliance Checklist to assure all Health and Safety standards are being met. In September 2020 DHS began the work of implementing a comprehensive Early Childhood Licensing database that will greatly improve the ability to properly license providers. The system is anticipated to be complete by March 2022.

Status: The recommendation was partially implemented. The Lead Agency receives a monthly report that contains payments that could be considered duplicate that were made for three months prior to the current month. The report contains payments that meet the following criteria: -Sam e child -Same caretaker -Sam e provider -Sam e service month Depart ment staff reviews identified payments on this report and maintains a log and notes on each situation and any follow up that was completed with Eligibility workers. The consol idated eligibility system, SPACES, where payments are issued, does have checks validations in place to ensure payments to no exceed the state maximum rate. An additional warning message is in place and is received when a payment already exists for the child and provider for a service month and a new payment with the same criteria is entered. Workers are able to by -pass this warning message as there are instances where a second payment may be needed. The department will explore a system enhancement to make this warning message more prominent in an effort to reduce duplicate payment situations.

Devel op and implement controls to ensure that all eligibility workers are collecting and maintaining all applicable information for Child Care Assistance eligibility determinations, and; 2. Prope rly determine eligibility for individuals receiving Child Care Assistance and issue payments that comply with requirements set in the Code of Federal Regulations for Child Care Development Funds. Status: This recommendation was partially implemented. DHS provides policy and system trainings, tips and tricks and policy and processing reminders as needed through periodic statewide trainings, monthly newsletters and online help resources. This effort is done in collaboration with the Policy and System Support (PaSS) unit in Economic Assistance. The PaSS unit will begin conducting CCAP New Worker Training annually beginning the winter of 2022. The training will cover all aspects of CCAP eligibility. In Mar ch 2019, the department implemented a new eligibility system, SPACES. The implementation of this new system has made processing of cases less error prone as the system calculates all aspects of CCAP eligibility such as countable income amounts, countable hous eholds members, allowable child care hours, etc. The department is continually making improvements to the system through change requests. Quali ty Assurance reviews are completed monthly and the results of those reviews are used to determine training needs, corrective active, etc. to mitigate errors.

Status: This recommendation was not implemented. During the audit timeframe, County Licensors were inconsistent in how they followed up on corrective orders. As part of Early Childhood Services Redesign (completed by March 2020), all Licensing Specialists are assigned a specific provider case load, which will help Licensing Specialists keep track of any correction orders and follow -up expectations that affect providers they are assigned to work with.

In addition, we recommend the Department develop procedures for monitoring the timely and proper determination of fraudulent activity. Status: This recommendation was implemented. The Department continues to use the Department's Fraud Log to track reports that are received by the state office. When these reports are received, state policy staff review the information and forward the information on to the appropriate county as necessary. The Department has reached out to their federal technical assistance partner, the National Center on Subsidy Innovation and Accountability (NCSIA), for assistance in strengthening and implementing procedures. After NCSIA reviews the Department's Intentional Program Violation (IPV) e- learning, they will provide feedback and suggestions of various types of red flag reports implemented by other states that help to identify potential instances of fraud. The Department continues to utilize existing reports, such as a duplicate payment report and a duplicate SSN report. The Department implemented a new integrated eligibility system in March 2019. With the implementation, eligibility information and verifications are shared across multiple programs in one system. This will further help to ensure that reported information is being evaluated for CCAP when the information is reported for a different program .

Status: This recommendation was implemented. Child Care Assistance policy staff are included on all case finding emails that Quality Assurance/Control sends to counties. Additionally, policy staff receive a copy of the case findings review report used by Quality Assurance/Control. Policy then reviews the report and will follow up with counties when a corrective action, such as establishing a claim, is appropriate. Review of this report began in September 2018 for the review month of July 2018.

Status: This recommendation was partially implemented. During the audit timeframe County Licensors were inconsistent in rates of completion for unannounced visits. This was due, in part, to the difference in how each County chose to administer and staff this function; licensors were not cons istently required to maintain certain caseloads which contributed to uneven application of this part of the regulation. A ma jor focus of the redesign effort was to ensure that the system was structured to ensure early childhood specialists time was organized to maximize time spent on visits. As part of redesign all Licensing Specialists are assigned a specific case load so they can schedule and follow through with unannounced visits for their assigned providers. This new distribution of work accompanied the transition from county to state employment (Jan 2020) and was being implemented by mid- 2020. Earl y Childhood Services is currently in the process of designing a database to ensure all required documents and licensing visits are complete prior to issuing licenses and certificates to providers. The data base will be complete in April of 2022.

Status: This recommendation was partially implemented. Early Childhood Services Redesign moved all County Licensors to State employment (Jan 2020) and Early Childhood Services Regional Representatives to a Supervisor status (March 2020). These steps will change how a QA visit is completed. Starting in March 2020, regional supervisors were beginning to conduct both standard performance reviews of licensors as well as quality assurance review of outputs and outcomes. This includes review of how licensors conduct visits and complete their core work related to license compliance and health and safety practices of child care programs.

Status: This recommendation was implemented. The Child Care Assistance Administrat or receives a monthly report of potential duplicate payments made for three months prior to the current month. The report contains payments that meet the following criteria: Same child Same caretaker Same provider Same service month Chil d Care Assistance staff review all payments on this report and maint ains a log of notes on each situation and any follow up that was compl eted with Eligibility workers. In many instances, the second payment to a child in the same case was due to an underpayment being issued. Underpay ments are issued when it was determined that the family was entit led to more assistance then was first determined. Chil d Care Assistance Policy does allow a child to be in two separate cases at the same time d ue to joint custody arrangements. The system notifies a work er when they have entered a child with the same SSN or identifying number in a case when the child is already known to another case. Howev er, due to the allowance of a child in two cases, the workers can bypass the edit. The edit serves as a notification to workers to verify that joint custody is appropriate in the case and to alert them to instances of a duplic ate child when they may not have been aware. Chil d Care Assistance applies a state maximum rate per child, per provider in each case a child is receiving assistance. The state maximum rate is based on t he determined level of care, age of child and provider type.

Status: This recommendation was implemented. The Department returned the overpayment of federal funds. As soon as the Department discovered the overpayment, additional controls were implemented to ensure monthly maintenance payments are proper. The controls put into place are a secondary review of all new subsidy payments entered, a secondary review of all changes to monthly subsidy amounts, and a scan of each months' payment report for outlier payment amounts.

Status: This recommendation was implemented. Except for DHS 2019 and 2020 LIHEAP State Plans, all previous state plans contained language that stated: \"LIHEAP funded services would be available ... until the obligated funds have been expended.\" Section O(1), 2018 State Plan. This language was in violation of 31 USC \u00a7 1552 (a) which states that all fixed appropriation accounts end on September 30th of the 5th fiscal year after the period of availability for obligation of the funds ends. However, this language was not in violation of state law, as state law clearly establishes that expenditures of federal funds must comply with al l mandatory federal laws. NDAC \u00a7 4-12-01-05. and under Section 2605(d) of P.L.97- 35 states are required to expend funds in accordance with their state plan. Prior to 2019, DHS was expending funds according to the state plan as written. Once it was discovered that the state plan was in error, the default would be federal law 31 USC \u00a7 1552(a) to establish the length of time for expenditure of obligated funds. This default determination by DHS is authorized under NDAC \u00a7 4- 12-01-05(2), as state agencies are permitted to comply with the terms and conditions of federal grants, and 31 USC \u00a7 1552(a) is a general term applicable to all federal grants unless otherwise indicated. This determination is also allowed under state law, as OMB is allowed to determine the terms of contracts and nothing in state law prohibits DHS from following all applicable federals to the grant funds.

Status: This recommendation was implemented. The Department has adopted TANF rules in determining administrative costs and has applied these rules to contracts with the ND Department of Commerce, Division of Community Services. 45 CFR 263.0 (b)(1) excludes from administration costs the direct costs of providing program services, whether by the state or contracts devoted entirely to such activities. It also excludes salaries and benefit costs for staff providing program services and direct administrative costs associated with providing the services such as the costs for supplies, equipment, travel, postage, rental and maintenance of office space. The Department's contract with DCS requires the grantee (DCS) to provide weatherization services to Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program eligible households. The costs associated with this contract are solely for providing a weatherization program in the state ad absent such costs a program of this nature would not exist. General Administration of this contract and program is performed in the state offices and any costs incurred by the state for this purpose are tracked and reported toward the 10% allowable funds for administration.

Status: This recommendation was partially implemented. The Foster Care program was the only program with outstanding issues. The Child and Family Services (CFS) policy Foster Care Eligibility Quality Assurance Reviews 447-10-18 is under revision to accommodate the changes of eligibility unit implem entation and how to apply review for high risk of agencies. The fis cal office compiles the county/zone risk assessment on a yearly basis. CFS sends NDDHS Fiscal the required information (results of Foster Care reviews, OCR reviews, etc). The request to take the results of that combined risk assessment into account when selecting foster care reviews is embedded into the new draft policy. For example: If a zone is deemed high risk during the risk assessment and is not due for a file review, the high- risk knowledge will be considered in future sampling. It is imperative to mention that the North Dakota Department of Human Services, the North Dakota Association of Counties, and local human service zone leaders, with the support of Gov. Doug Burgum and st ate lawmakers continue to redesign social services. This collaborative effort began with the passage of Senate Bill 2206 in 2017, continued with the passage of Senate Bill 2124 in 2019 and is currently being heard as Senate Bill 2086 during the 2021 legislative assembly. Due to redesign efforts, the Centralized Foster Care & Subsidized Adoption Eligibility Unit, absorbed as a function of Children and Family Services (CFS), went live February 1, 2021. The overall goals are to implement standardized procedures which offer consistency and efficiencies for workers, providers, and families, while STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 By State Agency G - 34 reducing financial errors and overpayments for the state.

Effective, February 1, 2021 much of the review is about our own NDDHS employees and error rate with payments or eligibility determinations. However, we will be able to notify the Zones/agencies if they are not getting information to the unit timely resulting in fiscal error.

This report has been prepared by the Office of Management and Budget. The financial statements contained in the CAFR have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to state and local governments, as promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Responsibility for both the accuracy of the data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with the state's management. To the best of our knowledge and belief, the information contained in the CAFR is accurate in all material respects and reported in a manner that presents fairly the financial position and results of operations of the State's primary government and the component units for which it is financially accountable. All disclosures necessary to enable the reader to gain an understanding of the State of North Dakota's financial affairs have been included. The state's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the government are protected from loss, theft or misuse and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. In compliance with state statute, the Office of the State Auditor (SAO) audited the State's financial statements. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of the State for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Their examination was conducted in accordance with GAAP and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards as published by the Comptroller General of the United States. The SAO concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that the State's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent auditor's report is presented as the first component of the financial section of this report The State of North Dakota is also required to undergo a single audit in conformity with the provision of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and the Uniform Administra tive Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (contained in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200). Information related to this single audit, including a schedule of expenditures of federal awards, the independent auditor's reports on internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and a schedule of findings and questioned costs, are included in a separately issued biennial single audit report. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) immediately follows the Independent Auditor's Report and provides a narrative introduction, overview and analysis of the basic financial statements. This letter of transmittal is intended to complement MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. 7PROFI LE OF THE GOVERNMENT The State of North Dakota provides for a full range of services, including education, health and social services, highway maintenance and construction, law enforcement, judicial, public safety, business regulation, community and economic development, and natural resource development. The State's reporting entity reflected in the CAFR includes all the funds of the state as legally defined, as well as all of its component units in conformity with the requirements of GASB Statement No. 61. Statement No. 61 provides that the financial statements should emphasize the primary government and permit financial statement users to distinguish between the primary government and its component units. Consequently, the transmittal letter, MD&A, and the financial statements focus on the primary government and its activities. Although information pertaining to the discretely presented component units is provided, their separately issued financial statements should be read to obtain a complete overview of their financial position. The State's reporting entity is described more fully in Note 1A to the basic financial statements. The State operates through a biennial appropriation, which represents agency appropriations recommended by the governor and presented to the Legislative Assembly at the beginning of each legislative session. The budget is legally required to be adopted through passage of appropriation bills by the Legislative Assembly and signed by the governor. The governor has line item veto powers over all appropriations subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the app ropriation bill becomes the departments' financial plan for the next two years. Changes to the appropriation are limited to Emergency Commission authorization, initiative, allotment, or referendum action. The State does not budget by fund nor does it formally budget revenues. The legal level of budgetary control is at the agency, appropriation authority and expenditure line item level. The State's budgetary policies and procedures are further explained in Note 1D on the notes to the basic financial statements. LOCAL ECONOMY Although North Dakota's economy is increasingly diversified, the agricultural industry continues to play a key role in the state's economy. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service reports that for 2018 crop production, North Dakota is the nation's leading producer of durum wheat, spring wheat, canola, flaxseed, oats, dry edible beans and peas, navy beans, pinto beans and honey. North Dakota also ranked second in the production of black beans, lentils, and sunflowers. The energy industry plays an important role in the state's economy. The development of wind and coal resources, the production of ethanol and bio-diesel, and oil and natural gas extraction all contribute to the state's economy. North Dakota reached an all-time high for oil production which averaged over 1.48 million barrels of oil produced per day in August 2019. North Dakota's current crude oil production ranks second in the nation, behind first-ranked Texas. Oil prices have rebounded significantly from the 2016 lows when North Dakota producers were receiving prices below $25 per barrel. Prices have averaged around $50 per barrel at the start of the 2019-21 biennium. In September 2019, the actual average price per barrel for North Dakota oil was $50.25, slightly over the estimated price of $48.50 used for budgeting purposes. The long-term outlook remains strong for oil globally as well as here in North Dakota. According to the United States Census Bureau, the state's estimated population for 2018 was approximately 760,000 people, which is an all-time high. Health care and social assistance jobs account for nearly 21% of the employment in the state. Other leading areas of employment are retail trade, educational services, construction and manufacturing. The unemployment rate for the state in October 2019 was 2.5%, compared to 3.6% for the United States. A listing of the state's 20 largest employers demonstrates the diversity of the economy. Top employers include: the U.S. military, the state university system, health care providers, manufacturers, financial and insurance companies, information technology companies, energy producers, and retail companies. 8Despite uncer tainty within international markets, North Dakota achieved positive export growth in 2018. The United States Census Bureau showed that North Dakota's exports were up overall by $1 billion for a total of $6.8 billion in 2018. This represents an increase of 16.2% over 2017. LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING The long- term financial plan for the state of North Dakota was outlined by Governor Burgum as part of the 2019- 21 executive budget address, presented to the legislature in December 2018. The Governor's long-term financial plan includes the following key components: x Balancing ongoing revenues and expenses of state government x Rebuilding reserves. x Ensuring solvency for the state pension fund. North Dakota is required by its Constitution to have a balanced budget. However, ongoing revenues and ongoing expenses have not always been in balance. In those instances where ongoing revenues did not meet the obligations of ongoing expenses of state government, one-time transfers from accumulated reserves and fund balances were used to fill the gap. In nearly all cases, those accumulated reserves and fund balances were directly attributable to oil and natural gas extraction and production tax revenue. In the 2019-21 biennium executive budget, the governor laid out a financial plan that not only balanced ongoing revenues and expenses but did so by adding transparency to the use of oil tax revenue. In the executive budget, the state general fund allocation of oil and gas taxes increased from $400 million to $1 billion per biennium, but no additional transfers from accumulated fund balances were proposed. Both the 2013-15 and 2015-17 biennium budgets included general fund revenues and transfers in excess of $1 billion that were directly funded from oil and gas tax revenue. The legislature did not approve the proposed transfer of $1 billion per biennium from oil tax revenues to the general fund, opting to continue it at the level of $400 million per biennium. The legislature instead chose to balance the general fund budget with transfers from accumulated oil tax revenues. Although this approach provides less transparency and obscures the state's ongoing revenue and expense structure, it ensures overall revenue sources are adequate to fund ongoing government expenses. It provides a conservative approach to funding the budget as the accumulated balances transferred to the general fund are balances on hand at the start of the biennium and not dependent on forecasted tax revenues. The state's rainy-day fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, was nearly depleted during the 2015-17 biennium economic downturn. The 2019-21 executive budget proposed to fully replenish this fund to its maximum balance allowed by law, which is 15% of general fund appropriations. This included a proposed transfer of over $300 million from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. A critical component of ensuring the long-term financial well-being of the state of North Dakota is a well-funded Budget Stabilization Fund that provides a necessary buffer against volatile commodity prices that drive ups and downs in the state's economy. The legislature did not approve the transfer of $300 million to the Budget Stabilization Fund. However, the revenue forecast adopted by the legislature proved so conservative that actual revenues ended the biennium $250 million higher than predicted. North Dakota law requires any end of biennium balance in the general fund in excess of $65 million to be transferred to the Budget Stabilization Fund. As a result, $548 million was transferred to the Budget Stabilization Fund, pushing the balance above $660 million. It is expected to reach its $726 million cap by the end of the 2019-21 biennium. Another component of the state's long-term financial plan is ensuring the solvency of the state's pension fund. The governor proposed restoring solvency to the fund through a combination of policy proposals that reformed the benefit and funding structure, along with a one-time cash infusion into the fund. The proposed one-time cash infusion was a transfer of $265 million at the beginning of the 2019-21 biennium from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund to the Public Employees Retirement Fund. 9Althoug h the legislature did not approve the proposed cash infusion of $265 million, the legislature did adopt separate proposals that reformed the benefit structure and had a positive impact on the long-term actuarial projections for the fund. The backbone of the state's financial plan is a revenue forecasting process that is accurate, conservative, and credible. The state utilizes a Revenue Forecasting Advisory Committee, comprised of representatives of the major industries in the state and the legislative and executive branches of government, along with the expertise of a national economic forecasting consultant. With the assistance of these experts, the state's Tax Department and Office of Management and Budget develop a conservative revenue forecast for use in the budgeting process. The budgeting process begins with the development of a biennial budget proposal reflecting the Governor's priorities for the next two years. The budget is submitted to the legislature for their consideration and eventual enactment. With a biennial budget cycle, each revenue forecast and budget proposal provides a three-year plan for the revenues and expenditures of state government. RELEVANT FINANCIAL POLICIES North Dakota's financial policies ensure that in the event of an economic downturn, North Dakota state government will be able to continue to provide its citizens with necessary services. Should North Dakota experience a significant revenue shortfall, the state is able to access funds in the budget stabilization fund. The statutory maximum balance for the budget stabilization fund is 15.0 percent of the state general fund budget. North Dakota experienced a significant revenue shortfall during the 2015-17 biennium due to decreases in oil and agriculture prices, resulting in a transfer of nearly the entire balance of the budget stabilization fund to the general fund prior to June 30, 2017. The 2017 legislature established an ongoing allocation of $75 million per biennium from oil and gas tax revenues to the budget stabilization fund. North Dakota Century Code requires the transfer to the budget stabilizat ion fund of any end-of-b iennium general fund balance in excess of $65 million. The 2017-19 biennium ended with revenues exceeding the forecast and resulted in the transfer of $548 million to the budget stabilization fund. The balance of the budget stabilization fund is estimated to be over $726 million by June 30, 2021 due to a combination of existing fund balance and additional oil tax revenue allocations. In addition to accessing the budget stabilization fund, in the event of an economic downturn the Governor can reduce general fund expenditure authority uniformly across state agencies through a process known as allotment. In the event of an allotment, the foundation aid stabilization fund was established to protect the state school aid program. Dolla rs from this fund would rep lace the amount of general fund dollars allotted, thus K-12 education would not experience a reduction in funding. The passage of Measure 2 in the 2016 general election allowed money in the fund to be appropriated for education-related purposes. Funding for the foundation aid stabilization fund comes from 10 percent of oil extraction tax collections. The foundation aid stabilization fund is expected to have a June 30, 2021 balance in excess of $443 million. MAJOR INITIATIVES Major initiatives proposed by Governor Doug Burgum and approved by the legislature for the 2017-19 biennium include: x Investing in infrastructure and in other priorities; x Continued funding of Medicaid expansion; x Investing in behavioral health issues; and x Transitioning the cost of county social services to the state. 10INFRASTRUC T URE INVESTMENTS The 2017-19 biennial budget includes funding to rebuild and repair roads throughout the state, for water supply and flood control, and grants for airports.

Please read it in conjunction with the transmittal letter at the front of this report and with the State's financial statements, which follow this section. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Government-wide: Total assets and deferred outflows of resources of the State exceeded its liabilities and deferred inflows of resources at fiscal year-end by $24.7 billion (reported as net position), an increase of $2.3 billion from the previous year. The net position of governmental activities increased by 11.4% while the net position of the business-type activities showed an increase of 5.2%. As a result of implementing GASB Statement 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions , the State recorded $27.5 million net pension asset, $380.3 million deferred outflows of resources, $887.5 million net pension liability, and $82.5 million deferred inflows of resources for the primary government. The State had a slight increase in net pension liability during the year of $24.6 million or 2.9%. Fund Level: As of the close of fiscal year 2019 the State's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $15.7 billion, an increase of $1.96 billion. Of this amount, $108.4 million is non-spendable, primarily for Permanent Trust Funds. Spendable fund balance consists of $6.5 billion restricted for specific purposes such as common schools, highway projects, and state education aid, $1.5 billion committed and $374.6 million assigned for specific functional expenditures such as education and health and human service operations, with the unassigned fund balance making up the remaining amount of $7.2 billion, which is primarily made up of the legacy fund with a balance of $6.2 billion. The enterprise funds reported net position at year-end of $4.1 billion, an increase of $201.8 million during the year. Long-term Debt : The State's total debt (bonds, certificates of participation, and notes payable) increased approximately 7.8% during the fiscal year to $2.8 billion, an increase of $200 million, which represents the net difference between new issuances and payments. During the year the State issued $389 million in bonds, $97 million in certificates of participation, and $6.4 billion in notes. More detailed information regarding these activities and funds is included in Note 3L. OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the State's basic financial statements, which consists of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements. Government-wide Statements The government-wide financial statements provide a broad view of the State's operations in a manner similar to a private-sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the State's financial position, which assists in assessing the State's economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These statements include all non-fiduciary assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources using the accrual basis of accounting. The current year's revenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or paid. 22The Statement of Net Position presents all of the State's assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as \"net position\". Over time, increases and decreases in net position is an indicator of whether the State's financial position is improving or deteriorating. The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the State's net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying events giving rise to the change occur, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Therefore, revenues and expenses are reported in these statements for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). Both statements report three activities: Governmental Activities - The activities in this section are primarily supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenue. Most of the State's basic services, such as education, health and human services and transportation, are reported under this category. Business-type Activities - These functions are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user fees and charges to external users of goods and services. The Bank of North Dakota, Housing Finance Agency and the University System are examples of the State's business-type activities. Discretely Presented Component Units - These are operations for which the State has financial accountability but they have certain independent qualities as well. These entities operate similar to private- sector business and the business-type activities described above. The State has 5 discretely presented component units. Financial information for these entities is presented separately from the financial information presented for the primary government. The government-wide financial statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis. Fund Financial Statements A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that the State uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending for a particular purpose. The State, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance related legal requirements. The basic fund financial statements begin after the Component Unit FASB basis statements and provide more detail about the major individual funds. The State's funds are divided into three categories - governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary. It is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be interpreted differently. Governmental funds - Most of the State's basic services are reported in the governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, the governmental fund financial statements focus on the near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus on the balances left at year-end that are available for future spending. Such information may be useful in evaluating whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the State's programs. These funds are reported using modified accrual accounting, which measures cash and all other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash. Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government's near-term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds 23and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are presented on the page immediately following each governmental fund financial statement. Governmental funds include the General Fund, special revenue, debt service, and permanent funds. The State has several governmental funds, of which three (3) are considered major individual funds. These three are the General Fund, the Federal Fund, and the State Special Revenue Fund. Each of these major funds is presented in a separate column in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balance. The remaining governmental funds are combined in a single aggregated column on the basic fund statements. Individual fund data for each of these non-major governmental funds can be found in the other supplementary information section of this report. Proprietary funds - Services for which the State charges customers a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds. The state maintains two different types of proprietary funds, enterprise funds and internal service funds. Enterprise funds report activities that provide supplies and services to the general public. Internal service funds report activities that provide supplies and services for the State's other programs and activities. Like the government-wide statements, proprietary funds use the accrual basis of accounting. Although the basis of accounting is the same for the government-wide and proprietary fund statements, reconciliation between these statements is presented because of the allocation of internal service funds' net income. The State has four (4) major enterprise funds: The Bank of North Dakota, Housing Finance, University System, and Workforce Safety and Insurance. These four funds are each presented in separate columns on the basic proprietary fund financial statements. The remaining enterprise funds are combined in a single total column on these statements. Individual fund data for each of the non-major enterprise funds can be found in the other supplementary information section of this report. The State's internal service funds are reported as governmental activities on the government-wide statements, because the services they provide predominantly benefit governmental activities. The State's four (4) internal service funds are reported on the basic proprietary fund financial statements in a single combined column. Individual fund data for the internal service funds is provided in the form of combining statements found in the other supplementary information section of this report. Fiduciary funds - The State acts as a trustee, or fiduciary, for its employee pension plans. It is also responsible for other assets that, because of a trust arrangement, can be used only for the trust beneficiaries. The State's fiduciary activities are reported in separate Statements of Fiduciary Net Position and Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. These funds, which include pension (and other employee benefit) trust, investment trust, private-purpose trust, and agency funds, are reported using accrual accounting. The government-wide statements exclude fiduciary fund activities and balances because the State cannot use these assets to finance its operations. Notes to the Financial Statements The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and the fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found immediately following component units' financial statements. Required Supplementary Information The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information. This section includes a budgetary comparison schedule, which includes reconciliation between the statutory fund balances for budgetary purposes and the fund balances for the General Fund, the Federal Fund and the State Special Revenue Fund as presented in the governmental fund financial statements. In addition, the required supplementary information includes up to ten years of information on the State's pension and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans, including schedules on the employer proportionate share of the net pension liability and net OPEB liability, changes in the net pension liability and OPEB liability, and employer contributions. 24Other Supplementary Information Other supplementary information includes combining financial statements for non-major governmental, non-major enterprise, internal service, and fiduciary funds. These funds are added together, by fund type, and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE As noted previously, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government's financial position. The State's combined net position (governmental and business-type activities) totaled $24.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. Net position increased $2.3 billion from the prior fiscal year. State of North Dakota's Net Position (Expressed in Thousands) Governmental Bu siness-Type Total Primary Acti vities Activities Government 2019 201 8 2019 2018 2019 2018 Current and Other Assets $16,972,671 of the State's net position is unrestricted net position. Unrestricted net position may be used at the State's discretion, but often have limitations on use based on State statutes. Restricted net position makes up thirty-one percent (31%) of the state's net position. Restricted net position represents resources that are subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on how they can be used. Twenty-six percent (26%) of the State's net position reflects its investment in capital assets such as land, buildings, equipment, intangibles (software), and infrastructure (roads, bridges and other immovable assets) less any related debt outstanding that was needed to acquire or construct the assets. The State uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the State's investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. The condensed financial information below was derived from the government-wide Statement of Activities and reflects how the State's net position changed during the fiscal year: 25Stat e of North Dakota's Changes in Net Position (Expressed in Thousands) Gov ernmental Business-Type Total Primary Activ ities Activities Government 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues: Program Revenues: Charges for Services 378,032 1,435,130 1,326,249 1,435,130 1,326,249 and Coal 2,196,877 - 2,196,877 Other 1,238,989 Regulatory 61,213 Corrections - - Agriculture and 444,530 444,530 Term Debt 1,952 2,503 - - 1,952 2,503 Bank of North Dakota - - 98,931 Housing Finance - - - - - - 1,198,989 and Insurance Increase (decrease) in & Transfers 2,381,604 1,928,700 (74,934) (104,261) 2,306,670 1,824,439 * More detailed information regarding the prior period adjustments can be found in Note 2. 26Govern mental Activities Governmental Activities increased the State's net position by $2.1 billion. Revenues increased 9.4%, with the largest dollar increase in the State's revenues for fiscal year 2019 coming from oil, gas, and coal, taxes, an increase of $390 million. The increase in sales and use tax is due to growth in taxable sales and purchases as a result of a strong economy and the taxation of internet sales as a result of the US Supreme Court decision. Corporation and Individual Income Tax both increased showing growth in the economy, growth in oil activity, and increased wages and salaries. Oil and Gas production tax and Oil Extraction tax increased due to strong oil prices leading to production growth. Expenses for governmental activities remained relatively consistent.

Workforce Safety and Insurance's (WSI) net position increased $89.4 million. Policyholder count increased by 319 policies in fiscal year 2019. WSI's financial position remains stable. Earned premium net of discounts and reinsurance totaled $238 million, $232 million, and $233 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. WSI re-entered the Securities Lending arena in fiscal year 2016. Total income for fiscal year 2019 was $145 thousand, compared to fiscal year 2018 which had earnings of $200 thousand with related expense of $40 thousand. Total claims filed for fiscal year 2019 totaled 19,913. This is an increase of 83 from previous fiscal year 2018 total of 19,830. A strong investment return in the past three years has contributed to the positive change in net position. The Bank of North Dakota net position increased $27.6 million. The loan portfolio decreased by $332,000 to $4.5 million at December 31, 2018. Total assets increased by .2% to $7 million. The increase was largely attributable to investment purchases offset by the sale of federal student loan portfolio. Interest-bearing deposits totaled $4.2 billion at December 31, 2018 compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2017. This fluctuation is due to state deposits and the economic status of the state. The Bank has a tier one capital leverage ratio of 12.48% as of December 31, 2018. The leverage ratio is a measure of strength. Well capitalized per federal regulations requires this percentage to be a minimum of 5%. The University System's net position increased $8.5 million. Net position increased due to a 3% increase in grants and contracts and a 7% increase in total assets. Increases in non-current assets was due primarily to an increase of $45.1 million in other long-term investments as well as an increase of $37.8 million in restricted cash which represents unspent certificate of participation proceeds for the new steam plant and infrastructure improvements at UND. Housing Finance net position increase of $12.1 million as a result of the year's program operations and financing activities. Included in this number is an increase in the prior year's net position of $4.1 million due to a prior period adjustment with regards to implementing the effective interest method in amortizing bond premium.

Of the $15.7 billion in net position, $108 million is non- spendable, $6.5 billion is restricted, $1.5 billion is committed, $375 million is assigned, and $7.2 billion is unassigned. These fund balance categories are a result of GASB Statement 54. Note 1U provides definitions for these categories. The following analysis of funds provides the explanation for the overall change in net position for governmental funds. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance of the General Fund was $7.2 billion, non-spendable was $6.6 million, $279 thousand was restricted, and $348 million was committed for expenditure by various governmental functions. Total General Fund balance increased during the fiscal year by $917 million. Revenues decreased approximately 7.6%, largely due to a decrease in oil, gas, and coal taxes of $477 million. Increases of revenue were individual and corporate income tax of $135 million and sales and use tax of $121 million. As there was a slight decrease in the general fund revenues, revenues for the overall state had increased and was previously explained with the increase in net position for governmental activities. General fund expenditures remained relatively consistent with a slight overall decrease of $2 million. The State Special Revenue ending fund balance increased by $1 billion resulting in $8.1 billion fund balance. Revenues increased by 38.5% in the state special revenue fund primarily due to an increase in oil, gas, and coal taxes due to strong oil prices leading to production growth as previously discussed. Special fund expenditures increased by 6.4% primarily due to an increase in Health and Human Services spending, as they received additional funding for Medicaid expansion in their special fund. The June 30 Federal Fund balance of $10.7 million consists primarily of non-spendable items such as prepaids and inventory and unavailable revenue for those revenues to be received later than the time period used for revenue recognition. Expenditures and revenues in the federal fund remained relatively consistent from prior years with an increase of 5% in expenditures and a 3% increase in revenues with no significant changes in FY19 from prior year. The federal fund balance decreased by $5.5 million due to a larger increase in federal fund expenditures than revenues. Proprietary Funds The State's proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. The increases in the net position of the proprietary funds are discussed under \"Business-type Activities\" above. General Fund Budgetary Highlights: The State has a biennial appropriated budget. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, was the second year of the 2017-19 budget cycle. The original budget increased $205.4 million. The increases to the beginning appropriated budget are from authorized carryover of general fund appropriation authority and legislative changes of which the larger ones are noted below. At the beginning of the 2017-19 budget cycle, there was an increase in the original budget of $79.9 million due to the authorized carryover of general fund appropriation authority from the 2015-17 biennium, a $7.2 million increase for capital construction carryover, and a $11.4 million increase for Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library carryover. Several state agencies were authorized by appropriation laws to carryover a portion or all of their general fund appropriation for various purposes, including the University System, $21 million, the Department of 29Transportation, $25 million, the Industrial Commission, $2.4 million, the Department of Human Services, $11.7 million, Legislative Council, $4.6 million, the Department of Commerce, $2.9 million, the Adjutant General, $2 million and Office of Management & Budget, $3.7 million. Of the $7.2 million in capital construction carryover dollars, $1.3 million was for the Attorney General; $2.2 million was for the Secretary of State; $3.7 million was for the Parks and Recreation and various smaller amounts for several other state agencies. During the 2019 Legislative Session the legislature increased budgets by $19.2 million in several agencies for different reasons. The Governor's office received an increase in general fund budget of $15 million to deposit into a fund to establish funding for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum. Other increases were $1 million for the Bank of North Dakota for Loan interest payments in relation to protest costs and the Tax Department of $1.3 million for the Homestead tax and disabled veterans credit. Also, during the Legislative Session and increase of $52.6 million was for several Universities with the largest being for North Dakota State University of $28 million, University of North Dakota for $9 million, Bismarck State College of $8.9 million for different capital projects at each university. Other items appropriated during the 2019 legislative session was $13 million for the Department of Transportation for the purpose of road maintenance and $28 million for the Department of Commerce to defray the expenses relating to the beyond visual line of sight unmanned aircraft system program. There were no expenditures in excess of general fund authority. The difference between the final amended budget and actual spending was $51.9 million below final budgeted estimates. CAPITAL ASSETS AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION Capital Assets: At the end of the fiscal year 2019, the State had invested $6.4 billion, net of accumulated depre ciation, in a broad range of capital assets. Depreciation charges for this fiscal year totaled $226 million. (Net of Depreciation, Expressed in Thousands) Governmental Bu siness-Type Total Primary Activ ities Activities Government 2019 201 8* 2019 2018 2019 and Land Improvements $161,050 capital balances were adjusted for certain reclassifications. The t otal increase in the State's investments in capital assets for the current fiscal year was 4.8% in terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets were approximately $1.3 billion for the year. A major portion of this amount was used to construct or reconstruct assets for highway construction. More detailed information on the State's capital assets can be found in Note 3H to the financial statements. Long-term Debt: Article X, Section 13 of the Constitution of North Dakota provides that the state may issue or guarantee the payment of bonds provided that all bonds in excess of $2 million are: secured by first 30mortgage upon property and no further indebtedness may be incurred by the state unless evidenced by a bond issue; authorized by law, for a certain purpose; provisioned to pay the interest semiannually, and pay the principal within 30 years. The law authorized the bond issue must specifically appropriate the provisions to the payment of the principal and interest of the bond. The State has no general obligation bonds outstanding at June 30, 2019. The State does have a number of revenue bonds outstanding at June 30, 2019. Current state statutes empower certain state agencies and the Building Authority, a component unit of the State, to issue bonds as part of their activities. This debt is not backed by the full faith and credit of the State of North Dakota. The principal and interest on revenue bonds issued by state agencies is payable from designated revenue sources. The Building Authority's bonds generate revenue to finance the construction and improvements of State buildings. Revenues derived from leases on the buildings fund the debt service requirements. The Bank of North Dakota has advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank in the amounts of $1.1 billion. The advances have a fixed rate of interest, ranging from 1.61 percent to 5.56 percent. More detailed information regarding the State's long-term obligations is presented in Note 3L to the financial statements.

ECONOMIC CONDITION AND OUTLOOK Moody's Analytics recently completed an analysis of the North Dakota economy for its Pr\u00e9cis U.S. State October 2019 publication. The report depicts an economy in recovery, but at a slow pace due to low commodity prices and slow employment growth. North Dakota's outlook is linked tightly to two major industries, energy and agriculture. Oil production per rig has risen by more than 25 percent per rig in the last year. Additionally, overall production is at an all-time high averaging over 1.44 million barrels per day. This nation-leading gain has put the Bakken at the forefront among all shale oil plays for output per rig. The higher productivity will lift output and improve profits. The most recent average price per barrel of oil was at $50.25, which is slightly over the estimated price of $48.50 used for budgeting purposes. The trade war with China has had an adverse impact on commodity prices in North Dakota, but the cancellation of a round a of tariff hikes will lead to an increase in the purchase of farm commodities and will lift prices. North Dakota's job growth dropped slightly from the national level in year-to-date growth, but still grew by a modest 0.3%. Unemployment is still low in North Dakota with the jobless rate at a historic low of 2.4%. Although employment is declining slightly in the mining industry due to increased productivity, the 31construction and manufacturing industries continue to increase their hiring and goods employment is at a more than three year high. Median household income and per capita income for North Dakota are both ahead of the national average. For 2019, median household income in North Dakota was $66,605 compared to $63,179 for the U.S. Per capita income for 2019 was $55,452 for North Dakota, while $54,446 for the U.S. CONTACTING THE STATE'S OFFICE OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT This financial report is designed to provide our citizens, taxpayers, customers, investors, and creditors with a general overview of the State's finances and to demonstrate the State's accountability for the money it receives.

Thus, the change in net position differs from the change in fund balance by the book value of the assets sold. (410,695) Donations of capital assets increase net position in the statement of activities but do not appear in the governmental funds because they are not financial resources. 20,000 Some of the assets acquired this year were financed through capital leases.

The Office of Management and Budget has adopted the pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which is the nationally accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The more significant of the State's accounting policies are as follows: A. REPORTING ENTITY For financial reporting purposes, the State of North Dakota has included all funds, organizations, agencies, boards and commissions that make up its legal entity. The State has also included all potential component units for which it is financially accountable, and other organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship with the State are such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board has set forth criteria to be considered in determining financial accountability. These criteria include appointing a voting majority of an organization's governing body and (1) the ability of the State to impose its will on that organization or (2) the potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on the State. As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, these financial statements present the State of North Dakota (the primary government) and its component units. The component units are included in the State's reporting entity because of the significance of their operational or financial relationships with the State. BLENDED COMPONENT UNITS These component units are entities that are legally separate from the State, but are so intertwined with the State that they are, in substance, the same as the State. They are reported as part of the State and blended into the appropriate fund types. Building Authority (Debt Service Fund and Capital Projects Fund) - The Building Authority was created by the Legislature as a separate instrumentality of the State. Its purpose is to promote the general welfare of the citizens of the State by providing financing for use by the State in altering, repairing, maintaining or constructing buildings and making any improvements connected to State buildings. The Industrial Commission, which consists of the governor, the attorney general, and the commissioner of agriculture, is the governing board of the Building Authority. The funds of the Building Authority were audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. DISCRETELY PRESENTED COMPONENT UNITS These component units are entities that are legally separate from the State, but are financially accountable to the State. The component units' columns of government-wide financial statements include the financial data of these entities. MAJOR COMPONENT UNITS Comprehensive Health Association (Proprietary Fund Type) - The Association was established by the Legislature with participating membership consisting of those insurance companies, licensed or authorized to do business in the State. It provides low cost access to health insurance coverage for residents of the State who are denied adequate health insurance and are considered uninsurable. Under North Dakota Century Code, the Majority Leader of the Senate appoints one member of the Senate and the House of Representatives appoints one member of the House to the eight-member board. The Association was audited by other independent auditors for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation - The mission of the State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation is to provide fundraising and membership development activities to support the State Historical Society of North Dakota which preserves and promotes the heritage of North Dakota and its people. The Fund of the State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation were audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. 58STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Public Finance Authority (Proprietary Fund Type) - The Finance Authority was created by the Legislature as a separate agency of the State. The purpose of the Finance Authority is to make funds available for borrowing by North Dakota political subdivisions through the issuance of its bonds and the purchase of municipal securities of the political subdivisions. The Finance Authority has been granted all powers required in order to accomplish this purpose and is under the control and management of the Industrial Commission. The Fund was audited by other independent auditors for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. North Dakota Development Fund, Inc. (Proprietary Fund Type) - The Development Fund was established as a statewide nonprofit development corporation with the authority to take equity positions in; to provide loans to; or to use other innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for new or expanding businesses in North Dakota or relocating businesses to North Dakota. A board of directors consisting of eight members, all of whom are appointed by the governor, manages the corporation. The deputy director of the Department of Commerce (a State agency) is the corporation's chief executive officer. The director of the Department of Commerce (governor-appointed cabinet position) is responsible for developing rules, subject to the approval of the board of directors, necessary to implement the administration of the corporation. The Fund was audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. North Dakota State Fair Foundation - The mission of the North Dakota State Fair Foundation is to develop lifelong relationships with donors to secure philanthropic gifts that will enhance and support the work of the North Dakota State Fair. The Fund of the North Dakota State Fair Foundation were audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. Major and Non-major University System Foundations (Proprietary Fund Type) - The foundations are legally separate, tax-exempt organizations providing support and recognition to the respective colleges and universities through a variety of programs and activities. The foundations are normally managed by a board of directors made up primarily of alumni, friends or leading members of the communities. The component unit financial statements are presented under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards. As such, certain disclosures are not reflected for the Major University System Foundation in the major component unit disclosures and no disclosures are included for the Non-major University System Foundation. A complete set of financial statements can be obtained at the North Dakota University System office at 600 E. Boulevard Avenue, #10, Bismarck, ND 58505. Complete financial statements for each of the other individual component units may be obtained at the entity's administrative offices as follows: Building Authority Public Finance Authority 600 E.

AND FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Statement of Net Position and Statement of Activities report information on all non-fiduciary activities of the primary government and its component units. Primary government activities are distinguished between governmental and business-type activities. Governmental activities generally are financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other non-exchange revenues. Business-type activities are financed in whole or in part by fees charged to external parties for goods or services. The Statement of Net Position presents the reporting entity's non-fiduciary assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference reported as net position. Net position is reported in three categories: 59STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Net investment in capital assets consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by outstanding balances for bonds, notes, and other debt that are attributed to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. Restricted net position result when constraints placed on net position use are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, and the like, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. Net position restricted by enabling legislation are subject to change by a majority vote of the Legislative Assembly. Unrestricted net position consist of net position that do not meet the definition of the two preceding categories. Unrestricted net position often are designated, to indicate that management does not consider them to be available for general operations. Unrestricted net position often have constraints on resources which are imposed by management, but can be removed or modified. The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segment are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable within a specific function. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Taxes and other items not meeting the definition of program revenues are instead reported as general revenue. FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide statements. Major individual governmental funds and major individual proprietary funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements, with non-major funds being combined into a single column. C. MEASUREMENT FOCUS, BASIS OF ACCOUNTING, AND FIN ANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION MESUREMENT FOCUS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The government-wide statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary and fiduciary fund (agency funds are excluded as they have no measurement focus) financial statements. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of cash flows. The State follows the pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which is the nationally accepted standard-setting body for establishing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for governmental entities. Governmental fund statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as they become susceptible to accrual; generally when they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collected within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. The State considers tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal year end. Other revenues are considered to be available if received within one year after the fiscal year end. Major revenues that are determined to be susceptible to accrual include interest, federal grants-in-aid, and taxpayer-assessed taxes such as income, sales, corporate, excise, motor fuel taxes and unemployment compensation contributions. Revenues earned under the terms of reimbursement agreements with other governments or private sources are recorded at the time the related expenditures are made if other eligibility requirements have been met. Sales and use taxes are accrued based upon filings received and an estimate of filings due by June 30. Net income taxes from individuals and corporations are accrued based on current income earned by the taxpayer before June 30. Quarterly filings, withholding statements, and other historical data are used to estimate income. The revenue is accrued net of an allowance for uncollectible taxes. Unearned revenue is recorded for receivables that are measurable but not available at year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, expenditures related to debt service, compensated absences, and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due and payable. 60STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION The State reports the following major governmental funds: The General Fund is the principal operating fund of the State. The Federal Fund accounts for all the financial resources from the federal government. The State Special Revenue Fund accounts for activities from state sources, which are restricted legally or administratively for the particular costs of an agency or program. The State reports the following major enterprise funds: The Bank of North Dakota Fund finances economic development throughout the state, participates in loans with North Dakota financial institutions, and holds interest-bearing deposit accounts for state and political subdivisions of North Dakota. The Housing Finance Agency Fund is authorized to issue bonds to make loans to mortgage lenders for qualified residential mortgage loans and to make mortgage and construction loans for multi-family housing within the State of North Dakota. The University System Fund accounts for all financial transactions of the colleges and universities that compose the University System of North Dakota. The Workforce Safety & Insurance Fund is financed entirely by premiums assessed to the employers of North Dakota and provides no-fault medical and disability insurance to all North Dakota employees. Additionally, the State reports the following fund types: GOVERNMENTAL FUND TYPES General Fund accounts for all governmental financial resources, except for those required to be accounted for in other funds. Special Revenue Funds are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. Debt Service Funds are used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest. Capital Projects Funds are used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets. Capital project funds exclude those types of capital related outflows financed by proprietary funds or for assets that will be held in trust for individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Permanent Funds report resources that are legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that benefit the government or its citizenry, such as the common schools within the state. PROPRIETARY FUND TYPES Enterprise Funds account for those business-like State activities that provide goods/services to the public, financed primarily through user charges. They are also used to account for operations where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other purposes. The State's loan programs, Mill and Elevator, and Fair are reported in this type. Internal Service Funds account for the financing of goods and/or services provided by one department or agency to another department or agency of a government, or to other governments, on a cost-reimbursement basis. These goods and services include motor pool services; printing, reproduction and mailing services; information technology; and risk management services. In the government-wide statements, internal service funds are included with governmental activities. 61STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA FIDUCIARY FUND TYPES Pension and Other Employee Benefits Trust Funds account for resources that are required to be held in trust for the members and beneficiaries of the State's defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plan, deferred compensation plan, flexcomp plan, and other post-employment benefit plans. Investment Trust Funds account for the transactions, assets, liabilities, and fund equity of the external pool participants (City of Bismarck, City of Grand Forks, City of Grand Forks Park District, ND Association of Counties, City of Fargo Fargodome, North Dakota State Board of Medicine, Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Fund, Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center Endowment Fund and Retirement and Investment Office Investments). The State Investment Board (SIB) provides administrative services for the external pool participants. SIB issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to the Retirement and Investment Office, 3442 East Century Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota 58503. Investment Trust Funds are accounted for in essentially the same manner as Proprietary Funds. Private Purpose Trust Funds account for resources of all other trust arrangements in which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Examples include student donations, the State's college savings plan, and a remediation trust. Agency Funds account for assets held by the State as an agent for other governmental units, or other organizations, and do not involve measurement of results of operations. Examples of funds in this category include state agency funds for bonding, tax collection, child support disbursement, and funds held for others. D. GENERAL BUDGETARY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The State operates through a biennial appropriation that represents departmental appropriations recommended by the governor and presented to the Legislative Assembly at the beginning of each legislative session. The Legislative Assembly enacts the budgets of the various state departments through passage of specific appropriation bills. The governor has line item veto powers over all appropriations subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the appropriation bill becomes the departments' financial plan for the next two years. Changes to the appropriation are limited to Emergency Commission authorization, initiative, allotment, or referendum action. The Emergency Commission can authorize receipt of federal or other moneys not appropriated by the Assembly if the Assembly did not indicate intent to reject the money. The Emergency Commission may authorize pass-through federal funds from one state agency to another. The Emergency Commission may authorize the transfer of expenditure authority between appropriated line items. The Legislature has also passed appropriation laws that authorize directors of certain state agencies to transfer appropriation authority among the various divisions of their specific agency, subject to the Budget Section of the North Dakota Legislative Council's approval. Unexpended appropriations lapse at the end of each biennium, except certain capital expenditures covered under the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) section 54-44.1-11 and the University System's unexpended general fund appropriation authority. The State's biennial budget is prepared primarily on a cash basis. The State does not use encumbrance accounting. The legal level of budgetary control is at the agency, appropriation, funding source and expenditure line item level, with administrative controls established at lower levels of detail in certain instances. The State does not formally budget revenues, and it does not budget by fund. The State appropriation is defined through the use of specific expenditure line items. Capital appropriations are generally made at the agency and project level. North Dakota's Appropriation Act does not present budgets by GAAP fund. Instead, it authorizes General Fund appropriation authority by agency and Other Budgeted Income appropriation authority by agency. Other budgeted income includes all budgeted resources, other than the General Fund, and includes some governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary fund activities. During the 2017-2019 biennium, there were general, federal and other funds supplemental appropriations totaling $790,712,092. E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents for reporting purposes includes cash and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. This includes investments with original maturity of three months or less. Also cash, as reported, may be under the control of the State Treasurer or by other administrative bodies as determined by law. Cash and cash equivalents are presented on the fund balance sheets as \"Cash Deposits at the Bank of North Dakota\" and \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" to present the unique nature of the relationship between the Bank of North Dakota, an enterprise fund, and other state agencies. 62STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Cash Deposits at the Bank of North Dakota - State agency cash balances, as required by law, are pooled by the State Treasurer and deposited in the Bank of North Dakota, an enterprise fund. These cash balances, in addition to other agency cash deposited at the Bank of North Dakota, are included on the fund balance sheets as \"Cash Deposits at the Bank of North Dakota\". For purposes of the Government-wide Statement of Net Position, these amounts have been reclassified to internal balances. Cash and Cash Equivalents - All cash and cash equivalents, (other than cash deposits at the Bank of North Dakota), as permitted by the North Dakota Century Code, are included on the Government-wide Statement of Net Position as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\". The State had no cash overdrafts from pooled cash and investments at June 30, 2019. All interest revenue is allocated to the General Fund unless state law (as outlined in the North Dakota Century Code) requires allocations of interest to other funds. F. INVESTMENTS Investments are reported at fair value. Quoted market prices, when available, have been used to value investments. The fair value for securities that have no quoted market price represent estimated fair value. International securities are valued based upon quoted foreign market prices and translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at June 30. In general, corporate debt securities have been valued at quoted market prices or, if not available, values are basedon yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar instruments. The fair value of real estate investment securities, including timberland, is based on appraisals plus fiscal year-to-datecapital transactions. Publicly traded alternative investments are valued based on quoted market prices. When not readilyavailable, alternative investment securities are valued using current estimates of fair value from the investment manager. Such valuations consider variables such as financial performance of the issuer, comparison of comparable companies' earnings multiples, cash flow analysis, recent sales prices of investments, withdrawal restrictions, and other pertinentinformation. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation for these other alternative investments, the estimatedfair value may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed. The net change in fair value of investments consists of the realized gains or losses and the unrealized increase or decrease in fair value of investments during the year. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed based on the difference between the sales price and the original cost of the investment sold. Unrealized gains and losses are computed based on changes in the fair value of investments between years. Security transactions are currently accounted for on a trade date basis. Interest income is recorded when earned. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Purchases of other state funds' debt issues by the Bank of North Dakota have been recorded as normal business transactions if they are the result of arms-length transactions. Investments are presented on the fund balance sheets as \"Investments at the Bank of North Dakota\" and \"Investments\" to present the unique nature of the relationship between the Bank of North Dakota, an enterprise fund, and other state agencies. Investments at the Bank of North Dakota - State agency investments, primarily certificates of deposits of the Bank of North Dakota, are included on the fund balance sheets as \"Investments at the Bank of North Dakota.\" For purposes of the Government-wide Statement of Net Position, these amounts have been reclassified to internal balances. Investments - State agency investments invested at financial institutions other than the Bank of North Dakota are included on the Government-wide Statement of Net Position as \"Investments.\" Differences on the Fund Balance Sheets between the assets, \"Cash at the Bank of North Dakota\" and \"Investments at the Bank of North Dakota,\" and the liability, \"Deposits Held for Other Funds,\" is attributable to timing differences resulting from the Bank of North Dakota having a different fiscal year end than many of the other state agencies. 63STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA G. SECURITIES LENDING GASB Statement No. 28 \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Securities Lending Transactions,\" establishes accounting and financial reporting standards for securities lending transactions. The standard requires governmental entities to report securities lent as assets in their statements of net position. Cash received as collateral and investments made with that cash must also be reported as both an asset and a liability. The statement also requires the costs of the securities lending transactions to be reported as expenses separately from income received. In addition, the statement requires disclosures about the transactions and collateral related to them. The Agent lends securities of the type on loan at June 30, 2019, for collateral in the form of cash, U.S. government securities and irrevocable letters of credit. U.S. securities are loaned versus collateral valued at 102% of the market value of the securities plus accrued interest. Non-U.S. securities are loaned versus collateral valued at 105% of the market value of the securities plus accrued interest. Non-cash collateral cannot be pledged or sold unless the borrower defaults. All securities can be terminated on demand by either the lender or the borrower, although the average term of the loans State's loans was approximately 71 days as of June 30, 2019. Cash open collateral is invested in a short term investment pool, which had an interest sensitivity of 3 days as of this statement date. This pool is valued based on amortized cost. There were no violations of legal or contractual provisions, no borrower or lending agent default losses known to the securities lending agent. There are no dividends or coupon payments owing on the securities lent. Securities lending earnings are credited to participating clients on approximately the fifteenth day of the following month. Indemnification deals with the situation in which a client's securities are not returned due to the insolvency of a borrower and the Agent has failed to live up to its contractual responsibilities relating to the lending of those securities. The Agent' s responsibilities include performing appropriate borrower and collateral investment credit analyses, demanding adequate types and levels of collateral, and complying with applicable Department of Labor and Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council regulations concerning securities lending. For securities loaned at fiscal year end, the State has no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the State owes the borrowers exceeds the amounts the borrowers owe the State. H. INTERFUND ACTIVITY AND BALANCES INTERFUND ACTIVITY As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide statements. Exceptions to this rule are: 1) activities between funds reported as governmental activities and funds reported as business-type activities and 2) activities between funds that are reported in different functional categories in either the governmental or business-type activities column. Elimination of these activities would distort the direct costs and program revenues for the functions concerned. In the fund financial statements, transfers represent flows of assets (such as goods or cash) without equivalent flows of assets in return or a requirement for repayment. Residual transfer amounts exist in the Government-wide Statement of Activities due to different fiscal year ends of various agencies included in business-type activities. INTERFUND BALANCES Interfund receivables and payables have been eliminated from the Statement of Net Position, except for the residual amounts due between governmental and business-type activities. I. INVENTORIES AND PREPAID ITEMS Inventories of Governmental Funds are valued at cost and are recognized principally using the average cost method. Generally, the cost of Governmental Funds' inventories is recorded as an expenditure when consumed rather than when purchased. Inventories of Proprietary Funds consist primarily of grain inventories from the North Dakota Mill and Elevator Association. Grain inventories are valued at the June 30 Minneapolis grain market values less freight costs to Minneapolis. Flour, feed and resale inventories are valued at ingredient cost plus manufacturing costs incurred in their production. Proprietary Funds expense the cost of consumable supplies when used. 64STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Generally, inventories of University System Funds are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value. Cost is generally determined on the first in/first out, or moving weighted average method. Inventories consist of food, books, and other merchandise held for resale in auxiliaries and unrestricted physical plant supplies. Prepaid items reflect payments for costs applicable to future accounting periods. The cost of governmental prepaid items are recorded as expenditures when purchased. Other government fund inventories and prepaid items are reflected as a reservation of fund balance on the balance sheet. J. BOND PREMIUMS / DISCOUNTS In the governmental funds, bond discounts and premiums are treated as period costs in the year of issue. Bond discounts and premiums are shown as an \"other financing source (use)\" in the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund balance. In the proprietary funds, bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the term of the bonds using the effective interest method. The unamortized discount is shown on the statement of net position as a reduction of the bonds payable, and the amortization is included in the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund balance as interest expense. K. CAPITAL ASSETS Capital assets, which include land, buildings, equipment, intangibles (software, easements and other), construction in progress and infrastructure assets, are valued at historical cost or at estimated historical cost if actual historical cost is not available. Donated capital assets are valued at their acquisition value on the date of donation. Where necessary, estimates of original cost are derived by factoring price levels from the current period to the time of acquisition. Library books are not capitalized as capital assets except for the University System. All other capital assets with an original cost of $5,000 or more per unit and an estimated useful life in excess of one year are capitalized and reported in the applicable government or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Exceptions include: infrastructure reported by the Department of Transportation, the threshold is $100,000 and intangible assets such as easements, water rights, patents and trademarks, the threshold is $25,000. Capital asset costs include the purchase price or construction cost, plus the costs necessary to place the asset in its intended location and condition for use. In governmental activities, interest costs on self-constructed assets are not capitalized. In business-type activities, interest costs (if material) on self-constructed assets are also included in the cost . The amount of interest to be capitalized is calculated by offsetting interest expense incurred from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project with interest earned on invested proceeds over the same period. Capitalized interest is amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Normal maintenance and repair costs that do not materially add to the value or extend the life of the asset are not capitalized. Collections of works of art and historical treasures are not capitalized if the following three criteria are met: (1) Held for public exhibition, education, or research in furtherance of public service, rather than financial gain; (2) Protected, kept unencumbered, cared for, and preserved; (3) Subject to organizational policy that requires the proceeds from sales of collection items to be used to acquire other items for collections. The State's non-capitalized collections include the historical artifacts at the various state museums and historical sites, and monuments and other art throughout the capital grounds. Assets that do not meet all three criteria, or that were capitalized as of June 30, 1999, are capitalized and included in the government-wide financial statements. Infrastructure consists of major statewide public systems and items attached thereto such as freeways, freeway lighting systems, freeway drainage systems, freeway signs, bridges, bridge lighting systems, and sewer systems, including those infrastructure assets acquired prior to June 30, 1980. Infrastructure is reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. The Department of Transportation uses the first-in first-out method to remove the capitalized cost of a replaced road along with corresponding accumulated depreciation. Capital assets in Governmental Funds are recorded as expenditures in the funds used to acquire or construct them in the governmental fund financial statements. Capital assets, along with accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense, which includes amortization of intangible assets, are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. 65STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Land and construction in progress are not depreciated. With the exception of infrastructure reported by the Department of Transportation (which uses the composite method), other capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Assets Years Buildings 10-50 Infrastructure 10-50 Furniture, Automobiles, and Equipment 3-20Intangibles 3-99 L. DEF E RRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES Deferred outflow of resources represents a consumption of net position by the government that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then. Deferred outflows of resources are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns, or in the component units column on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. M. LEASE COMMITMENTS The State leases land, office facilities, office and computer equipment, and other assets. Leases are classified according to GASB 62. Many of these leases have fiscal funding clauses; however, these clauses have no effect on classifying these leases for accounting purposes. Leases which represent acquisitions are classified as capital leases, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in the financial statements at the inception of the lease. Other leases are classified as operating leases with the lease payments recorded as expenditures or expenses during the life of the lease. N. FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED Federal Funds Purchased represent federal funds borrowed by the Bank of North Dakota from member banks generally on an overnight basis at the federal funds rate. O. CLAIMS/JUDGMENTS PAYABLE Claims/Judgments Payable is primarily Workers Compensation Claims Incurred But Not Yet Reported (IBNR) by the claimants as well as claims related to various litigation matters. P. COMPENSA T ED ABSENCES ANNUAL LEAVE State employees accrue vested annual leave at a variable rate based on years of service. Teachers employed by the State do not receive annual leave. In general, accrued annual leave cannot exceed 30 days at each year end, as set by the agency. The amount of annual leave earned ranges between one and two days per month, and is fixed by the employing unit per section 54-06-14 of the NDCC. The governmental fund financial statements recognize annual leave when the liability is incurred and payable from available expendable resources. This normally occurs only if an employee has unused reimbursable leave still outstanding at the time of their termination. The government-wide financial statements present the cost of accumulated annual leave as a liability. Proprietary and Fiduciary Funds recognize the expense and accrued liability when the annual leave is earned. SICK LEAVE The North Dakota Century Code, section 54-06-14, states employees accrue sick leave at the rate of one to a maximum of one and one-half working days per month of employment without limitation on the amount that can be accumulated. Employees vest at ten years of creditable service, at which time the State is liable for ten percent of the employee's accumulated unused sick leave. The governmental fund financial statements recognize sick leave as it is incurred. The government-wide financial statements present the estimated cost of sick leave as a liability after an employee has been employed by the State for five consecutive years. Q. DEPOSITS The following two liability line items are presented in the Government-wide Statement of Net Position and/or fund financial statements: 66STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Deposits Held For Other Funds. \"Deposits Held for Other Funds\" are those deposits held by the Bank of North Dakota for other funds included in the reporting entity and shown on the fund financial statements. For purposes of the Government-wide Statement of Net Position, these amounts have been reclassified to internal balances. Other Deposits. \"Other Deposits\" are those deposits held by the Bank of North Dakota for non-reporting entity third parties. It also includes deposits held for students of the University System. Differences on the fund balance sheets between the liability \"Deposits Held for Other Funds\" and the assets \"Cash Deposits and Investments at the Bank of North Dakota\" are attributable to timing differences resulting from the Bank of North Dakota having a different accounting year end than many other state agencies. R. NET PENSION LIABLITY For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows related to pension, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the North Dakota Public Employee Retirement System (PERS), North Dakota Highway Patrolmen's Retirement System (NHPRS), Retirement Plan for the Employees of Job Service North Dakota (JSND) and North Dakota Teachers' Fund for Retirement (TFFR) and additions to / deductions from PERS, NDHPRS, JSND and TFFR's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported for PERS, NDHPRS, JSND and TFFR. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. The primary government's proportionate share of pension amounts were further reallocated to the propriety funds (business-type activities) based on the amount of employer contributions paid by each proprietary fund. Pension investments are reported at fair value. S. NET OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS LIABILITY For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System (NDPERS) and additions to/deductions from NDPERS' fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by NDPERS. For this purpose, benefit payments are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. Job Service North Dakota engaged an actuary to determine the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflow of resources related to OPEB and OPEB expense for its Met Life Insurance Benefit plan. T. DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES Deferred inflows of resources represent an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period, and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time. Deferred inflows of resources are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns or in the component units column on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. Deferred inflows of resources of governmental funds, proprietary fund, and discrete component units are reported in detail in their respective fund statements. U. NET POSITION/FUND BALANCE The difference between fund assets and liabilities is \"Net Position\" on the government-wide, proprietary, and fiduciary fund statements, and \"Fund Balance\" on governmental fund statements. CLASSIFICATIONS Fund balance classifications for governmental funds are reported in two general classifications, nonspendable and spendable. Nonspendable represents the portion of fund balance that is not in spendable form such as inventories and prepaids. Spendable fund balance is further categorized as restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. The restricted fund balance category includes amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by the State constitution and external parties, such as the federal government, or through enabling legislation. The committed fund balance classification includes amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making authority, the state's legislature, through legislation, that is not considered as enabling legislation, passed into law. 67STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Assigned fund balance classifications are used when the amounts are to be used for specific purposes but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. The assignment of fund balance is generally initiated by the executive branch and later appropriated by the Legislature for a specific purpose. In governmental funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance also represents the remaining amount that is not restricted or committed. Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the government's general fund and includes all spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications. In other funds, the unassigned classification would only be used to report a deficit balance resulting from overspending for specific purposes for which amounts had been restricted, committed, or assigned. The State generally segregates restricted, committed, and assigned resources by individual funds within the governmental funds. When resources meeting more than one of these classifications are comingled within an individual fund, the assumed order of spending is restricted first, committed second, assigned third, and finally, unassigned. BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) section 54-27.2-02 requires any amount in the state general fund in excess of sixty-five million dollars at the end of any biennium to be deposited in the Budget Stabilization Fund. Any interest or earnings of the fund must be deposited in the fund per NDCC section 54-27.2-01. However, any amounts provided by law for deposit in the fund and any interest or earning of the fund which would bring the balance in the fund to an amount greater than nine and half percent of the current biennial state general fund budget, as finally approved by the most recently adjourned special or regular session of the legislative assembly, may not be deposited or retained in the fund but must be deposited instead in the state general fund. NDCC section 54-27.2-03 states that if general fund revenue projections for the biennium will be at least two and one- half percent less than estimated by the most recently adjourned special or regular session of the legislative assembly, and if the governor orders a transfer, which must be reported to the budget section of the legislative management, the state treasurer shall transfer the appropriate funds from the budget stabilization fund to the state general fund to offset the decrease in general fund revenues. The amount transferred upon order of the governor may not exceed the difference between an amount two and on-half percent below the general fund revenue projections for the biennium. The Budget Stabilization Fund, fund balance at June 30, 2019 was $118,647,704. V. REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES/EXPENSES In the Government-wide Statement of Activities, revenues and expenses are segregated by activity (governmental or business-type), then further by function for governmental activities (e.g., general government, education, health and human services, etc.). Additionally, revenues are classified between program and general revenues. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants for goods or services, 2) operating grants and contributions, and 3) capital grants and contributions. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general revenues, rather than as program revenue. General revenues include all taxes and money from tobacco settlements. Certain indirect costs are included in the program expenses reported for individual functions. In the government-wide financial statements, revenues are reported by source and are further classified as either \"general purpose\" or \"restricted\". General purpose revenues are available to fund any activity accounted for in the fund. Restricted revenues are, either by State law or by outside restriction (e.g., federal grants), available only for specified purposes. When both general purpose and restricted funds are available for use, it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first. In the governmental fund financial statements, expenditures are reported by character: \"Current,\" \"Intergovernmental-revenue are sub-classified by function and are for items such as salaries, grants, supplies, and services. Capital outlay includes expenditures for real property or infrastructure (e.g., highways). Intergovernmental-revenue sharing accounts for the distribution of certain tax revenues that are shared with local units based upon constitutional and statutory requirements. Debt service includes both interest and principal outlays related to bonds and payments on capitalized leases. Revenues and expenses of proprietary funds are classified as operating or nonoperating and are sub classified by object (e.g., salaries, depreciation, and purchases for resale). Operating revenues consist of sales of goods and services, quasi-external operating transactions with other funds, grant revenues for specific activities that are considered to be operating activities of the grantor, receipts from other agencies for reimbursement of operating transactions, and other miscellaneous revenue that should be classified as operating. Grants that would qualify as an operating activity are those that do not subsidize an existing program, rather they finance a program the agency would otherwise not undertake. For certain loan and investment programs, revenue that would normally be classified as non-operating should be classified 68STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA as operating. Examples of this would include interest and investment income. All other revenues that do not meet the above criteria should be classified as non-operating. W. EST I MATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 2 - RESTATEMENTS The changes to beginning net position are summarized in the following table (expressed in thousands): Government-wide Gov't Activities Business-type Activities Internal Service Funds June 30, 2018, net position, as previously reported $ 18,516,218 $ 3,917,941 $ 103,786 Prior period adjustments: Correction of Errors (5,955) - 3,951 Change in Accounting Method: Housing Finance - 4,103 - June 30, 2018, net position, as restated $ 18,510,263 $ 3,922,044 $ 107,737 A. CORRE C TION OF ERRORS The beginning net position of the Government-wide governmental activities were restated due to an understatement of expenses of $3.431 million and an overstatement of construction in progress of $2.524 million in the prior year. The Internal Service funds were restated for an overstatement of expenses of $3.951 million in the prior year. B. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING METHOD In previous years, Housing Finance accounted for bond premiums and discounts under the straight-line method. In 2019, Housing Finance changed its method of accounting for bond premiums and discounts to the effective interest rate method. As a result of the differences in methods, a prior period adjustment of $4.103 million was recorded to the Business-type activities to decrease premiums on bond funds and increase net position as of July 1, 2018. NOTE 3 - DETAILED NOTES ON ACCOUNT BALANCES A. DEPO S ITS CUSTODIAL CREDIT RISK The State minimizes custodial credit risk by restrictions set forth in state statute. Custodial credit risk is risk associated with the failure of a depository financial institution. In the event of a depository financial institution's failure, the State would not be able to recover its deposits or collateralized securities that are in the possession of the outside parties. State law generally requires that all State funds be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota. NDCC 21-04-01 provides that public funds belonging to or in the custody of the State shall be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota. Also, NDCC 6-09-07 states, \"all state funds . . . must be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota\" or must be deposited in accordancewith constitutional and statutory provisions. The State does not have a formal policy that addresses custodial credit risk for deposits. At June 30, 2019, the bank balance of the primary government's deposits was $510,777,595. Of the bank amount, $195,278,000 was uncollateralized and uninsured. 69STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA There were significant concentrations of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits in the Bank of North Dakota and University System at June 30, 2019. Their uninsured and uncollateralized deposits totaled $195.3 million and $23 thousand, and their bank deposits totaled $196.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively. At June 30, 2019, the bank balance of the major component units' deposits was $96,472,725. Of the bank amount, $93,328,141 was uncollateralized and uninsured. The internal receivable amount in the governmental activities column in the Statement of Net Position includes Cash and Investments at the Bank of North Dakota for governmental activities. The internal payable amount in the business-type activities column includes deposits the Bank has for governmental activities. Because the Bank has a different fiscal year end, these internal balances do not equal. B. INVESTMENTS The investment policies of the State of North Dakota are governed by NDCC 6-09-07, 15-10-12, and 21-04-02, indicating that all public funds must be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota unless there are other constitutional or statutory provisions. If there are no statutory provisions and the funds are invested outside the Bank of North Dakota, the state agency must have the permission of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. Investments are generally managed by the State Investment Board, the North Dakota Department of Trust Lands, the Bank of North Dakota, and the North Dakota State Treasurer's Office. Management responsibilities and investment instruments as authorized by statute are as follows: 1. State Investment Board (SIB) - NDCC 21-10 designates the SIB with investment responsibilities for the Public Employees' Retirement System, Bonding Fund, Teachers' Fund for Retirement, Fire and Tornado Fund, Workforce Safety & Insurance Fund, and other specific funds. The Century Code states the SIB shall apply the prudent investor rule in investing funds under its supervision. The retirement funds belonging to the teachers' fund for retirement and the public employees' retirement system must be invested exclusively for the benefit of theirmembers and in accordance with the respective funds' investment goals and objectives. The State Investment Board's investment policy allows investment managers to use derivative securities to hedge or replicate underlying exposures but not for speculation. All derivatives are considered investment derivativeinvestments. The SIB had four types of derivative securities at June 30, 2019: futures, options, swaps and currencyforwards . 2. North Dakota Department of Trust Lands - The Century Code states that the Department of Trust Lands shall apply the prudent investor rule in investing its funds. The investment policies of the Board allow the use of derivativesecurities to hedge or replicate underlying exposures but not for speculation. All derivatives are considered investment derivative investments. 3. The Bank of North Dakota - NDCC 6-09 authorizes the Bank of North Dakota. The Bank is owned and operated by the State of North Dakota under the supervision of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. The Bank may haveinvestments in anything that any bank lawfully may do, except what is restricted by NDCC 6-09. 4. The North Dakota State Treasurer's Office - The North Dakota Constitution and various sections of the Century Code authorize the State Treasurer to invest all State funds deposited with the State Treasury. However, the StateTreasurer must invest the public funds with the Bank of North Dakota unless there is statutory authority to do otherwise. Generally, the State Treasurer pools deposits and invests in money market accounts and Bank of NorthDakota certificates of deposit. 5. University System - NDCC 15-55-05 and 15-55-06 govern the investment of proceeds of revenue bonds and revenues pledged to bondholders. Such proceeds must be invested in the Bank of North Dakota, in a separate fundin the State Treasury or in a duly authorized depository for the state funds that is a member of the federal depositinsurance corporation. The University System may invest such funds in direct obligation of, or in obligations wherethe United States of America guarantees the principal and interest, or obligations of the State of North Dakota or any municipality as defined in NDCC Section 21-03-01. Agency investments, of the primary government, under management of the State Investment Board are included below with the Pension and Investment Trust funds. 70STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates of debt securities will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The price of a debt security typically moves in the opposite direction of the change in interest rates. The State does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to potential fair value losses arising from future changes in interest rates. However, North Dakota Housing Finance's respective bond resolutions permit only investments that will not adversely affect the rating quality of the outstanding bonds. Also, the maturity date or the date on which such investment obligations may be redeemed shall coincide as nearly as practicable with the date or dates on which moneys in the funds or accounts for which the investments were made will be required. The Bank of North Dakota's investment policy provides for a duration range of one to four years, which will serve to decrease interest rate risk. At June 30, 2019, the following tables show the debt securities of the primary government and major component units by investment type and maturity (expressed in thousands). Primary Government (includes Pension and Investment Trust Funds) Investment Type Total Fair Value Less Than 1 Year 1 - 6 Years 6 - 10 Years More Than 10 Years Asset Backed Securities $ 446,612 $ 347 $ 71,850 $ 200,301 $ 174,114 Collateralized Bonds 2,716 259,024 and Notes 41,996 41,996 - - - Short Term Investments Funds 443,676 443,676 - - - Pooled Investments 1,440,048 6,003 Total $ 5,204,296 $ 1,727,313 $ 2,464,171 Major Component Units Investment Type Total Fair Value Less Than 1 Year 1 - 6 Years 6 - 10 Years More Than 10 Years Commercial Paper $ 16,294 $ 16,294 $ - $ - $ - Corporate Notes 24,829 16,284 8,545 - - Government Agencies - Government Bonds 35,662 15,107 20,555 - - Short Term Bills and Notes 11,092 11,092 - - - Total Debt Securities $ 98,481 $ 62,536 $ 35,945 $ - $ - 71STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The fair values of inflation indexed bonds are reflected in the tables above, based on their stated maturity dates. The principal balances of these bonds are adjusted every six months based on the inflation index for that period. Some investments are more sensitive to interest rate changes than others. Variable and floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO's), asset-backed securities (ABS), interest-only and principal-only securities are examples of investments whose fair values may be highly sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest-only (IO) and principal-only (PO) strips are transactions which involve the separation of the interest and principal components of a security. They are highly sensitive to prepayments by mortgagors, which may result from a decline in interest rates. The State held IOs valued at $18.8 million and POs valued at $0.0 million. The State has no policy regarding IO or PO strips. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer. The State does not have an investment policy that specifically addresses concentrations of credit risk in a single issuer, however the Bank of North Dakota has established asset allocation ranges for investments as a percentage of their total portfolio. The Bank of North Dakota had the following concentrations at June 30, 2019 (expressed in thousands): Amount Percent Federal Agency Federal Home Loan Bank $ 353,171 19.1% Small Business Administration 269,264 14.5% Farm 3.3% $ 1,853,806 100.0% CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The State maintains a highly diversified portfolio of debt securities encompassing a wide range of credit ratings. Although the State has no overall policy regarding credit risk, each debt securities manager is given a specific set of guidelines to invest within based on the mandate for which it was hired. The guidelines specify in which range of credit the manager may invest. These ranges include investment grade and below investment grade categories. The Bank of North Dakota's investment policy provides minimum credit quality ratings for its investments and asset allocation ranges for investments as a percentage of the total portfolio. 72STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA As of June 30, 2019, the following tables present the debt securities of the primary government and major component units and their respective ratings (expressed in thousands).

Credit ratings of US government agency securities that are only implicitly guaranteed by the US government are categorized accordingly in the main body of this table. Implicitly guaranteed agency securities included in the Asset Backed, Commercial Mortgage Backed, Gov't Issued Commercial & Gov't Mortgage Backed, Gov't Agencies, Gov't Bonds, Index Linked Gov't Bonds and Short Term Bills and Notes categories are issued by FNMA, FHLB, FHLMC, FAMC and TVA. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment or a deposit. Although the State Investment Board does not have a formal investment policy governing foreign currency risk, the board does manage its exposure to fair value loss by requiring their international securities investment managers to maintain diversified portfolios to limit foreign currency and security risk. The Department of Trust Lands treats currency exposure in two different ways, depending on the type of investment. For the Board's international equity portfolio, the currency exposure is not hedged, as currency exposure is one of the items that adds diversity to the overall portfolio. For foreign bonds, the Board fully hedges the currency exposure, as the purpose of this portfolio is to generate more consistent returns. 74STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA At June 30, 2019, foreign currency risk exposure on investments managed by the Department of Trust Lands and State Investment Board were as follows (expressed in thousands).

The investment policies of the States' clients allow the use of derivative securities to hedge or replicate underlying exposures but not for speculation. All derivatives are considered investment derivative instruments. The fair value of all derivative securities is reported in the Statement of Net Position. At June 30, 2019, the State had four types of derivative securities: futures, options, swaps and currency forwards. Futures - Futures represent commitments to purchase (asset) or sell (liability) securities at a future date and at a specific price. Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges (exchange traded) thereby minimizing the States' counterparty risk. The net change in the futures contracts' value is settled daily in cash with the exchanges. Net gains or losses resulting from the daily settlements are included in net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and to taled $17.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2019, the State investment portfolio had the notional futures shown below (expressed in thousands). Futures Notional Value Cash a nd cash equivalent derivative futures Long $ 188,152 Shor t (657,304) Equit y derivative futures Long 808,005 Short - Fixed income derivative futures Long 352,611 Short (141,400) Total futures $ 550,064 Optio ns - Options represent or give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a preset price over a specified period. Options are traded on organized exchanges (exchange traded) thereby minimizing the States' counterparty credit risk. The option's price is usually a small percentage of the underlying asset's value. As a seller of a financial option, the State, through its investment manager, receives a premium at the beginning of the agreement and bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option. As a buyer of a financial option, the State, through its investment manager, pays a premium at the beginning of the agreement and the counterparty bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option. Gains and losses on options are determined based on fair values and recorded with the net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $3.3 million. At June 30, 2019, the State had the following option balances (expressed in thousands): Options Fair Value Cash & O ther Options Call $ (10) Put 1Fixe d Income Options Call (38) Put (241) Total options $ (288) Swap s - A swap is a derivative in which counterparties exchange certain benefits of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. Specifically, the two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows for another stream. The State, through its investment managers, has entered into various swap agreements in an attempt to manage its exposure to interest rate, inflation, credit, currency risk and total return. Gains and losses on swaps are determined based on fair values and are recorded with the net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $(18.6) million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The maximum loss that would be recognized at June 30, 2019, if all counterparties failed to perform as contracted is $3.0 million. Swap fair values are determined by a third party pricing source.

A forward exchange contract is a commitment to purchase (positive) or sell (negative) a currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. The gain or loss arising from the difference between the original contracts and the closing of such contracts is included in the net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $91 thousand.

The fair value of the grain futures contracts was determined on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. The margin requirement is $0.60 per bushel, unless the market price changes the limit for two consecutive days, then the margin requirement is $0.90 per bushel. The Mill has entered into futures contracts for spring wheat to lock in a price for a future delivery or settlement period. These contracts are entered into to protect the Mill against price fluctuation of the commodity. The price protection is needed to cover any long or short positions compared to flour sales. The table below shows the cost and market values of these spring wheat futures as of June 30, 2019.

ENDOWMENT FUNDS UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS The endowment funds reported herein are institutional funds under the terms of the gift instrument and are not wholly expendable by the institution. NDCC Section 59-21, the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) applies to the investment of endowments governed by a gift instrument. NDUS SBHE policy 810 stipulates endowment funds shall be invested according to the intent of the donor provided such intent is consistent with applicable laws. Absent terms expressing donor intent in a gift instrument, NDUS institution officers initially shall deposit the funds in institution accounts at the Bank of North Dakota. Thereafter, the funds may be invested according to NDCC 59-21. Subject to the intent of the donor, NDUS institution officers are delegated authority to manage and invest these institutional funds as provided by UPMIFA. NDCC Section 59-21-02.5a(7) applies to standard of conduct in the administration of powers to make and retain investments. It states that in managing and investing an institutional fund, 79STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA the needs of the institution and the fund to make distributions and to preserve capital must be considered. Given the flexibility in NDCC 59-21-02, institutions have differing policies with respect to spending investment income and net appreciation on endowment funds. For UND, distributions for spending endowments each year will be calculated once annually with the quarter ended December 31 unitized market value and is based on the set spending rate, currently four percent, applied to the average market value for the preceding twelve quarter average. All endowment in existence at December 31 for one year will receive a distribution spending allocation. The available amount will be forecast to UND for planning purposes by February 1, and these distributions will be available for spending in the upcoming fiscal year. NDSU determines the spending of endowment earnings based on an annual evaluation. WSC give departments authority to spend all investment income earned on the endowment funds. Net appreciation on investments are available for expenditure and consist of the following at June 30, 2019: Reflected in net position as: North Dakota State University $ 233,027 Expen da ble scholarships & fellowships University of North Dakota 937,935 Non-ex p endable fellowships NDUS $ 1,173,693 Endowm e nt funds reported herein do not include the Federal Land Grant Fund held by the State Department of Trust Lands. The annual proceeds from assets held by the Commissioner of the State Department of Trust Lands and are deposited into each college/university's operating fund at the State Treasury and are used for current operating purposes. Bismarck State College, Lake Region State College and Williston State College do not participate in the proceeds allocated by the State Land Department. Total assets held by the State Land Department and proceeds for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 are approximately $185.2 million and $6.1 million respectively.

REVERS E REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS State statutes permit the State to enter into reverse repurchase agreements, that is, the sale of securities with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase them in the future at the same price plus a contract rate of interest. The fair value of the securities underlying reverse repurchase agreements normally exceeds the cash received, providing the dealers a margin against a decline in fair value of the securities. All sales of investments under these agreements are for fixed terms. In investing the proceeds of these agreements, State policy is for the term to maturity of the investment to be the same as the term of the agreement. Such matching existed at year end. These agreements are secured by Fed book-entry securities held in the State's name. At June 30, 2019, the State had no reverse repurchase agreements outstanding and did not participate in reverse repurchase agreements during the fiscal year. G.

OPERATING LEASES PAYMENTS ON OPERATING LEASES The State is obligated under certain leases accounted for as operating leases. Operating leases do not give rise to property rights or lease obligations, and therefore, the resulting expenditures are recognized as incurred. Lease expenditures for the year ended June 30, 2019, amounted to $20.9 million for governmental activities and $17.1 million for business-type activities. Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of June 30, 2019, for all fund types are as follows (expressed in thousands): Year Ending June 30 Governmental Activ itiesBusiness-type Total Minimum Lease Payments $ 37,575 $ 34,492 J. CAPITAL LEASES The State is obligated under certain leases accounted for as capital leases. In the government-wide and proprietary fund statements, capital assets and a corresponding liability are recorded at the inception of the lease. The liability is reduced by payments of principal, with a portion of the payment allocated to interest expense. For capital leases in governmental funds, other financing sources and expenditures are recorded at lease inception. Lease payments are recorded as debt service expenditures.

DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT The State enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify interest rates on certain liabilities. The fair values of both hedging derivatives and investment derivatives (if any) are presented on the Statement of Net Position, either as a derivative liability (negative fair value) or as a derivative asset (positive fair value). The change in the total fair value o f derivatives that are determined to be effective hedges is recorded as a deferred inflow or outflow of resources on the Statement of Net Position. If a derivative were determined to be an ineffective hedge, it would be classified as an investment derivative, and the change in the total fair value would be presented as part of investment earnings. DEFERRED LOSS ON BOND REFUNDING A deferred charge on refunded debts results from the difference in the carrying value of the refunded debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. L. LONG-TERM DEBT Debt authorized is generally limited by the state constitution. The Constitution of North Dakota provides that the State may issue or guarantee the payment of bonds, provided that all bonds in excess of $2 million are: (1) secured by first mortgage upon property and no further indebtedness may be incurred by the State unless evidenced by a bond issue; (2) authorized by law; (3) for a certain purpose; (4) provisioned to pay the interest semiannually; and (5) the principal is paid within 30 years. Additionally, the law authorizing the bond issue must specifically appropriate the provisions to the payment of the principal and interest of the bond. 1. REVENUE BONDS Bonds payable at June 30, 2019, consisted of bonds issued by the State and are accounted for by the respective state agencies in the government-wide financial statements that issued the bonds. Current state statutes empower certain state agencies to issue bonds as part of their activities. This debt is not backed by the full faith and credit of the State of North Dakota. The principal and interest on such bonds shall be payable only from the applicable agency's program income.

Total net revenue pledges for fiscal year 2019 were $6.3 million. For fiscal year 2019, principal and interest paid by the Authority on the bonds was $6.3 million. The total principal and interest remaining to be paid as of June 30, 2019, is $30.8 million payable through December 2030. 88STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The 2010 bond agreements require the establishment and maintenance of reserve funds to be used for debt service payments if amounts in the bond funds are insufficient to make payments. Fund are also required for any positive arbitration due to the Federal government. Department of Transportation The North Dakota Department of Transportation (NDDOT) is authorized pursuant to NDCC 24-02-40.1, to issue grant and revenue anticipation bonds for the purpose of financing certain qualified federal aid transportation projects. The Series 2005 Bonds are limited obligations of NDDOT, payable solely from the Trust Estate, consisting primarily of federal transportation funds and pledged state highway funds. The Series 2005 Bonds will not be deemed or construed as creating an indebtedness of the State within the meaning of the State Constitution or laws of the State concerning or limiting the creation of indebtedness of the State. The total principal and interest remaining to be paid on the bonds is $5.3 million payable through June 2020. For the current year principal and interest paid and total net pledged revenues before interest expense were $5.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The funds pledged for the NDDOT 2005 bond issue consist of state funds in the State Highway Fund from the following sources: Highway Tax Distribution Fund, fee and permit revenues, interest revenue and miscellaneous sales of scrap materials and obsolete equipment. The pledged funds do not include any funding deposited into the State Highway Fund from the State General Fund. The proportion of the specific revenue stream pledged was 98.5% in 2019. Interest on the Series 2005 Bonds is payable on June 1 and December 1, of each year. Bonds maturing on or after June 1, 2016, are subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of NDDOT, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Student Loan Trust Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 2004 Series A Bonds are variable rate bonds. The rate of interest is determined based on one-month LIBOR plus 0.7% . The maximum rate of interest is 12% per annum. Details of the terms and provisions of the variable rate bonds are outlined in Section 2.1 of the Fourth Supplemental Resolution to the State of North Dakota Student Loan Revenue Bonds First General Bond Resolution. Section 2.2 of the Fourth Supplemental Resolution to the State of North Dakota Student Loan Revenue Bonds First General Bond Resolution has deemed these to be Federally Taxable Bonds. The Series 2004 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the Commission from any source of funds, in whole or in part, on any date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to date of redemption.

For fiscal year 2019, revenue pledged and total principal and interest paid by Student Loan Trust were $46,000 and $30,000, respectively Housing Finance Housing Finance Bonds were issued to provide financing to purchase mortgage loans to finance multifamily housing projects. The bonds are the direct obligation of the Housing Finance Agency and are secured by the mortgage loans purchased under the applicable resolutions; the revenues, prepayments, insurance and foreclosure proceeds received related to the mortgage loans; and certain funds and accounts established pursuant to the applicable bond resolution. Revenues Pledged - The agency has homeownership bonds outstanding in the amount of $1.25 billion maturing at various times from July 1, 2019 through January 1, 2050. The bonds have been issued to provide financing to purchase mortgage loans. Annual principal and interest payments on the bonds are expected to require 98 percent of net revenues. Principal and interest paid for the current year and total customer net revenues were $104.1 million and $23.5 million, respectively. Bond principal was reduced through customer revenues and the refunding of older bonds with proceeds from new bond issues. Pursuant to the Series Resolutions adopted to date and under the 1994 and 2009 General Resolutions, the revenues generated by the Program Loans (but not the Program Loans themselves) are pledged to secure the Bonds. The Agency is permitted by terms of the General Resolutions to issue Bonds and pledge Revenues pursuant to the Series Resolution which exceed the amount required to meet the obligations of that Series of Bonds. In such event, it is likely that any such Series of bonds would produce excess Revenues which could be available to redeem the related Series of bonds or any other Series of Bonds prior to the state maturities thereof. The Agency also had multifamily revenue bonds in the amount of $9.25 million that mature on August 1, 2020. The bonds have been issued to pay a portion of the cost of acquiring, rehabilitation and equipping a 186 unit multifamily residential rental property located in Fargo, North Dakota.

The ND Housing Finance Agency maintains a collateral pledge agreement with the FHLB covering secured advances whereby the Agency has agreed to retain residential real estate loans and marketable securities, free of all other pledges, liens and encumbrances. The pledged loans and securities are discounted by FHLB when determining their borrowing capacity. The aggregate borrowing capacity of eligible collateral was approximately $85,066 as of June 30, 2019.

ARBITRAGE REBATE PAYABLE Arbitrage as it applies to government financing refers to the ability of state governments to obtain funds at a tax-exempt rate of interest and to then invest those funds in investments which earn a higher yield, resulting in a profit to the issuer. The arbitrage rebate rules require that any earnings from the investment of the tax-exempt bond proceeds which exceed the yield on the bonds be remitted to the federal government. The State has an arbitrage rebate payable to the federal government of approximately $93,000 at June 30, 2019. These amounts are reported in the Government-wide and Proprietary Fund Type financial statements as an intergovernmental payable. N. DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES GRANTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO TIME REQUIREMENTS This amount represents unavailable revenue. The amounts are deferred and recognized as an inflow of resources in the period that the amounts become available INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF HEDGING DERIVATIVES This amount represents the changes in fair value of futures. O. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value measurements are used to record fair value adjustments to certain assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources to determine fair value disclosures. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY In acc o rdance with GASB Statement No. 72, assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilit ies and deferred inflows of resources are grouped at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: Level 1: Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2: Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3: Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. 95STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE In accor da nce with GASB Statement No. 72, fair values are based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is the State's policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The following is a description of the methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value. Securities classified in Level 1 are valued using quoted prices in active markets for those securities. Securities classified in Level 2 and Level 3 are valued using methodologies such as various bid evaluations, market averages and other matrix pricing techniques as well as values derived from associated traded securities or last trade data. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels, the fair value is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation. Investments valued at the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) have been classified separately in the table below and include investments considered to be alternative investments as defined by the AICPA. The definition includes investments for which a readily determinable fair value does not exist (that is, investments not listed on national exchanges or over-the-counter markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available from sources such as financial publications, the exchanges, or NASDAQ). These types of investments can be held within any of the asset classes used by the State based on underlying portfolio holdings and analysis of risk and return relationships. These investments can be structured in different ways, including limited partnerships, limited liability companies, common trusts and mutual funds. Some are closed-ended with a specific life and capital commitment while others are open-ended with opportunity for ad hoc contributions or withdrawals and termination upon proper notice. Commingled/Mutual Funds - These types of funds are generally open-ended funds and may be utilized in equities or fixed income asset classes. They are funds made up of underlying securities that have readily available fair values (publicly traded stocks or bonds). The State owns units of these funds rather than the individual securities. Contributions or withdrawals from these funds can be made as needed, generally with daily or monthly liquidity, with a notice period of one to fifteen days. Because they are liquid funds, there are no unfunded commitments for these types of investments. Private Credit - These investments include loans to private companies, privately placed debt of public companies, or loans backed by real assets. Loan repayment can be derived from either cash flows from an operating company or cash flows generated by a physical or esoteric asset. Private debt is typically secured and has various protections/covenants in place. The debt is customized to the borrower's requirement, thus rendering it illiquid. The State includes these strategies within its global fixed income allocation through limited partnership-type structures. Private credit issuers may be investment grade but are typically below-investment grade and similar in some respect to the syndicated bank loan and high yield markets. The State employs two senior private debt funds, commonly referred to as direct lenders, which are structured as custom managed accounts that are not eligible for redemptions during remaining investment lives of 2 to 3 years, and the unfunded commitments totaled $146.2 million as of June 30, 2019. Private Equity - Private Equity investments are typically private interests in corporations across different areas of the capital structure and in different stages of the corporations' development via limited partnership vehicles. Private Equity investments are illiquid and long term in nature (10-12 years), typically held until maturity. Private Equity portfolios generally have a \"J-Curve Effect\" whereby there are low to negative returns in the initial years due to the payment of investment management fees and initial funding of investments made by the General Partner during a period when investments are typically carried at cost and returns have not been realized. To diversify the program, Private Equity investments are made across business cycles, vintage years, and different strategies. The State has a dedicated sub- asset class for private equity investments within its global equity allocation in the pension pool. The State does not the option to request redemptions from its private equity funds. The General Partner distributes earnings and proceeds from the sale of the underlying investments as transactions occur. The State has $339.9 million in unfunded private equity commitments as of June 30, 2019. Venture Capital - These include investments in companies in a range of stages of development from start-up/seed stage, early stage, and later/expansion stage. Investments are typically made in years one through six and returns typically occur in years four through ten. Buyouts - These include investments in funds that seek out and purchase underperforming or undervalued companies in order to improve them and sell them or take them public many years later. These funds are also often involved in management buyouts, which are buyouts conducted by the management of the company being purchased, and they often play key roles in leveraged buyouts, which are buyouts that are funded with borrowed money. 96STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Distressed Debt - These include investments in the debt instruments of companies which may be publicly traded or privately held that are financially distressed and are either in bankruptcy or likely candidates for bankruptcy. Typical holdings are senior and subordinated debt instruments, mortgages and bank loans. The State includes these types of investments in its private equity asset class. As of June 30, 2019, unfunded commitments in one of its two distressed debt funds totaled $76.9 million. The fund is not eligible for redemptions. The other fund is eligible for redemptions with quarterly liquidity and 60 days notice, and has no unfunded commitment. Mezzanine Debt - This strategy is a hybrid of debt and equity financing. It is basically debt capital that gives the lender the rights to convert to an ownership or equity interest in the company if the loan is not paid back in time and in full. It is generally subordinated to senior debt. The State utilizes this strategy, through a limited partnership structure, in its global fixed income allocation. The two funds in this category are not eligible for redemptions, have remaining lives of 2-5 years, and unfunded commitments of $8.5 million as of June 30, 2019. Equity Long/Short - This strategy is a combination of long and short positions, primarily in publicly traded equities. The State utilizes this strategy, through a limited partnership structure, with its global equity allocations. This is an open- ended fund with monthly liquidity with a notice period of 15 days. There was no unfunded commitment as of June 30, 2019. Real Assets - These investments are intended to provide allocations to tangible assets that are expected to be inflation protected and provide performance above the inflation rate as indicated by the CPI. Investments are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Investments in Real Estate Assets include Real Estate, Timberland and Infrastructure, as discussed below. Real Estate - includes investments in private vehicles through limited partnerships or commingled vehicles that have an ownership interest in direct real estate properties. The investment strategies may include \"value added\" strategies, which derive their return from both income and appreciation, \"opportunistic\", which derive their return primarily through appreciation, and \"alternative\" which invest in less traditional types of property. Both domestic and international real estate funds are utilized. The State has a dedicated sub-asset class for these types of investments within global real assets. There are currently 10 different real estate funds in the portfolio. Three of those funds are open-ended vehicles that accept redemption requests quarterly with a 30-90 day notification period. The remaining seven funds are closed-ended limited partnerships that are not eligible for redemptions. Those seven funds have a combined unfunded commitment of $114.4 million as of June 30, 2019. Timberland - includes investments in limited liability companies that have an ownership interest in properties where the value of the property is derived mainly from income-producing timber but also from the \"higher and better use\" value of the underlying land. The State includes these assets within its global real asset allocations. There are three funds in the portfolio and they have no unfunded commitments. The funds are not eligible for redemption other than distributions of income and/or proceeds as determined by the investment manager. The funds have remaining lives of 2-7 years. Infrastructure - includes investments in limited partnerships that have an ownership interest in transportation assets such as toll roads, tunnels and bridges; and regulated assets such as electricity transmission, gas and oil distribution and wastewater collection. Other possible investments would include communication assets and social infrastructure. The State includes these assets within its global real assets allocations. The infrastructure investments in the portfolio as of June 30, 2019, include both open an d closed-ended funds. The open-ended funds have no unfunded commitments and are eligible for redemptions quarterly with 90 days notice. There may be a 3-12 month queue for receiving redemptions. The closed-ended funds have unfunded commitments of $243.9 million at June 30, 2019 and are not eligible for redemptions. Interest Rate Swap Agreements - Fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the settlement value adjusted by estimated nonperformance risk. Derivative Instruments - Fair values of the grain future contracts are determined on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. 97STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Fair Value The following table shows the fair value leveling of the State's assets and liabilities at June 30 (expressed in thousands).

DESCRIPTION OF PLANS The State of North Dakota administers four major retirement systems: North Dakota Public Employees' Retirement System, North Dakota Highway Patrolmen's Retirement System, Retirement Plan for the Employees of Job Service North Dakota and the Teachers' Fund for Retirement. The State also administers the North Dakota Defined Contribution Retirement Plan, which was established January 1, 2000. Certain state employees may also participate in a privately administered retirement system: Teachers' Insurance Annuity Association. The following is a brief description of each plan. More detailed information can be found in the plan agreements and the related legislation. NORTH DAKOTA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM (PERS) The North Dakota Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of the State of North Dakota, its agencies, and various participating political subdivisions (Main System). It also covers Supreme and District Court judges, the National Guard Security Officers and Firefighters, peace officers and correctional officers employed by political subdivisions and as of August 1, 2017, firefighters employed by participating political subdivisions. Effective August 1, 2015, current and newly eligible members of the National Guard System were transferred to the Law Enforcement System. It is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974. PERS issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System, 400 East Broadway, Suite 505, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501. At June 30, 2019, the number of participating political subdivisions in PERS was: Cities 94 Counties 50 School Districts 125 Other 85 Total Participating Local Political Subdivisions 354 Administration The North Dakota Retirement Board was created by the State Legislature and is the governing authority of PERS. Benefit and contribution provisions are administered in accordance with chapter 54-52 of the North Dakota Century Code. Responsibility for administration of the three defined benefit pension plans and the defined contribution plan is assigned to a Board comprised of nine members. The Board consists of a Chairman, who is appointed by the Governor; one member appointed by the Attorney General; one member appointed by the State Health Officer; two members of the legislative assemble appointed by a chairman of the legislative management, three members elected by the active membership of the NDPERS system; and one member elected by the retired public employees. The costs of administering the plan are financed through the contributions and investment earnings of each plan. Benefits Pension benefits are set by statute. The System has no provisions or policies with respect to automatic and ad hoc post- retirement benefit increases. Members are entitled to unreduced monthly pension benefits beginning when the sum of age and years of credited service equals or exceeds 85 (Rule of 85), or at normal retirement age (65). For members hired on or after January 1, 2016 the Rule of 85 will be replaced with the Rule of 90 with a minimum age of 60. The annual pension benefit is equal to 2.00% of their average monthly salary, using the highest 36 months out of the last 180 months of service, for each year of service. For members hired on or after January 1, 2020 the annual pension benefit is equal to 1.75% of their average monthly salary, using the three highest periods of twelve consecutive months employed during the last one hundred eighty months of employment. The Plan permits early retirement at ages 55-64 with five or more years of service. Supreme and district court judges are entitled to unreduced monthly pension benefits beginning at the normal retirement age (65) or Rule of 85. The monthly pension benefit for Supreme and district court judges is equal to a percentage of average monthly salary using the highest 36 consecutive months out of the last 180 months of service. The percentage is 101STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA equal to 3.5% of final average monthly salary multiplied by the first 10 years of service, plus 2.80% of the average monthly salary times the second 10 years of service, plus 1.25% of average monthly salary times years of service in excess of 20 years. The judicial retirement formula is only applied to eligible judicial service. Non-judicial service benefits are calculated using the 2.00% multiplier. The plan permits early retirement at ages 55-64, with five or more years of service. The monthly pension benefit for National Guard at normal retirement age (55). Effective August 1, 2015, the National Guard System will become part of the Law Enforcement System. Members of the Law Enforcement are entitled to unreduced monthly pension benefits at normal retirement age (55) or the rule of 85. The monthly pension benefit for the National Guard/Law Enforcement is equal to 2.00 percent of their average monthly salary, using the highest 36 months out of the last 180 months of service, for each year of service. The plan permits early retirement at ages 50-55 with three or more years of service for members. Members may elect to receive the pension benefits in the form of a single life, joint and survivor, term-certain annuity, or partial lump sum with ongoing annuity. Members may elect to receive the value of their accumulated contributions, plus interest, as a lump sum distribution upon retirement or termination, or they may elect to receive their benefits in the form of an annuity. For each member electing an annuity, total payment will not be less than the employee's accumulated contributions plus interest. Death and Disability Benefits Death and disability benefits are set by statute. If an active employee dies with less than three years of service for the Main System and National Guard/Law Enforcement, or less than five years of service for Supreme and district court judges, a death benefit equal to the value of the employee's accumulated contributions, plus interest, is paid to the employee's beneficiary. If the employee has earned more than three years of service for the Main System and National Guard/Law Enforcement, the surviving spouse will be entitled to a single payment refund, life-time monthly payments in an amount equal to 50% of the employee's accrued normal retirement benefit, or monthly payments in an amount equal to the employees' accrued 100% joint and survivor retirement benefit if the member had reached normal retirement age prior to date of death. If the surviving spouse dies before the employee's accumulated pension benefits are paid, the balance will be payable to the surviving spouse's designated beneficiary. For judges only who have earned five years of credited service, the death benefit is changed to the greater of (i) lump sum payment of accumulated contributions, and (ii) 100% of the member's accrued benefit (not reduced on account of age), payable for the spouse's lifetime. Eligible members who become totally disabled after a minimum of 180 days of service receive monthly disability benefits that are equal to 25% of their final average salary with a minimum benefit of $100. To qualify under this section, the member has to become disabled during the period of eligible employment and apply for benefits within one year of termination. The definition for \"disabled\" is set by the Board in the North Dakota Administrative Code. For Judges only, the disability benefit formula is changed to 70% of final average salary minus social security and workers compensation benefits. Refunds of Member Contributions Upon termination, if a member is not vested (is not 65 or does not have three years of service for the Main System and National Guard/Law Enforcement, or five years of service for the Supreme and district court judges, credited for PERS), they will receive the accumulated member contributions plus interest. If an employee has vested, they have the option of applying for a refund or can remain as a terminated vested participant. If a member terminated and withdrew their accumulated employee contribution and is subsequently re-employed, they have the option of repurchasing their prior service. Contributions Contribution rates are set by state statute and are a percentage of salaries and wages. Members that made a qualifying election under Senate B ill 2015 to move from the Defined Cont ribution Plan back to the Defined Benefit Plan have a 2% increase on employee contributions. The 2019 Legislative Assembly passed legislation that ended the RHIC plan for new hires after January 1, 2020 and redirected the 1.14% RHIC employer contribution to the retirement account for both the PERS plan as well as the defined contribution plan. 102STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Member contributions are set by state statue and are a percentage of salaries and wages. During the 1983-1985 biennium, the State implemented the employer pickup provision of the IRS code, whereby a portion or all of the required member contributions are made by the employer. The State is paying 4% of the full member contribution. Some of the political subdivisions are paying all or part of the member contributions. Employer contributions are set by statue except the contribution rates for the National Guard/Law Enforcement Plans which are set by the Board. Contribution rates are established as a percent of covered compensation as follows: Member Contributions Employer Contributions PERS* Members first enrolled prior to 1/1/20 7.00% 7.12% Members first enrolled after to 1/1/20 7.00% 8.26% Members returning to the Defined Benefit Plan as a result of Senate Bill 2015 9.00% 7.12% Judges Retirement System 8.00% 17.52% Law Enforcement with previous service State - BCI Plan 6.00% 9.81% State - National Guard 5.50% 9.81% Political subdivisions 9.81% Law Enforcement without previous service 5.50% 7.93% *Members making the election to move from the Defined Contribution Plan back to the Defined Benefit Plan as a result of Senate Bill 2015 pay a 9.00% employee contribution. The m e mber's account balance includes employee contributions, interest, and the vested employer contributions equal to the member's contributions to an eligible deferred compensation plan. Members of the Supreme and District Court Judges are not eligible to vest in the employer contributions if contributing to the deferred compensation plan. The minimum monthly member contribution is $25, and the maximum may not exceed certain parameters based upon years of service. NORTH DAKOTA HIGHWAY PATROLMEN'S RETIREMENT SYSTEM (NDHPRS) The North Dakota Highway Patrolmen's Retirement System is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all sworn officers of the Highway Patrol of the State of North Dakota. It is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. NDHPRS issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System, 400 East Broadway, Suite 505, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501. Administration The North Dakota Retirement Board was created by the State Legislature and is the governing authority of NDHPRS. See PERS Administration note for composition of the Retirement Board. Benefit and contribution provisions are administered in accordance with chapter 39-03 of the North Dakota Century Code. The costs of administering the plan are financed through the contributions and investment earnings of the plan. Benefits Pension benefits are set by statute. The System has no provisions or policies with respect to automatic and ad hoc post- retirement benefit increases. Members are entitled to unreduced pension benefits upon attainment of age 55 and 10 years of eligible employment or when the sum of age and years of credited service equals or exceeds 80. The annual pension benefit is equal to a percentage of average monthly salary using the highest 36 months out of the last 180 months of service. The percentage is equal to the sum of the first 25 years of service multiplied by 3.60% and 1.75% multiplied by years of service in excess of 25, if any. The plan permits early retirement at ages 50-54, with ten or more years of service. Members may elect to receive the pension benefits in the form of a single life, joint and survivor, term-certain annuity, or partial lump sum with ongoing annuity. Members may elect to receive the value of their accumulated contributions, plus interest, as a lump sum distribution upon retirement or termination, or they may elect to receive their benefits in the form 103STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA of an annuity. For each member electing an annuity, total payment will not be less than the members' accumulated contributions plus interest. Death and Disability Benefits Death and disability benefits are set by statute. If an active member dies with less than 10 years of credited service, a death benefit equal to the value of the member's accumulated contributions, plus interest, is paid to the member 's beneficiary. If the member has earned more than 10 years of credited service, the surviving spouse, if any, will be entitled to a single payment refund, life-time monthly payments in an amount equal to 50 percent of the member 's accrued normal retirement benefit. If the surviving spouse dies before the member 's accumulated pension benefits are paid, the balance will be payable to any designated beneficiary. Eligible member s who become totally disabled after a mini mum of 180 days service receive monthly disability benefits that are up to 70 percent of their final average salary, reduced by workers compensation with a minimum benefit of $100. To qualify under this section, the member must meet the criteria established by the Retirement Board for being totally disabled and apply for benefits within one year of termination. Refunds of Member Contributions Upon termination, if a member is not vested (is not 60 or does not have ten years of service credited for NDHPRS), they will receive the accumulated member contributions plus interest. If an employee has vested, they have the option of applying for a refund or can remain as a terminated vested participant. If a member terminated and withdrew their accumulated employee contribution and is subsequently re-employed, they have the option of repurchasing their prior service. Contributions Contribution rates for NDHPRS are set by state statute and are a percentage of covered compensation. The State is paying 4.0% of the member contribution. The member contribution rate is 13.3% and the employer rate is 19.7%. RETIREMENT PLAN FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA (JSND) The retirement plan for employees of Job Service North Dakota is a single-employer defined benefit public employee retirement plan administered by PERS. The plan is established under NDCC 52-11-01 with benefit provisions established through the plan document, as amended by the Board. This plan document, as amended, is authorized by the Plan Administrator, who is the Executive Director of the agency. JSND issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to Job Service North Dakota, PO Box 5507, Bismarck, North Dakota 58506-5507. Participation in the plan is limited to employees participating in the plan as of September 30, 1980. Administration On August 1, 2003, the administrative authority and the net position of the Retirement Plan for Employees of Job Service North Dakota were transferred from the agency to the Public Employees Retirement System Board. This action was based on the passage of House Bill 1064 by the Fifty-eighth Legislative Assembly of North Dakota. The Retirement Plan for Employees of Job Service has an Actuarial Valuation Report produced annually. Requests to obtain or review this report should be addressed to the Executive Director, NDPERS, 400 East Broadway, Suite 505, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501. The costs of administering the plan are financed through the contributions and investment earnings of the plan. Benefits Benefits are established through the plan document, as amended by the Board. The System provides a post-retirement cost-of living adjustment each year based on the Consumer Price Index. Employees are entitled to annual pension benefits beginning at normal retirement age (65). Employees may elect optional retirement eligibility at age 62 with 5 years of credited service, at age 60 with 20 years of credited service, or at age 55 with 30 years of credited service. Pension benefits are calculated based on the final average earnings (basic monthly earnings averaged over the highest three consecutive years of basic earnings) of the employee multiplied by the sum of: 104STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA 1.5% times years of credited service up to 5 plus; x 1.75% times years of credited service between 6 and 10 plus; x 2.0% times years of credited service in excess of 10. Death and Disability Benefits The plan provides retirement, disability and death benefits. If death of a participant occurs prior to their annuity starting date, t h e surviving spouse who has been married at least two years prior to the participant's death or, if married less than two years is a parent of a child of this marriage, then the spouse shall receive monthly benefits. The amount is the greater of the benefit had the participant retired on the day before they died and elected the Contingent Annuitant Option with 55% of their retirement benefit continued to their spouse or 55% of the smaller of 40% of the deceased participant's average monthly earnings or the deceased participant's normal retirement benefit obtained by increasing their credited service by the period of time between their date of death, and the date they would have attained age 60. Upon remarriage of the surviving spouse before age 60, the death benefit will cease. If a participant becomes totally disabled, they will be eligible for a monthly disability benefit which shall be equal to the great er of 40% of the participant's average annual earnings or the accrued benefit determined as of their date of disability. Refunds of Member Contributions Upon termination, if a member of the JSND System terminates employment before retirement payments begin, partici pa tion in the retirement plan will cease. No further additions to retirement income will accrue on the member's behalf, and the member may be paid under one of the following options. * The member may be paid an amount of retirement income with payments starting at Normal, Optional, or Early Retirement Date. The amount of that income will be equal to the amount provided under the formula according to the member's years of credited service and earnings. * The member may receive a cash withdrawal benefit equal to the total of the member's contributions and employer contributions made on their behalf, plus 4 percent interest compounded annually. The member may elect this option atany time after withdrawal and before Normal, Optional, or Early Retirement Date, but such benefit shall be in place ofall other benefits under the retirement benefits section. Contributions Employees' contributions are established at 7% of total compensation. The funding policy of the plan provides for employer contributions at actuarially determined rates that, expressed as percentages of annual covered payroll, are designed to accumulate sufficient assets to pay benefits when due. Effective July 1, 1999, the \"scheduled contribution\" will be zero as long as the plan's actuarial value of assets exceeds the actuarial present value of projected benefits. The \"scheduled contribution\" and amortization will be determined when the plan is not in surplus and will be based on a funding policy adopted by the Employer. TEACHERS' FUND FOR RETIREMENT (TFFR) The North Dakota Teachers' Fund for Retirement is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan covering all North Dakota public teachers and certain other teachers who meet various membership requirements. TFFR provides for pension, death and disability benefits. The cost to administer the TFFR plan is financed by investment income and contributions. Teachers' Fund for Retirement issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to the Retirement and Investment Office, 3442 East Century Avenue, P.O. Box 7100, Bismarck, North Dakota 58507-7100. At June 30, 2019, the number of participating employer units in TFFR was: Type Number Public School Districts 175 County Superintendents 6 Special Education Units 19 Vocational Education Units 4 Other 9 Total 213 105STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Administration Responsibility for administration of the TFFR benefits program is assigned to a seven-member Board of Trustees (Board). The Board consists of the State Treasurer, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and five members appointed by the Governor. The appointed members serve five-year terms which end on June 30 of alternate years. The appointed Board members must include two active teachers, one active school administrator, and two retired members. The Board submits any necessary or desirable changes in statues relating to the administration of the fund, including benefit terms, to the Legislative Assembly for consideration. The Legislative Assembly has final authority for changes to benefit terms and contributions rates. Benefits For purposes of determining pension benefits, members are classified within one of three categories. Tier 1 grandfathered and Tier 1 non-grandfathered members are those with service credit on file as of July 1, 2008. Tier 2 members are those newly employed and returning refunded members on or after July 1, 2008. Tier 1 Grandfathered - A Tier 1 grandfathered member is entitled to receive unreduced benefits when three or more years of credited service as a teacher in North Dakota have accumulated, the member is no longer employed as a teacher and has reached age 65, or the sum of age and years of service equals or exceeds 85. TFFR permits early retirement from ages 55 to 64, with benefits actuarially reduced by 6% per year for every year the member's retirement age is less than 65 years or the date as of which age plus service equal 85. In either case, benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension benefits paid by TFFR are determined by NDCC Section 15-39.1-10. Monthly benefits under TFFR are equal to the three highest annual salaries earned divided by 36 months and multiplied by 2.00% times the number of service credits earned. Retirees may elect payment of benefits in the form of a single life annuity, 100% or 50% joint and survivor annuity, ten or twenty-year term certain annuity, partial lump-sum option or level income with Social Security benefits. Members may also qualify for benefits calculated under other formulas. Tier 1 Non-grandfathered - A Tier 1 non-grandfathered member is entitled to receive unreduced benefits when three or more years of credited service as a teacher in North Dakota have accumulated, the member is no longer employed as a teacher, and the member has reached the age 65, or has reached age 60 and the sum of age and years of service credit equals or exceeds 90. TFFR permits early retirement from ages 55-64, with benefits actuarially reduced by 8% per year from the earlier of age 60/Rule of 90 or age 65. In either case, benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension benefits paid by TFFR are determined by NDCC Section 15-39.1-10. Monthly benefits under TFFR are equal to the three highest salaries earned divided by 36 months and multiplied by 2.00% times the number of service credits earned. Retirees may elect payment of benefits in the form of a single life annuity, 100% or 50% joint and survivor annuity, ten or twenty-year term certain annuity, partial lump-sum option or level income with Social Security benefits. Members may also qualify for benefits calculated under other formulas. Tier 2 - A Tier 2 member is entitled to receive unreduced benefits when five or more years of credited service as a teacher in North Dakota have accumulated, the member is no longer employed as a teacher and has reached age 65, or has reached age 60 and the sum of age and years of service credit equals or exceeds 90. TFFR permits early retirement from ages 55 to 64, with benefits actuarially reduced by 8% per year from the earlier of age 60/Rule of 90 or age 65. In either case, benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension benefits paid by TFFR are determined by NDCC Section 15-39.1-10. Monthly benefits under TFFR are equal to the five highest annual salaries earned divided by 60 months and multiplied by 2.00% times the number of service credits earned. Retirees may elect payment of benefits in the form of a single life annuity, 100% or 50% joint and survivor annuity, ten or twenty-year term certain annuity, partial lump-sum option or level income with Social Security benefits. Members may also qualify for benefits calculated under other formulas. Death and Disability Benefits Death benefits may be paid to a member's designated beneficiary. If a member's death occurs before retirement, the benefit options available are determined by the member's vesting status prior to death. If a member's death occurs after retirement, the death benefit received by the beneficiary (if any) is based on the retirement plan the member selected at retirement. 106STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA An active member is eligible to receive disability benefits when: (a) a total disability lasting twelve months or more does not allow the continuation of teaching, (b) the member has accumulated five years of credited service in North Dakota, and (c) the Board of Trustees of TFFR has determined eligibility based upon medical evidence. The amount of the disability benefit is computed by the retirement formula in NDCC 15-39.1-10 without consideration of age and uses the member's actual years of credited service. There is no actuarial reduction for reason of disability retirement. Contributions Member and employer contributions paid to TFFR are set by NDCC 15-39.1-09. Every eligible teacher in the state of North Dakota is required to be a member of TFFR and is assessed at a rate of 11.75% of salary as defined by NDCC 15-39.1-04. Every governmental body employing a teacher must also pay into TFFR a sum equal to 12.75% of the teacher's salary. Member and employer contributions will be reduced to 7.75% each when the fund reaches 100% funded ratio on an actuarial basis. A vested member who terminates covered employment may elect a refund of contributions paid plus 6% or defer pay- ment u ntil eligible for pension benefits. A nonvested member who terminates covered employment must claim a refund of contributions paid before 70\u00bd. Refunded members forfeit all service credits under TFFR. These service credits may be repurchased upon return to covered employment under certain circumstance defined by state statue.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PLAN ASSET MATTERS BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The public employee retirement systems described above are considered part of the State of North Dakota's reporting entity and are included in the State's financial statements as pension trust funds. The financial statements of these systems are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Employee contributions are recognized as revenues in the period in which they are due. Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contribution. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plans. INVESTMENT POLICY The System's Board is responsible for establishing the investment policy for the fund assets, which includes setting investment goals and specifying the percentage of assets to be invested in various types of investments for PERS, NDHPRS and JSND. The investment goals are viewed over the long term. The Board recognizes the plans' performance objectives, benefit projections, and capital market expectations when determining the asset allocation. The SIB is responsible for managing the System's investments in accordance with the investment policy. The TFFR Board is responsible for establishing investment policy for the fund assets under NDCC 15-39.1-05.2. Benefit payments are projected to occur over a long period of time. This allows TFFR to adopt a long-term investment horizon and asset allocation policy for the management of fund assets. Asset allocation policy is critical because it defines the basic risk and return characteristics of the investment portfolio. Asset allocation targets are established using an asset-liability analysis designed to assist the Board in determining an acceptable volatility target for the fund and an optimal asset allocation policy mix. This asset-liability analysis considers both sides of the plan balance sheet, utilizing both 107STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA quantitative and qualitative inputs, in order to estimate the potential impact of various asset class mixes on key measures of total plan risk, including the resulting established impact of funded status and contribution rates. The following was the asset allocation policy as of June 30, 2019: Target Allocation PERS for further details of the RHIC OPEB Plan. INVESTMENT RA TE OF RETURN The m oney-weighted rate of return expresses investment performance, net of investment expense, adjusted for the changing amounts actually invested. The annual money-weighted rate of return on pension plan investments, net of pension plan investment expense, was as follows for June further details of the RHIC OPEB Plan. MET HO D USED TO VALUE INVESTMENTS Investments are recorded at fair value determined by reference to published market data for publicly traded securities and through the use of independent valuation services and appraisals for other investments. The net increase in fair value of investments consists of the realized gains or losses and the unrealized increase or decrease in fair value of investments during the year. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed based on the difference between the sales price and the original cost of the investment sold. Realized gains and losses on investments that had been held in more than one fiscal year and sold in the current fiscal year were included as a change in the fair value of investments reported in the prior year(s) and the current year. Unrealized gains and losses are computed based on changes in the fair value of investments between years. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Interest income is recognized when earned. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are components of net change in fair value of investments and are computed as described in note 1. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the following are the net realized Contribution Plan 230,794 Deferred Compensation Plan 6,454,352 108STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA C. FUNDING STATUS AND PROGRESS NET PENSION LIABILITY OF THE PLANS The c om ponents of the net pension liability of the Plans at June 30, 2019 were as follows (expressed in thousands): PERS NDHPRS JSND TFFR Total 3,993,424 Plan fiduciary net position (3,096,731) (81,415) (97,203) (2,616,171) Net pension liability (asset) $ 1,172,609 $ 24,900 $ (31,006) $ 1,377,253 Plan fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability 72.53% 76.58% 146.84% 65.50% ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS PERS The t otal pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no assets smoothing) Inflation: 2.50% Salary Increase: 4.00% to 20.00% including inflation Retirement Age: Age-based tale of rates that specify to the type of eligible condition Investment Rate of Return: 7.75% Mortality Rates: Mortality rates for active members, inactive members and healthy retirees were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table, set back two years for males and three years for females, projected generationally using the SSA 2014 Intermediate Cost scale from 2014. For disabled retirees, mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Disabled Mortality Table, set back one year for males (no setback for females) multiplied by 125%. Other Notes: The calculation of Final Average Salary was changed for members who terminate after December 31,2019. The interest rate on member contributions will decrease from 7.25% to 7.00% effective January 1, 2020. The benefit accrual rate for members first enrolled on or after January 1, 2020 in the Main and Public Safety Systems is 1.75% (compared to 2.00% for members enrolled before January 1, 2020. The investment return assumption was updated from 7.75% to 7.50% beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019. The economic assumptions (excluding salary increases) were updated beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2017 based on a review performed by GRS. All other actuarial assumptions were adopted by the Board based on an experience study covering the period July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014. The employer rates to the System are the statutory/Board approved contribution rates of 7.12% of payroll for the Main System (8.26% for members enrolled on or after January 1, 2020), 17.52% for the Judges System, 9.81% for the Public Safety with prior Main System, and 7.93%for the Public Safety without prior Main System service System. HPRS The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal 109STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no assets smoothing) Inflation: 2.50% Salary Increase: Service-based table for members with less than five years of service and age-based table for members with more than five years of service Retirement Age: Age-based tale of rates that specify to the type of eligible condition Investment Rate of Return: 7.75% Mortality Rates: Mortality rates for active members, inactive members and healthy retirees were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table, set back two years for males and three years for females, projected generationally using the SSA 2014 Intermediate Cost scale from 2014. For disabled retirees, mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Disabled Mortality Table, set back one year for males (no setback for females) multiplied by 125%. Other Notes: There were no benefit changes during the year. The economic assumptions (excluding salary increases) were updated beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2017 based on a review performed by GRS. The investment return assumption was decreased from 7.75% to 7.50% beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019. All other actuarial assumptions were adopted by the Board based on experience study covering the period July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014. The employer rate to the System is the statutory contribution rate of 19.70% payroll. JSND The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no assets smoothing) Inflation: 2.50% Salary Increase: 3.50% Retirement Age: Age-based tale of rates that specify to the type of eligible condition Investment Rate of Return: 4.75% Cost of Living Adjustment: 2.50% Mortality Rates: Mortality rates for active members, inactive members and healthy retirees were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table, set back two years for males and three years for females, projected generationally using the SSA 2014 Intermediate Cost scale from 2014. For disabled retirees, mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Disabled Mortality Table, set back one year for males, (no setback for females) multiplied by 125%. Other Notes: There were no benefit changes during the year. The economic assumptions (excluding salary increases) were updated beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2017 based on a review performed by GRS. The investment return assumption was decreased from 5.70% to 4.75% beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2018. All other actuarial assumptions were adopted by the Board based on experience study covering the period July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014. The System has assets in excess of the present value of future benefits. Therefore, no employer contributions are being made. 110STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA TFFR The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: 5 year smoothed market Inflation: 2.75% Salary Increase (Payroll Growth): 4.25% - 14.50%; varying by service, including inflation and productivity. Retirement Age: In the 2015 valuation, rates of retirement were changed to better reflect anticipated future experience. In the 2010 valuation, expected retirement ages of plan members were adjusted to more closely reflect actual experience. Investment Rate of Return: 7.75%, net of investments expense. Cost of Living Adjustment: None Mortality Rates: In the 2015 valuation, assumed life expectancies were adjusted as a result of adopting the RP-2014 mortality tables with generational improvement. In prior years, those assumptions were based on percentages of GRS post termination non-disabled tables and RP-2000 disabled-life tables. INVESTMENT RATE OF RETURN The long-term expected rate of return on investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimates ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expenses and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates to return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Estimates of arithmetic real rates of return, for each major asset class included in the pension plan's target asset allocation as of July 1, 2019 is summarized in the following tables: PERS and NDHPRS Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return JSND Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return TFFR Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return Domestic equity 6.25% Domestic equities 4.75% Global equity 6.90% International equity 6.95% Core fixed income 1.91% Global fixed income 2.10% Private equity 10.15% Limited duration fixed income 1.13% Global real assets 5.40% Domestic fixed income 2.11% Global equity 5.31% Cash equivalents 0.00% International fixed income 0.00% Diversified short-term fixed income 1.66% Global real assets 5.41% Short-term corporate fixed income 0.49% Cash equivalents 0.00% US high yield 3.49% Emerging market debt 4.68% DISCOUNT RATE For PERS, GASB Statement No. 67 includes a specific requirement for the discount rate that is used for the purpose of the measurement of the Total Pension Liability. This rate considers the ability of the System to meet benefit obligations in the future. To make this determination, employer contributions, employee contributions, benefit payments, expenses and investment returns are projected into the future. The current employer and employee fixed rate contributions are assumed to be made in each future year. The Plan Net Position (assets) in future years can then be determined and compared to its obligation to make benefit payments in those years. In years where assets are not projected to be sufficient to meet benefit payments, the use of a municipal bond rate is required. 111STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The Single Discount Rate (SDR) is equivalent to applying these two rates to the benefits that are projected to be paid during the different time periods. The SDR reflects (1) the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (during the period in which the fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) a tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the contributions for use with the long-term expected rate of return are not met). For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.50%; the municipal bond rate is 3.13%; and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 7.50%. For HPRS, the discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50% as of June 30, 2019. For JSND, the discount rate was 4.75% as of June 30, 2019. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member and employer contributions will be made at rates equal to those based on the July 1, 2019 Actuarial Valuation Reports. For this purpose, only employer contributions that are intended to fund benefits of current plan members and their beneficiaries are included. Projected employer contributions that are intended to fund the service costs of future plan members and their beneficiaries, as well as projected contributions from future plan members, are not included. Based on those assumptions (for JSND it is assumed no future contribution will be made), the pension plans' fiduciary net position were projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments for current plan members as of June 30, 2019. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability as of June 30, 2019. For TFFR, the discount rate was 7.75% as of June 30, 2019. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member and employer contributions will be made at rates equal to those based on the July 1, 2019 Actuarial Valuation Reports. For this purpose, only employer contributions that are intended to fund benefits of current plan members and their beneficiaries are included. Projected employer contributions that are intended to fund the service costs of future plan members and their beneficiaries, as well as projected contributions from future plan members, are not included. Based on those assumptions TFFR's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments for current plan members as of July 1, 2019. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability as of June 30, 2019.

IMP L ICIT SUBSIDY UNFUNDED PLAN The Implicit Subsidy Unfunded Plan provides health insurance coverage to eligible retirees who are not eligible for Medicare. The premiums for this coverage are set under North Dakota Century Code 54-52.1-02 as a percent of the active member single and family plan rates and are paid by the retiree. The premiums for this coverage are not age- rated. Currently, the premiums for this group do not cover the costs of the coverage; therefore, the costs of this group are being subsidized through the active group rates. This subsidy is not funded in advance and there is no guarantee that the subsidy for the 2017-19 biennium will continue in the future. A retiree must be receiving a retirement allowance from PERS, ND TFFR or TIAA-CREF to be eligible for the retiree health care coverage. Effective July 1, 2015, eligibility for this coverage is limited to employees who retired prior to July 2015 and/or former Legislators.

Withdrawal Rates: Rates of withdrawal from active service before retirement other than death, rates of disability and expected retirement ages developed on the basis of an investigation of actual plan experience. Interest Rate: 6.56% per annum, net of investment expense Inflation: 3% per annum Expenses: Prior year expense, adjusted for inflation B.

The benefit amount applied each year is shown as \"prefunded credit applied\" on the Statement of Changes in Plan Net Position for the OPEB trust funds. OPEB Benefits Retiree health insurance credit benefits and death and disability benefits are set by state statute. There are no provisions or policies with respect to automatic and ad hoc post-retirement benefit increases. Employees who are receiving monthly retirement benefits from the Public Employees Retirement System, the Highway Patrolmen's Retirement System, or the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan, the Chapter 27-17 judges or an employee receiving disability benefits, or the 120STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA spouse of a deceased annuitant receiving the surviving spouse benefit of if the member selected a joint and survivor option are eligible to receive credit toward their monthly health insurance premium under the state health plan. The benefits are equal to $5.00 for each of the employee's , or deceased employee's years of credited service not to exceed the premium in effect for selected coverage. The retiree health benefit is also available for early retirement with reduced benefits. Net OPEB Liability of the Plan The components of the net OPEB liability of the plan at June 30, 2019 is as follows (expressed in thousands): RHIC Total OPEB liability $ 217,831 Plan fiduciary net position (137,512) Net OPEB liability (asset) $ 80,319 RHIC fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total OPEB liability 63.13% Actuarial Assumptions Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no asset smoothing) RHIC Inflation: 2.50% Salary Increase: Not applicable Investment Rate of Return: 7.25%, net of investments expense, including inflation. Mortality Rates: Mortality rates for active members, inactive members and healthy retirees were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table set back two years for males and three years for females, projected generationally using the SSA 2014 Intermediate Cost scale from 2014. For disabled retirees, mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Disabled Retiree Mortality Table set back one year for males (not setback for females), multiplied by 125%. Other Notes: Beginning January 1, 2020, members first enrolled in the NDPERS Main System and the Defined Contribution Plan on or after that date will not be eligible to participate in RHIC. Therefore, RHIC will become for the most part a closed plan. There were no benefit changes during the year. The economic assumptions (excluding salary increases) and the asset smoothing method were updated beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2017 based on a review performed by GRS. The investment return assumption was decreased from 7.50% to 7.25% beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2019. All other actuarial valuations were adopted by the Board based on an experience study covering the period July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2014. The employer rate to the System is the statutory contribution rate of 1.14% of payroll. Investment Rate of Return The long-term expected investment rate of return assumption for the RHIC fund was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimates ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of RHIC investment expenses and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Estimates of arithmetic real rates of return, for each major asset class included in the RHIC's target asset allocation as of July 1, 2019 is summarized in the following table: Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return Large Cap Domestic Equities 6.00% Small Cap Domestic Equities 7.30% International equities 6.95% Core -Plus Fixed Income 2.07% 121STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Discount Rate The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 7.25%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member and statutory/Board approved employer contributions will be made at rates equal to those based on the July 1, 2019 HPRS actuarial valuation reports. For this purpose, only employer contributions that are intended to fund benefits of current RHIC members and their beneficiaries are included. Projected employer contributions that are intended to fund the service costs of future plan members and their beneficiaries are not included. Based on those assumptions, the RHIC fiduciary net position was projected to be sufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long term expected rate of return on RHIC investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability. Sensitivity of Net OPEB Liability The following presents the net OPEB liability of the Plans as of June 30, 2019, calculated using the single discount rate of 7.25%, as well as what the RHIC net OPEB liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1- percentage-point lower or 1-percentage-point higher than the current rate: Net OPEB Liability (Asset) As of June 30, 2019 1% Decrease (6.25%)Current Discount Rate (7.25%)1% Increase (8.25%) RHIC $ 102,516,136 $ 80,318,738 $ 61,317,668 The benefit provided by the North Dakota Retiree Health Insurance Credit Fund is a fixed dollar subsidy and is not affected by healthcare cost trend. Therefore, a healthcare trend rate was not performed. C.

The plan allows employees of the State of North Dakota or any of its political subdivisions, institutions, departments, or agencies to participate, providing that the employee has signed a participation agreement, which permits them to defer a portion of their current salary until future years. Each participant may defer the lessor of $19,000 or 100% of gross annual compensation for calendar year 2019. Participation in the plan is optional. The deferred compensation is not available to the employees until termination, retirement, death or unforeseeable emergency. All compensation deferred under the plans, all property and rights purchased with those amounts, and all income attributable to those amounts, property or rights, are held in trust for the exclusive use of the employee or their beneficiary. The minimum monthly member contribution to the deferred compensation plan is $25 and the maximum vesting in the employer contributions ranges from 1% to 4% of the monthly salary, or $25, depending the employees months of service.

DSUF is involved in a dispute with another member of Dickinson Investments, Granville Brinkman and other Brinkman entities (Respondent). An arbitration claim was filed on December 26, 2013. On September 30, 2014, the arbitrator awarded the Respondent a buy-out of their equity interest in the amount of $1.260 million. The Respondent was also awarded repayment of a note, prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees and costs. DSUF and Dickinson Investments are jointly and severally liable for the buyout amount. On October 28, 2014, the arbitrator issued a final arbitration award and ordered: a) prejudgment interest at 6% would commence December 26, 2013, b) the amount of attorney fees and costs to be repaid was $233,420, c) the note prepayment amount was $133,600d) the parties shared responsibility for arbitration fees and expenses totaling $67,620. The final award exceeds $1.7 million. Although DSUF has an equity interest of about 6 percent in Dickinson Investments, the arbitrator has ruled that it is jointly and severally liable for the entire award, except the $133,600 loan for which Dickinson Investments is responsible. Receivership - At the request of the NDUS Chancellor, on November 21, 2014, the North Dakota Attorney General petitioned the state district court for the appointment of a receiver. On December 3, 2014, the court appointed a receiver for DSUF. The court order included the following directives: x The receiver shall take immediate possession, custody, and control of all assets owned or held by DSUF; x The DSUF board of directors shall be temporarily suspended and have no authority to act on behalf of DSUF; x The receiver shall gather, protect and oversee DSUF's corporate and charitable assets; x The receiver shall report to the court; and x The receiver shall have all the authority necessary to continue the day-to-day activities of the DSUF. The receiver filed interim reports on a regular basis through September 2016. In the seventh interim report, dated August 31, 2015, the receiver recommended that DSUF be dissolved. This recommendation was based on an inability to negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement of the outstanding Brinkman judgment against DSUF. The report indicates that dissolution should foremost prioritize DSUF obligations to honor restrictions placed on DSUF assets by donors, then address claims made by creditors, employees, and other interested parties. However, DSUF accounting reports indicated that the foundation had total net restricted assets in an amount less than total permanently and temporarily restricted donations. The Office of Attorney General requested the commencement of dissolution for DSUF. On August 30, 2017, Stark County District Court Judge William Herauf issued an Order that, in part, approved a settlement reached between the Attorney General and the DSUF's major creditors. The Order also resolved all claims against the DSUF, allowing for the distribution of assets and final closure of the issues surrounding the DSUF. On June 20, 2017, a settlement agreement was signed by the SBHE, DSU and five financial institutions whereby an amount of $3.1 million will be paid to the financial institutions to repay the outstanding debt related to the Biesiot Activiti es Center. The 2017 North Dakota Legislative Assembly provided an appropriation to Dickinson State University for the settlement amount. The settlement was paid in July 2017 consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. DSUF's Restated Articles of Incorporation state that upon dissolution, remaining assets shall be distributed to the SBHE for the exclusive use and benefit of the Dickinson State University or its direct successors in interest. The receiver recommended that all remaining net assets of DSUF be directed to be turned over to a new 501(c)(3) tax-exempt Foundation in keeping with DSUF's Restated Articles of Incorporation. There is a cash reserve account remaining in excess of $300,000 pending the outcomes of resolving claims from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to Charitable Remainder Trusts. All tax returns have been filed by the court appointed Receiver. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has approved one of the returns and the remainder of the returns are pending review. Once all returns are approved, any remaining cash will be distributed to the DSU Heritage Foundation and a final Receiver's report will be filed to obtain Court approval of the final distribution and closing the receivership dissolution action. 128STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Financial Audit In fiscal year 2013, The DSUF's independent auditors issued a qualified opinion on the DSUF financial statements because they were unable to form an opinion regarding th e proper amount and classifi cation of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets. In fiscal year 2014, the DSUF's independent auditors were unable to issue an audit opinion on the DSUF financial statements as a result of the aforementioned arbitration and the overall condition of the DSUF financial records. An audit has not performed since fiscal year 2014. Additionally, it has been reported that DSUF may have used endowment funds as collateral to obtain financing and to meet monthly operating expenses of the foundation and one of its real estate projects. NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY AND NDSU RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY PARK, INC. On December 30, 1999, North Dakota State University (NDSU), through the State of North Dakota and North Dakota State Board of Higher Education, entered into a ground lease, whereby the NDSU Research and Technology Park (RTP), Inc. (component unit) leases 40 acres of land for $1 per year for the next seventy-five years. On July 1, 2002, NDSU and the RTP entered into an agreement for cooperation and assistance between entities. The agreement is an annual agreement, which automatically extends for one-year periods unless cancelled by either party to the agreement. During fiscal year 2017, NDSU and the RTP entered into renewed agreements, whereby NDSU leases the Research Buildings #1 and #2 through June 30, 2032. During fiscal year 2019, total annual rent of $312,000 was paid by NDSU for these two buildings, in addition to the $1.8 million of principal and interest paid by NDSU directly to the bond trustee. NDSU reimbursed the RTP $30,556 for property insurance on the two buildings and directly pays the utility costs under these agreements. The annual rent will be re-adjusted by mutual agreement every two years. These agreements are subject to funding and legislative appropriations. NDSU FOUNDATION Fargodome Lease and Improvements In fiscal year 2006, the Foundation financed the construction and equipping of office space, locker rooms, meetings rooms, and related facilities in the Fargodome for use by NDSU through the sale of revenue bonds issued by Cass County. The Foundation has leased the space in the Fargodome from the City of Fargo and subleased the space, furniture, fixtures and equipment to NDSU. Under the agreement, NDSU will pay rent to the NDSUFAA for use of the premises. The amount of the rent is tied to the $3.5 million debt service retirement plus the Fargodome annual space rent and all costs incurred by the Foundation incident to the lease, less any contributions received by the Foundation for the project. Under this agreement in fiscal year 2019, the Foundation paid the debt service and other fees on behalf of NDSU in the amount of $331,606. The facility is included in long-term investments and the debt is included in long-term liabilities on the financial reports of the Foundation. NDSU has also recorded a capital asset and a capital lease payable, reflected as \"Due to Component Units\" by NDSU, of $443,947 as of June 30, 2019. Since the foundation is a discretely presented component unit of the University System and the component unit and the University System are reporting the same assets and debt for the Fargodome improvements, a reclassification entry was made to ending balances in the component unit consolidating financial statements to show the appropriate due from primary institution. Renaissance Hall The former Northern School Supply building was donated to the Foundation by NDSU alum in December of 2001. During fiscal year 2003 and 2004, the Foundation renovated the building with the intent to lease the facility to NDSU beginning fall 2004. The Foundation transferred nearly the entire ownership of the building to 650 NP Avenue, LLC and Kilbourne Design Group, LLC, for a five-year period in order to achieve tax credits that would ultimately reduce the cost of the building to NDSU. During the five-year tax credit period, NDSU leased the building from the two LLCs, with the lease payments composed of interest and fees. With the five-year tax credit period ending December 31, 2010 (as extended), and the ownership was transferred back to the Foundation, permanent financing was put in place on December 17, 2010, with the issuance of $5.65 million of 20-year University Facilities Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 (Renaissance Hall Project). The financing structure involving the five-year temporary ownership transfer resulted in achieving tax credits of $4.9 million which directly lowered the leasing cost to NDSU. 129STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Under this refinanced debt issuance and lease agreement, as approved by the SBHE on December 16, 2010, the property is leased to NDSU for rent equal to the semi-annual principal and interest on the bonds, plus all costs incurred by the Foundation incident to ownership of the property. Ownership of the property will transfer to NDSU when the bonds are repaid in full. NDSU paid the Foundation $412,000 in fiscal year 2019 for debt service under this agreement. As of June 30, 2019 the outstanding balance on the bonds, reflected as \"Due to Component Units\" by NDSU, is $3.8 million. Barry Hall Business Building and Klai Hall Architecture Building Effective November 28, 2007, NDSU and the Foundation entered into lease agreements for two buildings in downtown Fargo, formerly known as the \"Pioneer Mutual Building\" and \"Lincoln Mutual building\". The Foundation financed the construction of the Barry Hall business building and Klai Hall architecture building projects through the sale of $18.52 million of 20-year University Facilities Revenue Bonds issue by the City of Fargo, North Dakota. The City has loaned the bond proceeds to the Foundation for payments equal to the sum of the semi-annual interest payments and installments of varying principal amounts on the variable rate bonds and the semi-annual principal and interest payments on the fixed-rate bonds. The principal payments on the variable rate bonds will be funded from payments on donor pledges restricted for the project. Under the terms of the loan, the Foundation is responsible for the real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other costs incident to ownership of the property. The property is included with property in the financial statements and the bonds have been recorded as a direct obligation of the Foundation. Ownership of the property will transfer to NDSU when the bonds are repaid in full. The bonds are guaranteed by the Foundation. This property is leased to NDSU for rental equal to the sum of the semi-annual interest only payments on the variable term bonds plus the semi- annual principal and interest payments on the fixed-rate bonds for the term of the bonds, plus all the costs incurred by the Foundation incident to ownership of the property. In May 2012, the Foundation refinanced the original bonds issued in November 2007. As a result, new leases were executed. Under the terms of the new leases, NDSU pays and recognizes a liability for entire amount of the previously issued bonds. During fiscal year 2019, NDSU paid $774,000 to the bond trustee on-behalf of the Foundation under the new leases for debt service on Barry Hall & Klai Hall. NDSU has an option to acquire the property upon full payment of the bonds. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance on the bonds, reflected as \"Due to Component Units\" by NDSU, is $8.65 million. Other Transactions The Foundation provides meeting space rental and database support service to NDSU for an annually negotiated fee. NDSU paid the foundation $679,000 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. In addition to the debt service payments on the Fargodome, Renaissance, Barry and Klai Halls, NDSU reimburses the Foundation for other operating expenses related to those buildings, such as property insurance, flood insurance, boiler inspection fees, real estate taxes and bond administrative fees. Those costs totaled $104,000 during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Foundation's fiscal year end is December 31, NDSU year end is June 30.

Payments of $133,333 are required semi-annually through 2028. The bonds are secured by a lease with UND. Annual principal and semiannual interest payments as of June 30, 2019 was $2.0 million. NOTE 12 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA The State, through the Bank of North Dakota, is a party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, financial standby letters of credit and guarantees related to loan programs. Those instruments involve varying degrees of credit, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of net position. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the State has in particular classes of off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The State's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and financial standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The State uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Contract Amount (in thou sands) Commitments to extend credit $ 861,421 Financial standby letters of credit 412,614 Guarantees provided 9,490 Comm itm ents to extend credit are agreements to lend as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained by the State upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank has segmented this category into three components: (1) letters of credit, (2) confirming letters of credit, and (3) letters of credit pledged for public deposits to North Dakota financial institutions. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party which require this type of facility. The maturities for these letters range from three months to ten years, and the likelihood of funding any of these letters of credit is considered to be remote. The Bank holds collateral supporting those commitments. The Bank also has letters of credit with the North Dakota Public Finance Authority with maturities ranging from seventeen months to twenty nine years. If the letters issued to Public Finance Authority were ever drawn upon, Public Finance Authority is legally obligated to reimburse the Bank from funds legally available, or from any appropriation made available to the Legislative Assembly after certification by the Industrial Commission. The likelihood of funding any of these letters of credit is also considered to be remote. Outstanding issued letters of credit as of December 31, 2018 were $106,834,000. Confirming letters of credit are issued to North Dakota financial institutions to support letters of credit they have issued but are still in need of backing from an institution with a long-term, high quality bond rating. In the event these letters were to be drawn upon, based on the terms of the agreement, the Bank would immediately withdraw funds from the 132STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA institution's correspondent bank account held at the Bank to cover the amount drawn. These agreements generally have terms of 12 months or less. The likelihood of funding any of these confirming letters of credit is also considered to be remote. Outstanding issued confirming letters of credit as of December 31, 2018 were $3,525,000. Letters of credit pledged for public deposit to North Dakota financial institutions are issued to support public borrowing arrangements. These letters are fully collateralized by a pool of loans pledged to the Bank. These agreement generally have terms of 12 months or less. Financial standby letters for public deposits by North Dakota banks totaled $302,255,000 at December 31, 2018. The likelihood of funding any of these letters of credit is also considered to be remote. These letters of credit are authorized form of collateral for public deposits per North Dakota Century Code 21-04-09. The Bank has not recorded a contingent liability related to off-balance sheet activity as of December 31, 2018. INFRASTRUCTURE REVOLVNG LOAN PROGRAM In the normal course of business, the Loan Fund makes various commitments that are not reflected in the financial statements. These commitments include commitments to extend credit of $38,955,000 at June 30, 2019. NORTH DAKOTA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY In the normal course of business, the Agency makes various commitments that are not reflected in the financial statements. These include commitments to extend credit and the debt reduction required when related loan acquisition funds are not drawn down within prescribed time frames set by the specific bond resolution. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to fund loans as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. Commitments require the payment of a reservation fee and generally have a fixed expiration date. Commitments to extend credit total $524,000 at June 30, 2019. The bond resolutions require that the funds in the loan acquisition accounts be expended within 42 months of the related bond delivery date. Any remaining funds must be used for debt reduction. The loan acquisition funds totaled $53,474,000 at June 30, 2019. PUBLIC FINANCE AUTHORITY In the normal course of business, the Finance Authority (a component unit) makes various commitments that are not reflected in the financial statements. These commitments include commitments to extend credit of $269,344,000 at December 31, 2018. NOTE 13 - INTEREST RATE SWAP BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA The Bank has an outstanding interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount totaling $350 million to convert variable rate federal funds into fixed-rate instruments over the term of the contract. On June 5, 2014 (\"June 2014 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on June 1, 2029, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 2.861% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 interest rate. On April 14, 2015 (\"April 2015 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on May 1, 2030, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 1.920% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 interest rate. On August 11, 2016 (\"August 2016 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on September 1, 2031, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 1.483% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-1 MONTH LIBOR-BBA interest rate. On April 5, 2017 (\"April 2017 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on May 1, 2032, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 2.390% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-1 MONTH LIBOR-BBA interest rate. 133STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA On June 15, 2017 (\"June 2017 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on July 1, 2032, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 1.985% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 interest rate. On March 27, 2018 (\"March 2018 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on April 1, 2033, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 2.468% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 interest rate. On June 28, 2018 (\"June 2018 Swap\") the Bank entered into a swap agreement which matures on July 1, 2033, and the swap's notional amount is $50,000,000. Under the terms of the swap, the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed payment of 2.515% and receives a variable payment based on the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 interest rate. At December 31, 2018, the June 2014, March 2018 and June 2018 swaps has a negative fair values of $2,180,000, $45,000 and $320,000, respectively, because interest rates have declined since the swap was executed. The April 2015, August 2016, April 2017 and June 2017 swaps has a positive fair values of $2,492,000, $6,240,000, $1,404,000 and $2,710,000, respectively, because interest rates have increased since the swap was executed. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was not exposed to material credit risk because each counterparty is required to fully collateralize the fair value of the swaps within $250,000 of daily mark-to-market valuations by depositing funds with the other counterparty. Amongst all swap counterparties for the transactions noted above, the Bank holds a net $12,150,000 in cash pledged under collateral arrangements related to the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018, to satisfy the collateral requirements. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk on its swap agreements. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk on its swap agreements. On its pay-fixed, receive variable interest rate swaps, the Bank's net payment increases as the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 and USD-1 MONTH LIBOR-BBA interest rates decrease. Either the Bank or its counterparties may terminate the interest rate swap if the other party fails to perform under the terms of the contract. Termination could result in the Bank being required to make a payment of the fair value of the swap to counterparty.

As rates vary, the federal fund and 1 month LIBOR interest expense and the net swap payments will vary. Pay Fixed Receive Variable Year Ended December 31: Contract InterestFederal Fund Interest 1-Month LIBOR Interest Interest Rate Swap, net 2019 $ 7,811,000 $ 6,000,000 $ (9,221,000) NORTH DA K OTA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY As a m eans to lower its borrowing costs, when compared against fixed-rate bonds at the time of issuance, the Agency entered into several cash flow hedges or swaps in connection with various variable-rate housing bond series. The Agency cash flow hedges are pay-fixed. All Agency cash flow hedges are pay-fixed. The intention of these swaps was to effectively change the Agency's interest rate on the bonds to a fixed rate. The Agency also has cash flow hedges that were entered into in connection with variable-rate housing bond series that no longer have bonds outstanding as those bonds have been called. The cash flow hedges that are not connected to a specific bond series hedge the risk related to the Agency's other variable-rate housing bonds that are unhedged. The bonds and the related swap agreements have a stated issuance and maturity date. Some of the swaps have optional termination dates. Under the swaps, the Agency pays the counterparty a fixed payment and receives a variable payment computed as a percent of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed percentage on the swap notional amount. On the other hand, the bond's variable-rate coupons are determined by the remarketing agent. If for any reason the remarketing agent fails to act, the rate shall be the lesser of (i) the TBMA Index plus 0.25% or (ii) the Maximum Rate as defined within the applicable series resolution. As of June 30, 2019, the Agency no swaps with a positive fair value. Of the swaps with negative fair value, the Agency is not exposed to credit risk. However, the swap exposes the Agency to basis risk should the relationship between LIBOR and TBMA converge, changing the synthetic rate on bonds. The swap counterparty has guaranteed all payments and is rated AAa/AA+/AAA by Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, respectively. To mitigate potential credit risk, the counterparty has entered into Credit Support Agreements with Bank of New York Mellon, the Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo as a credit enhancement. The Agency has entered into netting arrangements whenever it has entered into more than one derivative instrument transaction with a counterparty. Under the terms of these arrangements netting provisions permit each party to net the transactions' fair values so that a single sum will be owed by, or owed to, the other party. At June 30, 2019, the Agency owed the swap providers a fixed rate on the notional amount of the swaps of $2,566,000 and the swap providers owed the Agency a variable rate on the notional amounts of $1657,000 making the net payment that the Agency owed the swap providers $909,000. Due to the difference in the variable rate indices, the swaps had a net negative fair value of $7,886,000 as of June 30, 2019. Accordingly, the financial derivative instrument is reported as a liability and the accumulated changes in fair value of the swaps are reported as a deferred outflow at June 30, 2019. The coupon on the government's variable-rate bonds adjust to changing interest rates, the bonds do not have a corresponding fair value increase. All valuations are as of the valuation date indicated. Mid-Market or indicative unwind valuations may be derived from broker quotations or from proprietary models that take into consideration estimates about relevant present and future market conditions as well as the size and liquidity of the position and any related actual or potential hedging transactions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. The swap exposes the Agency to basis risk should the relationship between LIBOR and the actual variable rates converge, changing the synthetic rate on the bonds. The effect of this difference in basis is indicated by the difference 135STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA between the intended synthetic rate and the synthetic rate as of June 30, 2019. If a change occurs that results in the rates' moving to convergence, the expected cost savings may not be realized. The derivative contract uses the International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement, which includes standard termination events, such as failure to pay and bankruptcy. The Schedule to the Master Agreement includes an \"additional termination event.\" That is, the swap may be terminated if counterparty's credit quality rating falls below \"A3\" as issued by Moody's Investors Service or \"A-\" as issued by Fitch Ratings or Standard & Poor's. The swap may be terminated at any time by the Agency or the counterparty with 30 days written notice up to limits specified in the swap agreement. If the swap or swaps were terminated, the variable-rate bonds would no longer carry a synthetic interest rate. Also, if at the time of terminations the swap has a negative fair value, the Agency would be liable to the counterparty for payment equal to the swap's fair value, but in the event the fair value is positive, the counterparty would be liable to the Agency. The Agency is exposed to rollover risk on hedging derivative instruments that are hedges of debt that mature or may be terminated prior to maturity of the hedged debt. When these hedging derivative instruments terminate, or in the case of a termination option, if the counterparty exercises its option, the Agency will be re-exposed to the risks being hedged by the hedging derivative instrument. The Agency also is exposed to rollover risk on the swaps that mature and the Agency does not call the related variable rate debt. 136STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The terms of the interest rate swaps at June 30, 2019 are as follows: 1.

Concentrations of credit are present in the construction and operation of community water facilities, loans to medical facilities for health care construction, loans to students for post-secondary education, loans to owners of homes damaged in the 2011 floods in Barnes, Benson, Burleigh, McHenry, Morton, Ramsey, Renville, Richland and Ward counties, loans to political subdivisions in the state for infrastructure, single-family and multifamily mortgage loans, and the agricultural industry. Due to the pervasive nature of agriculture in the economy of the state, all loans, regardless of type, are impacted by agriculture. NOTE 15 - RISK MANAGEMENT Several funds accumulate assets to cover risks that the State may incur. Specifically, the State assumes a portion or substantially all risks associated with the following: THE STATE FIRE AND TORNADO FUND The State Fire and Tornado Fund, an Enterprise Fund, is financed by premiums charged to the participating funds of the State. All monies collected must be paid into the fund for use only for the purpose outlined in NDCC 26.1-22.02. All losses occasioned by the hazards provided for in the North Dakota Century Code must be paid out of the fund, with the fund being reimbursed by a third-party insurance carrier for all losses in excess of $1,000,000 per occurrence. The limit of liability of such reinsurance contract is no less than $1,000,000 during each twelve month period. STATE BONDING FUND The State Bonding Fund, an Enterprise Fund, is financed by premiums charged to each State agency for the bonding of public employees and public officials. FLEET SERVICES Fleet Services, an Internal Service Fund, represents the State's fleet of automobiles and is administered by the Department of Transportation. The State is self-insured for substantially all automobile insurance (e.g., comprehensive, collision), with the exception of liability, which is provided by the State's Risk Management Fund (RMF). State agencies are charged premiums to cover Fleet Service's RMF assessment and to pay for those losses that are not covered by RMF. These premium charges are factored into the fees agencies are charged when renting the cars. WORKFORCE SAFETY & INSURANCE Workforce Safety & Insurance (WSI), an Enterprise Fund, is a State insurance fund and a \"no fault\" insurance system, covering the State's employers and employees. WSI is financed by premiums assessed to employers. The rate of such premiums is periodically adjusted to assure the solvency of WSI. The premiums are available primarily for the payment of 138STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA claims to employees injured in the course of employment. During fiscal year 2019, a total of $147,666,582 in claims was recognized. The liability of $1,090,944,000 is the present value of the unpaid claim liability discounted at 5% as determined by the actuarial. RISK MANAGEMENT FUND Due to the loss of sovereign immunity, the 1995 Legislature established the Risk Management Fund (RMF) to pay money damages for tort claims for which the State is liable. The statutory liability of the State is limited to a total of $250,000 p er person and $1,000,000 per occurrence. The State purchases commercial insurance for claims in excess of coverage provided by the Fund and continues to transfer liabilities for medical malpractice and aviation to private insurance carriers. Settlements have not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. Revenues to the RMF are generated from contributions required from state agencies, boards and commissions, and the University System. The need for and amount of funding is determined using a projected cost allocation approach. The premise of this plan is that the agencies with greater expected loss costs should contribute more to the funding of the RMF than those agencies with lessor costs. The underlying logic is that contributions should roughly equal loss costs plus the expenses of administering the program over the long term. The RMF liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Unpaid claim liabilities are based on an actuarial study of the outstanding loss reserve need for the fund and a forecast of ultimate loss and loss expense. These liabilities were determined on an undiscounted expected level of ultimate loss. Because actual claims liabilities are affected by complex factors including inflation, changes in legal doctrines, and unanticipated damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in exact amounts. Claims liabilities will be re-evaluated periodically to take in consideration settled claims, the frequency of claims, and other economic and social factors. The following table presents the changes in claims liabilities balance for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2018 and 2019: Fiscal Year Beginning Balance Current Year Claims and Changes In Estimates Claims Payments Ending Balance 2018 $ 4,076,985 $ 923,270 $ (743,861) $ 4,256,394 2019 4,256,394 3,767,002 The Risk Management Workers Compensation Program (WCP) was established to consolidate all state entities under one workers compensation account, allowing for transitional duty between entities. The statutory liability of the fund is limited to $100,000 per claim with Workforce Safety & Insurance, providing excess insurance for claims that exceed the $100,000 cap. WCP pays separately for this coverage. Since the inception of WCP on July 1, 2001, forty claims exceeded coverage by $10,687,695. Revenues to WCP are generated from contributions required from state agencies, boards, commissions, and the University System. The amount contributed from each agency is actuarially determined by Workforce Safety & Insurance and based upon the number of employees, the type of work done, and claims history of each entity. Each entity also pays a deductible of $250 per claim. The WCP liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Because actual claims liabilities are affected by complex factors including inflation, changes in legal doctrine, and unanticipated damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in exact amounts. Claims liabilities will be re-evaluated periodically to take into consideration settled claims, the frequency of claims, and other economic and social factors. An actual study was performed for Workforce Safety & Insurance. The liability estimates are based on that study. The following table presents the changes in claims liabilities balance for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2018 and 2019: Fiscal Year Beginning Balance Current Year Claims and Changes in Estimates Claims Payments Ending Balance 2018 $ 5,358,784 $ 2,945,274 4,358,636 139STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTE 16 - PUBLIC ENTITY RISK POOLS A. GENERAL FIRE AND TORNADO AND BONDING FUND The Fire and Tornado Fund provides property insurance to state agencies, political subdivisions, the International Peace Garden and the Winter Show. The Fire and Tornado Fund has issued 1,161 policies to participating entities for a total building and content coverage of $15.2 billion. The Bonding Fund is used to provide fidelity bonding of public employees and officials. The Fund has issued 1,892 policies to participating entities. The total coverage for the Bonding Fund is $674.9 million. If the assets of these funds were exhausted, fund participants would not be responsible for the funds' liabilities. The Fire and Tornado and Bonding Fund are accounted for on the accrual basis. The Fire and Tornado Fund establishes claim liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been reported but not settled, and of claims incurred but not reported. The Bonding Fund establishes claim liabilities based on actual judgments obtained against the fund but not paid prior to fiscal year end. Liabilities for incurred but not reported losses have not been established based on prior year activity. Neither fund incurred any acquisition costs, which should have been capitalized, nor were any liabilities recognized that were discounted. Investment income was not considered in determining the existence of premium deficiencies. The Fire and Tornado Fund uses reinsurance agreements to reduce its on covered losses in excess of $1.0 million. Reinsurance permits recovery of a portion of losses from reinsurers, although it does not discharge the primary liability of the Fund as direct insurer of the risks that are reinsured. The Fire and Tornado Fund does not report reinsured risks as liabilities unless it is probable that those risks will not be covered by reinsurers. There were no pending losses at June 30, 2019 that would reduce the fund's liability. WORKFORCE SAFETY & INSURANCE Workforce Safety & Insurance (WSI), an Enterprise Fund, is a state insurance fund and a \"no fault\" insurance system covering the State's employers and employees. At June 30, 2019, coverage extended to the following employers: Annual Premium $250 381 Total Employers 24,467 WSI is financed by premiums assessed to the employers doing business in North Dakota. The premiums are available primarily for the payment of claims to employees injured in the course of employment. The operations of WSI are accounted for on the accrual basis. Liability for incurred loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) is estimated by WSI's actuary. The estimate is developed by WSI's actuary, taking into consideration past experience of WSI in paying claims, and general conditions of the environment in which WSI operates. The liability is based on the estimated ultimate costs to settle both reported and incurred but not report (IBNR) losses and LAE, and includes the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. The actuarial computations also include a 4.5% discount to report this liability at its present value. A 5% discount rate has been used in prior years; however, in 2019, the rate was reduced to 4.5% discount. The result of the discount rate decrease, increased liabilities by $44.3 million. Management believes the estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expense is sufficient to cover the ultimate net cost of incurred losses, but such loss reserves are necessarily based on estimates and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the amounts estimated. As adjustments to this estimated liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in current operations. For the year ended June 30, 2019, the consulting actuaries presented an estimate in the form of a range to emphasize the uncertainty for a \"long-tailed\" liability insurer such as workers' compensation. These ranges are as follows (expressed in thousands): Low Central Value High Full value basis, undiscounted $ 1,602,041 $ 1,726,416 $ 1,821,531 1,013,686 1,090,944 1,151,057 140STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA WSI has adjusted the estimated liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense to the actuary's 4.5 percent discounted expected value of $1,090,944,000 at June 30, 2019. While management has recorded amounts that fall within the ranges of estimated liabilities as computed under actuarial assumptions, the high level of uncertainty indicates that actual losses and expenses could be materially higher than the recorded estimated liability. WSI has entered into a contract with an intermediary for reinsurance coverage for catastrophic coverage. Historically, WSI has had up to four coverage levels, with varying retention limits of $3 million, $5 million, $10 million and $20 million. Terms, limits and pricing are re-evaluated annually. WSI's current 2019 calendar year has two coverage levels, with retention limits of $10 million and $20 million. For the year ended June 30, 2019 WSI recorded ceded losses of $1,037,258 and ceded premiums of ($184,860). For accident years December 1, 1999 to December 1, 2002, Munich Re provided treaty excess of loss reinsurance to WSI. In fiscal year 2019, Munich Re and WSI agreed to commute the remaining liabilities under these treaties. As a result of this commutation, cash increased by $50.5 million and approximately $40 million of ceded liabilities were assumed by WSI. B.

The Bank of North Dakota is the only government-owned bank in the United States. Banks do not present a classified statement of net position because current assets are not matched with current liabilities. Presentation of a classified statement of net position would give the false impression that there is a liquidity problem at the bank. Presentation of a classified statement of net position for the Bank of North Dakota would be misleading to the extent that the financial statements may be materially misstated. Therefore, the statement of net position of the Bank of North Dakota presents assets and liabilities in order of their relative liquidity, rather than in a classified format. 141STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTE 18 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES A.

LITIGATION The estimated loss in all of the litigation against the State in which a loss to the State that is reasonably possible to resul t in an unfavorable outcome is estimated to be $5 million. C. QUESTIONED COSTS The State receives federal financial assistance which is subject to review and audit by the Office of the State Auditor and the federal government. This assistance is generally conditioned upon compliance with certain laws and regulations. Disallowed and questioned costs relating to federal assistance could become a liability to the State. The State estimates that the ultimate disallowances pertaining to federal assistance, if any, will be immaterial to its overall financial condition . The single audit of the State of North Dakota for the two-year period ending June 30, 2018, was completed and issued in March of 2019. As a result of this audit, approximately $1.9 million of identifiable questioned costs were noted. Also, there were several findings which had potentially significant, unknown, questioned costs. The State is cooperating with the federal government to resolve the findings and is optimistic these findings will not have a material impact on the State. 143STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTE 19 - TOBACCO SETTLEMENT In November 1998, the North Dakota Attorney General joined forty-five other states and five territories in a settlement agreement against the nation's largest tobacco manufacturer. The settlement money is intended to compensate the State for costs it has incurred in providing health and other services to its citizens that were necessitated by the use of tobacco products. The Master Settlement Agreement includes base payments to states totaling $220.6 billion for the next 25 years, and continues in perpetuity. The State has received total payments of $495.93 million as of June 30, 2019. The State recognized revenue of $20.75 million of tobacco settlement revenue during the year ended June 30, 2019. The amount of the annual payment is subject to a number of modifications, including adjustments for inflation and usage volumes. Some of the adjustments may result in increases in the payments (inflation, for example), or other adjustments will likely cause decreases in the payments (e.g., volume adjustments). The net effect of these adjustments on future payments is unclear. NOTE 20 - TERMINATION BENEFITS PRIMARY GOVERNMENT (EXCLUDING UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS) On June 29, 2018, the State offered a Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSIP) to state agencies as a tool to assist them when planning for the 2019-21 biennium budget. Agencies independently determined whether or not it is beneficial to offer the program to their employees. This was determined based on each agency's budget planning process and specific business objectives. Under the VSIP, employees were given two options. The first option was to receive lump sum equal to three (3) month's salary and payment equivalent to three (3) months of health insurance at the actual cost of the current health insurance benefit as of VSIP program start date. Participating part-time employees will receive a pro-rated amount based on their current average monthly rate of pay over the last three months. The second option was to remain on payroll for three (3) months after separation date and receive salary and currently enrolled benefits as if still actively working during this time. Participating part-time employees will receive a pro-rated amount based on their current average monthly rate of pay over the last three months. The separation agreement of program participants must be no later than April 30, 2019. In total, 218 employees from 18 state agencies elected to participate in the VSIP for a total cost of $4.6 million in fiscal year 2019. The terms for these agreements range a payment one to three months. The State recorded a liability at June 30, 2019 of $252,000 for future payments. UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS Termination benefits are benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily or voluntarily terminated, as a result of budget reductions. Termination benefits agreements may include contract buyouts, retirement incentives, severance lump-sum payouts and continuing healthcare coverage for a designated period of time or a combination of these benefits. The agreement terms vary by institution. The outstanding liability is measured at the discounted present value and projected increases in health insurance rates. The University Systems entered into voluntary termination agreements with 109 employees for a cost of $4.2 million in fisc al year 2019. The terms for these agreements range from one month to eighteen months. The University Systems recorded a liability at June 30, 2019 of $2.1 million for future payments. During the same time-period, The University Systems entered into involuntary separation agreements with 10 employees for a cost of $146,000. The payments of benefits were for a one-month time period and there is no future liability for these arrangements at June 30, 2019. In fiscal year 2019, NDUS incurred $718,000 in expenses related to voluntary termination agreements entered into in prior fiscal years for 26 employees. The terms for these agreements range from three month to thirty-eight months. At June 30, 2019, the liability for future payments was $456,000. NOTE 21 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA In May and October 2019 the Bank entered into interest rate swaps with Goldman Sachs, which resulted in a total fixed rate funding commitment of $100 million for 15 years. These transactions were completed to hedge fixed rate loan exposure, primarily in mortgage and DEAL loans. The Bank also has seven other interest rate swaps for the same purpose with a notional amount of $50 million each with Goldman Sachs (3), Wells Fargo (3) and SunTrust Bank (1). As of October 31, 2019, the market value position of all interest rate swap transactions was a net loss of $35.3 million. The 2015 Legislature authorized a transfer of up to $100 million from the Bank to fund an Infrastructure Loan Fund for North Dakota cities and counties. They also transferred an additional $50 million from the Strategic Investment and 144STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Improvement Fund to this same revolving loan fund. So far, the Bank has committed to $186 million of infrastructure loans. The legislation mandated that the money from the Strategic Investment and Improvement Fund be used to fund the initial $50 million of commitments and the drawdown of up to $100 million from the Bank to fund activity over the initial $50 million. As of October 31, 2019, the Bank has transferred $48 million of its capital to fund its portion of the Infrastructure Loan Fund. In the 2019 Legislature, legislation passed to add up to $40 million of additional contribution from the Strategic Investment and Improvement Fund should oil tax collections exceed $755 million. Oil tax collections exceeded $780 million, which resulted in an additional contribution of $25 million to the Infrastructure Loan Fund. That $25 million will be spent prior to drawing the remaining $52 million from the Bank's retained earnings. The 2019 Legislature allowed the Reinsurance Association to establish a credit line at the Bank in the amount of $25 million to provide reimbursements to member insurers. As of October 31, 2019, the Reinsurance Association has not applied for this line of credit. NORTH DAKOTA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY The Agen c y issued Series 2019F Homeownership Revenue Bonds totaling $80 million. The bonds have an interest rate ranging from 1.15% to 3.75% and mature between July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2050. UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS On A ugust 21, 2019, WSC issued tax exempt certificates of participation series 2019 totaling $7.3 million. The proceeds will fund an infrastructure and energy improvement project, including renovations to existing heating, ventilation, controls and deferred maintenance improvements to buildings located on WSC's campus. WSC entered into a lease-purchase agreement on August 1, 2019, with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI). JCI will construct the project and provide operations and maintenance assistance through August 1, 2048. The certificates of participation were rated BBB by Standard and Poor's. On October 1, 2019, the University of North Dakota issued $71.5 million, Series 2019A Housing and Auxiliary Facilities Revenue Bonds. The proceeds will be used to demolish the current student union building and to construct a new student union building. The bond payments commence on April 1, 2020 and mature on April 1, 2050. The security for the bonds is pledged revenues from net housing and auxiliary facilities system and pledged fees. The bonds were issued with a Moody's Investor Services rating of Aa3 with a stable outlook. PUBLIC FINANCE AUTHORITY Subsequent to year end, the Agency issued $2.515 million of bonds payable for its capital financing program. The bonds have an interest rate ranging from 1.75% to 4.0% and mature between 2020 and 2024. REBUILDERS LOAN PROGRAM As o f October 31, 2019, the outstanding loans total $25.5 million to 1,184 borrowers. The 2019 legislature allowed an additional $3.75 million in rebuilders loans for severe flooding in northwestern North Dakota. As a result, an additional 5 loans totaling $375,000 have been applied for under this program. NOTE 22 - NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS The Stat e implemented the following new pronouncement for fiscal year 2019: GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations , addresses accounting and financial reporting for certain asset retirement obligations (AROs). This Statement establishes criteria for determining the timing and pattern of recognition of a liability and corresponding deferred outflow of resources for AROs. It also establishes disclosure of information about the nature of a government's AROs, the methods and assumptions used for the estimates of the liabilities, and the estimated remaining useful life of the associated tangible capital assets. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, including Direct Borrowings and Direct Placements , improves the information that is disclosed in notes to government financial statements related to debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information related to debt. This Statement requires that additional essential information related to debt be disclosed in notes to financial statements, including unused lines of credit; assets pledged as collateral for the debt; and terms specified in debt agreements related to significant events of default with finance-related consequences, significant 145STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA termination events with finance-related consequences, and significant subjective acceleration clauses. This Statement is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged. The State will implement the following new pronouncements for fiscal years ending after 2019: GASB Stat ement N o. 84, Fiduciary Activities , provides guidance regarding the identification of fiduciary activities for accounting and financial reporting purposes and how those activities should be reported. This Statement establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities of all state and local governments. The focus of the criteria generally is on (1) whether a government is controlling the assets of the fiduciary activity and (2) the beneficiaries with whom a fiduciary relationship exists. Separate criteria are included to identify fiduciary component units and postemployment benefit arrangements that are fiduciary activities. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 87, Leases , establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. This Statement requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources based on the payment provisions of the contract. Under this Statement, a lessee is required to recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and consistency of information about governments' leasing activities. This Statement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Construction Period , establishes accounting requirements for interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period. This Statement requires that interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period be recognized as an expense in the period in which the cost is incurred for financial statements prepared using the economic resources measurement focus. As a result, interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period will not be included in the historical cost of a capital asset reported in a business-type activity or enterprise fund. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 90, Majority Equity Interests , establishes accounting requirements for interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period. This Statement provides guidance for reporting when a government has majority equity interest in legally separate organizations. An equity interest is explicit and measurable if the government has a present or future claim to the net resources of the entity and the method for measuring the government's share of the entity's net resources is determinable. If government's holding of that equity interest meets the definition of an investment, as defined by GASB No. 72, the equity interest should be reported as an investment and measured using the equity method and not as a component unit of the government. If a government's holding of a majority interest in a legally separate organization does not meet the definition of an investment, the holding of the majority equity interest results in the government being financially accountable for the organization and therefore, the government should report the legally separate organization as a component unit. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 91, Conduit Debt Obligations , provides a single method of reporting conduit debt obligations by issuers and eliminates diversity in practice associated with (1) commitments extended by issuers, (2) arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations, and (3) related note disclosures. This Statement clarifies the existing definition of a conduit debt obligation; establishes that a conduit debt obligation is not a liability of the issuer; establishes standard s for accounting and financial reporting of additional commitments and voluntary commitments extended by issuers and arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations; and improves required note disclosures. This Statement also addresses arrangements\u2014often characterized as leases\u2014that are associated with conduit debt obligations. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Earlier application is encouraged. Management has not yet determined the effect these St atements will have on the State's financial statements. 146Stat e of North Dakota Required Supplementary Information 147Required Supplemental Information Approved Appropriation Adjusted Actual Difference Budget Adjustments Budget Biennium Uncollected/ 2017-2019 Thru 6-30-19 Budgetary Fund Balance, July 1 30,890,381 $ - $ 30,890,381 $ 217,617,800 $ 186,727,419 $ Financial Institutions Tax - - - - - Oil And Gas Production Tax 163,000,000 49,147,128 Aeronautics Commission 900,000 - Department of Transportation 38,016,031 $ 178,993,924 $ 801,236,291 $ 622,242,367 $ STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA General Fund For the Biennium Ended June 30, 2019Budgetary Comparison Schedule 148Required Supplemental Information General Fund Explanation of Differences between Budgetary Inflows and Outflows and GAAP Revenues and for the General Fund Expenditures Sources/Inflows of resources Actual Amounts (budgetary basis) \"total revenue inflows\" 4,913,448,662 from the budgetary comparison schedule Backing out 2018 activity (2,348,637,808) Differences-Budget to GAAP: The period of availabilit y for revenue recognition for budget purposes differs from (439,454,229) the GAAP basis.

The only major fund with a legally adoptedbudget is the General Fund. All other funds are budgeted together as \"Other Budgeted Funds.\" A budgetaryschedule has been done for these other funds because they include budgeted amounts for the Federal Fundand State Funds, which are major special revenue funds. These amounts are reported on the schedules entitled \"Federal Funds\" and \"State Funds\". North Dakota's Appropriation Acts include a dual legal level of budgetary control - one at the General Fund versus Other Budget Income level for each agency and one at the line item level for each agency. Line items are not separate between General Fund and Other Budgeted Income so that control is not presentedin our budgetary comparison schedule for major funds. The legal level of control for all agencies is reportedin a publication titled \"State of North Dakota 2017-2019 Biennium Budget and Actual Detail (BudgetaryBasis) For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019.\" This budget information is available through the Office of Management and Budget, 600 East Boulevard Ave Dept. 110, Bismarck, ND 58505. For the 2017-2019biennium there were general, federal, and special fund supplemental appropriations of $790,712,092. The Budgetary Comparison Schedule reports expenditures on a budgetary basis.

The rows of the tables are defined as follows: (1) This line shows the total of each fiscal year's earned contribution revenues and investment revenues. (2) This line shows each fiscal year's other operation costs of the fund including overhead and claims expense not allocable to individual claims. (3) This line shows the funds' incurred claims and allocated claim adjustment expense (both paid and accrued) as originally reported at the end of the first year in which the event that triggered coverage under the contract occurred (called policy year). (4) This section of 10 columns shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years for each policy year. (5) This section of 10 columns shows how each policy year's incurred claims increased or decreased as of the end of successive years. This annual re-estimation results from new information received regarding unknown claims, reevaluation of existing information on known claims, as well as emergence of new claims not previously known. (6) This line compares the latest re-estimated incurred claims amount to the amount originally established (line 3) and shows whether this latest estimate of claims cost is greater or less than originally thought. As data for individual policy years mature, the correlation between original estimates and re-estimated amounts is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of incurred claims currently recognized in less mature policy years. The columns of the tables show data for successive policy years (expressed in thousands). 236STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Statistical Section Schedule 17 Claims Development Information Last Ten Fiscal Years (Expressed In Thousands) Bonding Fund 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 1Net Earned Required Contribution and Investment Revenues 214$ 202$ 195$ 140$ 133$ 70 $ 173 $ 101 $ 42 $ 204 $ 2Unallocated Expenses 34 25 28 22 33 36 67 26 21 25 3Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense, End of Policy Year 49 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 21 87 39 4Paid (Cumulative) as of: End of Policy Year (148) (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) (19) (59) One Year Later (148) (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) (19) Two Years Later (148) (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) Three Years Later (148) (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) Four Years Later (148) (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) Five Years Later (148) (179) (202) (157) (32) Six Years Later (148) (179) (202) (157) Seven Years Later (148) (179) (202) Eight Years Later (148) (179) Nine Years Later (148) 5Reestimated Incurred Claims and Expenses: End of Policy Year 49 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) 87 39 One Year Later 49 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) 87 Two Years Later 49 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) Three Years Later 49 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 Four Years Later 49 22 4 (115) 39 94 Five Years Later 49 22 4 (115) 39 Six Years Later 49 22 4 (115) Seven Years Later 48 22 4 Eight Years Later 48 22 Nine Years Later 48 6Increase in Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense From End of Policy Year 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 237STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Statistical Section Schedule 17 Claims Development Information Last Ten Fiscal Years (Expressed In Thousands) Fire and Tornado Fund 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 1Net Earned Required Contribution 912 1,348 1,118 874 3Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense, End of 4,946 4,492 Nine Years Later 4,946 5Reestimated Incurred Claims 4,946 4,516 Nine Years Later 4,946 6Increase in Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense From End of Policy Year 1,559 (147) 549 511 125 582 191 (58) 0 0 238STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Statistical Section Schedule 17 Claims Development Information Last Ten Fiscal Years (Expressed In Thousands) Workforce Safety & Insurance 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 1Net Earned Required Contribution and Investment Revenues 289 $ 357 $ 341 $ 443 $ 502 $ 408 $ 377 $ 396 $ 343 $ 386 $ 2Unallocated Expenses 33 30 33 52 41 41 43 47 44 45 3Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense, End Of Policy Year 160 192 230 300 338 315 229 198 193 187 4Paid (Cumulative) as of: End of Policy Year 31 39 44 53 65 61 41 40 42 42 One Year Later 52 65 87 99 111 102 74 65 68 Two Years Later 60 76 102 117 128 120 84 73 Three Years Later 65 85 111 128 140 132 84 Four Years Later 69 90 116 136 148 140 Five Years Later 73 94 120 142 154 Six Years Later 76 96 123 146 Seven Years Later 77 98 125 Eight Years Later 78 100 Nine Years Later 79 5Reestimated Incurred Claims and Expenses: End of Policy Year 160 192 230 300 338 315 229 198 192 187 One Year Later 151 192 258 293 321 283 204 177 179 Two Years Later 195 193 344 288 299 271 191 164 Three Years Later 193 187 241 272 291 267 174 Four Years Later 142 174 228 266 285 265 Five Years Later 139 181 221 261 277 Six Years Later 137 174 214 253 Seven Years Later 134 171 206 Eight Years Later 132 164 Nine Years Later 126 6Increase in Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense From End of Policy Year (34) (28) (24) (47) (61) (50) (54) (34) (14) - 239STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Statistical Section Schedule 18 Agricultural Production Value of Export Shares of Agricultural Commodities - 2017 - 2018 2017 2017 2018 2018 Dollars % of U.S. Dollars % of U.S. (Mil.)

This report has been prepared by the Office of Management and Budget. The financial statements contained in the CAFR have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to state and local governments, as promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Responsibility for both the accuracy of the data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with the state's management. To the best of our knowledge and belief, the information contained in the CAFR is accurate in all material respects and reported in a manner that presents fairly the financial position and results of operations of the State's primary government and the component units for which it is financially accountable. All disclosures necessary to enable the reader to gain an understanding of the State of North Dakota's financial affairs have been included. The state's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the government are protected from loss, theft or misuse and to ensure that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America . The internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management. In compliance with state statute, the Office of the State Auditor (SAO) audited the State's financial statements. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of the State for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Their examination was conducted in accordance with GAAP and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards as published by the Comptroller General of the United States. The SAO concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that the State's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent auditor's report is presented as the first component of the financial section of this report The State of North Dakota is also required to undergo a single audit in conformity with the provision of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (contained in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200). Information related to this single audit, including a schedule of expenditures of federal awards, the independent auditor's reports on internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and a schedule of findings and questioned costs, are included in a separately issued biennial single audit report. Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) immediately follows the Independent Auditor's Report and provides a narrative introduction, overview and analysis of the basic financial statements. This letter of transmittal is intended to complement MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. 7PROFILE OF THE GOVERNMENT The State of North Dakota provides for a full range of services, including education, health and social services, highway maintenance and construction, law enforcement, judicial, public safety, business regulation, community and economic development, and natural resource development. The State's reporting entity reflected in the CAFR includes all the funds of the state as legally defined, as well as all of its component units in conformity with the requirements of GASB Statement No. 61. Statement No. 61 provides that the financial statements should emphasize the primary government and permit financial statement users to distinguish between the primary government and its component units. Consequently, the transmittal letter, MD&A, and the financial statements focus on the primary government and its activities. Although information pertaining to the discretely presented component units is provided, their separately issued financial statements should be read to obtain a complete overview of their financial position. The State's reporting entity is described more fully in Note 1A to the basic financial statements. The State operates through a biennial appropriation, which represents agency appropriations recommended by the governor and presented to the Legislative Assembly at the beginning of each legislative session. The budget is legally required to be adopted through passage of appropriation bills by the Legislative Assembly and signed by the governor. The governor has line item veto powers over all appropriations subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the appropriation bill becomes the departments' financial plan for the next two years. Changes to the appropriation are limited to Emergency Commission authorization, initiative, allotment, or referendum action. The State does not budget by fund nor does it formally budget revenues. The legal level of budgetary control is at the agency, appropriation authority and expenditure line item level. The State's budgetary policies and procedures are further explained in Note 1D on the notes to the basic financial statements. LOCAL ECONOMY Although North Dakota's economy is increasingly diversified, the agricultural industry continues to play a key role in the state's economy. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service reports that for 2019 crop production, North Dakota led the nation in production of all dry edible beans, pinto beans, canola, flaxseed, honey, oats, non-oil sunflower, Durum wheat, and spring wheat. North Dakota also ranked second in the production of black beans, navy beans, lentils, dry edible peas, all sunflowers, oil sunflowers, and all wheat. The energy industry plays an important role in the state's economy. The development of wind and coal resources, the production of ethanol and bio-diesel, and oil and natural gas extraction all contribute to the state's economy. North Dakota reached an all-time high for oil production which averaged over 1.52 million barrels of oil produced per day in November 2019. North Dakota's current crude oil production ranks second in the nation, behind first-ranked Texas. Oil prices have rebounded since the crash of oil prices at the end of fiscal year 2020 when North Dakota producers were receiving prices below $15 per barrel. Prices averaged around $50 per barrel at the start of the 2019-21 biennium before the crash. In September 2020, the actual average price per barrel for North Dakota oil was $32.83, below the estimated price of $48.00 used for budgeting purposes. According to the United States Census Bureau, the state's estimated population for 2019 was approximately 762,000 people, which is an all-time high. Health care and social assistance jobs account for the highest percent of employment in the state. Other leading areas of employment are retail trade, accommodation and food services, educational services, construction and manufacturing. The unemployment rate for the state in October 2020 was 4.0%, compared to 6.6% for the United States. A listing of the state's 20 largest employers demonstrates the diversity of the economy. Top employers include: health care providers, the state university system, the U.S military, manufacturers, financial and insurance companies, U.S postal service, information technology companies, mining, energy producers, and retail companies. 8Uncertainty within international markets, resulted in a decrease in exporting in North Dakota in 2019. The United States Census Bureau showed that North Dakota's exports were down overall by about $1.1 billion for a total of $6.7 billion in 2019. This represents a decrease of 14.5% over 2018. LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING The long-term financial plan for the state of North Dakota was outlined by Governor Burgum as part of the 2019-21 executive budget address, presented to the legislature in December 2018. The Governor's long-term financial plan includes the following key components: x Balancing ongoing revenues and expenses of state government x Rebuilding reserves. x Ensuring solvency for the state pension fund. North Dakota is required by its Constitution to have a balanced budget. However, ongoing revenues and ongoing expenses have not always been in balance. In those instances where ongoing revenues did not meet the obligations of ongoing expenses of state government, one-time transfers from accumulated reserves and fund balances were used to fill the gap. In nearly all cases, those accumulated reserves and fund balances were directly attributable to oil and natural gas extraction and production tax revenue. In the 2019-21 biennium executive budget, the governor laid out a financial plan that not only balanced ongoing revenues and expenses but did so by adding transparency to the use of oil tax revenue. In the executive budget, the state general fund allocation of oil and gas taxes increased from $400 million to $1 billion per biennium, but no transfers from accumulated fund balances were proposed. Both the 2013-15 and 2015-17 biennium budgets included general fund revenues and transfers in excess of $1 billion that were directly funded from oil and gas tax revenue. The legislature did not approve the proposed transfer of $1 billion per biennium from oil tax revenues to the general fund, opting to continue it at the level of $400 million per biennium. The legislature instead chose to balance the general fund budget with transfers from accumulated oil tax revenues. Although this approach provides less transparency and obscures the state's ongoing revenue and expense structure, it ensures overall revenue sources are adequate to fund ongoing government expenses. It provides a conservative approach to funding the budget as the accumulated balances transferred to the general fund are balances on hand at the start of the biennium and not dependent on forecasted tax revenues. The state's rainy-day fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, was nearly depleted during the 2015-17 biennium economic downturn. The 2019-21 executive budget proposed to fully replenish this fund to its maximum balance allowed by law, which is 15% of general fund appropriations. This included a proposed transfer of over $300 million from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund. A critical component of ensuring the long-term financial well-being of the state of North Dakota is a well-funded Budget Stabilization Fund that provides a necessary buffer against volatile commodity prices that drive ups and downs in the state's economy. The legislature did not approve the transfer of $300 million to the Budget Stabilization Fund. However, the revenue forecast adopted by the legislature proved so conservative that actual revenues ended the biennium $250 million higher than predicted. North Dakota law requires any end of biennium balance in the general fund in excess of $65 million to be transferred to the Budget Stabilization Fund. As a result, $548 million was transferred to the Budget Stabilization Fund, pushing the balance above $660 million. It reached its $726 million cap in March 2020 with a statutorily required transfer of oil tax revenues. Although state tax revenues have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, other state revenues such as Legacy fund earnings have been unaffected. It is anticipated the state will finish the 2019-21 biennium with total revenues that exceed the original forecast and without accessing the budget stabilization fund to offset a revenue shortfall. Another component of the state's long-term financial plan is ensuring the solvency of the state's pension fund. The governor proposed restoring solvency to the fund through a combination of policy proposals that reformed the benefit and funding structure, along with a one-time cash infusion into the fund. The proposed one-time cash infusion was a transfer of $265 million at the beginning of the 2019-21 biennium from the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund to the Public Employees Retirement Fund. 9Although the legislature did not approve the proposed cash infusion of $265 million, the legislature did adopt separate proposals that reformed the benefit structure and had a positive impact on the long-term actuarial projections for the fund. The backbone of the state's financial plan is a revenue forecasting process that is accurate, conservative, and credible. The state utilizes a Revenue Forecasting Advisory Committee, comprised of representatives of the major industries in the state and the legislative and executive branches of government, along with the expertise of a national economic forecasting consultant. With the assistance of these experts, the state's Tax Department and Office of Management and Budget develop a conservative revenue forecast for use in the budgeting process. The budgeting process begins with the development of a biennial budget proposal reflecting the Governor's priorities for the next two years. The budget is submitted to the legislature for their consideration and eventual enactment. With a biennial budget cycle, each revenue forecast and budget proposal provides a three-year plan for the revenues and expenditures of state government. RELEVANT FINANCIAL POLICIES North Dakota's financial policies ensure that in the event of an economic downturn, North Dakota state government will be able to continue to provide its citizens with necessary services. Should North Dakota experience a significant revenue shortfall, the state is able to access funds in the budget stabilization fund. The statutory maximum balance for the budget stabilization fund is 15.0 percent of the state general fund budget. North Dakota experienced a significant revenue shortfall during the 2015-17 biennium due to decreases in oil and agriculture prices, resulting in a transfer of nearly the entire balance of the budget stabilization fund to the general fund prior to June 30, 2017. The 2017 legislature established an ongoing allocation of $75 million per biennium from oil and gas tax revenues to the budget stabilization fund. North Dakota Century Code requires the transfer to the budget stabilization fund of any end-of-biennium general fund balance in excess of $65 million. The 2017-19 biennium ended with revenues exceeding the forecast and resulted in the transfer of $548 million to the budget stabilization fund. The balance of the budget stabilization fund is estimated to be over $726 million by June 30, 2021 due to a combination of existing fund balance and additional oil tax revenue allocations. In addition to accessing the budget stabilization fund, in the event of an economic downturn the Governor can reduce general fund expenditure authority uniformly across state agencies through a process known as allotment. In the event of an allotment, the foundation aid stabilization fund was established to protect the state school aid program. Dollars from this fund would replace the amount of general fund dollars allotted, thus K-12 education would not experience a reduction in funding. The passage of Measure 2 in the 2016 general election allowed money in the fund to be appropriated for education-related purposes. Funding for the foundation aid stabilization fund comes from 10 percent of oil extraction tax collections.

Please read it in conjunction with the transmittal letter at the front of this report and with the State's financial statements, which follow this section. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Government-wide: Total assets and deferred outflows of resources of the State exceeded its liabilities and deferred inflows of resources at fiscal year-end by $26.1 billion (reported as net position), an increase of $1.4 billion from the previous year. The net position of governmental activities increased by 4.6% while the net position of the business-type activities showed an increase of 10.8%. As a result of implementing GASB Statement 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions , the State recorded $31 million net pension asset, $290.1 million deferred outflows of resources, $603.9 million net pension liability, and $337.5 million deferred inflows of resources for the primary government. The State decreased its net pension liability by $283.6 million during the year. Fund Level: As of the close of fiscal year 2020 the State's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $16.5 billion, an increase of $760 million. Of this amount, $109.5 million is non-spendable, primarily for Permanent Trust Funds. Spendable fund balance consists of $6.4 billion restricted for specific purposes such as common schools, highway projects, and state education aid, $1.9 billion committed and $419.7 million assigned for specific functional expenditures such as education and health and human service operations, with the unassigned fund balance making up the remaining amount of $7.7 billion, which is primarily made up of the legacy fund with a balance of $7 billion. The enterprise funds reported net position at year-end of $4.6 billion, an increase of $446.7 million during the year. Long-term Debt : The State's total debt (bonds, certificates of participation, and notes payable) decreased approximately 12.2% during the fiscal year to $2.5 billion, a decrease of $341 million, which represents the net difference between new issuances and payments. During the year the State issued $269 million in bonds, $7.3 million in certificates of participation, and $6.3 billion in notes. More detailed information regarding these activities and funds is included in Note 3L. OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis is an introduction to the State's basic financial statements, which consists of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements. Government-wide Statements The government-wide financial statements provide a broad view of the State's operations in a manner similar to a private-sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the State's financial position, which assists in assessing the State's economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These statements include all non-fiduciary assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources using the accrual basis of accounting. The current year's revenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or paid. 22The Statement of Net Position presents all of the State's assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as \"net position\". Over time, increases and decreases in net position is an indicator of whether the State's financial position is improving or deteriorating. The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the State's net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying events giving rise to the change occur, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Therefore, revenues and expenses are reported in these statements for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave). Both statements report three activities: Governmental Activities - The activities in this section are primarily supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenue. Most of the State's basic services, such as education, health and human services and transportation, are reported under this category. Business-type Activities - These functions are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user fees and charges to external users of goods and services. The Bank of North Dakota, Housing Finance Agency and the University System are examples of the State's business-type activities. Discretely Presented Component Units - These are operations for which the State has financial accountability but they have certain independent qualities as well. These entities operate similar to private- sector business and the business-type activities described above. The State has 4 discretely presented component units. Financial information for these entities is presented separately from the financial information presented for the primary government. The government-wide financial statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis. Fund Financial Statements A fund is a fiscal and accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts that the State uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending for a particular purpose. The State, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance related legal requirements. The basic fund financial statements begin after the Component Unit FASB basis statements and provide more detail about the major individual funds. The State's funds are divided into three categories - governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary. It is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be interpreted differently. Governmental funds - Most of the State's basic services are reported in the governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, the governmental fund financial statements focus on the near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus on the balances left at year-end that are available for future spending. Such information may be useful in evaluating whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the State's programs. These funds are reported using modified accrual accounting, which measures cash and all other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash. Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government's near-term financing decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds 23and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are presented on the page immediately following each governmental fund financial statement. Governmental funds include the General Fund, special revenue, debt service, and permanent funds. The State has several governmental funds, of which three (3) are considered major individual funds. These three are the General Fund, the Federal Fund, and the State Special Revenue Fund. Each of these major funds is presented in a separate column in the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balance. The remaining governmental funds are combined in a single aggregated column on the basic fund statements. Individual fund data for each of these non-major governmental funds can be found in the other supplementary information section of this report. Proprietary funds - Services for which the State charges customers a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds. The state maintains two different types of proprietary funds, enterprise funds and internal service funds. Enterprise funds report activities that provide supplies and services to the general public. Internal service funds report activities that provide supplies and services for the State's other programs and activities. Like the government-wide statements, proprietary funds use the accrual basis of accounting. Although the basis of accounting is the same for the government-wide and proprietary fund statements, reconciliation between these statements is presented because of the allocation of internal service funds' net income. The State has four (4) major enterprise funds: The Bank of North Dakota, Housing Finance, University System, and Workforce Safety and Insurance. These four funds are each presented in separate columns on the basic proprietary fund financial statements. The remaining enterprise funds are combined in a single total column on these statements. Individual fund data for each of the non-major enterprise funds can be found in the other supplementary information section of this report. The State's internal service funds are reported as governmental activities on the government-wide statements, because the services they provide predominantly benefit governmental activities. The State's four (4) internal service funds are reported on the basic proprietary fund financial statements in a single combined column. Individual fund data for the internal service funds is provided in the form of combining statements found in the other supplementary information section of this report. Fiduciary funds - The State acts as a trustee, or fiduciary, for its employee pension plans. It is also responsible for other assets that, because of a trust arrangement, can be used only for the trust beneficiaries. The State's fiduciary activities are reported in separate Statements of Fiduciary Net Position and Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. These funds, which include pension (and other employee benefit) trust, investment trust, private-purpose trust, and agency funds, are reported using accrual accounting. The government-wide statements exclude fiduciary fund activities and balances because the State cannot use these assets to finance its operations. Notes to the Financial Statements The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and the fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found immediately following component units' financial statements. Required Supplementary Information The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information. This section includes a budgetary comparison schedule, which includes reconciliation between the statutory fund balances for budgetary purposes and the fund balances for the General Fund, the Federal Fund and the State Special Revenue Fund as presented in the gove rnmental fund financial statements. In addition, the required supplementary information includes up to ten years of information on the State's pension and Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans, including schedules on the employer proportionate share of the net pension liability and net OPEB liability, changes in the net pension liability and OPEB liability, and employer contributions. 24Other Supplementary Information Other supplementary information includes combining financial statements for non-major governmental, non-major enterprise, internal service, and fiduciary funds. These funds are added together, by fund type, and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE As noted previous ly, net position may serve over time as a us eful indicator of a government's financial position. The State's combined net position (governmental and business-type activities) totaled $26.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020. Net position increased $1.4 billion from the prior fiscal year. State of North Dakota's Net Position (Expressed in Thousands ) Governmental Business-Type Total Primary Activities Activities Government 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Current and Other Assets $18,654,826 Net largest component (44%) of the State's net position is unrestricted net position. Unrestricted net position may be used at the State's discretion, but often have limitations on use based on State statutes. Restricted net position makes up thirty percent (30%) of the state's net position. Restricted net position represents resources that are subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on how they can be used. Twenty-six percent (26%) of the State's net position reflects its investment in capital assets such as land, buildings, equipment, intangibles (software), and infrastruc ture (roads, bridges and other immovable assets) less any related debt outstanding that was needed to acquire or construct the assets. The State uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequentially, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the State's investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. The condensed financial information below was derived from the government-wide Statement of Activities and reflects how the State's net position changed during the fiscal year: 25State of North Dakota's Changes in Net Position (Expressed in Thousands ) Governmental Business-Type Total Primary Activities Activities Government 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues: Program Revenues: Charges for Services $347,155 1,364,665 1,435,130 1,364,665 1,435,130 and Coal 2,586,570 - - 1,949,036 2,586,570 Other Taxes Education 1,288,935 1,288,935 Regulatory 78,442 Corrections - - Agriculture and - 429,801 443,629 429,801 443,629 Term Debt 1,691 1,952 - - 1,691 1,952 Bank of North Dakota - - 103,391 Housing Finance - - - - - - 1,227,858 Increase (decrease) in Net Position Before Contributions, Loss & Transfers 1,368,718 2,381,604 (39, 535) (74,934) 1,329,183 2,306,670 Contributions * More detailed information regarding the prior period adjustments can be found in Note 2. 26Governmental Activities Governmental Activities increased the State's net position by $938 million. Revenues decreased 12.7%, with the largest dollar decrease in the State's revenues for fiscal year 2020 coming from oil, gas, and coal, taxes, a decrease of $637.5 million. The decrease in individual and corporate income taxes is due to the change in the due date for the 2019 tax returns from April 15 to July 15, 2020 as a federal and state response to the global pandemic. Oil and Gas production tax and Oil Extraction tax decreases due to very weak oil prices and production declines associated with the nationwide recession caused by the global pandemic. Expenses for governmental activities remained relatively consistent.

Workforce Safety and Insurance's (WSI) net position increased $135.6 million. Fiscal year 2020 shows decreases in earned premiums, incurred losses, and the number of filed claims. There was a slight increase in the number of policy holders. Policyholder count increased by 107 policies in fiscal year 2020. WSI's financial position remains stable. Earned premium net of discounts and reinsurance totaled $221 million, $238 million, and $232 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Total claims filed for fiscal year 2020 totaled 18,813. This is a decrease of 1,100 from the previous fiscal year 2019 total of 19,913. A dividend credit of 50% was declared in fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018. Net earned premium from fiscal year 2020 of $221 million is slightly down from the fiscal year 2019 total of $238 million. The strong investment return in the past three years has contributed to the positive change in net position. The Bank of North Dakota net position increased $96.2 million. The loan portfolio decreased by $55,000 to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing deposits totaled $4.5 billion at December 31, 2019 compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2018. This fluctuation is due to state deposits and the economic status of the state. The Bank has a tier one capital leverage ratio of 13.60% as of December 31, 2019. The leverage ratio is a measure of strength. Well capitalized per federal regulations requires this percentage to be a minimum of 5%. The University System's net position decreased $11.6 million. The University system saw a decrease in revenues and an increase in expenditures which attributed to their decrease in net position. Grants and contracts (operating revenues) decreased mainly due to reduced National Science Foundation grants at NDSU and federal awards at UND. The decrease in sales and services of educational department and auxiliary enterprises revenues are attributed to Covid-19 related closures of the institutions in the third and fourth quarters of FY20. The largest increases of operating expenses for the University system was Scholarships and fellowships, CARES act aid to students, and cost of sales and services. Scholarships and fellowships increased primarily due to the implementation of a new waiver for a freshman academic award. CARES act aid was new for FY20 and was used to provide monetary aid to students impacted by the Covid- 19 pandemic. Cost of sales and services increased primarily as a result of timing of internal billings to other operating departments at UND.

Operating revenues in FY20 were up as a result of higher mortgage interest income due to a larger mortgage loan receivable balance. Also, investment interest rates were slightly higher due to debt service reserve funds being invested in mortgage backed securities which have typically earned higher rates of interest than currently available GICs and Money Market accounts. Operating expenses were up from prior year operating expenses due to higher interest expenses with regards to a larger bonds payable balance. Also, administrative and operating expenses were lower than the prior year. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE STATE'S FUNDS Governmental Funds As the State completed the year, its governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $16.5 billion, an increase of $760 million from the prior fiscal year. Of the $16.5 billion in net position, $109 million is non-spendable, $6.4 billion is restricted, $1.9 billion is committed, $420 million is assigned, and $7.7 billion is unassigned. These fund balance categories are a result of GASB Statement 54. Note 1U provides definitions for these categories. The following analysis of funds provides the explanation for the overall change in net position for governmental funds. The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At the end of current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance of the General Fund was $7.7 billion, non-spendable was $6.2 million, and $1.1 billion was committed for expenditure by various governmental functions. Total General Fund balance increased during the fiscal year by $1.1 billion. Revenues increased approximately 4.7%, due to an increase in oil, gas, and coal taxes of $313 million. This increase was due to the way Oil, Gas, and Coal taxes are distributed within the state. Revenue for oil, gas, and coal taxes are distributed first to the general fund and then once the max amount is reached the revenues will then be distributed to the next fund. The reason we saw an increase from FY19 was because in FY19 these general fund distributions would have already been met in FY18 so there would not have been as many revenues in the general fund for FY19. As there was an increase in the general fund revenues, revenues for the overall state had decreased and was previously explained with the increase in net position for governmental activities. General fund expenditures increased by $161.1 million or 8.6% with the largest increases in Education and Health and Human Services. However, total expenditures for the Governmental funds remained relatively consistent. The increase in Education primarily came from an increase in state student aid from the general fund in FY20. In the previous biennium these expenses would have been paid for with special funds. The increase in Health and Human Services was also due to reallocating more expenses to the general fund in the first year of the biennium. The State Special Revenue ending fund balance decreased by $380 million resulting in $7.7 billion fund balance. Revenues decreased by 41.6% in the state special revenue fund primarily due to a decrease in oil, gas, and coal taxes of $949.8 million due to weak oil prices and production decline as previously discussed. This decrease was also due to the increase in the general fund oil, gas, and coal revenues in FY20 as oil gas and coal taxes are first allocated to the general fund as previously explained. Special fund expenditures decreased by 13.7% primarily due to a decrease in Education and Health and Human Services spending. Decreases to the special funds was previously discussed under the general fund expenditures. The June 30 Federal Fund balance of $11.9 million consists primarily of non-spendable items such as prepaids and inventory. Revenues increased by $204.8 million and expenditures increased by $186.1 million primarily due to the increase in federal funding for the global pandemic. The federal fund balance increased by $1.2 million due to additional funding for the state to combat the global pandemic. 29Proprietary Funds The State's proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. The increases in the net position of the proprietary funds are discussed under \"Business-type Activities\" above. General Fund Budgetary Highlights: The general fund budgetary revenues and other financing sources were $8.2 million or 5.1% higher than the final budget, primarily because of actual sales tax and department collections were more than the final budgeted amount. The State has a biennial appropriated budget. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, was the first year of the 2019-21 budget cycle. The original budget increased $128.6 million. The increases to the beginning appropriated budget are from authorized carryover of general fund appropriation authority and legislative changes of which the larger ones are noted below. Several state agencies were authorized by appropriation laws to carryover a portion or all of their general fund appropriation for various purposes, including the University System, $55.1 million, the Department of Human Services, $5.8 million, Secretary of State, $1.3 million, the Department of Commerce, $33.1 million, the Parks and Recreation department, $2.1 million, the Department of Transportation, $13 million, Legislative Council and Assembly, $4.7 million, and Office of Management & Budget, $3.6 million. Of the $6.4 million in capital construction carryover dollars, $5.5 million was for the Department of Human Services and $804 thousand for the Department of Transportation. There were no expenditures in excess of general fund authority. CAPITAL ASSETS AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION Capital Assets: At the end of the fiscal year 2020, the State had invested $6.7 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, in a broad range of capital assets. Depreciation charges for this fiscal year totaled $252 million. (Net of Depreciation, Expressed in Thousands ) Governmental Business-Type Total Primary Activities Activities Government 2020 2019* 2020 2019 2020 2019* Land and Land Improvements $163,127 capital asset balances were adjusted for certain reclassifications. The total increase in the State's investments in capital assets for the current fiscal year was 4.1% in terms of net book value. However, actual expenditures to purchase or construct capital assets were approximately $1.1 billion for the year. A major portion of this amount was used to construct or reconstruct assets for highway construction. More detailed information on the State's capital assets can be found in Note 3H to the financial statements. 30Long-term Debt: Article X, Section 13 of the Constitution of No rth Dakota provides that the state may issue or guarantee the payment of bonds provided that all bonds in excess of $2 million are: secured by first mortgage upon property and no further indebtedness may be incurred by the state unless evidenced by a bond issue; authorized by law, for a certain purpose; provisioned to pay the interest semiannually, and pay the principal within 30 years. The law authorized the bond issue must specifically appropriate the provisions to the payment of the principal and interest of the bond. The State has no general obligation bonds outstanding at June 30, 2020. The State does have a number of revenue bonds outstanding at June 30, 2020. Current state statutes empower certain state agencies and the Building Authority, a component unit of the State, to issue bonds as part of their activities. This debt is not backed by the full faith and credit of the State of North Dakota. The principal and interest on revenue bonds issued by state agencies is payable from designated revenue sources. The Building Authority's bonds generate revenue to finance the construction and improvements of State buildings. Revenues derived from leases on the buildings fund the debt service requirements. The Bank of North Dakota has advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank in the amounts of $631 million. The advances have a fixed rate of interest, ranging from 1.61 percent to 5.56 percent. More detailed information regarding the State's long-term obligations is presented in Note 3L to the financial statements. State of North Dakota's Outstandin g Debt (Expressed in Thousands ) Governmental Business-Type Total Primary Activities Activities Government 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenue Bonds $19,730 $29,950 $1,666,599 $1,525,285 debt decreased approximately 12.2% during the current fiscal year. ECONOMIC CONDITION AND OUTLOOK Moody's Analytics recently completed an analysis of the North Dakota economy for its Pr\u00e9cis U.S. State October 2020 publication. The report depicts an economy in recovery, coming out of the COVID-19 recession, but at a slow pace mostly due to the effects the massive drop in oil prices had on employment. North Dakota's outlook is linked tightly to two major industries, energy and agriculture. The oil industry will prove one of the worst economic casualties from the pandemic, which led to the plummet in price and the decrease for demand. Oil production per rig has risen slightly by 3 percent per rig in the last year. The most recent North Dakota average price per barrel of oil was at $33.00, which is below the estimated price of $48.00 used for budgeting purposes. On the agriculture side, the demand for crops remained intact throughout the pandemic, but the closure of the U.S./Canada border continues to expound the decline seen in exports and commodity prices are expected to remain low. North Dakota's job growth has taken a hit because of the pandemic. At the end of September the job count was 7.3% lower than it was in January. Unemployment in North Dakota is at 5.2%, which is more than double what it was for the same time frame in 2019. The positive is that the tight labor market could be an attractive draw to job seekers from other states. 31Median household income and per capita income for North Dakota are both ahead of the national average.

The Office of Management and Budget has adopted the pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which is the nationally accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The more significant of the State's accounting policies are as follows: A. REPORTING ENTITY For financial reporting purposes, the State of North Dakota has included all funds, organizations, agencies, boards and commissions that make up its legal entity. The State has also included all potential component units for which it is financiall y accountable, and other organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship with the State are such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board has set forth criteria to be considered in determining financial accountability. These criteria include appointing a voting majority of an organization's governing body and (1) the ability of the State to impose its will on that organization or (2) the potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on the State. As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, these financial statements present the State of North Dakota (the primary government) and its component units. The component units are included in the State's reporting entity because of the significance of th eir operational or financial relationships with the State. BLENDED COMPONENT UNITS These component units are entities that are legally separate fr om the State, but are so intertwined with the State that they are, in substance, the same as the State. They are reported as part of the State and blended into the appropriate fund types. Building Authority (Debt Service Fund and Capital Projects Fund) - The Building Authority was created by the Legislature as a separate instrumentality of the State. Its purpose is to promote the general welfare of the citizens of the State by providing financing for use by the State in altering, repairing, maintaining or constructing buildings and making any improvements connected to State buildings. The Industrial Commission, which consists of the governor, the attorney general, and the commissioner of agriculture, is the governing board of the Building Authority. The funds of the Building Authority were audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. DISCRETELY PRESENTED COMPONENT UNITS These component units are entities that are legally separate from the State, but are financially accountable to the State. The component units' columns of government-wide financial statements include the financial data of these entities. MAJOR COMPONENT UNITS Comprehensive Health Association (Proprietary Fund Type) - The Association was established by the Legislature with participating membership consisting of those insurance companies, licensed or authorized to do business in the State. It provides low cost access to health insurance coverage for residents of the State who are denied adequate health insurance and are considered uninsurable. Under North Dakota Century Code, the Majority Leader of the Senate appoints one member of the Senate and the House of Representatives appoints one member of the House to the eight-member board. The Association was audited by other independent auditors for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. Public Finance Authority (Proprietary Fund Type) - The Finance Authority was created by the Legislature as a separate agency of the State. The purpose of the Finance Authority is to make funds available for borrowing by North Dakota political subdivisions through the issuance of its bonds and the purchase of municipal securities of the political subdivisions. The Finance Authority has been granted all powers required in order to accomplish this purpose and is under the control and management of the Industrial Commission. The Fund was audited by other independent auditors for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019, and their report has bee n previously issued under a separate cover. 58STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA North Dakota Development Fund, Inc. (Proprietary Fund Type) - The Development Fund was established as a statewide nonprofit development corporation with the authority to take equity positions in; to provide loans to; or to use other innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for new or expanding businesses in North Dakota or relocating businesses to North Dakota. A board of directors consisting of eight members, all of whom are appointed by the governor, manages the corporation. The deputy director of the Department of Commerce (a State agency) is the corporation's chief executive officer. The director of the Department of Commerce (governor-appointed cabinet position) is responsible for developing rules, subject to the approval of the board of directors, necessary to implement the administration of the corporation. The Fund was audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. North Dakota State Fair Foundation - The mission of the North Dakota State Fair Foundation is to develop lifelong relationships with donors to secure philanthropic gifts that will enhance and support the work of the North Dakota State Fair. The Fund of the North Dakota State Fair Foundation were audited by other independent auditors for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. Major and Non-major University System Foundations (Propr ietary Fund Type) - The foundations are legally separate, tax-exempt organizations providing support and recognition to their respective colleges and universities through a variety of programs and activities. The foundations are normally managed by a board of directors made up primarily of alumni, friends or leading members of the communities. The component unit financial statements are presented under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards. As such, certain disclosures are not reflected for the Major University System Foundation in the major component unit disclosures and no disclosures are included for the Non-major University System Foundation. A complete set of financial statements c an be obtained at the North Dakota University System office at 600 E. Boulevard Avenue, #10, Bismarck, ND 58505. Non-major State Historical So ciety of North Dakota Foundation - The mission of the State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation is to provide fundraising and membership development activities to support the State Historical Society of North Dakota which preserves and promotes the heritage of North Dakota and its people. The Fund of the State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation were audited by other inde pendent auditors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, and their report has been previously issued under a separate cover. The component unit financial statements are presented under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) standards. As such, certain disclosures are not reflected for the Foundation and no disclosures are included for the Foundation. Complete financial statements for each of the other individual component units may be obtained at the entity's administrative offices as follows: Building Authority Public Finance Authority 600 E.

Century Ave., #2 Fargo, ND 58121 Bismarck, ND 58503 State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation North Dakota State Fair Foundation P.O. Box 1976 P.O. AND FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Statement of Net Position and Statement of Activities report information on all non-fiduciary activities of the primary government and its component units. Primary government activities are distinguished between governmental and business-type activities. Governmental activities generally are financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other non-exchange revenues. Business-type activities are financed in whole or in part by fees charged to external parties for goods or services. The Statement of Net Position presents the reporting entity's non-fiduciary assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities , and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference reported as net position. Net position is reported in three categories: 59STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Net investment in capital assets consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by outstanding balances for bonds, notes, and other debt that are attributed to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. Restricted net position result when constraints placed on net position use are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, and the like, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. Net position restricted by enabling legislation are subject to change by a majority vote of the Legislative Assembly. Unrestricted net position consist of net position that do not meet the definition of the two preceding categories. Unrestricted net position often are designated, to indicate that management does not consider them to be available for general operations. Unrestricted net position often have constraints on resources which are imposed by management, but can be removed or modified. The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segment are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable within a specific function. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Taxes and other items not meeting the definition of program revenues are instead reported as general revenue. FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-wide statements. Major individual governmental funds and major individual proprietary funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements, with non-major funds being combined into a single column. C. MEASUREMENT FOCUS, BASIS OF ACCOUNTING, AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION MEASUREMENT FOCUS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The government-wide statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary and fiduciary fund (agency funds are excluded as they have no measurement focus) financial statements. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of cash flows. The State follows the pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which is the nationally accepted standard-setting body for establishing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for governmental entities. Governmental fund statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as they become susceptible to accrual; generally when they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collected within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. The State considers tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal year end. Other revenues are considered to be available if received within one year after the fiscal year end. Major revenues that are determined to be susceptible to accrual include interest, federal grants-in-aid, and taxpayer-assessed taxes such as income, sales, corporate, excise, motor fuel taxes and unemployment compensation contributions. Revenues earned under the terms of reimbursement agreements with other governments or private sources are recorded at the time the related expenditures are made if other eligibility requirements have been met. Sales and use taxes are accrued based upon filings received and an estimate of filings due by June 30. Net income taxes from individuals and corporations are accrued based on current income earned by the taxpayer before June 30. Quarterly filings, withholding statements, and other historical data are used to estimate income. The rev enue is accrued net of an allowance for uncollectible taxes. Unearned revenue is recorded for receivables that are measurable but not available at year-end. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, expenditures related to debt service, compensated absences, and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due and payable. 60STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION The State reports the following major governmental funds: The General Fund is the principal operating fund of the State. The Federal Fund accounts for all the financial resources from the federal government. The State Special Revenue Fund accounts for activities from state sources, which are restricted legally or administratively for the particular costs of an agency or program. The State reports the following major enterprise funds: The Bank of North Dakota Fund finances economic development throughout the state, participates in loans with North Dakota financial institutions, and holds interest-bearing deposit accounts for state and political subdivisions of North Dakota. The Housing Finance Agency Fund is authorized to issue bonds to make loans to mortgage lenders for qualified residential mortgage loans and to make mort gage and construction loans for multi-family housing within the State of North Dakota. The University System Fund accounts for all financial transactions of the colleges and universities that compose the University System of North Dakota. The Workforce Safety & In surance Fund is financed entirely by premiums assessed to the employers of North Dakota and provides no-fault medical and disability insurance to all North Dakota employees. Additionally, the State reports the following fund types: GOVERNMENTAL FUND TYPES General Fund accounts for all governmental financial resources, except for those required to be accounted for in other funds. Special Revenue Funds are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. Debt Service Funds are used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest. Capital Projects Funds are used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets. Ca pital project funds exclude those types of capital related outflows f inanced by proprietary funds or for assets that will be held in trust for individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Permanent Funds report resources that are legally restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that benefit the government or its ci tizenry, such as the common schools within the state. PROPRIETARY FUND TYPES Enterprise Funds account for those business-like State activities that provide goods/services to the public, financed primarily through user charges. They are also used to account for operations where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability and other purposes. The State's loan programs, Mill and Elevator, and Fair are reported in this type. Internal Service Funds account for the financing of goods and/or services provided by one department or agency to another department or agency of a government, or to other governments, on a cost-reimbursement basis. These goods and services include motor pool services; printing, reproduction and mailing services; information technology; and risk management services. In the government-wide statements, internal service funds are included with governmental activities. 61STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA FIDUCIARY FUND TYPES Pension and Other Employee Benefits Trust Funds account for resources that are required to be held in trust for the members and beneficiaries of the State's defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plan, deferred compensation plan, pretax benefits program, and other post-employment benefit plans. Investment Trust Funds account for the transactions, assets , liabilities, and fund equity of t he external pool participants (City of Bismarck, City of Grand Forks, City of Grand Forks Park District, ND Association of Counties, City of Fargo Fargodome, North Dakota State Board of Medicine, Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Fund, Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center Endowment Fund, Veteran's Cemetery Trust Fund and Retirement and Investment Office Investments). The State Investment Board (SIB) provides administrative services for the external pool participants. SIB issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to the Retirement and Investment Office, 3442 East Century Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota 58503. Investment Trust F unds are accounted for in essentially the same manner as Proprietary Funds. Private Purpose Trust Funds account for resources of all ot her trust arrangements in which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments. Examp les include student donations, the State's college savings plan, and a remediation trust. Agency Funds account for assets held by the State as an agent for other governmental units, or other organizations, and do not involve measurement of results of operations. Examples of funds in this category include state agency funds for bonding, tax collection, child support disbursement, and funds held for others. D. GENERAL BUDGETARY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES The State operates through a biennial appropriation that represents departmental appropriations recommended by the governor and presented to the Legislative Assembly at the beginning of each legislative session. The Legislative Assembly enacts the budgets of the various state departments through passage of specific appropriation bills. The governor has line item veto powers over all appropriations subject to legislative override. Once passed and signed, the appropriation bill becomes the departments' financial plan for the next two years. Changes to the appropriation are limited to Emergency Commission authorization, initiative, allotment, or referendum action. The Emergency Commission can authorize receipt of federal or other moneys not appropriated by the Assembly if the Assembly did not indicate intent to reject the money. The Emergency Commission may authorize pass-through federal funds from one state agency to another. The Emergency Commission may authorize the transfer of expenditure authority between appropriated line items. The Legislature has also passed appropriation laws that authorize directors of certain state agencies to transfer appropriation authority among the various divisions of their specific agency, subject to the Budget Section of the North Dakota Legislative Council's approval. Unexpended appropriations lapse at the end of each biennium, except certain capital expenditures covered under the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) section 54-44.1-11 and the University System's unexpended general fund appropriation authority. The State's biennial budget is prepared primarily on a cash basis. The State does not use encumbrance accounting. The legal level of budgetary control is at the agency, appropriation, funding source and expenditure line item level, with administrative controls established at lower levels of detail in certain instances. The State does not formally budget revenues, and it does not budget by fund. The State appropriation is defined through the use of specific expenditure line items. Capital appropriations are generally made at the agency and project level. North Dakota's Appropriation Act does not present budgets by GAAP fund. Instead, it authorizes General Fund appropriation authority by agency and Other Budgeted Income appropriation authority by agency. Other budgeted income includes all budgeted resources, other than the General Fund, and includes some governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary fund activities. During the 2019-2021 biennium, there were general, federal and other funds supplemental appropriations totaling $1,157,610,655. E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents for reporting purposes includes cash and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. This includes investment s with original maturity of three months or less. Also cash, as reported, may be under the control of the State Treasurer or by other administrative bodies as determined by law. Cash and cash equivalents are presented on the fund balance sheets as \"Cash Deposits at the Bank of North Dakota\" and \"Cash 62STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA and Cash Equivalents\" to present the unique nature of the relationship between the Bank of North Dakota, an enterprise fund, and other state agencies. Cash Deposits at the Bank of North Dakota - State agency cash balances, as required by law, are pooled by the State Treasurer and deposited in the Bank of North Dakota, an enterprise fund. These cash balances, in addition to other agency cash deposited at the Bank of North Dakota, are included on the fund balance sheets as \"Cash Deposits at the Bank of North Dakota\". For purposes of the Government-wide Statement of Net Position, these amounts have been reclassified to internal balances. Cash and Cash Equivalents - All cash and cash equivalents, (other than cash deposits at the Bank of North Dakota), as permitted by the North Dakota Century Code, are included on the Government-wide Statement of Net Position as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\". The State had no cash overdrafts from pooled cash and investments at June 30, 2020. All interest revenue is allocated to the General Fund unless state law (as outlined in the North Dakota Century Code) requires allocations of interest to other funds. F. INVESTMENTS Investments are reported at fair value. Quoted market prices, when available, have been used to value investments. The fair value for securities that have no quoted market price represent estimated fair value. International securities are valued based upon quoted foreign market prices and translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at June 30. In general, corporate debt securities have been valued at quoted market prices or, if not available, values are based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers wit h similar credit ratings. Mortga ges have been value d on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar instruments. The fair valueof real estate investment securities, including timberland, is based on appraisals plus fiscal year-to-date capital transactions. Publicly traded alternative investments are valued based on quoted market prices. When not readily available, alternative investment securities are valued using current es timates of fair value from the investment manager. Such valuations consider variables such as financial performance of the issuer, comparison of comparable companies' earnings multiples, cash flow analysis, recent sales prices of investments, withdrawal restrictions, and other pertinent information. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation for these other alternative investments, the estimated fair value may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed. The net change in fair value of investments consists of the realized gains or losses and the unrealized increase or decrease in fair value of investments during the year. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed based on the difference between the sales price and the original cost of the investment sold. Unrealized gains and losses are computed based on changes in the fair value of investments between years. Security transactions are currently accounted for on a trade date basis. Interest income is recorded when earned. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Purchases of other state funds' debt issues by the Bank of North Dakota have been recorded as normal business transactions if they are the result of arms-length transactions. Investments are presented on the fund balance sheets as \"Investments at the Bank of North Dakota\" and \"Investments\" to present the unique nature of the relationship between the Bank of North Dakota, an enterprise fund, and other state agencies. Investments at the Bank of North Dakota - State agency investments, primarily certificates of deposits of the Bank of North Dakota, are included on the fund balance sheets as \"Investments at the Bank of North Dakota.\" For purposes of the Government-wide Statement of Net Position, these amount s have been reclassified to internal balances. Investments - State agency investments invested at financial institutions other than the Bank of North Dakota are included on the Government-wide Statement of Net Position as \"Investments.\" Differences on the Fund Balance Sheets between the assets, \"Cash at the Bank of North Dakota\" and \"Investments at the Bank of North Dakota,\" and the liability, \"Deposits Held for Other Funds,\" is attributable to timing differences resulting from the Bank of North Dakota having a different fiscal year end than many of the other state agencies. 63STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA G. SECURITIES LENDING GASB Statement No. 28 \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Securities Lending Transactions,\" establishes accounting and financial reporting standards for securities lending transactions. The standard requires governmental entities to report securities lent as assets in their statements of net positi on. Cash received as collateral and investments made with that cash must also be reported as both an asset and a liability. The statement also requires the costs of the securities lending transactions to be reported as expenses separately from incom e received. In addition, the statement requires disclosures about the transactions and collateral related to them. The Agent lends securities of the type on loan at June 30, 2020, for collateral in the form of cash, U.S. government securities and irrevocable letters of credit. U.S. securities are loaned vers us collateral valued at 102% of the market value of the securities plus accrued interest. Non-U.S. securities are loaned versus collateral valued at 105% of the market value of the securities plus accrued interest. Non-cash collateral cannot be pledged or sold unless the borrower defaults. All securities can be terminated on demand by either the lender or the borrower, although the average term of the loans State's loans was approximately 232 days as of June 30, 2020. Cash open collateral is invested in a short term investment pool, which had an interest sensitivity of 1 day as of this statement date. This pool is valued based on amortized cost. There were no violations of legal or contractual provisions, no borrower or lending agent default losses known to the securities lending agent. There are no dividends or coupon payments owing on the securities lent. Securities lending earnings are credited to participating clients on approximately the fifteenth day of the following month. Indemnification deals with the situation in which a client's securities are not returned due to the insolvency of a borrower and the Agent has failed to live up to its contractual responsibilities relating to the lending of those securities. The Agent's responsibilities include performing appropriate borrower and collateral investment credit analyses, demanding adequate types and levels of collateral, and complying with applicable Department of Labor and Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council regulations concerning securities lending. For securities loaned at fiscal year end, the State has no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the State owes the borrowers exceeds the amounts the borrowers owe the State. H. INTERFUND ACTIVITY AND BALANCES INTERFUND ACTIVITY As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide statements. Exceptions to this rule are: 1) activities between funds reported as governmental activities and funds reported as business-type activities and 2) activities between funds that are reported in different functional categories in either the governmental or business- type activities column. Elimination of these activities would di stort the direct costs and program revenues for the functions concerned. In the fund financial statements, transfers represent flows of assets (such as goods or cash) without equivalent flows of assets in return or a requirement for repayment. Residual transfer amounts exist in the Government-wide Statement of Activities due to different fiscal year ends of various agencies included in business-type activities. INTERFUND BALANCES Interfund receivables and payables have been eliminated from the Statement of Net Position, except for the residual amounts due between government al and business-type activities. I. INVENTORIES AND PREPAID ITEMS Inventories of Governmental Funds are valued at cost and are recognized principally using the average cost method. Generally, the cost of Governmental Funds' inventories is recorded as an expenditure when consumed rather than when purchased. Inventories of Proprietary Funds consist primarily of grain inventories from the North Dakota Mill and Elevator Association. Grain inventories are valued at the June 30 Minneapolis grain market values less freight costs to Minneapolis. Flour, feed and resale inventories are valued at ingredient cost plus manufacturing costs incurred in their production. Proprietary Funds expense the cost of consumable supplies when used. Generally, inventories of University System Funds are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value. Cost is generally determined on the first in/first out, or moving weighted average method. Inventories consist of food, books, and other merchandise held for resale in auxiliaries and unrestricted physical plant supplies. 64STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Prepaid items reflect payments for costs applicable to future accounting periods. The cost of governmental prepaid items are recorded as expenditures when purchased. Other government fund inventories and prepaid items are reflected as a reservation of fund balance on the balance sheet. J. BOND PREMIUMS / DISCOUNTS In the governmental funds, bond discounts and premiums are treated as period costs in the year of issue. Bond discounts and premiums are shown as an \"other financing source (use)\" in the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund balance. In the proprietary funds, bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the term of the bonds using the effective interest method. The unamortized discount is shown on the statement of net position as a reduction of the bonds payable, and the amortization is included in the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund balance as interest expense. K. CAPITAL ASSETS Capital assets, which include land, buildings, equipment, intangibles (software, easements and other), construction in progress and infrastructure assets, are valued at historical cost or at estimated historical cost if actual historical cost is not available. Donated capital assets are valued at their acquisition value on the date of donation. Where necessary, estimates of original cost are derived by factoring price levels from the current period to the time of acquisition. Library books are no t capitalized as capital assets except for the University System. All other capital assets with an original cost of $5,000 or more per unit and an estimated useful life in excess of one year are capitalized and reported in the applicable government or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Exceptions include: infrastructure reported by the Department of Transportation, the threshold is $100,000 and intangible assets such as easements, water rights, patents and trademarks, the threshold is $25,000. Capital asset costs include the purchase price or construction co st, plus the costs necessary to place the asset in its intended location and condition for use. In governmental activities, inter est costs on self-constructed assets are not capitalized. In business-type activities, interest costs (if material) on self-constructed assets are also included in the cost. The amount of interest to be capitalized is calculated by offsetting interest expense incurred from the date of the borrowing until completio n of the project with interest earned on invested proceeds over the same period. Capitalized interest is amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Normal maintenance and repair costs that do not materially add to the value or extend the life of the asset are not capitalized. Collections of works of art and historical treasures are not capitalized if the following three criteria are met: (1) Held for public exhibition, education, or research in furtherance of public service, rather than financial gain; (2) Protected, kept unencumbered, cared for, and preserved; (3) Subject to organ izational policy that requires the proceeds from sales of collection items to be used to acquire other items for collections. The State's non-capitalized collections include the historical artifacts at the various state museums and historic al sites, and monuments and other art throughout the capital grounds. Assets that do not meet all three criteria, or that were capitalized as of June 30, 1999, are capitalized and includedin the government-wide financial statements. Infrastructure consists of major statewide public systems and items attached thereto such as freeways, freeway lighting systems, freeway drainage systems, freeway signs, bridges, br idge lighting systems, and sewer systems, including those infrastructure assets acquired prior to June 30, 1980. Infrastr ucture is reported in the applicable governmental or business- type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. The Department of Transportation uses the first-in first-out method to remove the capitalized cost of a r eplaced road along with corresponding accumulated depreciation. Capital assets in Governmental Funds are recorded as expenditures in the funds used to acquire or construct them in the governmental fund financial statements. Capital assets, along with accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense, which includes amortization of intangible assets, are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. 65STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Land and construction in progress are not depreciated. With the exception of infrastructure reported by the Department of Transportation (which uses the composite method), other capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Assets Years Buildings 10-50 Infrastructure 10-50 Furniture, Automobiles, and Equipment 3-20 Intangibles 3-99 L. DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES Deferred outflow of resources represents a consumption of net position by the government that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then. Deferred outflows of resources are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns, or in the component units column on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. M. LEASE COMMITMENTS The State leases land, office facilities, office and computer equipment, and other assets. Leases are classified according to GASB 62. Many of these leases have fiscal funding clauses; however, these clauses have no effect on classifying these leases for accounting purposes. Leases which represent acquisitions are classified as capital leases, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in the financial statements at the inception of the lease. Other leases are classified as operatin g leases with the lease payments recorded as expenditures or expenses during the life of the lease. N. FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED Federal Funds Purchased represent federal funds borrowed by the Bank of North Dakota from member banks generally on an overnight basis at the federal funds rate. O. CLAIMS/JUDGMENTS PAYABLE Claims/Judgments Payable is primarily Workers Compensation Claims Incurred But Not Yet Reported (IBNR) by the claimants as well as claims related to various litigation matters. P. COMPENSATED ABSENCES ANNUAL LEAVE State employees accrue vested annual leave at a variable rate based on years of service. Teachers employed by the State do not receive annual leave. In general, accrued annual leave cannot exceed 30 days at each year end, as set by the agency. The amount of annual leave earned ranges between one and two days per month, and is fixed by the employing unit per section 54-06-14 of the NDCC. The governmental fund financial statements recognize annual leave when the liability is incurred and payable from available expendable resources. This normally occurs only if an employee has unused reimbursable leave still outstanding at the time of their termination. The government-wide financial statements present the cost of accumulated annual leave as a liability. Proprietary and Fiduciary Funds recognize the expense and accrued liability when the annual leave is earned. SICK LEAVE The North Dakota Century Code, section 54-06-14, states employees accrue sick leave at the rate of one to a maximum of one and one-half working days per month of employment without limitation on the amount that can be accumulated. Employees vest at ten years of creditable service, at which time the State is liable for ten percent of the employee's accumulated unused sick leave. The governmental fund financial statements recognize sick leave as it is incurred. The government-wide financial statements present the estimated cost of sick leave as a liability after an employee has been employed by the State for five consecutive years. Q. DEPOSITS The following two liability line items are presented in the Government-wide Statement of Net Position and/or fund financial statements: 66STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Deposits Held For Other Funds. \"Deposits Held for Other Funds\" are those deposits held by the Bank of North Dakota for other funds included in the reporting entity and shown on the fund financial statements. For purposes of the Government-wide Statement of Net Position, these amounts have been reclassified to internal balances. Other Deposits. \"Other Deposits\" are those deposits held by the Bank of North Dakota for non-reporting entity third parties. It also includes deposits held for students of the University System. Differences on the fund balance sheets between the liability \"Deposits Held for Other Funds\" and the assets \"Cash Deposits and Investments at the Bank of North Dakota\" are attributable to timing differences resulting from the Bank of North Dakota having a different accounting year end than many other state agencies. R. NET PENSION LIABILITY For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows related to pension, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the North Dak ota Public Employee Retirement System (PERS), North Dakota Highway Patrolmen's Retirement System (NDHPRS), Retirement Plan for the Employees of Job Service North Dakota (JSND) and North Dakota Teachers' Fund for Retirement (TFFR) and additions to / deductions from PERS, NDHPRS, JSND and TFFR's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported for PERS, NDHPRS, JSND and TFFR. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. The primary government's proportionate share of pension amounts were further reallocated to the propriety funds (business-type ac tivities) based on the amount of employer contributions paid by each proprietary fund. Pension investments are reported at fair value. S. NET OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS LIABILITY For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System (NDPERS) and additions to/deductions from NDPERS' fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by NDPERS. For this purpose, benefit payments are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. Job Service North Dakota engaged an actuary to determine the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflow of resources related to OPEB and OPEB expense for its Met Life Insurance Benefit plan. T. DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES Deferred inflows of resources represent an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period, and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time. Deferred inflows of resources are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns or in the component units column on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. Deferred inflows of resources of government al funds, proprietary fund, and discrete component units are reported in detail in their respective fund statements. U. NET POSITION/FUND BALANCE The difference between fund assets and liabilities is \"Net Position\" on the government-wide, proprietary, and fiduciary fund statements, and \"Fund Balance\" on governmental fund statements. CLASSIFICATIONS Fund balance classifications for governmental funds are reported in two general classifications, nonspendable and spendable. Nonspendable represents the portion of fund balance that is not in spendable form such as inventories and prepaids. Spendable fund balance is further categorized as restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. The restricted fund balance category includes amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by the State constitution and external parties, such as the federal government, or through enabling legislation. The committed fund balance classification includes amounts th at can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making authority, the state's legislature, through legislation , that is not considered as enabling legislation, passed into law. Assigned fund balance classifications are used when the amounts are to be used for specific purposes but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. The assignment of fund balance is generally initiated by the executiv e branch and later appropriated by the Legislature for a specific purpose. In governmental funds other than the general fund, assigned fund balance also represents the remaining amount that is not restricted or committed. 67STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the government's general fund and includes all spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications. In other funds, the unassigned classification would only be used to report a deficit balance resulting from overspending for specific purposes for which amounts had been restricted, committed, or assigned. The State generally segregates restricted, committed, and assigned resources by individual funds within the governmental funds. When resources meeting more than one of these classifications are comingled within an individual fund, the assumed order of spending is restricted first, committed second, assigned third, and finally, unassigned. BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) section 54-27.2-02 requires any amount in the state general fund in excess of sixty- five million dollars at the end of any biennium to be deposited in the Budget Stabilization Fund. Any interest or earnings of the fund must be deposited in the fund per NDCC section 54-27.2-01. However, any amounts provided by law for deposit in the fund and any interest or earning of the fund which would bring the balance in the fund to an amount greater than fifteen percent of the current biennial state general fund budget, as finally approved by the most recently adjourned special or regular session of the legislative assembly, may not be deposited or retained in the fund but must be deposited instead in the state general fund. NDCC section 54-27.2-03 states that if general fund revenue projections for the biennium will be at least two and one-half percent less than estimated by the most re cently adjourned special or regular session of the legislative assembly, and if the governor orders a transfer, which must be reported to the budget section of the legislative management, the state treasurer shall transfer the appropriate funds from the budget stabilization fund to the state general fund to offset the decrease in general fund revenues. The amount transferred upon order of the governor may not exceed the difference between an amount two and on-half percent below the general fund revenue projections for the biennium. The Budget Stabilization Fund, fund balance at June 30, 2020 was $726,903,611. V. REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES/EXPENSES In the Government-wide Statement of Activities, revenues and expenses are segregated by activity (governmental or business-type), then further by function for governmental acti vities (e.g., general government, education, health and human services, etc.). Additionally, revenues are classified between program and general revenues. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants for goods or services, 2) operating grants and contributions, and 3) capital grants and contributions. Internally dedicated resources are reported as general revenues, rather than as program revenue. General revenues include all taxes and money from tobacco settlements. Certain indirect costs are included in the program expenses reported for individual functions. In the government-wide financial statements, revenues are reported by source and are further classified as either \"general purpose\" or \"restricted\". General purpose revenues are available to fund any activity accounted for in the fund. Restricted revenues are, either by State law or by outside restriction (e.g., federal grants), available only for specified purposes. When both general purpose and restricted funds are available for use, it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first. In the governmental fund financial statements, expenditures are re ported are sub-classified by function and are for items such as salaries, grants, supplies, and services. Capital outlay includes expenditures for real property or infra structure (e.g., highways). Intergovernmental-revenue sharing accounts for the distribution of certain tax revenues that are shared with local units based upon constitutional and statutory requirements. Debt service includes both interest and principal outlays related to bonds and payments on capitalized leases. Revenues and expenses of proprietary funds are classified as operating or nonoperating and are sub classified by object (e.g., salaries, depreciation, and purchases for resale). Operating revenues consist of sales of goods and services, quasi- external operating transactions with other funds, grant revenues for specific activities that are considered to be operating activities of the grantor, receipts from other agencies for reimbursement of operating transactions, and other miscellaneous revenue that should be classified as operating. Grants that would qualify as an operating activity are those that do not subsidize an existing program, rather they finance a program the agency would otherwise not undertake. For certain loan and investment programs, revenue that would normally be classified as non-operating should be classified as operating. Examples of this would include interest and investment income. All other revenues that do not meet the above criteria should be classified as non-operating. 68STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA W. ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assump tions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE 2 - RESTATEMENTS The changes to beginning net position are summarized in the following table (expressed in thousands): Government-wide Gov't Activities Component Units (GASB Based) Component Units (FASB Based) State Historical Society Foundation June 30, 2019, net position, as previously reported $ 20,612,163 $ 549,583 $ - Prior period adjustments: Correction of Errors (1,092) (1,079) 1,079 June 30, 2019, net position, as restated $ 20,611,071 $ 548,504 $ 1,079 A. CORRECTION OF ERRORS The beginning net position of the Government-wide governmental activities were restated due to an overstatement of construction in progress of $1.092 million. The Component Units (GASB Based) net position was reduced $1.079 million to reclassify the State Historical Society of North Dakota Foundation from the GASB component units to the FASB component units statements, as the Foundation is accounted for under the FASB basis. NOTE 3 - DETAILED NOTES ON ACCOUNT BALANCES A. DEPOSITS CUSTODIAL CREDIT RISK The State minimizes custodial credit risk by restrictions set forth in state statute. Custodial credit risk is risk associated with the failure of a depository financial institution. In the event of a depository financial institution's failure, the State woul d not be able to recover its deposits or collateralized securities that are in the possession of the outside parties. State law generally requires that all State funds be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota. NDCC 21-04-01 provides that public funds belonging to or in the custody of the State shall be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota. Also, NDCC 6-09-07 states, \"all state funds . . . must be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota\" or must be deposited in accordance with constitutional and statutory provisions. The State does not have a formal policy that addresses custodial credit risk for deposits. At June 30, 2020, the bank balance of the primary government's deposits was $444,521,116. Of the bank amount, $196,738,000 was uncollateralized and uninsured. There were significant concentrations of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits in the Bank of North Dakota and University System at June 30, 2020. Their uninsured and uncollateralized deposits totaled $196.7 million and $789 thousand, and their bank deposits totaled $198.3 million and $18.3 million, respectively. At June 30, 2020, the bank balance of the major component units' deposits was $104,790,495. Of the bank amount, $103,233,156 was uncollateralized and uninsured. The internal receivable amount in the governmental activities column in the Statement of Net Position includes Cash and Investments at the Bank of North Dakota for governmental activities. The internal payable amount in the business-type activities column includes deposits the Bank has for governmental activities. Because the Bank has a different fiscal year end, these internal balances do not equal. 69STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA B. INVESTMENTS The investment policies of the State of North Dakota are governed by NDCC 6-09-07, 15-10-12, and 21-04-02, indicating that all public funds must be deposited in the Bank of North Dakota unless there are other constitutional or statutory provisions. If there are no statutory provisions and the funds are invested outside the Bank of North Dakota, the state agency must have the permission of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. Investments are generally managed by the State Investment Board, the North Dakota Department of Trust Lands, the Bank of North Dakota, and the North Dakota State Treasurer's Office. Management responsibilities and investment instruments as authorized by statute are as follows: 1. State Investment Board (SIB) - NDCC 21-10 designates the SIB with investment responsibilities for the Public Employees' Retirement System, Bonding Fund, Teachers' Fund for Retirement, Fire and Tornado Fund, Workforce Safety & Insurance Fund, and other specific funds. The Century Code states the SIB shall apply the prudent investor rule in investing funds under its supervision. The retirement funds belonging to the teachers' fund for retirement and the public employees' retirement system must be invested exclusively for the benefit of their members and in accordance with the respective funds' investment goals and objectives. The State Investment Board's investment policy allows investment managers to use derivative securities to hedge or replicate underlying exposures but not for speculation. All derivatives are considered investment derivative investments. The SIB had four types of derivative securities at June 30, 2020: futures, options, swaps and currency forwards. 2. North Dakota Department of Trust Lands - The Century Code states that the Department of Trust Lands shall apply the prudent investor rule in investing its funds. The investment policies of the Board allow the use of derivative securities to hedge or replicate underlying exposures but not for speculation. All derivatives are considered investment derivative investments. 3. The Bank of North Dakota - NDCC 6-09 authorizes the Bank of North Dakota. The Bank is owned and operated by the State of North Dakota under the supervision of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. The Bank may have investments in anything that any bank lawfully may do, except what is restricted by NDCC 6-09. 4. The North Dakota State Treasurer's Office - The North Dakota Constitution and various sections of the Century Code authorize the State Treasurer to invest all State funds deposited with the State Treasury. However, the State Treasurer must invest the public funds with the Bank of North Dakota unless there is statutory authority to do otherwise. Generally, the State Treasurer pools deposits and invests in money market accounts and Bank of North Dakota certificates of deposit. 5. University System - NDCC 15-55-05 and 15-55-06 govern the investment of proceeds of revenue bonds and revenues pledged to bondholders. Such proceeds must be invested in the Bank of North Dakota, in a separate fund in the State Treasury or in a duly authorized depository for the state funds that is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation. The University System may invest such funds in direct obligation of, or in obligations where the United States of America guarantees the principal and interest, or obligations of the State of North Dakota or any municipality as defined in NDCC Section 21-03-01. Agency investments, of the primary government, under management of the State Investment Board are included below with the Pension and Investment Trust funds. 70STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates of debt securities will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The price of a debt security typically moves in the opposite direction of the change in interest rates. The State does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to potential fair value losses arising from future changes in interest ra tes. However, North Dakota Housin g Finance's respective bond resolutions permit only investments that will not adversely affect the rating quality of the outstanding bonds. Also, the maturity date or the date on which such investment obligations may be redeemed shall coincide as nearly as practicable with the date or dates on which moneys in the funds or accounts for which the investments were made will be required. The Bank of North Dakota's investment policy provides for a duration range of one to four years, which will serve to decrease interest rate risk. At June 30, 2020, the following tables show the debt securities of the primary government and major component units by investment type and maturity (expressed in thousands). Primary Government (includes Pens ion and Investment Trust Funds) Investment Type Total Fair Value Less Than 1 Year 1 - 6 Years 6 - 10 Years More Than 10 Years Asset Backed Securities $ 589,018 $ 104 $ 122,916 $ 224,913 $ 241,085 Collateralized - Pooled Investments 1,562,242 27,553 Total $ 5,489,891 $ 1,611,138 $ 3,148,976 Major Component Units Investment Type Total Fair Value Less Than 1 Year 1 - 6 Years 6 - 10 Years More Than 10 Years Commercial Paper $ 4,799 $ 4,799 $ - $ - $ - Corporate Notes 17,868 13,321 4,547 - - Government Agencies - Government Bonds 30,239 15,614 14,625 - - Short Term Bills and Notes 11,916 11,916 - - - Total Debt Securities $ 73,267 $ 50,521 $ 22,746 $ - $ - The fair values of inflation indexed bonds are reflected in the tables above, based on their stated maturity dates. The principal balances of these bonds are adjusted every six months based on the inflation index for that period. Some investments are more sensitive to interest rate changes than others. Variable and floating rate collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO's), asset-backed securities (ABS), int erest-only and principal-only securities are examples of investments whose fair values may be highly sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest-only (IO) and principal-only (PO) strips are transactions which involve the separation of the interest and principal components of a security. They are highly sensitive to prepayments by mortgagors, which may result from a decline in interest rates. The State held no PO's and held IOs valued at $24.4 million. The State has no policy regarding IO or PO strips. 71STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to th e magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer. The State does not have an investment policy that specifically addresses concentrations of credit risk in a single issuer, however the Bank of North Dakota has established asset allocation ranges for investments as a percentage of their total portfolio. The Bank of North Dakota had the following concentr ations at June 30, 2020 (expressed in thousands): Amount Percent Federal Agency Federal Home Loan Bank $ 244,471 12.3% Small Business Administration 221,472 11.2% Farm 2.8% $ 1,982,467 100.0% CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The State maint ains a highly diversified portfolio of debt securities encompassing a wide range of credit ratings. Although the State has no overall policy regarding credit risk, each debt securities manager is given a specific set of guidelines to invest within based on the mandate for which it was hired. The guidelines specify in which range of credit the manager may invest. These ranges include investment grade and below investment grade categories. The Bank of North Dakota's investment policy provides minimum credit quality ratings for its investments and asset allocation ranges for investments as a percentage of the total portfolio. 72STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA As of June 30, 2020, the following tables present the debt securities of the primary government and major component units and their respective ratings (expressed in thousands). Primary Government (includes Pension and In vestment Trust Funds) S&P Credit Rating* Total Fair Value AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC CC C D Not 4,629 2,633 - - - - - - - - Commercial Pape r 33,978 - - - - - - - - - - 33,978 10,372 - - 175 915 2,635 923 2,639 - 3,065 134,804 9,712 15,581 - 728,275 - 711,156 1,023 5,240 - 8,463 Issued CMB 46,648 2,044 44,604 - - - - - - Municipal/ Provincial Bonds 73,940 8,156 186,988 - 6,098 - - - - - - - Investments 1,781,834 380,144 230,607 Total Debt Securities $10,669,555 73STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Major Component Units Total Fair Value AA A BBB Commercial Pape r $ 4,799 $ - $ 4,799 $ - Short Term Bills & Notes 11,916 - 11,916 - Government Agencies 8,445 8,445 - - Corporate Notes 17,868 631 14,148 3,089 Total Credit Risk Debt Securities 43,028 $ 9,076 $ 30,863 $ 3,089 US Gov't & Agencies 30,239 Total Debt Securities $ 73,267 *Ratings are determined in the following order: 1) S&P rating, 2) Moody's rating, 3) Fitch rating, 4) Manager-determined rating (internal rating) and 5) if no ratings are available using steps 1-4, then shown as not rated. **US government agency securities explicitly guaranteed by the US government are categorized here. Credit ratings of US government agency securities that are only implicitly guaranteed by the US government are categorized accordingly in the main body of this table. Implicitly guaranteed agency securities included in the Asset Backed, Commercial Mortgage Backed, Gov't Issued Commercial & Gov't Mortgage Backed, Gov't Agencies, Gov't Bonds, Index Linked Gov't Bonds and Short Term Bills and Notes categories are issued by FNMA, FHLB, FHLMC, FAMC and TVA. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Foreign currency risk is the risk that chan ges in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment or a deposit. Although the State Investment Board does not have a formal investment policy governing foreign currency risk, the board does manage its exposure to fair value loss by requiring their international securities investment managers to maintain diversified portfolios to limit foreign currency and security risk. The Department of Trust Lands treats currency exposure in two different ways, depending on the type of investment. For the Board's international equity portfolio, the currency exposure is not hedged, as currency exposure is one of the items that adds diversity to the overall portfolio. For foreign bonds, the Board fully hedges the currency exposure, as the purpose of this portfolio is to generate more consistent returns. 74STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA At June 30, 2020, foreign currency risk exposure on investments managed by the Department of Trust Lands and State Investment Board were as follows (expressed in thousands).

The investment policies of the States' clients allow the use of derivative securities to hedge or replicate underlying exposures but not for speculation. All derivatives are considered investment derivative instruments. The fair value of all derivative securities is reported in the Statement of Net Position. At June 30, 2020, the State had four types of derivative securities: futures, options, swaps and currency forwards. Futures - Futures represent commitments to purchase (asset) or sell (liability) securities at a future date and at a specific price. Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges (e xchange traded) thereby minimizing the States' counterparty risk. The net change in the futures contracts' value is settled daily in cash with the exchanges. Net gains or losses resulting from the daily settlements are included in net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $65.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. At June 30, 2020, the State investment portfolio had the notional futures shown below (expressed in thousands). Futures Notional Value Cash and cash equivalent derivative futures Long $ - Short (258,482) Equity derivative futures Long 1,064,665 Short - Fixed income derivative futures Long 262,374 Short (1,703,654) Total futures $ (635,097) Options - Options represent or give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) an asset at a preset price over a specified period. Options are traded on organized exchanges (exchange traded) thereby minimizing the States' counterparty credit risk. The option's price is usually a small percentage of the underlying asset's value. As a seller of a financial option, the State, through its investment manager, receives a premium at the beginning of the agreement and bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option. As a buyer of a financial option, the State, through its investment manager, pays a premium at the beginning of the agreement and the counterparty bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option. Gains and losses on options are determined based on fair values and recorded with the net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $5.3 million. At June 30, 2020, the State had the following option balances (expressed in thousands): Options Fair Value Cash & Other Options Call $ 201 Put 537 Fixed Income Options Call (146) Put (70) Total options $ 522 Swaps - A swap is a derivative in which counterparties exchange certain benefits of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. Specifically, the two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows for another stream. The State, through its investment managers, has entered into various swap agreements in an attempt to manage its exposure to interest rate, inflation, credit, currency risk and total return. Gains and losses on swaps are determined based on fair values and are recorded with the net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $(22.5) million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The maximum loss that would be recognized at June 30, 2020, if all counterparties failed to perform as contracted is $3.0 million. Swap fair values are det ermined by a third party pricing source. 76STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA At June 30, 2020, the States' investment portfolio had the swap fair value balances as shown below (expressed in thousands).

A forward exchange contract is a commitment to purchase (positive) or sell (negative) a currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. The gain or loss arising from the difference between the original contracts and the closing of such contracts is included in the net change in fair value of investments in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position and totaled $2.0 million.

ENDOWMENT FUNDS UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS The endowment funds reported herein are institutional funds under the terms of the gift instrument and are not wholly expendable by the institution. NDCC Section 59-21, the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) applies to the investment of endowments governed by a gift instrument. NDUS SBHE policy 810 stipulates endowment funds shall be invested according to the intent of the donor provided such intent is consistent with applicable laws. Absent terms expressing donor intent in a gift instrument, NDUS institution officers initially shall deposit the funds in institution accounts at the Bank of North Dakota. Thereafter, the funds may be invested according to NDCC 59-21. Subject to the intent of the donor, NDUS institution officers are delegated authority to manage and invest these institutional funds as provided by UPMIFA. NDCC Section 59-21-02.5a(7) applies to stand ard of conduct in the administration of powers to make and retain investments. It states that in managing and investing an institutional fund, the needs of the institution and the fund to make distributions and to preserve capital must be considered. Given the flexibility in NDCC 59-21-02, institutions have differing policies with respect to spending investment income and net appreciation on endowment funds. For UND, distributions for spending endowments each year will be calculated once annually with the quarter ended December 31 unitized market value and is based on the set spending rate, currently four percent, applied to the average market value for the preceding twelve quarter average. All endowment in existence at December 31 for one year will receive a distribution spending allocation. The available amount will be forecast to UND for planning purposes by February 1, and these distributions will be available for spending in the upcoming fiscal year. NDSU determines the spending of endowment earnings based on an annual evaluation. WSC give departments authority to spend all investment income earned on the endowment funds. 79STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Net appreciation on investments are available for expenditure and consist of the following at June 30, 2020: Reflected in net position as: North Dakota State University $ 294,201 Expendable scholarships & fellowships University of North Dakota 911,679 Non-expendable scholarships & fellowships State fellowships Total NDUS $ 1,210,097 Endowment funds reported herein do not include the Federal Land Grant Fund held by the State Department of Trust Lands.

REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS State statutes permit the State to enter into reverse repurchase agreements, that is, the sale of securities with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase them in the future at the same price plus a contract rate of interest. The fair value of the securities underlying reverse repurchase agreements normally exceeds the cash received, providing the dealers a margin against a decline in fair value of the securities. All sales of investments under these agreements are for fixed terms. In investing the proceeds of these agreements, State policy is for the term to maturity of the investment to be the same as the term of the agreement. Such matching existed at year end. These agreements are secured by Fed book-entry securities held in the State's name. At June 30, 2020, the State had and average daily balance of $3,000 of repurchase agreements with a 0.00% interest rate and a 3.04% weighted average interest rate paid during the year. G.

OPERATING LEASES PAYMENTS ON OPERATING LEASES The State is obligated under certain leases accounted for as operating leases. Operating leases do not give rise to property rights or lease obligations, and therefore, the resulting expenditures are recognized as incurred. Lease expenditures for the year ended June 30, 2020, amounted to $17.9 million for governmental activities and $15.6 million for business-type activities. Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of June 30, 2020, for all f und types are as follows (expressed in thousands): Year Ending June 30 Governmental Activities Business-type Activities Total Minimum Lease Payments $ 35,797 $ 30,871 J. CAPITAL LEASES The State is obligated under certain leases accounted for as capital leases. In the government-wide and proprietary fund statements, capital assets and a corresponding liability are recorded at the inception of the lease. The liability is reduced by payments of principal, with a portion of the payment allocated to interest expense. For capital leases in governmental funds, other financing sources and expenditures are recorded at lease inception. Lease payments are recorded as debt service expenditures. The schedule below lists the future minimum lease payments under these capital leases and the present value of the net minimum lease payments at June 30, 2020 (expressed in thousands): Year Ending June 30 Governmental Activities Business- type Activities Major Component Units 2021 $ 511 $ 6,847 $ 128 2022 190 6,607 128 2023 125 6,231 2024 - 1,866 - 2051-2055 - - Total Minimum Lease Payments 911 67,443 1723 Less: Amount Representing Interest (77) (15,781) (470) Present Value of Future Minimum Lease Payments $ 834 $ 51,662 $ 1,253 87STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The historical costs of assets acquired under capital leases, and included as capital assets on the government-wide Statement of Net Position at June 30, 2020, is as follows (expressed in thousands): Governmental ActivitiesBusiness- Type Activities Major Component Units Infrastructure $ - $ 60 $ - Buildings - 52,425 1,979 Intangibles - 156 - Depreciation (1,805) (19,451) (1,093) Total $ 610 $ 49,240 $ 886 K. DEFERRED OUTFLOWS OF RESOURCES FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT The State enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify interest rates on certain liabilities. The fair values of both hedging derivatives and investment derivatives (if any) are presented on the Statement of Net Position, either as a derivative liability (negative fair value) or as a derivative asset (positive fair value). The change in the total fair value o f derivatives that are determined to be effective hedges is recorded as a deferred inflow or outflow of resources on the Statement of Net Position. If a derivative were determined to be an ineffective hedge, it would be classified as an investment derivative, and the change in the total fair value would be presented as part of investment earnings. DEFERRED LOSS ON BOND REFUNDING A deferred charge on refunded debts results from the difference in the carrying value of the refunded debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. L. LONG-TERM DEBT Debt authorized is generally limited by the state constitution. The Constitution of North Dakota provides that the State may issue or guarantee the payment of bonds, provided that all bonds in excess of $2 million are: (1) secured by first mortgage upon property and no further indebtedness may be incurred by the State unless evidenced by a bond issue; (2) authorized by law; (3) for a certain purpose; (4) provisioned to pay the interest semiannually; and (5) the principal is paid within 30 years. Additionally, the law authorizing the bond issue must specifically appropriate the provisions to the payment of the principal and interest of the bond. 1. REVENUE BONDS Bonds payable at June 30, 2020, consisted of bonds issued by the State and are accounted for by the respective state agencies in the government-wide financial statements that issued the bonds. Current state statutes empower certain state agencies to issue bonds as part of their activities. This debt is not backed by the full faith and credit of the State of North Dakota. The principal and interest on such bonds shall be payable only from the applicable agency's program income.

The total principal and interest remaining to be paid as of June 30, 2020, is $23.1 million payable through December 2030. 88STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The 2010 bond agreements require the establishment and maintenance of reserve funds to be used for debt service payments if amounts in the bond funds are insufficient to make payments. Fund are also required for any positive arbitration due to the Federal government. Student Loan Trust Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 2004 Series A Bonds are variable rate bonds. The rate of interest is determined based on one-month LIBOR plus 0.7% . The maximum rate of interest is 12% per annum. Details of the terms and provisions of the variable rate bonds are outlined in Section 2.1 of the Fourth Supplemental Resolution to the State of North Dakota Student Loan Revenue Bonds First General Bond Resolution. Section 2.2 of the Fourth Supplemental Resolution to the State of North Dakota Student Loan Revenue Bonds First General Bond Resolution has deemed these to be Federally Taxable Bonds. The Series 2004 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of the Commission from any source of funds, in whole or in part, on any date at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to date of redemption.

Principal and interest paid for the current year and total customer net revenues were $100.5 million and $30.0 million, respectively. Bond principal was reduced through customer revenues and the refunding of older bonds with proceeds from new bond issues. Pursuant to the Series Resolutions adopted to date and under the 1994 and 2009 General Resolutions, the revenues generated by the Program Loans (but not the Program Loan s themselves) are pledged to secure the Bonds. The Agency is permitted by terms of the General Resolutions to issue Bonds and pledge Revenues pursuant to the Series Resolution which exceed the amount required to meet the obligations of that Series of Bonds. In such event, it is likely that any such Series of bonds would produce excess Revenues which could be available to redeem the related Series of bonds or any other Series of Bonds prior to the state maturities thereof. University System Revenue bonds are limited obligations of the University System. The principal and interest on the bonds are payable generally from the net income of specific auxiliary activities, designated student fees, interest subsidies and debt service reserve funds.

M. ARBITRAGE REBATE PAYABLE Arbitrage as it applies to government financing refers to the ability of state governments to obtain funds at a tax-exempt rate of interest and to then invest those funds in investments which earn a higher yield, resulting in a profit to the issuer. The arbitrage rebate rules require that any earnings from the investment of the tax-exempt bond proceeds which exceed the yield on the bonds be remitted to the federal government. The State had no arbitrage rebate payable to the federal government as of June 30, 2020. N. DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES GRANTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO TIME REQUIREMENTS This amount represents unavailable revenue. The amounts are deferred and recognized as an inflow of resources in the period that the amounts become available. INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF HEDGING DERIVATIVES This amount represents the changes in fair value of futures. O. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value measurements are used to record fair value adju stments to certain assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources to determine fair value disclosures. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY In accordance with GASB Statement No. 72, assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources are grouped at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: Level 1: Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 95STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Level 2: Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumpt ions are observable in the market. Level 3: Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE In accordance with GASB Statement No. 72, fair values are based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is the State's policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The following is a description of the methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value. Securities classified in Level 1 are valued using quoted prices in active markets for those securities. Securities classified in Level 2 and Level 3 are valued using methodologies such as various bid evaluations, market averages and other matrix pricing techniques as well as values derived from associated traded securities or last trade data. In instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels, the fair value is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the valuation. Investments valued at the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) have been classified separately in the table below and include investments considered to be alternative investments as defined by the AICPA. The definition includes investments for which a readily determinable fair value does not exist (that is, investments not listed on national exchanges or over-the-counter markets, or for which quoted market prices are not available from sources such as financial publications, the exchanges, or NASDAQ). These types of inv estments can be held within any of the asset classes used by the State based on underlying portfolio holdings and analysis of risk and return relationships. These investments can be structured in different ways, including limited partnerships, limited liability companies, common trusts and mutual funds. Some are closed-ended with a specific life and capital commitment while others are open-ended with opportunity for ad hoc contributions or withdrawals and termination upon proper notice. Commingled/Mutual Funds - These types of funds are generally open-ended funds and may be utilized in equities or fixed income asset classes. They are funds made up of underlying securities that have readily available fair values (publicly traded stocks or bonds). The State owns units of these funds rather than the individual securities. Contributions or withdrawals from these funds can be made as needed, generally with daily or monthly liquidity, with a notice period of one to fifteen days. Because they are liquid funds, there are no unfunded commitments for these types of investments. Private Credit - These investments include loans to private companies, privately placed debt of public companies, or loans backed by real assets. Loan repayment can be derived from either cash flows from an operating company or cash flows generated by a physical or esoteric asset. Private debt is typically secured and has various protections/covenants in place. The debt is customized to the borrower's requirement, thus rendering it illiquid. The State includes these strategies within its global fixed income allocation through limited partnership-type structures. Private credit issuers may be investment grade but are typically below-investment grade and similar in some respect to the syndicated bank loan and high yield markets. The State employs two senior private debt funds, commonly referred to as direct lenders, which are structured as custom managed accounts that are not eligible for redemptions during remaining investment lives of 1 to 2 years, and the unfunded commitments totaled $191.2 million as of June 30, 2020. Private Equity - Private Equity investments are typically private interests in corporations across different areas of the capital structure and in different stages of the corporations' development via limited partnership vehicles. Private Equity investments are illiquid and long term in nature (10-12 years), typically held until maturity. Private Equity portfolios genera lly have a \"J-Curve Effect\" whereby there are low to negative returns in the initial years due to the payment of investment management fees and initial funding of investments made by the General Partner during a period when investments are typically carried at cost and returns have not been realized. To diversify the program, Private Equity investments are made across business cycles, vintage years, and different strategies. The State has a dedicated sub-asset class for private equity investments within its global equity allocation in the pension pool. The State does not the option to request redemptions from its private equity funds. The General Partner distributes earnings and proceeds from the sale of the underlying investments as transactions occur. The State has $333.3 million in unfunded private equity commitments as of June 30, 2020. 96STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Venture Capital - These include investments in companies in a range of stages of development from start-up/seed stage, early stage, and later/expansion stage. Investments are typically made in years one through six and returns typically occur in years four through ten. Buyouts - These include investments in funds that seek out and purchase underperforming or undervalued companies in order to improve them and sell them or take them public many years later. These funds are also often involved in management buyouts, which are buyouts conducted by the management of the company being purchased, and they often play key roles in leveraged buyouts, which are buyouts that are funded with borrowed money. Distressed Debt - These include investments in the debt instruments of companies which may be publicly traded or privately held that are financially distressed and are either in bankruptcy or likely candidates for bankruptcy. Typical holdings are senior and subordinated debt instruments, mo rtgages and bank loans. The State includes these types of investments in its private equity asset class. As of June 30, 2020, unfunded commitments in one of its two distressed debt funds totaled $90.6 million. The fund is no t eligible for redemptions. The other fund is eligible for redemp tions with quarterl y liquidity and 60 days notice, and has no unfunded commitment. Mezzanine Debt - This strategy is a hybrid of debt and equity financing. It is basically debt capital that gives the lender the rights to convert to an ownership or equity interest in the company if the loan is not paid back in time and in full. It is generally subordinated to senior debt. The State utilizes this st rategy, through a limited partnership structure, in its global fixed income allocation. The two funds in this category are not eligible for redemptions, have remaining lives of 1-4 years, and unfunded commitments of $8.5 million as of June 30, 2020. Equity Long/Short - This strategy is a combination of long and short po sitions, primarily in publicly traded equities. The State utilizes this strategy, through a limited partnership stru cture, with its global equity allocations. This is an open-ende d fund with monthly liquidity with a notice period of 15 days. There was no unfunded commitment as of June 30, 2020. Real Assets - These investments are intended to provide allocations to tangible assets that are expected to be inflation protected and provide performance above the inflation rate as indicated by the CPI. Investments are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Inve stments in Real Estate Assets include Real Estate, Timberland and Infrastructure, as discussed below. Real Estate - includes investments in private vehicles through limited partnerships or commingled vehicles that have an ownership interest in direct real estate properties. The investment strategies may include \"value added\" strategies, which derive their return from both income and appreciation, \"opportunistic\", which derive their return primarily through appreciation, and \"alternative\" which invest in less traditional types of property. Both domestic and international real estate funds are utilized. The State has a dedicated sub-asset class for these types of investments within global real assets. There are currently 9 different real estate funds in the portfolio. Four of those funds are open-ended vehicles that accept redemption requests quarterly with a 30-90 day notification period. Two of the four open-ended funds had unfunded commitments totaling $45 million as of June 30, 2020. The remaining five funds are closed-ended limited partnerships that are not eligible for redemptions. Those five funds have a combined unfunded commitment of $85.1 million as of June 30, 2020. Timberland - includes investments in limited liability companies that have an ownership interest in properties where the value of the property is derived mainly from income-producing timber but also from the \"higher and better use\" value of the underlying land. The State includes these assets within its global real asset allocations. There are three funds in the portfolio and they have no unfunded commi tments. The funds are not eligible for redemption other than distributions of income and/or proceeds as determined by the investment manager. The funds have remaining lives of 1-6 years. Infrastructure - includes investments in limited partnerships that have an ownership interest in transportation assets such as toll roads, tunnels and bridges; and regulated assets such as electricity transmission, gas and oil distribution and wastewater collection. Other possible investments would include communication assets and social infrastructure. The State includes these assets within its global real assets allocations. The infrastructure investments in the portfolio as of June 30, 2020, include both open and closed-ended funds. The open-ended funds have no unfunded commitments and are eligible for redemptions quarterly with 90 days notice. There may be a 3-12 month queue for receiving redemptions. The closed- ended funds have unfunded commitments of $116.3 million at June 30, 2020 and are not eligible for redemptions. Interest Rate Swap Agreements - Fair values for interest rate swap agreements are based upon the settlement value adjusted by estimated nonperformance risk. Derivative Instruments - Fair values of the grain future contracts are determined on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. 97STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Fair Value The following table shows the fair value leveling of the State's assets and liabilities at June 30 (expressed in thousands).

DESCRIPTION OF PLANS The State of North Dakota administers four major retirement systems: North Dakota Public Employees' Retirement System, North Dakota Highway Patrolmen's Retirement System, Retirement Plan for the Employees of Job Service North Dakota and the Teachers' Fund for Retirement. The State also administers the North Dakota Defined Contribution Retirement Plan, which was established January 1, 2000. Certain state employees may also participate in a privately administered retirement system: Teachers' Insurance Annuity Association. The following is a brief description of each plan. More detailed information can be found in the plan agreements and the related legislation. NORTH DAKOTA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM (PERS) The North Dakota Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of the State of North Dakota, its agencies, and various participating political subdivisions (Main System). It also covers Supreme and District Court judges, the National Guard Security Officers and Firefighters, peace officers and correctional officers employed by political subdivisions and as of August 1, 2017, firefighters employed by participating political subdivisions. Effective August 1, 2015, current and newly eligible members of the National Guard System were transferred to the Law Enforcement System. It is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974. PERS issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System, 400 East Broadway, Suite 505, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501. At June 30, 2020, the number of participating political subdivisions in PERS was: Cities 98 Counties 51 School Districts 129 Othe r 86 Total Participating Lo cal Political Subdivisions 364 Administration The North Dakota Retirement Board was created by the State Legislature and is the governing authority of PERS. Benefit and contribution provisions are administered in accordance with chapter 54-52 of the North Dakota Century Code. Responsibility for administration of the three defined benefit pens ion plans and the defined contribution plan is assigned to a Board comprised of nine members. The Board consists of a Chairman, who is appointed by the Governor; one member appointed by the Attorney General; one member appointed by the State Health Officer; two members of the legislative assemble appointed by a chairman of the legislative management, three members elected by the active membership of the NDPERS system; and one member elected by the retired public employees. The costs of administering the plan are financed through the contributions and investment earnings of each plan. 101STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Benefits Pension benefits are set by statute. The System has no provisions or policies with respect to automatic and ad hoc post- retirement benefit increases. Members are entitled to unreduced monthly pension benefits beginning when the sum of age and years of credited service equals or exceeds 85 (Rule of 85), or at normal retirement age (65). For members hired on or after January 1, 2016 the Rule of 85 will be replaced with the Rule of 90 with a minimum age of 60. The annual pension benefit is equal to 2.00% of their average monthly salary, using the highest 36 months out of the last 180 months of service, for each year of service. For members hired on or after January 1, 2020 the annual pension benefit is equal to 1.75% of their average monthly salary, using the three highest periods of twelve consecutive months employed during the last one hundred eighty months of employment. The Plan permits early retirement at ages 55-64 with five or more years of service. Supreme and district court judges are entitled to unreduced monthly pension benefits beginning at the normal retirement age (65) or Rule of 85. The monthly pension benefit for Supreme and district court judges is equal to a percentage of average monthly salary using the highest 36 consecutive months out of the last 180 months of service. The percentage is equal to 3.5% of final average monthly salary multiplied by the first 10 years of service, plus 2.80% of the average monthly salary times the second 10 years of service, plus 1.25% of average monthly salary times years of service in excess of 20 years. The judicial retirement formula is only applied to eligible judicial service. Non-judicial service benefits are calculat ed using the 2.00% multiplier. The plan permits early retirement at ages 55-64, with five or more years of service. The monthly pension benefit for National Guard at normal retire ment age (55). Effective August 1, 2015, the National Guard System will become part of the Law Enforcement System. Members of the Law Enforcement are entitled to unreduced monthly pension benefits at normal retirement age (55) or the rule of 85. The monthly pension benefit for the National Guard/Law Enforcement is equal to 2.00 percent of their average monthly salary, using the highest 36 months out of the last 180 months of service, for each year of service. The plan permits early retirement at ages 50-55 with three or more years of service for members. Members may elect to receive the pension benefits in the form of a single life, joint and survivor, term-certain annuity, or partial lump sum with ongoing annuity. Members may elect to receive the value of their accumulated contributions, plus interest, as a lump sum distribution upon retirement or termination, or they may elect to receive their benefits in the form of an annuity. For each member electing an annuity, total payment will not be less than the employee's accumulated contributions plus interest. Death and Disability Benefits Death and disability benefits are set by statute. If an active employee dies with less than three years of service for the Main System and Public Safety, or less than five years of service for Supreme and district court judges, a death benefit equal to the value of the employee's accumulated contributions, plus interest, is paid to the employee's beneficiary. If the employee has earned more than three years of service for the Main System and Public Safety, the surviving spouse will be entitled to a single payment refund, life-time monthly payments in an amount equal to 50% of the employee's accrued normal retirement benefit, or monthly payments in an amount equal to the employees' accrued 100% joint and survivor retirement benefit if the member had reached normal retirement age prior to date of death. If the surviving spouse dies before the employee's accumulated pension benefits are paid, the balance will be payable to the surviving spouse's designated beneficiary. For judges only who have earned five years of credited service, the death benefit is changed to the greater of (i) lump sum payment of accumulated contributions, and (ii) 100% of the member's accrued benefit (not reduced on account of age), payable for the spouse's lifetime. Eligible members who become totally disabled after a minimum of 180 days of service receive monthly disability benefits that are equal to 25% of their final average salary with a minimum benefit of $100. To qualify under this section, the member has to become disabled during the period of eligible employment and apply for benefits within one year of termination. The definition for \"disabled\" is set by the Board in the North Dakota Administrative Code. For Judges only, the disability benefit formula is changed to 70% of final average salary minus social security and workers compensation benefits. Refunds of Member Contributions Upon termination, if a member is not vested (is not 65 or does not have three years of service for the Main System and National Guard/Law Enforcement, or five years of service for the Supreme and district court judges, credited for PERS), they will receive the accumulated member contributions plus interest. If an employee has vested, they have the option of applying for a refund or can remain as a terminated vested participant. If a member terminated and withdrew their 102STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA accumulated employee contribution and is subsequently re-employed, they have the option of repurchasing their prior service. Contributions Contribution rates are set by state statute and are a percentage of salaries and wages. Members that made a qualifying election under Senate Bill 2015 to move from the Defined Contribution Plan back to the Defined Benefit Plan have a 2% increase on employee contributions. The 2019 Legislative Assembly passed legislation that ended the RHIC plan for new hires after January 1, 2020 and redirected the 1.14% RHIC employer contribution to the retirement account for both the PERS plan as well as the defined contribution plan. \u0003 Member contributions are set by state statue and are a percentage of salaries and wages. During the 1983-1985 biennium, the State implemented the employer pickup provision of the IRS code, whereby a portion or all of the required member contributions are made by the employer. The State is paying 4% of the full member contribution. Some of the political subdivisions are paying all or part of the member contributions. Employer contributions are set by statue except the contribution rates for the National Guard/Law Enforcement Pl ans which are set by the Board. Contribution rates are established as a percent of covered compensation as follows: Member Contributions Employer Contributions PERS Members first enrolled prior to 1/1/20 7.00% 7.12% Members first enrolled after to 1/1/20 7.00% 8.26% Members returning to the Defined Benefit Plan as a result of Senate Bill 2015 9.00% 7.12% Judges Retirement System 8.00% 17.52% Law Enforcement with previous service State - BCI Plan 6.00% 9.81% State - National Guard 5.50% 9.81% Political subdivisions 5.50% 9.81% Law Enforcement without previous service 5.50% 7.93% The member's account balance includes employee contributions, interest, and the vested employer contributions equal to the member's contributions to an eligible deferred compensation plan. Members of the Supreme and District Court Judges are not eligible to vest in the employer contributions if contributing to the deferred compensation plan. \u0003 The minimum monthly member contribution is $25, and the maximum may not exceed certain parameters based upon years of service.

The plan permits early retirement at ages 50-54, with ten or more years of service. Members may elect to receive the pension benefits in the form of a single life, joint and survivor, term-certain annuity, or partial lump sum with ongoing annuity.

For each member electing an annuity, total payment will not be less than the members' accumulated contributions plus interest. Death and Disability Benefits Death and disability benefits are set by statute. If an active member dies with less than 10 years of credited service, a death benefit equal to the value of the member's accumulated contributions, plus interest, is paid to the member 's beneficiary.

RETIREMENT PLAN FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF JOB SERVICE NORTH DAKOTA (JSND) The retirement plan for employees of Job Service North Dakota is a single-employer defined benefit public employee retirement plan administered by PERS. The plan is established under NDCC 52-11-01 with benefit provisions established through the plan document, as amended by the Board. This plan document, as amended, is authorized by the Plan Administrator, who is the Executive Director of the agency. JSND issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to Job Service North Dakota, PO Box 5507, Bismarck, North Dakota 58506-5507. Participation in the plan is limited to employees participating in the plan as of September 30, 1980. Administration On August 1, 2003, the administrative authority and the net position of the Retirement Plan for Employees of Job Service North Dakota were transferred from the agency to the Public Employees Retirement System Board. This action was based on the passage of House Bill 1064 by the Fifty-eighth Legisla tive Assembly of North Dakota. The Retirement Plan for Employees of Job Service has an Actuarial Valuation Report produced annually. Requests to obtain or review this report should be addressed to the Executive Director, NDPERS, 400 East Broadway, Suite 505, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501. The costs of administering the plan are financed through the contributions and investment earnings of the plan. 104STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Benefits Benefits are established through the plan document, as amended by the Board. The System provides a post-retirement cost-of living adjustment each year based on the Consumer Price Index. Employees are entitled to annual pension benefits beginning at normal retirement age (65). Employees may elect optional retirement eligibility at age 62 with 5 years of credited service, at age 60 with 20 years of credited service, or at age 55 with 30 years of credited service. Pension benefits are calculated based on the final average earnings (basic monthly earnings averaged over the highest three consecutive years of basic earnings) of the employee multiplied by the sum of: x1.5% times years of credited service up to 5 plus; x1.75% times years of credited service between 6 and 10 plus; x2.0% times years of credited service in excess of 10. Death and Disability Benefits The plan provides retirement, disability and death benefits. If death of a participant occurs prior to their annuity starting date, the surviving spouse who has been married at least two years prior to the participant's death or, if married less than two years is a parent of a child of this marriage, then the spouse shall receive monthly benefits. The amount is the greater of the benefit had the participant retired on the day before they died and elected the Contingent Annuitant Option with 55% of their retirement benefit continued to their spouse or 55% of the smaller of 40% of the deceased participant's average monthly earnings or the deceased participant's normal retirement benefit obtained by increasing their credited service by the period of time between their date of death, and the date they would have attained age 60. Upon remarriage of the surviving spouse before age 60, the death benefit will cease. If a participant becomes totally disabled, they will be eligible for a monthly disability benefit which shall be equal to the greater of 40% of the participant's average annual earnings or the accrued benefit determined as of their date of disability. Refunds of Member Contributions Upon termination, if a member of the JSND System terminates employment before retirement payments begin, participation in the retirement plan will cease. No further additions to retirement income will accrue on the member's behalf, and the member may be paid under one of the following options. xThe member may be paid an amount of retirement income with payments starting at Normal, Optional, or Early Retirement Date. The amount of that income will be equal to the amount provided under the formula according to the member's years of credited service and earnings. xThe member may receive a cash withdrawal benefit equal to the total of the member's contributions and employer contributions made on their behalf, plus 4 percent interest compounded annually. The member may elect this option at any time after withdrawal and before Normal, Optional, or Early Retirement Date, but such benefit shall be in place of all other benefits under the retirement benefits section. Contributions Member contributions are 3% and employer contributions are 4% of covered compensation. The funding policy of the plan provides for employer contributions at actuarially determined rates that, expressed as percentages of annual covered payroll, are designed to accumulate sufficient assets to pay benefits when due. Effective July 1, 1999, the \"scheduled contribution\" will be zero as long as the plan's actuarial value of assets exceeds the actuarial present value of projected benefits. The \"scheduled contribution\" and amortization will be determined when the plan is not in surplus and will be based on a funding policy adopted by the Employer. TEACHERS' FUND FOR RETIREMENT (TFFR) The North Dakota Teachers' Fund for Retirement is a cost-s haring multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan covering all North Dakota public teachers and certain other teachers who meet various membership requirements. TFFR provides for pension, death and disability benefits. The cost to administer the TFFR plan is financed by investment income and contributions. Teachers' Fund for Retirement issues a publicly available financial report that may be obtained by writing to the Retirement and Investment Office, 3442 East Century Avenue, P.O. Box 7100, Bismarck, North Dakota 58507-7100. 105STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA At June 30, 2020, the number of participating employer units in TFFR was: Type Numbe r Public School Districts 174 County Superintendents 6 Special Education Units 20 Vocational Education Units 4 Other 9 Total 213 Administration Responsibility for administration of the TFFR benefits program is assigned to a se ven-member Board of Trustees (Board). The Board consists of the State Treasurer, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and five members appointed by the Governor. The appointed members serve five-year terms which end on June 30 of alternate years. The appointed Board members must include two active teachers, one active school administrator, and two retired members. The Board submits any necessary or desirable changes in statues relating to the administration of the fund, including benefit terms, to the Legislative Assembly for consideration. The Legislative Assembly has final authority for changes to benefit terms and contributions rates. BenefitsFor purposes of determining pension benefits, members are classified within one of three categories. Tier 1 grandfathered and Tier 1 non-grandfathered members are those with service credit on file as of July 1, 2008. Tier 2 members are those newly employed and returning refunded members on or after July 1, 2008. Tier 1 Grandfathered - A Tier 1 grandfathered member is entitled to receive unreduced benefits when three or more years of credited service as a teacher in North Dakota have accumulated, the member is no longer employed as a teacher and has reached age 65, or the sum of age and years of service equals or exceeds 85. TFFR permits early retirement from ages 55 to 64, with benefits actuarially reduced by 6% per year for every year the member's retirement age is less than 65 years or the date as of which age plus service equal 85. In either case, benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension benefits paid by TFFR are determined by NDCC Section 15-39.1-10. Monthly benefits under TFFR are equal to the three highest annual salaries earned divided by 36 months and multiplied by 2.00% times the number of service credits earned. Retirees may elect payment of benefits in the form of a single life annuity, 100% or 50% joint and survivor annuity, ten or twenty-year term certain annuity, partial lump-sum option or level income with Social Security benefits. Members may also qualify for benefits calculated under other formulas. Tier 1 Non-grandfathered - A Tier 1 non-grandfathered member is entitled to receive unreduced benefits when three or more years of credited service as a teacher in North Dakota have accumulated, the member is no longer employed as a teacher, and the member has reached the age 65, or has reached age 60 and the sum of age and years of service credit equals or exceeds 90. TFFR permits early retirement from ages 55-64, with benefits actuarially reduced by 8% per year from the earlier of age 60/Rule of 90 or age 65. In either case, benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension benefits paid by TFFR are determined by NDCC Section 15-39.1-10. Monthly benefits under TFFR are equal to the three highest salaries earned divided by 36 months and multiplied by 2.00% times the number of service credits earned. Retirees may elect payment of benefits in the form of a single life annuity, 100% or 50% joint and survivor annuity, ten or twenty-year term certain annuity, partial lump-sum option or lev el income with Social Security benefits. Members may also qualify for benefits calculated under other formulas. Tier 2 - A Tier 2 member is entitled to receive unreduced benefits when five or more years of credited service as a teacher in North Dakota have accumulated, the member is no longer employed as a teacher and has reached age 65, or has reached age 60 and the sum of age and years of service credit equals or exceeds 90. TFFR permits early retirement from ages 55 to 64, with benefits actuarially reduced by 8% per year from the earlier of age 60/Rule of 90 or age 65. In either case, benefits may not exceed the maximum benefits specified in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Pension benefits paid by TFFR are determined by NDCC Section 15-39.1-10. Monthly benefits under TFFR are equal to the five highest annual salaries earned divided by 60 months and multiplied by 2.00% times the number of service credits 106STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA earned. Retirees may elect payment of benefits in the form of a single life annuity, 100% or 50% joint and survivor annuity, ten or twenty-year term certain annuity, partial lump-sum option or level income with Social Security benefits. Members may also qualify for benefits calculated under other formulas. Death and Disability Benefits Death benefits may be paid to a member's designated beneficiary. If a member's death occurs before retirement, the benefit options available are determined by the member's vesting status prior to death. If a member's death occurs after retirement, the death benefit received by the beneficiary (if any) is based on the retirement plan the member selected at retirement. An active member is eligible to receive disability benefits when: (a) a total disability lasting twelve months or more does not allow the continuation of teaching, (b) the member has a ccumulated five years of credit ed service in North Dakota, and (c) the Board of Trustees of TFFR has determined eligibility based upon medical evidence. The amount of the disabilitybenefit is computed by the retirement formula in NDCC 15-39.1-10 without consideration of age and uses the member's actual years of credited service. There is no actuarial reduction for reason of disability retirement. Contributions Member and employer contributions paid to TFFR are set by NDCC 15-39.1-09. Every eligible teacher in the state of North Dakota is required to be a member of TFFR and is assessed at a rate of 11.75% of salary as defined by NDCC 15-39.1- 04. Every governmental body employing a teacher must also pay into TFFR a sum equal to 12.75% of the teacher's salary. Member and employer contributions will be reduced to 7.75% each when the fund reaches 100% funded ratio on an actuarial basis. A vested member who terminates covered employment may elect a refund of contributions paid plus 6% or defer payment until eligible for pension benefits. A nonvested member who terminates covered employment must claim a refund of contributions paid before 70\u00bd. Refunded members forfeit all service credits under TFFR. These service credits may be repurchased upon return to covered employment under certain circumstance defined by state statue.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PLAN ASSET MATTERS BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The public employee retirement systems described above are considered part of the State of North Dakota's reporting entity and are included in the State's financial statements as pension trust funds. The financial statements of these systems are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Employee contributions are recognized as revenues in the period in which they are due. Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plans. 107STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA INVESTMENT POLICY The System's Board is responsible for establishing the investment policy for the fund assets, which includes setting investment goals and specifying the percentage of assets to be invested in various types of investments for PERS, NDHPRS and JSND. The investment goals are viewed over the long term. The Board recognizes the plans' performance objectives, benefit projections, and capital market expectations when determining the asset allocation. The SIB is responsible for managing the System's investments in accordance with the investment policy. The TFFR Board is responsible for establishing investment policy for the fund assets under NDCC 15-39.1-05.2. Benefit payments are projected to occur over a long period of time. This allows TFFR to adopt a long-term investment horizon and asset allocation policy for the management of fund assets. Asset allocation policy is critical because it defines the basic risk and return characteristics of the investment portfolio. Asset allocation targets are established using an asset-liability analysis designed to assist the Board in determining an accept able volatility target for the fund and an optimal asset allocation policy mix. This asset-liability analysis considers both sides of the plan balance sheet, utilizing both quantitativ e and qualitative inputs, in order to estimate the potential impact of various asset class mixes on key measures of total plan risk, including the resulting established impact of funded status and contribution rates. The following was the asset allocation policy as of June 30, 2020: Target Allocation PERS further details of the RHIC OPEB Plan. INVESTMENT RATE OF RETURN The money-weighted rate of return expresses investment performance, net of investment expense, adjusted for the changing amounts actually invested. The annual money-weighted rate of return on pension plan and OPEB plan investments, net of pension plan and OPEB plan investment expense, was as follows for details of the RHIC OPEB Plan. METHOD USED TO VALUE INVESTMENTS Investments are recorded at fair value determined by reference to published market data for publicly traded securities and through the use of independent valuation services and appraisals for other investments. The net increase in fair value of investments consists of the realized gains or losses and the unrealized increase or decrease in fair value of investments during the year. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are computed based on the difference between the sales price and the original cost of the investment sold. Realized gains and losses on investments that had been held in more than one fiscal year and sold in the current fiscal year were included as a change in the fair value of investments reported in the prior year(s) and the current year. Unrealized gains and losses are computed based on changes in the fair value of investments between years. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Interest income is recognized when earned. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. 108STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are components of net change in fair value of investments and are computed as described in note 1. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the following are the net realized Defined Contribution Plan (5,049) Deferred Compensation Plan 5,491,243 C. FUNDING STATUS AND PROGRESS NET PENSION LIABILITY OF THE PLANS The components of the net pension liability of the Plans at June 30, 2020 were as follows (expressed in thousands): PERS NDHPRS JSND TFFR Total 4,181,036 Plan fiduciary net position (3,154,351) (82,185) (95,251) (2,650,532) Net pension liability (asset) $ 3,225,449 $ 96,044 $ (31,122) $ 1,530,504 Plan fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability 49.44% 46.11% 148.53% 63.40% ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS PERS The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no assets smoothing) Inflation: 2.25% Salary Increase: 3.50% to 17.75% including inflation Retirement Age: Age-based tale of rates that specify to the type of eligible condition Mortality Rates: Sex-distinct Pub-2010 tables for General Employees, with scaling based on actual experience. Respective corresponding tables were used for healthy retirees, disabled retirees and active members. Other Notes: The interest rates on member contributions will decrease from 7.00% to 6.50% effective January 1, 2021. The benefit accrual rate for members first enrolled on or a fter January 1, 2020 in the Main and Public Safety Systems is 1.75% (compared to 2.00% for members enrolled before January 1, 2020. The investment return assumption was updated from 7.50% to 7.00% beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020. Other updates to actuarial assumptions since July 1, 2 019 valuation include changes to mortality tables used for the valuation as well as changes to the rates on annual salary increase, separation for active membership, disability, and retirement. The actuary assumptions were based on an experien ce review for the period July 1, 2014 to July 1, 2019. 109STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The employer rates to the System are the statutory/Board approved contribution rates of 7.12% of payroll for the Main System (8.26% for members enrolled on or after January 1, 2020), 17.52% for t he Judges System, 9.81% for the Public Safety with prior Main System, and 7.93% for the Public Safety without prior Main System service System. HPRS The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no assets smoothing) Inflation: 2.25% Salary Increase: Service-based table for members with less than five years of service and age-based table for members with more than five years of service. Retirement Age: Age-based tale of rates that specify to the type of eligible condition. Mortality Rates: Pub 2010 Healthy Retiree Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 103% for males and 101% for females. Pub-2010 Disabled Retiree Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 117% for males and 112% for females. Pub-2010 Employee Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 92% for both males and females. Mortality rates are projected from 2010 using MP-2019 scale. Other Notes: There were no benefit changes during the year. The assumptions were updated beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020 based on an experience study covering the period July 1, 2014 through July 1, 2019. The employer rate to the System is the stat utory contribution rate of 19.70% payroll. JSND The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no assets smoothing) Inflation: 2.25% Salary Increase: 3.50% Retirement Age: Age-based tale of rates that specify to the type of eligible condition.

Pub-2010 Employee Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 92% for both males and females. Mortality rates are projected from 2010 using the MP-2019 scale. Other Notes: There were no benefit changes during the year. The assumptions were updated beginning with the actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020 based on an experience study covering the period July 1, 2014 through July 1, 2019. 110STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The System has assets in excess of the present value of future benefits. Therefore, no employer contributions are being made. TFFR The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2020, using the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: 5 year smoothed market Inflation: 2.30% Salary Increase (Payroll Growth): 3.80% - 14.80%; varying by service, including inflation and productivity. Retirement Age: In the 2020 and 2015 valuations, rates of reti rement were changed to better reflect anticipated future experience. Investment Rate of Return: 7.75%, net of investments expense. Cost of Living Adjustment: None Mortality Rates: For the July 1, 2020, valuation, the post-reti rement healthy mortality table was updated to 104% of the PubT-2010 Retiree table for retirees and to 95% of the PubT-2010 Contingent Survivor table for beneficiaries, both projected with generational improvement using Scale MP-2019 . The disabled mortality was updated to the PubNS-2010 Non-Safety Disabled Mortality table projected with generational improvement using Scale MP-2019. The pre-retirement mortality table was updated to the Pub T-2010 Employee table projected with generational improvement using Scale MP- 2019.The actuarial assumptions used were based on the re sults of an experience study dated March 19, 2020. INVESTMENT RATE OF RETURN The long-term expected rate of return on investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimates ranges of expected future real rates of return (ex pected returns, net of pension plan investment expenses and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates to return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Estimates of arithmetic real rates of retu rn, for each major asset class included in the pension plan's target asset allocation as of July 1, 2020 is summarized in the following tables: PERS and NDHPRS Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return JSND Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return TFFR Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return Domestic equity 6.30% Domestic equities 5.50% Global equity 6.90% International equity 6.85% Core fixed income 7.00% Global fixed income 1.30% Private equity 9.75% Limited duration fixed income -0.34% Global real assets 5.00% Domestic fixed income 1.25% Global equity 5.24% Cash equivalents 0.00% International fixed income 0.00% Diversified short- term fixed income -0.21% Global real assets 5.01% Short-term corporate fixed income -0.89% Cash equivalents 0.00% US high yield 3.11% Emerging market debt 5.26% DISCOUNT RATE For PERS, GASB Statement No. 67 includes a specific requirement for the discount rate that is used for the purpose of the measurement of the Total Pension Liability. This rate considers the ability of the System to meet benefit obligations in the future. To make this determination, employer contribution s, employee contributions, benefit payments, expenses and 111STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA investment returns are projected into the future. The current employer and employee fixed rate contributions are assumed to be made in each future year. The Plan Net Position (assets) in future years can then be determined and compared to its obligation to make benefit payments in those years. In years where assets are not projected to be sufficient to meet benefit payments, the use of a municipal bond rate is required. The Single Discount Rate (SDR) is equivalent to applying these two rates to the benefits that are projected to be paid during the different time periods. The SDR reflects (1) the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (during the period in which the fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) a tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the contributions for use with the long-term expected rate of return are not met). For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of retu rn on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate is 2.45%; and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 4.64%. For HPRS, the expected rate of return on pension plan investm ents is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate is 2.45%; and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 4.09%. For JSND, the discount rate was 4.25% as of June 30, 2020. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member and employer contributions will be made at rates equal to those based on the July 1, 2020 Actuarial Valuation Reports. For this purpose, only employer contributions that are intended to fund benefits of current plan members and their beneficiaries are included. Projected employer contributions that are intended to fund the service costs of future plan members and their beneficiaries, as well as projected contributions from future plan members, are not included. Based on those assumptions (for JSND it is assumed no future contribution will be made), the pension plans' fiduciary net position were projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments for current plan members as of June 30, 2020. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability as of June 30, 2020. For TFFR, the discount rate was 7.25% as of June 30, 2020. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member and employer contributions will be made at rates equal to those based on the July 1, 2020 Actuarial Valuation Reports. For this purpose, only employer contributions that are intended to fund benefits of current plan members and their beneficiaries are included. Projected employer contributions that are intended to fund the service costs of future plan members and their beneficiaries, as well as projected contributions from future plan members, are not included. Based on those assumptions TFFR's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments for current plan members as of July 1, 2020. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability as of June 30, 2020.

Net OPEB Liability of the Plan The components of the net OPEB liability of the plan at June 30, 2020 is as follows (expressed in thousands): RHIC Total OPEB liability $ 229,741 Plan fiduciary net position (145,621) Net OPEB liability (asset) $ 84,120 RHIC fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total OPEB liability 63.38% Actuarial Assumptions Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method: Plan Fiduciary Net Position (Market value of assets, no asset smoothing) RHIC Inflation: 2.25% Salary Increase: Not applicable Investment Rate of Return: 6.50%, net of investments expense, including inflation. Mortality Rates: Pub-2010 Health Retiree Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 103% for males and 101% for females. Pub-2010 Disabled Retiree Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 117% for males and 112% for females. Pub-2010 Employee Mortality table (for General Employees), sex-distinct, with rates multiplied by 92% for both m ales and females. Mortality rates are projected from 2010 using the MP-2019 scale. 120STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Other Notes: RHIC is for the most part a closed plan. There were no benefit changes during the year. The employer rate to the System is the statutory contribution rate of 1.14% of payroll. Investment Rate of Return The long-term expected investment rate of return assumption for the RHIC fund was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimates ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of RHIC investment expenses and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real ra tes of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Estimates of arithmetic real rates of return, for each major asset class included in the RHIC's target asset allocation as of July 1, 2020 is summarized in the following table: Asset Class Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return Large Cap Domestic Equities 6.10% Small Cap Domestic Equities 7.00% International equities 6.45% Core-Plus Fixed Income 1.15% Discount Rate The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 6. 5%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed plan member and statutory/Board approved employer contributions will be made at rates equal to those based on the July 1, 2020 PERS ac tuarial valuation reports. For this purpos e, only employer contributions that are intended to fund benefits of current RHIC members and their beneficiaries are included. Projected employer contributions that are intended to fund the service costs of future plan members and their beneficiaries are not included. Based on those assumptions, the RHIC fiduciary net position was projected to be sufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long term expected rate of return on RHIC investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability. Sensitivity of Net OPEB Liability The following presents the net OPEB liability of the Plan as of June 30, 2020, calculated using the single discount rate of 6.50%, as well as what the RHIC net OPEB liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage- point lower or 1-percentage-point higher than the current rate: Net OPEB Liability (Asset) As of June 30, 2020 1% Decrease (5.50%)Current Discount Rate (6.50%)1% Increase (7.50%) RHIC $ 110,324,972 $ 84,119,757 $ 61,959,773 The benefit provided by the North Dakota Retiree Health Insurance Credit Fund is a fixed dollar subsidy and is not affected by healthcare cost trend. Therefore, a healthcare trend rate was not performed. B.

The plan allows employees of the State of North Dakota or any of its political subdivisions, institutions, departments, or agencies to participate, providing that the employee has signed a participation agreement, which permits them to defer a portion of their current salary until future years. Each participant may defer the lessor of $19,500 or 100% of gross annual compensation for calendar year 2020. Participation in the plan is optional. The deferred compensation is not available to the employees until termination, retirement, death or unforeseeable emergency. All compensation deferred under the plans, all property and rights purchased with those amounts, and all income attributable to those amounts, property or rights, are held in trust for the exclusive use of the employee or their beneficiary . The minimum monthly member contribution to the deferred compensation plan is $25 and the maximum vesting in the employer contributions ranges from 1% to 4% of the monthly salary, or $25, depending the employees months of service.

DICKINSON STATE UNIVERSITY AND DICKINSON STATE UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION Arbitration - The Dickinson State University Foundation (DSUF) has ownership interest and/or management responsibilities in various real estate projects by way of its membership in Dickinson Investments, LLC (Dickinson Investments) and other entities. DSUF is involved in a disp ute with another member of Dickinson Investments, Granville Brinkman and other Brinkman entities (Respondent). An arbitration claim was filed on December 26, 2013. On September 30, 2014, the arbitrator awarded the Respondent a buy-out of their equity interest in the amount of $1.260 million. The Respondent was also awarded repayment of a note, prejudgm ent interest and attorneys' fees and costs. DSUF and Dickinson Investments are jointly and severally liable for the buyout amount. On October 28, 2014, the arbitrator issued a final arbitration award and ordered: a) prejudgment interest at 6% would commence December 26, 2013, b) the amount of attorney fees and costs to be repaid was $233,420, c) the note prepayment amount was $133,600 d) the parties shared responsibility for arbitration fees and expenses totaling $67,620. The final award exceeds $1.7 million. Although DSUF has an equity interest of about 6 percent in Dickinson Investments, the arbitrator has ruled that it is jointly and severally liable for the entire award, except the $133,600 loan for which Dicki nson Investments is responsible. Receivership - At the request of the NDUS Chancellor, on November 21, 2014, the North Dakota Attorney General petitioned the state district court for the appointment of a rec eiver. On December 3, 2014, the court appointed a receiver for DSUF. The court order included the following directives: 127STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA xThe receiver shall take immediate possession, custody, and control of all assets owned or held by DSUF; xThe DSUF board of directors shall be temporarily suspen ded and have no authority to act on behalf of DSUF; xThe receiver shall gather, protect and oversee DSUF's corporate and charitable assets; xThe receiver shall report to the court; and xThe receiver shall have all the authority necessary to continue the day-to-day activities of the DSUF. The receiver filed interim reports on a regular basis through September 2016. In the seventh interim report, dated August 31, 2015, the receiver recommended that DSUF be dissolved. This recommendation was based on an inability to negotiate a mutually acceptable settlement of the outstanding Brinkman judgment against DSUF. The report indicates that dissolution should foremost prioritize DSUF obligations to honor restrictions placed on DSUF assets by donors, then address claims made by creditors, employees, and other interested parties. However, DSUF accounting reports indicated that the foundation had total net restricted assets in an amount less t han total permanently and temporarily restricted donations. The Office of Attorney General requested the commencement of dissolution for DSUF. On August 30, 2017, Stark County District Court Judge William Herauf issued an Order that, in part, approved a settlement reached between the Attorney General and the DSUF's major creditors. The Order also reso lved all claims against the DSUF, allowing for the distribution of assets and final closure of the issues surrounding the DSUF. On June 20, 2017, a settlement agreement was signed by the SBHE, DSU and five financial institutions whereby an amount of $3.1 million will be paid to the financial institutions to repay the outstanding debt related to the Biesiot Activities Cent er. The 2017 North Dakota Legislative Assembly provided an appropriation to Dickinson State University for the settlement amount. The settlement was paid in July 2017 consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. DSUF's Restated Articles of Incorporation state that upon dissolution, remaining assets shall be distributed to the SBHE for the exclusive use and benefit of the Dickinson State University or its direct successors in interest. The receiver recommended that all remaining net assets of DSUF be directed to be turned over to a new 501(c)(3) tax-exempt Foundation in keeping with DSUF's Re stated Articles of Incorporation. There is a cash reserve account remaining in excess of $300,000 pending the outcomes of resolving claims from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service relating to Charitable Remainder Trusts. All tax returns have been filed by the court appointed Receiver. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has approved one of the returns and the remainder of the returns are pending review. Once all returns are approved, any remaining cash will be distributed to the DSU Heritage Foundation and a final Receiver's report will be filed to obtain Court approval of the final distribution and closing the receivership dissolution act ion. The receivership was closed effective August 6, 2020 through the Court's approval of the Final Receiver's report. The final tax returns have been filed and final fees were paid. The final check was issued to the Dickinson State University Heritage Foundation on August 7, 2020 in the amount of $337,402. The Receiver has been discharged and the case was closed by the Stark County District Court. Financial Audit In fiscal year 2013, The DSUF's independent auditors issued a qualified opinion on the DSUF financial statements because they were unable to form an opinion regarding the proper amount and classification of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets. In fiscal year 2014, the DSUF's independent auditors were unable to issue an audit opinion on the DSUF financial statements as a result of the aforementioned arbitration and the overall condition of the DSUF financial records. An audit has not performed since fiscal year 2014. Additionally, it has been reported that DSUF may have used endowment funds as collateral to obtain financing and to meet monthly operating expenses of the foundation and one of its real estate projects. NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY AND NDSU RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY PARK, INC. On December 30, 1999, North Dakota State University (NDSU), through the State of North Dakota and North Dakota State Board of Higher Education, entered into a ground lease, whereby the NDSU Research and Technology Park (RTP), Inc. (component unit) leases 40 acres of land for $1 per year for the next seventy-five years. On July 1, 2002, NDSU and the RTP entered into an agreement for cooperation and assistance between entities. The agreement is an annual agreement, which automatically extends for one-year periods unless cancelled by either party to the agreement. During fiscal year 2017, NDSU and the RTP entered into renewed agreements, whereby NDSU leases the Research Buildings #1 and #2 through June 30, 2032. During fiscal year 2020, total annual rent of $312,000 was paid by NDSU for 128STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA these two buildings, in addition to the $1.8 million of principal and interest paid by NDSU directly to the bond trustee.

The Foundation has leased the space in the Fargodome from the City of Fargo and subleased the space, furniture, fixtures and equipment to NDSU. Under the agreement, NDSU will pay rent to the NDSUFAA for use of the premises. The amount of the rent is tied to the $3.5 million debt service retirement plus the Fargodome annual space rent and all costs incurred by the Foundation incident to the lease, less any contributions received by the Foundation for the project. Under this agreement in fiscal year 2020, the Foundation paid the debt service and other fees on behalf of NDSU in the amount of $331,587. The facility is included in long-term investments and the debt is included in long-term liabilities on the financial reports of the Foundation. NDSU has also recorded a capital asset and a capital lease payable, reflected as \"Due to Component Units\" by NDSU, of $131,000 as of June 30, 2020. Since the foundation is a discretely presented component unit of the University System and the component unit and the University System are reporting the same assets and debt for the Fargodome improvements, a reclassification entry was made to ending balances in the component unit consolidating financial statements to show the appropriate due from primary institution. Renaissance Hall The former Northern School Supply building was donated to the Foundation by NDSU alum in December of 2001. During fiscal year 2003 and 2004, the Foundation renovated the building with the intent to lease the facility to NDSU beginning fall 2004. The Foundation transferred nearly the entire ownership of the building to 650 NP Avenue, LLC and Kilbourne Design Group, LLC, for a five-year period in order to achieve tax credits that would ultimately reduce the cost of the building to NDSU. During the five-year tax credit period, NDSU leased the building from the two LLCs, with the lease payments composed of interest and fees. With the five-year tax credit period ending December 31, 2010 (as extended), and the ownership was transferred back to the Foundation, permanent financing was put in place on December 17, 2010, with the issuance of $5.65 million of 20-year University Facilities Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2010 (Renaissance Hall Project). The financing structure involving the five-year temporary ownership transfer resulted in achieving tax credits of $4.9 million which directly lowered the leasing cost to NDSU. Under this refinanced debt issuance and lease agreement, as approved by the SBHE on December 16, 2010, the property is leased to NDSU for rent equal to the semi-annual principal and interest on the bonds, plus all costs incurred by the Foundation incident to ownership of the property. Ownership of the property will transfer to NDSU when the bonds are repaid in full. NDSU paid the Foundation $413,000 in fiscal year 2020 for debt service under this agreement. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding balance on the bonds, reflected as \"Due to Component Units\" by NDSU, is $3.6 million. Barry Hall Business Building and Klai Hall Architecture Building Effective November 28, 2007, NDSU and the Foundation entered into lease agreements for two buildings in downtown Fargo, formerly known as the \"Pioneer Mutual Building\" and \"Lincoln Mutual building\". The Foundation financed the construction of the Barry Hall business building and Klai Hall architecture building projects through the sale of $18.52 million of 20-year University Facilities Revenue Bonds issue by the City of Fargo, North Dakota. The City has loaned the bond proceeds to the Foundation for payments equal to the sum of the semi-annual interest payments and installments of varying principal amounts on the variable rate bonds and the semi-annual principal and interest payments on the fixed-rate bonds. The principal payments on the variable rate bonds will be funded from payments on donor pledges restricted for the project. Under the terms of the loan, the Foundation is responsible for the real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other costs incident to ownership of the property. The property is included with property in the financial statements and the bonds have been recorded as a direct obligation of the Foundation. Ownership of the property will transfer to NDSU when the bonds are repaid in full. The bonds are guaranteed by the Foundation. This property is leased to NDSU for rental equal to the sum of the semi-annual interest only payments on the variable term bonds plus the semi- annual principal and interest payments on the fixed-rate bonds fo r the term of the bonds, plus all the costs incurred by the Foundation incident to ownership of the property. 129STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA In May 2012, the Foundation refinanced the original bonds issued in November 2007. As a result, new leases were executed. Under the terms of the new leases, NDSU pays and recognizes a liability for entire amount of the previously issued bonds. During fiscal year 2020, NDSU paid $158,000 to the bond trustee on-behalf of the Foundation under the new leases for debt service on Barry Hall & Klai Hall. NDSU has an option to acquire the property upon full payment of the bonds. As of June 30, 2020, the outstanding balance on the bonds, reflected as \"Due to Component Units\" by NDSU, is $8.15 million. Other Transactions The Foundation provides meeting space rental and database support service to NDSU for an annually negotiated fee. NDSU paid the foundation $384,000 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. In addition to the debt service payments on the Fargodom e, Renaissance, Barry and Klai Halls, NDSU reimburses the Foundation for other operating expenses related to those buildings, such as property insurance, flood insurance, boiler inspection fees, real estate taxes and bond administrative fees. Those costs totaled $158,432 during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

In June 2008, the $3.7 million remaining balance of the 2003 bonds were financed with Lease Revenue Refunding Bonds, series 2008. In April 2018, the $2.2 million remaining balance of the 2008 bonds was refinanced with Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2018. The interest rate is fixed at 3.5% until 2028. Payments of $133,333 are required semi-annually through 2028. The bonds are secured by a lease with UND. Annual principal and semiannual interest payments as of June 30, 2020 was $266,669. 131STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTE 12 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA The State, through the Bank of North Dakota, is a party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, financial standby letters of credit and guarantees relate d to loan programs. Those instruments involve varying degrees of credit, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of net position. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the State has in particular classes of off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The State's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and financial standby letters of cr edit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The State uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Contract Amount (in thousands) Commitments to extend credit $ 911,809 Financial standby letters of credit 415,755 Guarantees provided 7,889 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained by the State upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank has segmented this category into three components: (1) letters of credit, (2) confirming letters of credit, and (3) letters of credit pledged for public deposits to North Dakota financial institutions. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the B ank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party which require this type of facility. The maturities for these letters range from three months to ten years, and the likelihood of funding any of these letters of credit is considered to be remote. The Bank holds collateral supporting those commitments. The Bank also has letters of credit with the North Dakota Public Finance Authority with maturities ranging from seventeen months to twenty nine years. If the letters issued to Public Finance Authority were ever drawn upon, Public Finance Authority is legally obligated to reimburse the Bank from funds legally available, or from any appropriation made available to the Legislative Assembly after certification by the Industrial Commission. The likelihood of funding any of these letters of credit is also considered to be remote. Outstanding issued letters of credit as of December 31, 2019 were $108,645,000. Confirming letters of credit are issued to North Dakota financial institutions to support letters of credit they have issued bu t are still in need of backing from an institution with a long-term, high quality bond rating. In the event these letters were to be drawn upon, based on the terms of the agreement, the Bank would immediately withdraw funds from the institution's correspondent bank account held at the Bank to cover the amount drawn. These agreements generally have terms of 12 months or less. The likelihood of funding any of these confirming letters of credit is also considered to be remote. Outstanding issued confirming letters of credit as of December 31, 2019 were $3,950,000. Letters of credit pledged for public deposit to North Dakota financial institutions are issued to support public borrowing arrangements. These letters are fully collateralized by a pool of loans pledged to the Bank. These agreement generally have terms of 12 months or less. Financial standby letters for pu blic deposits by North Dakota banks totaled $303,160,000 at December 31, 2019. The likelihood of funding any of these letters of credit is also considered to be remote. These letters of credit are authorized form of collateral for public deposits per North Dakota Century Code 21-04-09. The Bank has not recorded a contingent liability related to off-balance sheet activity as of December 31, 2019. 132STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA INFRASTRUCTURE REVOLVING LOAN PROGRAM In the normal course of business, the Loan Fund makes various commitments that are not reflected in the financial statements. These commitments include commitments to extend credit of $44,929,000 at June 30, 2020. MEDICAL FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE LOAN FUND The Fund's exposure to loan loss is represented by the cont ractual amount of these commitments. There were two pending loan commitments totaling $4,300,000 as of June 30, 2020. NORTH DAKOTA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY In the normal course of business, the Agency makes various commitments that are not reflected in the financial statements. These include commitments to extend credit and the debt reduction required when related loan acquisition funds are not drawn down within prescribed time frames set by the specific bond resolution. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to fund loans as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. Commitments require the payment of a reservation fee and generally have a fixed expiration date. Commitments to extend credit total $73,784,000 at June 30, 2020. The bond resolutions require that the funds in the loan acquisition accounts be expended within 42 months of the related bond delivery date. Any remaining funds must be used for debt reduction. The loan acquisition funds totaled $57,420,000 at June 30, 2020. PUBLIC FINANCE AUTHORITY In the normal course of business, the Finance Authority (a component unit) makes various commitments that are not reflected in the financial statements. These commitments include commitments to extend credit of $221,875,000 at December 31, 2019. NOTE 13 - INTEREST RATE SWAP BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA The Bank has outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount $545,000,000 to convert variable rate federal funds and variable LIBOR-indexed deposits into fixed-rate instruments over the term of the contract. The following table summarizes the terms of the interest rate swap contracts: Trade Date Maturity Date Notional Amount Pay Fixed Receive Variable June 5, 2014 June 1, 2029 $50,000,000 2.86% Fed Funds April 14, 2015 May 1, 2030 $50,000,000 1.92% Fed Funds August 11, 2016 September 1, 2031 $50,000,000 1.48% 1 Month LIBOR April 5, 2017 May 1, 2032 $50,000,000 2.39% 1 Month LIBOR June 15, 2017 July 1, 2032 $50,000,000 1.99% Fed Funds March 27, 2018 April 1, 2033 $50,000,000 2.47% Fed Funds June 28, 2018 July 1, 2033 $50,000,000 2.52% Fed Funds April 25, 2019 May 1, 2034 $50,000,000 2.36% Fed Funds September 3, 2019 October 1, 2034 $50,000,000 1.15% Fed Funds October 3, 2019 November 1, 2034 $50,000,000 1.38% Fed Funds December 5, 2019 October 1, 2023 $45,000,000 1.33% Fed Funds Either the Bank or its counterparties may terminate the interest rate swap if the other party fails to perform under the terms of the contract. Termination could result in the Bank being requ ired to make a payment of the fair value of the swap to counterparty. 133STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The following table summarizes the derivative financial instrument utilized at December 31, 2019: Fair Value Changes in Fair Value SwapNotional Amount Classification Amount Classification Amount June 2014 $ 50,000,000 Other liabilities $ (5,468,000) Deferred outflow $ (3,288,000) April 2015 50,000,000 Other liabilities (1,278,000) Deferred outflow (3,770,000) Aug 2016 50,000,000 Other assets 1,722,000 Deferred inflow (4,518,000) April 2017 liabilities outflow 2017 Other liabilities (1,600,000) Deferred outflow (4,310,000) March 2018 50,000,000 Other liabilities (4,493,000) Deferred outflow (4,448,000) June 2018 50,000,000 Other liabilities (4,826,000) Deferred outflow (4,506,000) April 2019 50,000,000 Other liabilities (4,001,000) Deferred outflow (4,001,000) Sept 2019 50,000,000 Other assets 4,003,000 Deferred inflow 4,003,000 Oct 2019 50,000,000 Other assets 2,462,000 Deferred inflow 2,462,000 Dec 2019 45,000,000 Other assets 194,000 Deferred inflow 194,000 At December 31, 2019, the Bank was not exposed to material credit risk because each counterparty is required to fully collateralize the fair value of the swaps within $250 of da ily mark-to-market valuations by depositing funds with the other counterparty. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk on its swap agreements. On its pay-fixed, receive variable interest rate swaps, the Bank's net payment increases as the USD-FEDERAL FUNDS-H.15 and USD-1 MONTH LIBOR-BBA interest rates decrease. Using rates as of December 31, 2019, the interest expense of the variable rate federal funds, variable rate 1 month LIBOR and the net swap payments are as follows. As rates vary, the federal fund and 1 month LIBOR interest expense and the net swap payments will vary. Pay Fixed Receive Variable Year Ended December 31: Contract InterestFederal Fund Interest 1-Month LIBOR Interest Interest Rate Swap, net 2020 $ 10,856,000 $ 6,898,000 $ 27,103,000 134STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NORTH DAKOTA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY As a means to lower its borrowing costs, when compared against fixed-rate bonds at the time of issuance, the Agency entered into several cash flow hedges or swaps in connection with various variable-rate housing bond series. The Agency cash flow hedges are pay-fixed. All Agency cash flow hedges are pay-fixed. The intention of these swaps was to effectively change the Agency's interest rate on the bonds to a fixed rate. The Agency also has cash flow hedges that were entered into in connection with variable-rate housing bond series that no longer have bonds outstanding as those bonds have been called. The cash flow hedges that are not connected to a specific bond series hedge the risk related to the Agency's other variable-rate housing bonds that are unhedged. The bonds and the related swap agreements have a stated issuance and maturity date. Some of the swaps have optional termination dates. Under the swaps, the Agency pays the counterparty a fixed payment and receives a variable payment computed as a percent of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed percentage on the swap notional amount. On the other hand, the bond's variable-rate coupons are determined by the remarketing agent. If for any reason the remarketing agent fails to act, the rate shall be the lesser of (i) the TBMA Index plus 0.25% or (ii) the Maximum Rate as defined within the applicable series resolution. As of June 30, 2020, the Agency no swaps with a positive fair value. Of the swaps with negative fair value, the Agency is not exposed to credit risk. However, the swap exposes the Agency to basis risk should the relationship between LIBOR and TBMA converge, changing the synthetic rate on bonds. The swap counterparty has guaranteed all payments and is rated AAa/AA+/AAA by Moody's Investor Services, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, respectively. To mitigate potential credit risk, the counterparty has entered into Credit Support Agreements with Bank of New York Mellon, the Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo as a credit enhancement. The Agency has entered into netting arrangements whenever it has entered into more than one derivative instrument transaction with a counterparty. Under the terms of these arrangements netting provisions permit each party to net the transactions' fair values so that a single sum will be owed by, or owed to, the other party. At June 30, 2020, the Agency owed the swap providers a fixed rate on the notional amount of the swaps of $2,418,000 and the swap providers owed the Agency a variable rate on the notional amounts of $148,000 making the net payment that the Agency owed the swap providers $2,270,000. Due to the difference in the variable rate indices, the swaps had a net negative fair value of $16,132,000 as of June 30, 2020. Accordingly, the financial derivative instrument is reported as a liability and the accumulated changes in fair value of the swaps are reported as a deferred outflow at June 30, 2020. The coupon on the government's variable-rate bonds adjust to changing interest rates, the bonds do not have a corresponding fair value increase. All valuations are as of the valuation date indicated. Mid-Market or indicative unwind valuations may be derived from broker quotations or from proprietary models that take into consideration estimates about relevant pres ent and future market conditions as well as the size and liquidity of the position and any related actual or potential hedging transactions. Valuations based on other models or different assumptions may yield different results. The swap exposes the Agency to basis risk should the relationship between LIBOR and the actual variable rates converge, changing the synthetic rate on the bonds. The effect of this difference in basis is indicated by the difference between the intended synthetic rate and the synthetic rate as of June 30, 2020. If a change occurs that results in the rates' moving to convergence, the expected cost savings may not be realized. The derivative contract uses the International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement, which includes standard termination events, such as failure to pay and bankruptcy. The Schedule to the Master Agreement includes an \"additional termination event.\" That is, the swap may be terminated if count erparty's credit quality rating falls below \"A3\" as issued by Moody's Investors Service or \"A-\" as issued by Fitch Ratings or Standard & Poor's. The swap may be terminated at any time by the Agency or the counterparty with 30 days written notice up to limits specified in the swap agreement. If the swap or swaps were terminated, the variable-rate bonds would no longer carry a synthetic interest rate. Also, if at the time of terminations the swap has a negative fair value, the Agency would be liable to the counterparty for payment equal to the swap's fair value, but in the event the fair value is positive, the counterparty would be liable to the Agency. The Agency is exposed to rollover risk on hedging derivative in struments that are hedges of debt that mature or may be terminated prior to maturity of the hedged debt. When these hedging derivative instruments terminate, or in the case of a termination option, if the counterparty exercises its option, the Agency will be re-exposed to the risks being hedged by the hedging derivative instrument. The Agency also is exposed to rollover risk on the swaps that mature and the Agency does not call the related variable rate debt. 135STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The terms of the interest rate swaps at June 30, 2020 are as follows: 1.

Concentrations of credit are present in the construction and operation of community water facilities, loans to medical facilities for health care construction, loans to students for post- secondary education, loans to owners of homes damaged in the 2011 floods in Barnes, Benson, Burleigh, McHenry, Morton, Ramsey, Renville, Richland and Ward counties, loans to political subdivisions in the state for infrastructure, single- family and multifamily mortgage loans, loans to assist local financial institutions in providing loans to assist very small businesses in their recovery from the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, loans to provide financing for commercialization of intellectual technology within the State and the agricultural industry. Due to the pervasive nature of agriculture in the economy of the state, all loans, regardless of type, are impacted by agriculture. NOTE 15 - RISK MANAGEMENT Several funds accumulate assets to cover risks that the State may incur. Specifically, the State assumes a portion or substantially all risks associated with the following: THE STATE FIRE AND TORNADO FUND The State Fire and Tornado Fund, an Enterprise Fund, is financed by premiums charged to the participating funds of the State. All monies collected must be paid into the fund for use only for the purpose outlined in NDCC 26.1-22.02. All losses occasioned by the hazards provided for in the North Dakota Century Code must be paid out of the fund, with the fund being reimbursed by a third-party insurance carrier for all losses in excess of $1,000,000 per occurrence. The limit of liability of such reinsurance contract is no less than $1,000,000 during each twelve month period. STATE BONDING FUND The State Bonding Fund, an Enterprise Fund, is financed by premiums charged to each State agency for the bonding of public employees and public officials. FLEET SERVICES Fleet Services, an Internal Service Fund, represents the State's fleet of automobiles and is administered by the Department of Transportation. The State is self-insured for substantially all automobile insurance (e.g., comprehensive, collision), with the exception of liability, which is provided by the State's Risk Management Fund (RMF). State agencies are charged premiums to cover Fleet Service's RMF assessment and to pay for those losses that are not covered by RMF. These premium charges are factored into the fees agencies are charged when renting the cars. 137STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA WORKFORCE SAFETY & INSURANCE Workforce Safety & Insurance (WSI), an Enterprise Fund, is a State insurance fund and a \"no fault\" insurance system, covering the State's employers and employees. WSI is financed by premiums assessed to employers. The rate of such premiums is periodically adjusted to assure the solvency of WSI. The premiums are available primarily for the payment of claims to employees injured in the course of employment. During fiscal year 2020, a total of $88,374,676 in claims was recognized. The liability of $1,029,792,000 is the present value of the unpaid claim liability discounted at 4.5% as determined by the actuarial. RISK MANAGEMENT FUND Due to the loss of sovereign immunity, the 1995 Legislature established the Risk Management Fund (RMF) to pay money damages for tort claims for which the State is liable. The statutory liability of the State is limited to a total of $250,000 p er person and $1,000,000 per occurrence. The State purchases commercial insurance for claims in excess of coverage provided by the Fund and continues to transfer liabilities for medical malpractice and aviation to private insurance carriers. Settlements have not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. Revenues to the RMF are generated from contributions required from state agencies, boards and commissions, and the University System. The need for and amount of funding is determined using a projected cost allocation approach. The premise of this plan is that the agencies with greater expected loss costs should contribute more to the funding of the RMF than those agencies with lessor costs. The underlying logic is that contributions should roughly equal loss costs plus the expenses of administering the program over the long term. The RMF liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Unpaid claim liabilities are based on an actuarial study of the outstanding loss reserve need for the fund and a forecast of ultimate loss and loss expense. These liabilities were determined on an undiscounted expected level of ultimate loss. Because actual claims liabilities are affected by complex factors including inflation, changes in legal doctrines, and unanticipated damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in exact amounts. Claims liabilities will be re- evaluated periodically to take in consideration settled claims, the frequency of claims, and other economic and social factors. The following table presents the changes in claims liabilities balance for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019 and 2020: Fiscal YearBeginning BalanceCurrent Year Claims and Changes In Estimates Claims Payments Ending Balance 2019 $ 4,256,394 $ (175,718) $ (313,674) $ 3,767,002 2020 3,767,002 3,746,363 The Risk Management Workers Compensation Program (WCP) was established to consolidate all state entities under one workers compensation account, allowing for transitional duty between entities. The statutory liability of the fund is limited to $100,000 per claim with Workforce Safety & Insurance, providing excess insurance for claims that exceed the $100,000 cap. WCP pays separately for this coverage. Since the incept ion of WCP on July 1, 2001, forty-four claims exceeded coverage by $13,414,266. Revenues to WCP are generated from contributions required from state agencies, boards, commissions, and the University System. The amount contributed from each agency is actuarially determined by Workforce Safety & Insurance and based upon the number of employees, the type of work done, and claims history of each entity. Each entity also pays a deductible of $250 per claim. The WCP liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Because actual claims liabilities are affected by complex factors including inflation, changes in legal doctrine, and unanticipated damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in exact amounts. Claims liabilities will be re- evaluated periodically to take into consideration settled claims, the frequency of claims, and other economic and social factors. An actual study was performed for Workforce Safety & Insurance. The liability estimates are based on that study. 138STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The following table presents the changes in claims liabilities balance for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019 and 2020: Fiscal Year Beginning BalanceCurrent Year Claims and Changes in Estimates Claims Payments Ending Balance 2019 $ 4,861,686 $ 2,639,167 $ (3,142,217) $ 4,358,636 2020 4,358,636 3,669,716 (3,089,624) 4,938,728 NOTE 16 - PUBLIC ENTITY RISK POOLS A. GENERAL FIRE AND TORNADO AND BONDING FUND The Fire and Tornado Fund provides property insurance to state agencies, political subdivisions, the International Peace Garden and the Winter Show. The Fire and Tornado Fund has issued 1,175 policies to participating entities for a total building and content coverage of $16.5 billion. The Bonding Fund is used to provide fidelity bonding of public employees and officials. The Fund has issued 1,890 policies to participating entities. The total coverage for the Bonding Fund is $728.7 million. If the assets of these funds were exhausted, fund participants would not be responsible for the funds' liabilities. The Fire and Tornado and Bonding Fund are accounted for on the accrual basis. The Fire and Tornado Fund establishes claim liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been reported but not settled, and of claims incurred but not reported. The Bonding Fund establishes claim liabilities based on actual judgments obtained against the fund but not paid prior to fiscal year end. Liabilities for incurred but not reported losses have not been established based on prior year activity. Neither fund incurred any acquisition costs, which should have been capitalized, nor were any liabilities recognized that were discounted. Investment income was not considered in determining the existence of premium deficiencies. The Fire and Tornado Fund uses reinsurance agreements to reduce its on covered losses in excess of $2.0 million. Reinsurance permits recovery of a portion of losses from reinsurers, although it does not discharge the primary liability of the Fund as direct insurer of the risks that are reinsured. The Fire and Tornado Fund does not report reinsured risks as liabilities unless it is probable that those risks will not be covered by reinsurers. There were no pending losses at June 30, 2020 that would reduce the fund's liability. WORKFORCE SAFETY & INSURANCE Workforce Safety & Insurance (WSI), an Enterprise Fund, is a state insurance fund and a \"no fault\" insurance system covering the State's employers and employees. At June 30, 2020, coverage extended to the following employers: Annual Premium $250 346 Total Employers 24,574 WSI is financed by premiums assessed to the employers doing business in North Dakota. The premiums are available primarily for the payment of claims to employees injured in the course of employment. The operations of WSI are accounted for on the accrual basis. Liability for incurred loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) is estimated by WSI's actuary. The estimate is developed by WSI's actuary, taking into consideration past experience of WSI in paying claims, and general conditions of the envi ronment in which WSI operates. The liability is based on the estimated ultimate costs to settle both reported and incurred but not report (IBNR) losses and LAE, and includes the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. The actuarial computations also include a 4.5% discount to report this liability at its present value. Management believes the estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expense is sufficient to cover the ultimate net cost of incurred losses, but such loss reserves are necessarily based on estimates and the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the amounts estimated. As adjustments to this estimated liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in current operations. 139STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA For the year ended June 30, 2020, the consulting actuaries presented an estimate in the form of a range to emphasize the uncertainty for a \"long-tailed\" liability insurer such as workers' compensation. These ranges are as follows (expressed in thousands): Low Central Value High Full value basis, undiscounted $ 1,511,964 $ 1,629,797 $ 1,708,841 at 4.5% 956,774 1,029,792 1,079,890 WSI has adjusted the estimated liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense to the actuary's 4.5 percent discounted expected value of $1,029,792,000 at June 30, 2020. While management has recorded amounts that fall within the ranges of estimated liabilities as computed under actuarial assumptions, the high level of uncertainty indicates that actual losses and expenses could be materially higher than the recorded estimated liability. WSI has entered into a contract with an intermediary for reinsura nce coverage for catastrophic coverage. Historically, WSI has had up to four coverage levels, with varying retention limits of $3 million, $5 million, $10 million and $20 million. Terms , limits and pricing are re-evaluated annually. WSI's current 2020 calendar year has two coverage levels, with retention limits of $10 million and $20 million. For the year ended June 30, 2020 WSI recorded ceded losses of $4,703,825 and ceded premiums of ($680,864). For accident years December 1, 1999 to December 1, 2002, Munich Re provided treaty excess of loss reinsurance to WSI. In fiscal year 2020, Munich Re and WSI agreed to commute the remaining liabilities under these treaties. As a result of this commutation, cash increased by $50.5 million and approximately $40 million of ceded liabilities were assumed by WSI. B.

The Bank of North Dakota is the only government-owned bank in the United States. Banks do not present a classified statement of net position because current assets are not matched with current liabilities. Presentation of a classified statement of net position would give the false impression that there is a liquidity problem at the bank. Presentation of a classified statement of net position for the Bank of North Dakota would be misleading to the extent that the financial statements may be materially misstated. Therefore, the statement of net position of the Bank of North Dakota presents assets and liabilities in or der of their relative liquidity, rather than in a classified format. 140STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA NOTE 18 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES A.

LITIGATION The estimated loss in all of the litigation against the State in which a loss to the State that is reasonably possible to resul t in an unfavorable outcome is estimated to be $500,000. 142STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA C. QUESTIONED COSTS The State receives federal financial assistance which is subject to review and audit by the Office of the State Auditor and the federal government. This assistance is generally conditioned upon compliance with certain laws and regulations. Disallowed and questioned costs relating to federal assistance could become a liability to the State. The State estimates that the ultimate disallowances pertaining to federal assistance, if any, will be immaterial to its overall financial condition . The single audit of the State of North Dakota for the two-year period ending June 30, 2018, was completed and issued in March of 2019. As a result of this audit, approximately $1.9 million of identifiable questioned costs were noted. Also, there were several findings which had potentially significant, unknown, questioned costs. The State is cooperating with the federal government to resolve the findings and is optimistic these findings will not have a material impact on the State. NOTE 19 - TOBACCO SETTLEMENT In November 1998, the North Dakota Attorney General joined forty-five other states and five territories in a settlement agreement against the nation's largest tobacco manufacturer. The settlement money is intended to compensate the State for costs it has incurred in providing health and other services to its citizens that were necessitated by the use of tobacco products. The Master Settlement Agreement includes base payment s to states totaling $220.6 billion for the next 25 years, and continues in perpetuity. The State has received total payments of $517.21 million as of June 30, 2020. The State recognized revenue of $21.16 million of tobacco settlement revenue during the year ended June 30, 2020. The amount of the annual payment is subject to a number of modifications, including adjustments for inflation and usage volumes. Some of the adjustments may result in increases in the payments (inflation, for example), or other adjustments will likely cause decreases in the payments (e.g., volume adjustments). The net e ffect of these adjustments on future payments is unclear. NOTE 20 - TERMINATION BENEFITS UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS Termination benefits are benefits provided to employees who ar e involuntarily or voluntarily terminated, as a result of budget reductions. Termination benefits agreements may include contract buyouts, retirement incentives, severance lump-sum payouts and continuing healthcare coverage for a designated period of time or a combination of these benefits. The agreement terms vary by institution. The outstanding liability is measured at the discounted present value and projected increases in health insurance rates. The University Systems entered into voluntary termination agreements with 79 employees for a cost of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2020. The terms for these agreements range from one month to eighteen months. The University Systems recorded a liability at June 30, 2020 of $2.3 million for future payments. During the same time-period, the University Systems entered into involuntary separation agreements with 28 employees for a cost of $559,000. The terms for these agreements range from one month to two months There is no future liability for these arrangements at June 30, 2020. In fiscal year 2020, the University System incurred $2.2 million in expenses related to voluntary termination agreements entered into in prior fiscal years for 64 employees. The terms for these agreements range from one month to thirty-eight months. At June 30, 2020, the liability for future payments was $214,000. NOTE 21 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS BUILDING AUTHORITY Subsequent to year end, the Authority issued $88.585 million of bonds payable. The bonds have an interest rate of 5.00% and mature between 2021 and 2040. BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA In March of 2020, the COVID pandemic began to spread throughout the world causing major disruptions to world travel and commerce. This pandemic greatly impacted North Dakota businesses, particularly restaurants, bars, hotels, and airlines. It also impacted the energy industry as oil and gas prices plummeted due to the reduction in travel. BND started 2020 with a monthly Provision for Credit Loss of $400,000. Once the pandemic hit, economic factors within the model changed and BND increased that expense to $1 million per month in March and then increased the provision again in July to $2 million per month. In total, BND anticipates adding $16.8 million to Allowance for Credit Loss in 2020, compared to our original estimate of $4.8 million. 143STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA The 2015 Legislature authorized a transfer of up to $100 million from BND to fund an Infrastructure Loan Fund for ND Cities and Counties. They also transferred an additional $50 million from the Strategic Investment and Improvement Fund to this same revolving loan fund. So far, BND has committed to $198 million of infrastructure loans. The legislation mandated that the money from the Strategic Investment and Improvement Fund be used to fund the initial $50 million of commitments and the drawdown of up to $100 million from BND to fund activity over the initial $50 million. As of October 31, 2020, BND has transferred $48 million of its capital to fund its portion of the Infrastructure Loan Fund. In the 2019 Legislature, legislation passed to add up to $40 million of additional contribution from the Strategic Investment and Improvement Fund should oil tax collections exceed $755 million. Oil tax collections exceeded $780 million, which resulted in an additional contribution of $25 million to the Infrastructure Loan Fund. That $25 million will be spent prior to drawing the remaining $52 million from BND's retained earnings. The 2019 Legislature allowed the Reinsurance Association to establish a credit line at the Bank in the amount of $25 million to provide reimbursements to member insurers. As of October 31, 2020, the Reinsurance Association has not applied for this line of credit. Fuel Production Guarantee Program - The 2019 legislature approved $50 million from the Strategic Investment and Improvement Fund to be used to guarantee loans made under this program. BND received loan applications from 3 borrowers totaling $29.8 million due to the impact the pandemic had on ethanol production facilities in ND SMALL EMPLOYER LOAN FUND Subsequent to year end, the fund received applications for loans under this fund of approximately $27.2 million. COVID-19 PACE RECOVERY PROGRAM As of November 30, 2020, the Bank of North Dakota has received 227 applications totaling $223.5 million with an interest rate buydown of $28.3 million for program I and 753 applications totaling $18.5 million in grants under program II. NORTH DAKOTA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY The Agency issued Series 2020B Housing Finance Program Bonds totaling $125 million. The bonds have an interest rate ranging from 0.20% to 2.05% and mature between 2021 and 2033. The Agency also issued Series 2015F Housing Finance Program Bonds totaling $25 million. The bonds have an inte rest rate of 2.32% and mature between 2021 and 2048. UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS On July 2, 2020, VCSU issued $3.2 million, Series 2020 Housing and Auxiliary Facilities Revenue Bonds. The bonds were issued in December 2019 and are included in these financial statements and note s. The proceeds are held in escrow and were used to refund the existing 2010 bonds on July 2, 2020. The bonds are collateralized by net housing and auxiliary facilities systems and mature in 2046. NOTE 22 - NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS The State implemented the following new pronouncement for fiscal year 2020: GASB 95, Postponement of the Effective Dates of Certain Authoritative Guidance , which provided temporary relief to governments in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to post pone the effective dates of certain pronouncements. The State will implement the following new pronouncements for fiscal years ending after 2020: GASB Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities , provides guidance regarding the identification of fiduciary activities for accounting and financial reporting purposes and how those activities should be reported. This Statement establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities of all state and local governments. The focus of the criteria generally is on (1) whether a government is controlling the assets of the fiduciary activity and (2) the beneficiaries with whom a fiduciary relationship exists. Separate criteria are included to identify fiduciary component units and postemployment benefit arrangements that are fiduciary activities. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 87, Leases , establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. This Statement requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that were previously classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources based on the payment provisions of th e contract. Under this Statement, a lessee is required to 144STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease receivabl e and a deferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and consistency of information about governments' leasing activities. This Statement is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2021. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Construction Period , establishes accounting requirements for interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period. This Statement requires that interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period be recognized as an expense in the period in which the cost is incurred for financial statements prepared using the economic resources measurement focus. As a result, interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period will not be included in the historical cost of a capital asset reported in a business-type activity or enterprise fund. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 90, Majority Equity Interests , establishes accounting requirements for interest cost incurred before the end of a construction period. This Statement provides guidance for reporting when a government has majority equity interest in legally separate organizations. An equity interest is explicit and measurable if the government has a present or future claim to the net resources of the entity and the method for measuring the government's share of the entity's net resources is determinable. If government's holding of that equity interest meets the definition of an investment, as defined by GASB No. 72, the equity interest should be reported as an investment and measured using the equity method and not as a component unit of the government. If a government's holding of a majority interest in a legally separate organization does not meet the definition of an investment, the holding of the majority equity interest results in the government being financially accountable for the organization and therefore, the government should report the legally separate organization as a component unit. This Statement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 91, Conduit Debt Obligations , provides a single method of reporting conduit debt obligations by issuers and eliminates diversity in practice associated with (1) commitments extended by issuers, (2) arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations, and (3) related note disclosures. This Statement clarifies the existing definition of a conduit debt obligation; establishes that a conduit debt obligation is not a liability of the issuer; establishes standards f or accounting and financial reporting of additional commitments and voluntary commitments extended by issuers and arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations; and improves required note disclosures. This Statement also addresses arrangements\u2014often characterized as leases\u2014that are associated with conduit debt obligations. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 92, Omnibus 2020 , provides additional guidance to improve consistency of authoritative literature by addressing practice issues identified during the application of certain GASB statements. This statement provides accounting and financial reporting requirements for specific issues related to leases, intra-entity transfers of assets, postemployment benefits, government acquisitions, risk financing and insurance-related activity of public entity risk pools, fair value measurements and derivative instruments. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2021. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 93, Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates , provides guidance to address accounting and financial reporting implications that result from the replacement of an interbank offered rate (IBOR), most notable, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As a result of global reference rate reform, LIBOR is expected to cease to exist in its current form at the end of 2021, prompting governments to amend or replace financial instruments for the purpose of replacing LIBOR with other reference rates, by either changing the reference rate or adding or changing fallback provisions related to the reference rate. This statement provides e xceptions and clarifications regarding hedging derivative instruments for such transactions that result from the replacement of IBOR. The requirements of this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2021. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements , improves financial reporting by addressing issues related to public-private and public-public partnership arrangements (PPPs) and also provides guidance for accounting and financial reporting for availability payment arrangements (APAs). The statement provides definitions of PPPs and APAs and provides uniform guidance on accounting and financial reporting for transactions that meet those definitions. A PPP is an arrangement in which a government (the transferor) contracts with an operator (a governmental or nongovernmental entity) to provide public services by conveying control of the right to operate or use a nonfinancial asset, such as infrastructure or other capital asset (the underlying PPP asset), for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. An APA is an arrangement in which a government compensates an operator for services that may include designing, constructing, financing, maintaining, or operating an underlying nonfinancial asset for a period of time in an exchange or e xchange-like transaction. The requirements of this Statement 145STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2022, and all reporting periods thereafter. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 96, Subscription-Based Information Arrangements provides guidance on the accounting and financial reporting for subscription-based information technology arrangem ents (SBITAs). A SBITA is defined as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another party's (a SBITA vendor's) information technology (IT) software, alone or in combination with tangible capital assets (the underlying IT assets), as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. Under this Statement, a government generally should recognize a right-to use subscription asset\u2014an intangible asset\u2014and a corresponding sub scription liability. The requirements of this Statement will improve financial reporting by establishing a definition for SBITAs and providing uniform guidance for accounting and financial reporting for transactions that meet that definition. The requirements of this Statement are effective for fiscal yea rs beginning after June 15, 2022, and all reporting periods thereafter. Earlier application is encouraged. GASB Statement No. 97, Certain Component Unit Criteria, and Accounting and Financial Reporting for Internal Revenue Code Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plans\u2014an amendmen t of GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 84, and a supersession of GASB Statement No. 32 provides additional guidance for determining whether a primary government is financially accountable for a potential component unit. This Statement requires that the financial burden criterion in paragraph 7 of Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities, be applicable to only defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit OPEB plans that are administered through trusts that meet the criteria in paragraph 3 of Statement No. 67, Financial Reporting for Pension Plans, or paragraph 3 of Statement No. 74, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans, respectively. This Statement (1) requires that a Section 457 plan be classified as either a pension plan or an other employee benefit plan depending on whether the plan meets the definition of a pension plan and (2) clarifies that Statement 84, as amended, should be applied to all arrangements organized under IRC Section 457 to determine whether those arrangements should be reported as fiduciary activities. The requirements of this Statement that (1) exempt primary governments that perform the duties that a governing board typically performs from treating the absence of a governing board the same as the appointment of a voting majority of a governing board in determining whether they are financially accountable for define d contribution pension plans, defined contribution OPEB plans, or other employee benefit plans and (2) limit the applicability of the financial burden criterion in paragraph 7 of Statement 84 to defined benef it pension plans and defined benefit OPEB plans that are administered through trusts that meet the criteria in paragraph 3 of Statement 67 or paragraph 3 of Statement 74, respectively, are effective immediately. The requirements of this Statementthat are related to the accounting and financial reporting for Section 457 plans are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2021. Management has not yet determined the effect these Statements will have on the State's financial statements. 146State of North Dakota Required Supplementary Information 147Required Supplemental Information Approved Appropriation Adjusted Actual Difference Budget Adjustments Budget Biennium Uncollected/ 2019-2021 Thru 6-30-20 Budgetary Fund Balance, July 1 65,000,000 $ - $ 65,000,000 $ 801,236,291 $ 736,236,291 $ Resources (Inflows): Sales and Tax Tax 935,573,000 - 935,573,000 443,660,636 (491,912,364) Financial Institutions Tax - - - - - Oil And Gas Production Tax 198,930,000 - 198,930,000 209,211,929 10,281,929 Oil Extraction Tax 72,944,050 and Tobacco Wholesale Liquor Leasing Fees Excise Tax 249,951,800 - 249,951,800 119,506,814 (130,444,986) Interest on Public Funds 10,000,000 - 10,000,000 1,272,315 Gas Tax Administration 1,991,024 4,822,959,640 Available for Dept. of Human Services-County Social Service - 1,000 1,000 76 924 Protection and Advocacy 3,312,565 - $ (84,245,469) $ 1,003,987,541 $ 1,088,233,010 $ STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA General Fund For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020Budgetary Comparison Schedule 148Required Supplemental Information General Fund Explanation of Differences between Budgetary Inflows and Outflows and GAAP Revenues and for the General Fund Expenditures Sources/Inflows of resources Actual Amounts (budgetary basis) \"total revenue inflows\" 2,549,891,716 from the budgetary comparison schedule Differences-Budget to GAAP:The period of availability for revenue recognition for budget purposes differs from (41,428,409) the GAAP basis.

The rows of the tables are defined as follows: (1) This line shows the total of each fiscal year's earned contribution revenues and investment revenues. (2) This line shows each fiscal year's other operation costs of the fund including overhead and claims expense not allocable to individual claims. (3) This line shows the funds' incurred claims and allocated claim adjustment expense (both paid and accrued) as originally reported at the end of the first year in which the event that triggered coverage unde r the contract occurred (call ed policy year). (4) This section of 10 columns shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years for each policy year. (5) This section of 10 columns shows how each policy year's incurred claims increased or decreased as of the end of successive years. This annual re-estimation results from new information received regarding unknown claims, reevaluation of existing information on known claims, as well as emergence of new claims not previously known. (6) This line compares the latest re-estimated incurred claims amount to the amount originally established (line 3) and shows whether this latest estimate of claims cost is greater or less than originally thought. As data for individual policy years mature, the correlation between original estimates and re-estimated amounts is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of incurred claims currently recognized in less mature policy years. The columns of the tables show data for successive policy years (expressed in thousands). 244STATE OF NORTH DAKOT A Statistical Section Schedule 17 Claims Development InformationLast Ten Fiscal Years (Expressed In Thousands) Bonding Fund 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1 Net Earned Required Contribution and Investment Revenues 202 $ 195 $ 140 $ 133 $ 70 $ 173 $ 101 $ 42 $ 204 $ 183 $ 2 Unallocated Expenses 25 28 22 33 36 67 26 21 25 8 3 Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense,End of Policy Year 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 21 87 39 (1) 4 Paid (Cumulative) as of: End of Policy Year (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) (19) (106) (136) One Year Later (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) (19) (106) Two Years Later (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) (19) Three Years Later (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) (86) Four Years Later (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) (77) Five Years Later (179) (202) (157) (32) (35) Six Years Later (179) (202) (157) (32) Seven Years Later (179) (202) (157) Eight Years Later (179) (202) Nine Years Later (179) 5 Reestimated Incurred Claims and Expenses: End of Policy Year 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) 87 39 (1) One Year Later 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) 87 39 Two Years Later 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) 87 Three Years Later 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 (21) Four Years Later 22 4 (115) 39 94 26 Five Years Later 22 4 (115) 39 94 Six Years Later 22 4 (115) 39 Seven Years Later 22 4 (115) Eight Years Later 22 4 Nine Years Later 22 6 Increase in Estimated Incurred Claims andExpense From End ofP o l i c y Y e a r 0 0 0 0 0 00000 245STATE OF NORTH DAKOT A Statistical Section Schedule 17 Claims Development InformationLast Ten Fiscal Years (Expressed In Thousands) Fire and Tornado Fund 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1 Net Earned Required Contribution and Investment Revenues 4,709$ 3,031 $ 4,103 $ 5,388 $ Unallocated Expenses 1,340 849 768 915 800 912 1,348 1,118 874 541 3 Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense,End of Policy 4,492 1,691 Nine Years Later 4,492 5 Reestimated Incurred Claims Later 4,516 1,711 Nine Years Later 4,516 6 Increase in Estimated Incurred Claims andExpense From End ofPolicy Year (147) 549 511 125 582 191 (58) 0 87 0 246STATE OF NORTH DAKOT A Statistical Section Schedule 17 Claims Development InformationLast Ten Fiscal Years (Expressed In Thousands) Workforce Safety & Insurance 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1 Net Earned Required Contribution and Investment Revenues 357 $ 341 $ 443 $ 502 $ 408 $ 377 $ 396 $ 343 $ 386 $ 353 $ 2 Unallocated Expenses 30 33 52 41 41 43 47 44 45 44 3 Estimated Incurred Claims and Expense,End Of Policy Year 192 230 300 338 315 229 198 193 187 177 4 Paid (Cumulative) as of: End of Policy Year 39 44 53 65 61 41 40 42 42 42 One Year Later 65 87 99 111 102 74 65 76 69 Two Years Later 76 102 117 128 120 84 73 76 Three Years Later 85 111 128 140 132 84 78 Four Years Later 90 116 136 148 140 88 Five Years Later 94 120 142 154 146 Six Years Later 96 123 146 158 Seven Years Later 98 125 148 Eight Years Later 100 126 Nine Years Later 101 5Reestimated IncurredClaims and Expenses:End of Policy Year 192 230 300 338 315 229 198 192 187 177 One Year Later 192 258 293 321 283 204 177 179 174 Two Years Later 193 344 288 299 271 191 164 172 Three Years Later 187 241 272 291 267 174 154 Four Years Later 174 228 266 285 265 161 Five Years Later 181 221 261 277 263 Six Years Later 174 214 253 265 Seven Years Later 171 206 236 Eight Years Later 164 195 Nine Years Later 155 6 Increase in Estimated Incurred Claims andExpense From End ofPolicy Year (37) (36) (63) (73) (52) (68) (44) (22) (12) 0 247STATE OF NORTH DAKOT A Statistical Section Schedule 18 Agricultural Production Value of Export Shares of Agricultural Commodities - 2018 - 201 9 2018 2018 2019 2019 Dollars % of U.S. Dollars % of U.S. (Mil.)
