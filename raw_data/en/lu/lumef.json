Here's a list of things you can do at home to support your immune system! Prevent the Spread This is the number one priority. Wash your hands often during the day with hot water and soap for 60 seconds. Use anti-bacterial wipes or gel if a sink is not available. If you are sick, please stay home. Use disposable tissues instead of a hanky. Community immune protection is very important! Rest Your body will be able to fight the cold best when you're getting plenty of rest. Allow yourself to sleep longer at night and consider taking a nap during the day if your schedule allows. Good Nutrition Simple, nutritious foods are best when you're sick. It's best to focus on freshly made soups, stews and juices - these are easier for your body to digest and are packed with the nutrients your immune system needs to work well. Avoid sugar, alcohol, and mucous forming foods such as dairy products, wheat products and bananas. Incorporate anti-viral foods into your diet, which include bone broth, olive oil, coconut oil, garlic and onions. Plenty of Fluids It is even more important when you're sick to drink plenty of fluids. Try to drink at least 8 cups of water or herbal tea a day. Hydrotherapy When you shower, practice hydrotherapy. Finish by turning the shower to cold for at least 10 seconds (longer if you can handle it). Always end a shower with cold water in order to boost immunity. Studies have shown this contrast therapy can decrease the duration of illness and help with prevention. "}
