Students must be able to function in a variety of le arning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accurately, and consistently learn and proc ess data. CUSOM utiliz es cadavers in the gross anatomy laboratory. As suc h, CUSOM MSBS students must be able to tol erate wo rking with, a nd touching, c adavers. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural or religious beliefs, except where required by law . Students who have any concern regarding these requirements should discuss them with the Executive Director of Student Affairs prior to applying. CUSOM will make re asonable accommod ations as requir ed by law for students whose disabilities will not prev ent them f rom su ccessfully compl eting the entire CUSOM MSBS curriculum (See Section 3.5). Students, how ever, are required to function with indepe ndence and perform at all skill lev els described below which CUSOM holds a s mand atory for successful completion of the MSBS curriculum . CUSOM is committed to a ssuring a safe and ef fective environment that do es not pla ce students or othe rs at unnecessary risk. Appl icants who do not meet the Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements should not apply to C USOM MSBS . Students/Applicants must possess the requisite abilities and skills in the following six (6) areas: 1. Observat ion The student must be able to visually observe labora tory d emonstr ations, microscopic tissue with the a id of the mi croscope, and electronic imag es used in classroom presentations and labora tory d emonstr ations. The student must be able to visua lly and accurately obs erve physic al signs a nd symptoms of a pa tient used in diagnosis and clinical manag ement. The use of a tr ained intermedi ary in su ch cases would c ompromise p erformance, as it would be medi ated by another individual 's pow er of s election, obs ervation, and experience. Obs ervation requir es the fun ctional use of vision a nd somatic sensations a nd, is oft en enhanced by the s ense of smell. 2. Communica tion The student must be a ble to communi cate effectiv ely in English, a s the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered exclusively in English. Students 18 are encourage d to le arn other languag es for m edical communic ation; how ever, the entire curriculum and all a ssessment exercises are provided in English. CUSOM r equires the fun ctional ability to speak, h ear, and observe others to complete required curricular activities . The student must be able to c ommunic ate effectively and efficiently in verb al and w ritten fo rm. The student must be able to communic ate effectively and effici ently with faculty, staff, and other students in or der to su ccessfully compl ete the curriculum. 3.

The student must be able to compr ehend and understand/apply three - dimension al and sp atial relationships to succe ssfully compl ete the c urriculum and apply fundament al concepts to the provision of pa tient care. The student must be able to acquire and synthesize knowl edge through various types of learning materia ls and for mats utiliz ed in the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. In addition, students must be a ble to p erform p attern re cognition, re call information, id entify and disc riminate importa nt info rmation, probl em solve, calcul ate and make d ecisions in tim ed situations and in the pre sence of noise and distra ctions. The above int ellectual abilities are essential, as stud ents and gradu ates expected pe rform p attern re cognition, immediate re call of learned mat erial, disc rimination to elicit import ant infor mation, probl em solving, and d ecision -making in the emerg ent diagnosis and tre atment of patients. This type of d emonstr ated inte llectual ability must be pe rformed in a rapid and time -efficient mann er in order to provide appropriate care to patients with emergent conditions. 19 It is c ommon for e mergent situ ations to occur in the pr esence of visually distracting and noisy e nvironme nts. Su ch emerg ent situ ations includ e, but a exposur es, shock, and hemorrhage. 5. Behavioral an d Social Attributes The student must possess the e motional h ealth n eeded for full use of his/h er intelle ctual ca pabilities at a ll times.

Students must be able to function effectively und er stress and with physi cally taxing wor kloads, suc h as during le ctures, labs, and written and pra ctical examinations. The ability to a dapt to changing environme nts and str essful situ ations and to display compassion and integrity, while maintaining the necessary int ellectual capacity to be successful in the curriculum , is evaluated throughout the student's progr ess in the MSBS curriculum. An ability to d emonstr ate the emotional h ealth ne cessary to successfully complete the MSBS curriculum is mand atory. CUSOM c onsid ers drug a nd alcohol addiction or abuse a signifi cant risk f actor for providing uns afe patient care and poor pa tient outcom es. As su ch, CUSOM ha regarding subst S ection 3.10.3 of this Bulletin ). 6. Vaccination Requirements Verification that all vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress is required by August 1. Accepted students who have not verified vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress by August 1 prior to matriculation will have their offer of admission rescinded, will forfeit their seat in the class, and any deposit will not be refunded. See Section 3.10 of this Bulletin for addition al information. Applicants must identify to the Executive Director of Student Affairs all areas where there is any question regarding their ability to meet these Technical Standards. If an applicant has a question about his/her ability to meet the minimal Technical Standards, the applicant is required to notify the Executive Director of St udent Affairs in advance of applying. An offer of acceptance may be rescinded should an accepted applicant NOT meet the Technical Standards and Vaccination Requirements for Admission to CUSOM, or be found to not be able to meet these Technical Standards a nd Vaccination Requirements (See Section 3.10) . 20 For matriculated students, inability to maintain compliance with educational training Technical Standards including vaccinations may result in Dismissal from the program. If an applicant signs he/she meets the minimum health requirements, including required vaccination standards, and Technical Standards for admission, but it is discovered after matriculation that the student signed knowing he/she did not meet these minimum standards, then the student may receive sanctions up to and including dismissal from the program. 3.4 Non-Discrimination Admission Policy The MSBS program makes every effort to recruit students with diverse backgrounds to foster the cultural richness to meet its Mission and Goals. MSBS applicants will not be discriminated against on the basis of : race; ethnicity ; color; sex; sexual orientation ; gender ; gender identity ; gender expression; national origin ; age; disabilities ; religion ; genetic information ; protected veteran status ; protected military status; and any other characteristic protected by law, except where appropriate and authorized by law. 3.5 Americans with Disabilities Act CUSOM operates in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), both as amended, to assure its facilities, programs and student policies are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Appl icants and students with specific needs who request or are planning to request an accommodation under the ADA should contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs following the process described in Section 7.2.3 of this Bulletin 3.6 Applications Deadl ine The official PostBacCAS application is available online at: https://postbaccas.liaisoncas.com/ . The deadline for CUSOM MSBS applicants is July 1 . Exceptions to this timeline can only be approved by the Director of the MSBS Program . 21 3.7 Application Process PostBacCAS Application CUSOM MSBS participates alongside other graduate institutions in a centralized application processing service called PostBacCAS. An application may be submitted online at: https://postbaccas.liaisoncas.com/ To initiate the application process, applicants must apply directly to PostBacCAS. PostBacCAS is available to applicants from September to July of the year applying. Detailed instructions can be accessed through https://postbaccas. liaisoncas.com/ . Applicants must request official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended to be mailed directly from the institution(s) to the PostBacCAS office. For more information regarding transcripts, please see Section 3.10.4. Appl icants should also ensure all standardized test scores from the proper testing service are provided/uploaded as part of their PostBacCAS application. 3.8 CUSOM MSBS Selection Process Once the applicant file is complete , received , and verified by PostBacCAS , the Director of the MSBS Program will review the file to determine the most qualified applicants for interview. Qualified candidates will be invited to interview through a virtual meeting platform with members of the MSBS Admissions Committee . Detailed instructions regarding the interview process and procedure will be provided to qualified candidates. The MSBS Admissions Committee is appointed by the Dean. The committee will be notified of candidates selected for interview and will be given the application files for review at least three (3) days prior to the scheduled interview dates. The MSBS Admissions Committee members will evaluate each candidate who interviews with CUSOM MSBS and make a recommendation of either \"accept\" or \"deny\" admi ssion to the Dean. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, makes all final decisions on candidate status. The Dean decides to grant or deny acceptance of each candidate. The candidate will be notified of the decision by email coordinated by the Directo r of the MSBS Program . While the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences program provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate academic capability, it does not assure admi ssion to a professional school. 22 3.9 International Student Applicants CUSOM MSBS may accept students who are US -born citizens, naturaliz ed citizens, and green card holders . CUSOM MSBS policy requires applicants who have completed coursework at foreign institutions be evaluated for U.S. equivalence by one of the evaluation services listed on the PostBacCAS website http://postba ccas.liaisoncas.org/ . The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the U.S. is comparable to a regionally accredited U.S. college or university in a course -by-course fashion . All pre-requisite coursework for admis sion must be completed at an accredited U.S. college or university to be considered. 3.10 CUSOM MSBS M atriculation and Enrollment Policies All a ccepted stude nts must meet the following requirements prior to matr iculation: 3.10.1 Health and Va ccination Requirements Accepting an offer of admission to CUSOM MSBS will require the incoming student to adhere to any mandates imposed by the University at a later date; acceptance of the offer of admission is indirect affirmation the incoming student both underst ands this point and accepts this as a condition of acceptance. Verification that all vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress is required by August 1. Accepted students who have not verified vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress by August 1 prior to matriculation may have their offer of admission rescinded . Students who have their offer of admission rescinded will forfeit their seat in the class and their deposit will not be refunded . All deposited CUSOM MSBS students are required to submit the following to the MSBS Office by way of the CastleBranch website at: https://portal.castlebranch.com/MY69 1. Compl eted medical history form 2. Proof of all CUSOM vaccin ation requirements either met or in progress by August 1 3. Completed controlled substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination conduc ted by a licensed physician 5. Proof of health insurance Students must obtain all CUSOM -requir ed vaccination s and corresponding titers, prior to mat riculation and remain c ompliant with a ll vaccination requir ements through gradua tion in order to compl ete all requir ed experiences in the CUSOM MSBS curriculum and program requirements . 23 All incoming and current students must log all vaccination requirements on the standard AAMC Standard Immunization Form, available at: https://www.aamc.org/download/440110/data/immunizationform.pdf This form must be completed in its entirety and signed by a physician or qualified healthcare provider verifying the required information. In addition, students are required to submit support ing documentation such as vaccination records and titers. Important Notes Regarding Vaccination Requirements Verification that all vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress is required by August 1. Accepted MSBS students who have not verified vaccination requirements are fully met or in progress by August 1 prior to matriculation may have their offer of admission rescinded . Students who have their offer of admission rescinded will forfeit their seat in the class and their deposit will not be refunded. Accepting an offer of admission to CUSOM MSBS will require the incoming student to adhere to any mandates imposed by the University at a later date; acceptance of the offer of admission is indirect affirmation the incoming student both understands this point and accepts this as a condition of acceptance. All students wishing to participate in patient care activities sponsored or affiliated with the MSBS program must maintain full vaccination per this policy. Any incoming student needs t o weigh these facts in considering acceptance of an offer of admission to CUSOM MSBS. In addition, the influenza vaccine is required annually. COVID -19 vaccination requirements will follow CDC guidelines or as specified by clinical education partners and may require boosters annually or at other designated intervals. Clinical experiences are part of the basic curriculum to obtain the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree, and therefore, CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirem ents for religious or personal preferences except as set forth herein . o Campbell University currently provides students the opportunity to request a medical or religious exemption for the COVID -19 vaccine through the following process: Students who seek a medical or relig ious exemption to the COVID - 19 vaccination requirement should contact the Vice President for Student Life and Christian Mission, who chairs the Exemption Review Panel, at 910 -893-1541 or vaxexemption@campbell.edu . o The granting of an exemption to the COVID -19 requirement, does not guarantee that clinical experiences offered through other institutions or third parties will honor the exemption. 24 o Campbell University does not have authority or control over a clinical site's decisions. Therefore, an exemption granted under Campbell University's policies may not be applicable and accepted by a third- party clinical site. Even if a student is granted an exemption from vaccination requirements by t he University, failure to provide proof of vaccinations for clinical experiences as required by external agencies may limit their clinical training opportunities and prevent or delay completion of academic requirements and graduation. Any expenses require d by a clinical site for testing are the sole responsibility of the student. Unless granted an exception, s tudents will not be allowed to participate in any patient care activities, including but not limited to, EMT training, physician shadowing, health outreach events, or local, regional, national or international mission trips, until all vaccination requirements have been met. Inability to participate in required clinical experiences due to noncompliance with CUSOM vaccination policies may result in unexc used absences leading to failure of a course, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee hearing, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. Students must obtain all CUSOM -required vaccinat ions and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required experiences in the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. In addition, non- compliance with CUSOM Vaccination Requirements may result in inability to participa te in any clinical experiences, including, but not limited to, EMT training, physician shadowing, health outreach events, or local, regional, national or international mission trips . This may result in une xcused absences leading to failure of a course, referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee, Academic Probation, Suspension, delay in graduation, or even Dismissal from the program. All students must provide written documentation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form: https://www.aamc.org/media/23441/download completed and signed by their healthcare provider or institutional representative verifying all CUSOM -required vaccination and titer requirements (completed or in progress) , as listed below, and in accordance with the CDC Guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/h cw.html ), have been met for the following: 25 Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus a. All students must submit documentation (physician signature or vaccination record) of vaccination with a *Tdap booster (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since the year 2005. i. *Tdap is the one -time booster containing the acellular pertussis vaccine and is available only in the Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae vaccines. ii. Following the Tdap booster, a Td routine booster is required every ten (10) years. b. This information should be entered into the \"Tetanus -diphtheria - pertussis\" section of the MMR: Measles (Rubeola), Mumps, and Rubella a. Students must provide dates and verification (physician signature or vaccination record) o f two (2) MMR vaccinations, occurring at least 28 days apart. i. If the student is able to provide a vaccination record or physician signature verifying the dates of these two (2) vaccinations, no titer will be required . b. Students unable to provide vaccination records or physician signature verifyin g completion of the MMR series have two (2) options: i. Repeat the MMR series o f two (2) vaccinations at least 28 days apart and provide documentation verifying completion of the series. ii. Obtain titers for measles, mumps, and rubella. 1. If a student elects to ob tain titers and they show evidence of non - immunity to any of the three (3) components of the vaccine (measles, mumps, or rubella), they will be required to repeat the MMR series of two (2) vaccinations at least 28 days apart. The exception is if there is only non- immunity to Rubella, only one additional MMR vaccination will be required. c. This information should be entered into the \"MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form. Varicella a. Students must provide antibody titers as evidence of immunity to Varicella. b. If antibody titers demonstrate a student is not immune to Varicella, they must receive two (2) doses of the varicella vaccine administered four (4) weeks apart. c. This information should be entered into the \"Varicella\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form . 26 Hepatitis B Vaccination a. Students must provide dates and verification ( physician signature or vaccination record) of completing a Hepatitis B vaccination series consisting of either: i. A three (3) dose series of either the Engerix -B or Recombivax HB. Injections of these vaccines are generally given at 0, 1, and 6 months which means injection two would be given 1 month following injection one, and injection three would be given 6 months following injection one. ii. Two-dose series of Heplisav -B\u00ae with the doses separated by at least four (4) weeks. b. A quantitative antibody titer is then performed 4- 8 weeks following the final dose in the series. Qualitative results cannot be accepted . c. While students may not have completed the entire series at the time of matriculation, all students must have at least received their first injection and be in the process of completing the subsequent injection(s) and titer following the above schedule. d. In addition, all students must provide verification of quantitative antibody titers demonstrating immunity to Hepatitis B. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended antibody titer testing be performed 4 -8 weeks following t he final dose in the series. e. Students who do not demonstrate immunity through adequate titer levels i. Students who have received the initial series of Hepatitis B vaccine (3-doses if Engerix -B or Recombivax HB or 2- doses if Heplisav - B\u00ae) and do not seroconver t to demonstrate immunity will be required to repeat the complete series of vaccination s. ii. Following completion of the repeat series of Hepatitis B vaccinations, students must obtain another quantitative titer to confirm immunity. To ensure accuracy, it is recommended that antibody titer testing be performed 4 -8 weeks following the final dose in the series. iii. Students who still do not demonstrate immunity following the second Hepatitis B vaccination series will be considered a vaccine non-responder and at ris k for acquiring Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). iv. Students who do not attain immunity following completion of a second Hepatitis B vaccination series will also be required to obtain testing for active Hepatitis B infection . Please see the information below under Hepatitis B testing for further details. f. If testing for Hepatitis B infection is negative, the student will be considered non-immune to Hepatitis B and will meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Current recommendations and additional education on universal precautions, risk avoidance, and treatment options if exposed to HBV will be provided to the student. The student will sign documentation of informed consent to continue their 27 education, acknowledging the medical risk and receipt of this information, but they will not be required to continue additional HBV vaccination s. Hepatitis B Testing a. Per CDC guidelines, any student who does not obtain protective immunity as demonstrated by quantitative titers to Hepatitis B after a completion of two (2) vaccination series (for a total of six (6) vaccination s with either Engerix -B or Recombivax HB or a total of four (4) vaccination s with Heplisav -B\u00ae) will be required to obtain serologic testing for Hepatitis B infection as described below. Qualitative results cannot be accepted . b. Students who attain protective immunity to Hepatitis B after either the first or second vacci nation series are considered immune, protected, and free of Hepatitis B and, therefore, do not require testing for the disease . c. Testing for Hepatitis B is accomplished through evaluation of serum HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen) and anti -HBc (Total Hepatitis B core antibody). i. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a protein on the surface of HBV; it can be detected in high levels in serum during acute or chronic HBV infection. The presence of HBsAg indicates the person is infectious. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make Hepatitis B vaccine. ii. Total Hepatitis B core antibody (anti- HBc) appears at the onset of symptoms in acute Hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with HBV of an undefined time frame. iii. Students who are required to obtain Hepatitis B testing must provide results of both HBsAg and anti -HBc to CUSOM along with the confirmatory lab reports . Students testing positive for Hepatitis B a. Results of Hepatitis B testing will not affect a student's matriculation status or offer of acceptance but provide valuable information to ensure proper student and patient care safeguards and adherence to CDC recommendations for the management of Hepatitis B virus -infected healthcare providers and students are followed. In addition, testing prior to matriculation provides documentation of baseline infection status in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. i. While the presence of a chronic disease does not affect admission to CUSOM, student participation in clinical training is subject to the policies of the affiliated private hospitals and other healthcare facilities w here students train. 28 b. As noted by the CDC guidelines, HBV infection alone does not disqualify infected persons from the practice or study of medicine. However, in order to promote and optimize both infected student and patient safety, CUSOM has adopted the following set of guidelines for students found to be infected with HBV. c. Students who test positive for Hepatitis B/show evidence of Chronic Active Hepatitis B will be required to have a complete evaluation by an Infectious Disease physician or Gastroenter ologist to evaluate the student's clinical and viral burden status and make recommendations regarding treatment and any appropriate limitation to participation in specific procedures or patient care activities. The consulting physician should provide the following information to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs: i. A summary of the complete evaluation including any additional testing deemed appropriate to define and further evaluate the student's Hepatitis B infection and impact on their health. This should include, but is not limited to, HBV DNA levels (serve as a predictive indicator of infectivity). 1. The CDC recommends that an HBV level 1,000 IU/ml (5,000 GE/ml) or its equivalent is an appropriate threshold for a reviewing physician or panel to adopt . ii. Details of any treatment are recommended. iii. Coordination with the student's primary care physician (PCP) for ongoing care and establishment of appropriate follow up which must include at least an annual exam. iv. Complete the CUSOM Hepatitis B Information Form (Appendix 1) documenting the above information and submit it to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 1. The consultation must be completed and the CUSOM Hepatitis B Information Form received by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs before the student is permitted to participate in any patient care activities, including but not limited to EMT training, the CUCCC, community medicine outreach activities, or medical mission trips. Students will not be able to participate in these activities until this is completed. 2. A student testing positive for Hepatitis B is required to complete a follow up visit with the co nsulting specialist (or primary care physician upon recommendation of the consulting specialist) once every 12 months or sooner based on the specialist's recommendation. Additionally, another Hepatitis B Information Form must be completed and submitted to the Office of the MSBS Program and reviewed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 29 3. Notification of Student Hepatitis B Status Per CDC guidelines, routine notification of patients regarding student HBV status is not indicated unless the provider ex poses the patient to a bloodborne infection. Students involved in direct patient care activities outside of CUSOM should follow all institutional policies and procedures set forth by the healthcare institution facilitating that patient care activity. 4. Addit ional guidelines and information regarding students with Chronic Hepatitis B Infection Standard Precautions All students, including those with HBV infection, must maintain strict adherence to the tenants to standard (universal) infection control precautions. Students with HBV infection are encouraged to practice double -gloving, especially when participating in highly exposure -prone procedures, as this intervention has been shown to be efficacious in preventing the spread of HBV infections. Tuberculosis (TB) Testing a. Baseline TB screening/testing is required for all MSBS students prior to matriculation. b. There are two (2) acceptable methods for TB screening, and all students must provide documentation of the results from ONE of the two methods : i. Two-step tuberculin skin test (TST); or ii. Interferon -Gamma (IGRA) blood test TB Gold In -Tube Test or T -spot TB Test). If the initial TB screening is done with the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST), the student must have the Two -Step Method at ba seline (described below) followed by a single -step annually . If the blood test (Interferon -Gamma Release Assay or IGRA) is used at initial screening for baseline measures, a two -step process is not required. Students should speak with their physician to determine which test is most appropriate for them. c. Option 1: The Mantoux T uberculin S kin Test (TST) i. The Mantoux TST is the standard method of determining whether a person has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The TST is performed by injecting 0.1 ml of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) into the anterior surface of the forearm. The skin test reaction should be read between 48 and 72 hours after administration. If the test is not read between 48 and 72 hours after being placed, the student will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. 30 ii. Two -Step Method: If TST is utilized as the TB screening test, the \"two -step method\" is required . iii. Test interpretation 1. If the first TST result in the two -step baseli ne testing is positive, the person is considered infected and should be evaluated and treated accordingly. 2. If the first test result is negative, the TST should be repeated in 1-3 weeks . 3. If the second test result is positive, the person is considered infected and should be evaluated and treated accordingly. 4. If both steps are negative, the person is considered uninfected, and classify the TST as negative at baseline testing. iv. Note: Two -step Method is only used at the initial screening for a baseline measure - annual testing thereafter only requires a single PPD. v. When IGRAs are used for testing, there is no need for a second test. vi. Summary of 2 -step TST testing is provided in the following table: 1st TST Test Negative Repeat TST in 1 -3 weeks Positive Considered positive for infection* 2nd TST Test Negative Person probably does not have an infection Single PPD required annually moving forward Positive Considered positive for infection* * It is recommended that any student who has received bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), a vaccine for TB disease, undergo IGRA, rather than TST testing. If a student who has previously received BCG undergoes TST testing and obtains a positive result, they should be tested using an IGRA . d. Option 2: Interferon -Gamma R elease Assays B lood T est blood tests (interferon- gamma release assays or IGRAs) measure how the immune system reacts to the bacteria that cause TB. Two IGRAs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United States: 1. QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In -Tube test (QFT -GIT) 2. T-SPOT\u00ae.TB test (T -Spot) ii. IGRAs are the preferred method of TB infection testing for anyone who has received bacille Calmette- Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) . BCG is a vaccine disease. iii. Results of IGRAs 1. Positive IGRA : This means that the person has been infected with TB bacteria. Additional tests, including a chest X -ray, are needed to determine if the person has latent TB infection or active TB disease. 31 2. Negative IGRA : This means that the person's blood did not react to the test, and that latent TB infection or TB disease is not likely. e. Special Situations - Prior BCG Vaccination and Pregnancy i. Testing for TB in BCG -Vaccinated Persons : 1. Many people born outside of the United States have been BCG - vaccinated. People who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people, BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB bacteria. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. IGRAs, unlike the TB skin tests, are not affected by prior BCG vaccination and are not expected to give a false- positive result in people who have received BCG. 2. Students who have had a previous BCG vaccine must still be tested for TB with the TST or IGRAs . 3. Most people with pr evious BCG vaccine should consider an IGRA rather than a TST test; however, that decision should be made in consultation with their healthcare provider. ii. Pregnancy 1. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for TB skin testing. Pregnant students and students who are nursing should be included in the same baseline and serial TB screening as all other healthcare workers . IGRA blood tests are not currently used in pregnant women. iii. MSBS Students with Positive TST or IGRA Testing 1. Students with WRITTEN documentation of a previous positive TST or TB Blood Test 2. If the date and result of the previous test are documented, these students do not need a repeat TST or TB blood test. 3. If they have written documentation of the results of a chest X - ray indicating no active TB disease that is dated after the date of the positive TST or TB blood result, they do not need another chest X -ray unless symptoms or signs of TB disease develop or a clinician recommends a repeat chest X -ray. 4. These students do not require annual TST or IGRA testing but, must complete the TB Risk Assessment Form (Appendix 2) annually , have it signed by a physician, and submit it to the Office of the MSBS Program to be reviewed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 5. If the student does not have written documentation of a chest radiograph, they must obtain a chest X -ray prior to matriculation to exclude a diagnosis of infectious TB. The results/interpretation of this chest X -ray must be submitted to the Office of the MSBS Program and reviewed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 32 iv. MSBS Students with a Newly Identified P ositive TST or IGRA blood test 1. If a student tests positive with either screening test (TST or IGRA) any time following matriculation, they must immediately notify the Office of Clinical Affairs . 2. These individuals must be assessed by their physician for current TB symptoms and risk factors for progression to active TB disease. The physician must co mplete the \"Record of Tuberculosis Screening\" form and provide documentation indicating that the student is permitted to continue in the curriculum as a student including participation in lectures, labs, and clinical experiences. This documentation, along with documentation of the students chest x -ray result as noted below, must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to the student returning to campus or participating in any clinical experiences. 3. In addition, they must obtain a chest X -ray to exclude a diagnosis of active infectious TB disease and submit this documentation to the Office of Clinical Affairs. v. MSBS Students with Suspected or Confirmed Infectious TB : 1. If infectious TB is confirmed, the student must not r eturn to campus or participate in any clinical activities, including but not limited to EMT training, the CUCCC, community outreach, or medical mission trips. A student confirmed to have infectious TB will only be able to return when all the following criteria have been met: Three consecutive sputum samples collected in 8 -24 hour intervals are negative, with at least one sample from an early morning specimen; The person has responded to anti -TB treatment that will likely be effective (based on susceptibili ty results); The person is determined to be noninfectious by a physician knowledgeable and experienced in managing active TB disease; and 2. The student's treating physician must provide documentation to the Office of the MSBS Program to be reviewed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs verifying each of these criteria have been met and that the student can safely participate in clinical activities. d. All required information regarding TB testing and treatment must be entered in the \"Tuberculin Screening History\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization form . 33 Influenza a. All students are required to provide the dates and verification (physician signature or vaccination record) of an annual influenza vaccination. b. Students will be required to resubmit verification annually and will not be allowed to participate in patient care activities without proof of vaccination. COVID -19 Due to the rapidly evolving nature of this disease , the requirements listed below are subject to change at any time to be consi stent with recognized safe practices. COVID -19 vaccination requirements will follow CDC guidelines or as specified by clinical education partners and may require boosters annually or at other designated intervals. If additional COVID -19 vaccination requirements are implemented, they may have specific deadlines. All students must be fully vaccinated in order to participate in patient care activities . Completion and verification of all vaccine requirements (completed or in progress) is required by August 1. Clinical experiences are part of the core curriculum to obtain the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree, and, therefore, CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for rel igious or personal preferences. Campbell Univer sity currently provides students the opportunity to request a medical or religious exemption for the COVID -19 vaccine through the following process: o Students who seek a medical or religious exemption to the COVID - 19 vaccination requirement should contact t he Vice President for Student Life and Christian Mission, who chairs the Exemption Review Panel, at ( 910)-893-1541 or vaxexemption@campbell.edu . Optional Vaccines and Testing HIV Testing Although not required, CUSOM encourages all students to obtain HIV testing prior to matriculation . Testing prior to matriculation provides students with their baseline status in regard to the presence of HIV infection which is valuable in the event a student has an ex posure incident during subsequent clinical activities. Students are not required to report the results of their testing to CUSOM. 34 Hepatitis C Testing To protect CUSOM students and patients, it is recommended that students obtain Hepatitis C testing and provide documentation of test results to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to matriculation . Results of Hepatitis C testing will not affect a student's matriculation status or offer of acceptance but will provide valuable information to ensure proper patient care safeguards and adherence to CDC recommendations for the management of Hepatitis C virus in infected healthcare providers and students are followed. In addition, testing prior to matricul ation provides a baseline status in regard to the presence of Hepatitis C infection which is valuable in the event a student has an exposure incident during subsequent clinical activities. Testing for Hepatitis C may be accomplished by several methods with the most common method utilized for initial screening being the measurement of anti -HCV, which is a test to detect the presence of antibodies to the Hepatitis C virus. If anti -HCV tests are positive, students will be required to obtain additional confir matory testing and medical follow up in accordance with CDC guidelines: http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/HCVfaq.htm#section3 Optional Vaccines The following vaccines are considered optional; however, CUSOM strongly advises all students to discuss the appropriateness of each of the following vaccinations with their primary care physician, taking into account their personal medical history, risk factors for contracting t hese diseases and potential for international travel. 1. Polio 2. Hepatitis A 3. Meningococcal Disease 4. Yellow Fever 5. Typhoid Fever Students who have obtained the above optional vaccinations should document the dates and provide verification (physician signature or vaccination records) and include them in the \"Additional Vaccines\" section of the AAMC Standard Immunization Form. 35 Additional Information Regarding Vaccination Requirements In some situations, clinical training sites may have additional vaccination requirements above those required by CUSOM. CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for religious, medical, or personal preferences. CUSOM may revise the vaccination requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with any subsequent changes. 3.10.2 National Background Checks If an applicant has been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony prior to admission or matriculation, it is their responsibility to inform CUSOM MSBS immediately. Failure to disclose and provide accurate information about prior convictions may result in rescinding of acceptance offers, program dismissal, or other sanctions. Applicants must be aware of the potential impact on program acceptance and contact the CUSO M MSBS program f or guidance if they have a felony conviction or a criminal record. If an applicant is uncertain of the status of a charge versus a conviction on their record, or if they are uncertain as to whether the offense was an infraction, misdemeano r, or a felony, they should contact the city, county, or state jurisdiction where the incident oc curred, and they should contact the CUSOM MSBS program . CUSOM MSBS applicants are required to self -disclose any charges, arrests or convictions including misdemeanors, felonies, a prayer for judgment continued, deferred adjudications, traffic violations, military non -judicial punishment, court martial, and general or less -than-honorable discharge from the military, (all hereinafter \"Offenses\") with the understanding that non- disclosure/falsification of any previous or pending Offenses may result in the revocation of the offer of admission. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: Any instance in which they were arrested but which did not result in a conviction; Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but the conviction was overturned on appeal ; Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but received a pardon; Any instance in which they were tried as a juvenile or in which the conviction was entered via a court process specific to juvenile defendants ; or Any instance in which they were convicted of a crime but the conviction has since been expunged or sealed by a court under applicable law 36 If a student has any Offenses pending final adjudication at any time during the application process, at the time of matriculation, or following matriculation, it is the student's responsibility to immediately inform the CUSOM MSBS program . Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation, and on any student whose actions could potentially be considered a risk to others at any time. Should any Offenses occur after matriculation, (1) the student must report the Offenses to the Executive Director of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the inc ident, or (2) if Offenses occurring prior to matriculation are not reported to CUSOM at the time of application but are subsequently discovered following matriculation, the Offense will, pursuant to Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin, be reviewed by the Academ ic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and may result in possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. A national background check can be done at any time and is also done on each student prior to matriculation . Additional national background checks may be performed at the discretion of CUSOM or its partnering institutions before accepting a student into a ny clinical experience . National background checks may be required at any time deemed appropriate by CUSOM. Discovery of any previously non- reported Offense(s) may lead to referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks. Even expunged records may appear on these background checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in conseq uences affecting acceptance into professional programs or employment opportunities. If a student is unable t o pass background check requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS committee for possible sanctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. All current or former students returning from an approved extended period away from CUSOM, such as a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, must notify the Executive Director of Student Affairs in writing of any Offenses, including any conduct which may be considered a violation of the 37 Standards of Professional Conduct (Section 5.6.3), Student Profes sionalism and Ethics Standards (Section 6.7.2), Honor Code (Section 6.7.3), or the Code of Conduct (Section 6.7.4) no earlier than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date . For example, a student returning from a Medical Withdrawal on August 1, the Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen must be completed and results provided to CUSOM between June 2 and July 31. An Offense occurring less than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date must be reported to the Executi ve Director of Student Affairs within 24 hours of the Offense. Non-disclosure or falsification of any information related to an Offense may result in the revocation of the offer to return to CUSOM, or if already returned to CUSOM, referral to the APPS Com mittee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program . CUSOM retains the right to relinquish the seat of any current or former student returning from an extended absence if they have been criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation. Students who have already resumed classes following an extended absence, who have been or are criminally charged or convicted of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation will be referred to the APPS Committee for sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. As potential future physicians, students are held to a high standard of professionalism, ethics, and honor, and CUSOM has a duty to protect the public from potential harm b y its students. All current or former students returning from an approved period away from CUSOM including, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Supplemental Application, national background check, and controlled substance screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM , no earlier than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. For example, a student returning from a Medical Withdrawal on August 1, the Background Check and Controlled Substance Screen must be completed and results provided to CUSOM between June 2 and July 31. Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric or medical evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return yet still wish to attend the CUSOM MSBS program , will have to re- apply through PostBacC AS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. 38 3.10.3 Controlled Substance Screening In response to requirements in the professional practice environment, a controlled substance screening must be completed by all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. This screening must meet CUSOM's standards and be conducted by an agency approved by CUSOM. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of state and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive (i.e., evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, an ad hoc committee will be assigned to review the case. Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the student's acce ptance may be rescinded . For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a student to conduct themselves in a responsible, professional manner consistent with the standards set forth by CUSOM . As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation o f University policy. By signing the Attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge compliance with the precepts contained in the CUSOM MSBS Academic Bulletin, each applicant to the CUSOM MSBS program promises he/she is not currently using, and he/she will not use while a CUSOM MSBS student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Additional screenings may be required, at any time, at the discretion of CUSOM or partnering -institutions. By matriculating to the CUSOM MSBS program , the student agrees t o allow CUSOM to share controlled substance screening results as deemed necessary. If either of the following events occur, the matter will be referred to the APPS Committee for review in accord ance with the Procedures for Non -Academic Matters unde r Section 6.7 .5 of this Bulletin : 1. Any substance -related incident which occurs before or after matriculation, including, but not limited to, charges/arrests for Driving Under the Influence, must be reported by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the occurrence. 2. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively diluted urine. 39 3.10.4 Transcripts All CUSOM MSBS students are required to provide official transcripts from all colleges and universiti es attended if they have course work which was not included or degree(s) not conferred with the transcripts submitted through PostBacCAS . All transcripts are included in the student's original PostBacCAS application so students are only required to provide CUSOM MSBS official transcripts from cou rsework completed and degree(s) conferred after the PostBacCAS application was submitted. All students must submit all requir ed paperwork by the publishe d deadlin es. Failure to submit infor mation could r esult in a n offer of admission b eing rescinded. Falsifica tion of a ny doc ument or omission of any p ertinent information may result in dismiss al from the program if dis covered after matriculation. 40 4. Student Expenses and Financial Aid 4.1 Cost of Attendance 4.1.1 Application Fee There is a non -refundable application fee associated with PostBacCAS. 4.1.2 Accep tance Fee Accepted students must submit a non -refundable deposit of $1,500.00 to CUSOM by the deadline designated in their offer of acceptance. Payment is credited tow ard tuition upon mat riculation. 4.1.3 Tuition and Fees Tuition is subject to chang e annua lly. Tuit ion for the 2022- 2023 Acade mic Year is $25,040 with additional fees of $2,080 to cover recreation, technology , and other needs. C ampbell Univ ersity's Board of Trustees reserves the right to chang e the schedule of tu ition and fees without advance notice, and to ma ke such changes applicable to pre sent, as well as future students of CUSOM MSBS . The Board of Trustees may also establish additional fees or charges for special s ervices whenever, in the Board of Trustee's opinion, such act ions are deemed a dvisabl e. Students receiv ing federal aid or scholarships which have not arrived by the beginnin g of the acade mic year must have written assurance the funds are awarded. Students must pay any outstanding tuition and fees. When those funds are distribut ed, an y funds which exceed tuition and fees will be refunde d. All inqui ries conce rning the above policies and all requests for refunds should be directed to the Campbell University Office of F inancial Ai d: FinancialAid@Campbell.edu Student Fees Students in Years One and Two are assesse d an annua l student fee of $2,080. These fees are used to cover costs of laboratory equipme nt, compute r softw are and mainten ance, anization memb ership, student activities, te , and heal th services. The Campbell Univ ersity Board of Trustees reserves the right to change this fee schedule without notice. 41 4.1.4 Refund Policy Tuition and fees are refunded in accordance with the Campbell University Refund/Repayme nt Policy for Graduate and Professional Program s. https://www.campbell.edu/bursars -office/payments/refund- information/ To officially withdr aw from CUSOM MSBS , a student is required to complete an official withdrawal f orm available from CUSOM's Office of Student Affairs. The official form must be comple ted with prope r signatures obtai ned and turn ed in to the Executive Director of Student Affairs . Once all sig natures are obtaine d, the Executive Director of Student Affairs provid es a copy to the Registrar for pla cement in the student 's permanent file. Upon the comple tion of the official withdrawal form and the receipt of said form in the CUSOM Office of the R egistrar, the student's c lass registration is upda ted as withdr from accordi ngly and sses student tuition and fee charges. CUSOM MSBS students' tuition refunds are issued for a Univ ersity Withdrawal (\"W\" status) in accordance with the schedule set forth in the link below . To be eligible for a Univ ersity Withdrawal tuition refund, the student must withdraw from CUSOM MSBS and all classes are subsequently assigned a \"W\" status. Withdrawal tuition refunds will be based on the effective date of status ch ange and calcu lated in accor dance with the Campbell University Refund/Repayment Policy for Graduate and Professional Programs : https://www.campbell.edu/bursars -office/payments/refund- information/tuition -refund -schedules/ The Campbell University Bursar's Office is responsib le for the reassessment of student account charges and ensuring financial aid awards have been evaluated and reassessed accordingly. The Campbell University Bursar's Office reserves the right to hold refund of credit balances until they have evaluated and approved the release of funds awarded to students who withdraw from the University. Any student account balance resulting from a University withdrawal or separation is the responsibility of the student and subject to the collections process. Students wi ll not have grades entered on transcripts, or have transcripts available, if there is an outstanding balance owed the University. 42 4.2 Financial Aid Campbell University's Office of Financial Aid (Office of Financial Aid) makes every effort to ensure no qualified applicant is denied the opportunity to study biomedical science due to financial reasons. The financial aid program assists students in the form of institutional scholarships and student loans. The Office provides financial aid counseling to prospective applicants and to CUSOM MSBS graduates and beyond. The Office of Financial Aid is responsible for the administration of the student financial aid program. Personal financial aid counseling is also available to s tudents by appointment. The Office of Financial Aid will email all accepted students information related to applying for financial aid. Students interested in applying for financial aid are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Ai d (FAFSA), and the Statement of Financial Responsibility. Students must also provide any other documentation required by federal, state, and private financial assistance programs to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Financial aid co unseling is pr esented to incoming students at the Financial Aid Presentation during Orientation. Attendance at this financial aid presentation is mandatory for all students. During the presentation, federal entrance counseling requirements are discussed including aid eligibility calculations, borrower rights and responsibilities, and loan information. A review of the financial aid application process, loan disbursements, billing process, deferments, record keeping , and debt management are also discussed. Students may meet individually with the financial aid counselor if they have specific questions regarding their financial aid package or if the counselor requests a special meeting. The Office of Financial Aid provides personal counseling upon request w ith students receiving financial aid throughout each academic year. CUSOM MSBS students are offered periodic updates regarding changes in financial aid regulations and application procedures. Such information is provided to students through their CUSOM e mail. Students are encouraged to call, email, or stop by the Office of Financial Aid for further individual assistance. The Office of Financial Aid also provides personal counseling sessions for students receiving financial aid throughout each academic y ear. These sessions include budgeting tips, responsible borrowing strategies, loan terms and conditions, default prevention, student loan debt in relation to monthly payment amounts and deferment, forbearance, repayment and consolidation options, record keeping, and helpful websites for additional financial aid resources. Satisfactory Academic Performance (SAP) is one of the factors which determine if a student will qualify for renewal of financial aid. The SAP at CUSOM currently is set at a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. 43 The Office of Financial Aid conduc ts Exit Couns eling sessions for any student who withdr aws or graduates from CUSOM MSBS . Du ring these sessions, federal exit couns eling requirements are discuss ed including borrower rights and respons ibilities, instructions on how to access and interpret the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), loan terms and c onditions, de fault prevent ion, r epayment options and strategies, consolidation, deferment, forbearance, record keepi ng and helpful websites for additional financial aid resources. Students may meet individual ly with the financial aid couns elor if they have specific questions regarding their financial aid or if the couns elor requests a special meeting. In compliance with federal gove rnment regulations for students who withdr aw and do not meet with the financial aid couns elor, the ex it info rmation i s mailed to the student's address of record. 4.2.1 Financial A id Renewal Students receiv ing financial aid are expected to make r easona ble and timely Satisfactory Acade mic Progress (SAP ) towards their graduate degree during all periods of enrollm ent. C ampbell Univ ersity is consisten t in apply ing the SAP policie s to full- and part-time students. The cumula tive GPA for achieving SAP for CUSOM MSBS is urrently 2.0 on a 4.0 s cale. Addit ional information regarding financial ai d can be Campbell Univ ersity Website: https://assets.campbell.edu/wp -content/uploads/2016/12/19113125/grad- sap-policy -revised -01132017.pdf In addition, should there be an outstanding balance at the end of the semest er, students will be pla ced on a Bursar's Office Hold and will not be registered for the following s emest er and are n ot eligible for financial aid unt il the Bursar's Office Hold i s clear ed. CUSOM and Campbell University advise students concerning financial aid requirements ; however, final responsibility rests with each individual student to ensure all financial aid requirements and due dates are met and are up-to- date. 4.3 Scholarships 4.3.1 MSBS Scholarships CUSOM MSBS awards scholarships to students who excel in the MSBS program, aiding in the retention of highly qualified students. Scholarship criteria are based primarily on cumulative MSBS grade point average (GPA). The Endowed and Annual Scholarship Committee recommends scholarship candidates to the Dean for final approval and may consider other factors, such as commitment to service, in the decision -making process. 44 4.3.2 Academic Excellence Award MSBS students who have achieved a cumulative MSBS GPA of 3.750 or greater on a 4.0 scale after the first academic year are eligible to receive an Academic Excellence Award. Academic Excellence Award recipients receive a maximum award of $5,000, subject to fund availability. These awards reward both academic excellence and aid in student retention, and are awarded at the end of the first academic year for the benefit of the second academic year. 4.3.3 Jerry M. Wallace Scholar Award MSBS students who have achieved a cumulative MSBS GPA of 3.500 to 3.749 after the first academic year are eligible to receive a Jerry M. Wallace Scholar Award. Jerry M. Wallace Scholar Award recipients receive a maximum award of $2,500, subject to fund availability. These awards reward both academic excellence and aid in student retention, and are awarded at the end of the first academic year for the benefit of the second academic year. 45 5. Curriculum 5.1 General Overview 5.1.1 Academic Calendar Academic calen dars are made available to all students. Weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs. The minimum length of the MSBS curriculum at CUSOM is 70 weeks over two academic years. The curriculum duration for each year is: Year 1 = 3 6 weeks Year 2 = 3 4 weeks The minimum number of credits required to earn the MSBS d egree is 36.0. 5.1.2 Clinical Shadowing Policies and Procedur es CUSOM MSBS Student Shadowing Many students choos e to engag e in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the fo rmal CUSOM MSBS curriculum such as during semester breaks, summer break, or weekends. S hadowing experiences can be extremely valuable , and students may choos e to include these ex periences in their Curriculum Vitae or personal statement. Shadowing experiences can occur with CUSOM -appointe d clinical faculty memb ers or physicians not a ffiliate d with C USOM . Shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the stude nt's required CUSOM MSBS curriculum and d efined stru cture, supe rvision, feedback mechanisms, and medi cal-legal protections provide d by formal clinical training . Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience ackno wledge they will do so while a dhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands -on activity occurs with patients, this should be limited to patient examination only, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences, including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, rectal and genitourinary systems. Students should not perform any osteopathic manipulation while on shadowing experiences. 46 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity while engaged in physician sha dowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM-appointed faculty memb er. Students are required to let non- CUSOM appointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provide d by Campbell University. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambul atory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or healthcare system pol icies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and compl y with a ny applicable pol icies. 4. Indivi dual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is the refore the student's e thical and pr ofessional dut y to fully explain their lev el of tr aining. Shadowing with CUSOM Cl inical F aculty M embers 1. Students who desire to shadow CUSOM clinical faculty must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty members should wear their CUSOM ID and proper attire as directed otherwise by the clinician . 3. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty member must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form, (available from the MSBS Office) completed in its entirety, to the MSBS Office. 4. Students m ust sign the f orm a nd initial all required attestations. 5. The completed form must be submi tted to the MSBS Office for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing e xperience. Shad owing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow non-CUS OM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with the si tes in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the c linician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and backgro und checks, i mmuniz ation records, acade mic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University . d. Students acknowl edge tha t Campbell Unive rsity will not be li able for any medi cal care or expenses if they a re injured or become ill during 47 the clinical shadowing experience. They a lso r elease C ampbell Univ ersity f rom any liability from a ny injury or illness which occurs during the sha dowing e xperience. 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this doc ument. Violation of any conditions of this Shad owing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.2 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The CUSOM MSBS curriculum focuses on students learning the fundamental principles of biomedical science during the first year and expanding upon this knowledge during the second year. Upon completion of the degree program, students will have a solid foundation in the biomedical sciences sufficiently equipping them to handle the rigorous curricula of professional programs. This curriculum is designed to prepare individuals for professional programs and careers in a variety of healthcare professions. 5.2.1 Year 1 Curriculum Biomedical courses will be complemented with standardized exam preparation, professional development, and opportunities for students to engage in community service and complete an EMT training program which will allow students to gain valuable clinical experience.

Academic Policies and Procedures 6.1 Advising and Tutoring 6.1.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes strong academic counseling should provide students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre- matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. CUSOM's comprehensive academic counseling process includes a series of academic transition support activities, mentorship f rom assigned academic advisors , training and allocation of peer -tutors, a s well as individual and group learning enrichment workshops through its Academic Center of Excellence (CUSOM ACE). Organizational Structure of the Academic Center of Excellence ( ACE ) CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the two Assistant Deans for Academic Success and the support of an Administrative Assistant, is responsible for the overall success of CUSOM MSBS students. CUSOM ACE manages academic support programs and learning services including, but not limited to peer -tutor ing program, study skill development workshops, behavioral counseling, individual academic coaching, faculty advising support, and an on- line student forum. CUSOM ACE also hosts a collection of learning resources accessible to the CUSOM community through its computers and library. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community and Facebook group pages provide additional platforms for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborative academic interactions. Academic Transition Activities CUSOM ACE is responsible for designing and leading activities and programs designed to assist matriculating students to develop study skills and techniques in achieving academic success. During the first semester , two study skills workshops discuss growth mindset, metacognition, spaced practice, interleaving learning, test-taking skill s, and exam autopsy for refining study skills. Additional academic skills refinement is followed up by individual consultation upon request . Long- term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or 55 even teach. The CUSOM MSBS advising process ensures faculty are involved in student advising and establishing relationships which create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. The Advisor -Advisee relationship will ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. All advisors play an important role in identifying students experiencing academic, personal or behavioral heal th problems and providing them with referrals to CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Executive Director of Student Affairs assign s academic advisors, with input and a pproval by the Academic Officer for the MSBS program , to each incoming CUSOM MSBS student. Such mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors duri ng years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Semester 1 of Years 1 and 2, students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually, and once in a group setting before and after Fall Break (4 meetings total). The purpose of these meetings is to provide the academic support to the students as they adjust to graduate school and prepare for professional programs . During Semester 2 , students are required to meet with their advisors at least once in a group setting. Additional individual meetings can be arranged based on needs. During each semester of Years 1 and 2, students will also have a Personalized Evaluation of Professional Programs Candidacy (PEPPC) meeting with the Director of the MSBS Program , Assistant Director of the MSBS Program , Academic Officer of the MSBS Program , and Faculty Advisor to provide additional support and counsel on applications to professional programs and assessment of candidate competitiveness and readiness for professional programs. In lieu of a PEPPC meeting, a Pre -Professional Committee Interview may be scheduled pending approval from the Director of the MSBS program . In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty offer office hours individually and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty, or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By matriculating into the CUSOM MSBS program , students agree that t heir grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate effective advising. 56 6.1.2 Enrichment and Intervention Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health, CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The two Assistant Deans for Academic Success lead CUSOM ACE and provide counseling services for study skills, time management, test- taking skills, etc. directly to students in group settings or during one -on-one meetings. Individual meetings are scheduled based on need or according to the recommendation of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade o f 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to contact their academic advisor s or CUSOM ACE for an individual meeting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs based on academic performance, student requests, recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule additional meetings with their academic advisor or ACE at any time, regardless of their academic performance. Students placed on A cademic Probation per the decision of the APPS Committee may be required to maintain regular communication with the ACE Co-director(s), who monitor the students' academic progress closely throughout their probation period. Recommendation to seek additional support from Behavioral Health when necessary is also an integral part of this process. To maximize the effectiveness of faculty academic advisors, CUSOM ACE also organizes and participates in faculty development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for mentoring students. 6.1.3 CUSOM Peer- Tutor Program CUSOM ACE develops and manages additional academic support services through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor program . The CUSOM Peer -Tutor program is designed to assist students requesting tutoring service to not only gain more proficien cy in subject -specific materials but also become more effective independent learners across a broad range of c ourses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace, lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting with clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assig nments. CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, and appoints course -specific tutors. To become a certified tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (ranking the top 20% of a specific course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3), complete a Tutor Training Workshop provided by the ACE, and be approved by the Course Director(s). CUSOM MS BS-1 and MSBS-2 students who wish to receive peer -tutoring support place their requests by logging onto the ACE Community page on Blackboard and complet ing a request form provided via a Wufoo link. The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) will identify available certified peer -tutors who will then contact the 57 tutees directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long -term basis. The goal of tutoring sessions is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic professionalism, confidentiality, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Code. The most updated CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program manual is published on ACE Community page on Blackboard. As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM administrators are accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Administrative leadership a lso strives to conduct informal meetings with students on a regular basis, such as meetings of student small groups with the Dean and Associate Deans. In summary, academic advisors, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the two years of the MSBS program , and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. 6.1.4 Academic Freedom Policy Faculty are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of their other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the in stitution in advance of the acceptance of employment. Faculty are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject, but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment. The University faculty member is a citizen and a member of a learned profession. Their primary loya lty is to their institution, their profession, and their growth and development as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. A faculty member possesses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from their position as an employee of the University; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to indicate that in their role as a citizen they are not an institutional spokes person. Moreover, they should a llow for the fact that many members of the general public will find it difficult to disasso ciate their utterances as a citizen from their institutional identification. They should not use official university stationery, logos, watermarks or their institutional title in issuing public statements which they make purely in their role as a citizen. Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, o r stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 58 6.2 Assessment 6.2.1 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM MSBS curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written integrated examinations , assignments and projects . The Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through the processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Acad emic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action or academic review, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM MSBS graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. Assessment of knowledge is conducted by multiple -choice examinations , quizzes , and assignments administered at scheduled intervals. 6.2.2 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic (IRC, a subcommittee of the CUSOM Dean's Council ), the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM MSBS curriculum as part of the institutional accreditation process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, master, and doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033- 4097 or call ( 404)-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Boar d of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es revie wed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Med icine degree program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to appr ove the program and include it in the s cope of the curren t accreditation and to advance the institution to L evel VI.\" Campbell University is one of only f ive private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC. CUSOM's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to prepare students for the rigor and pace of a wide range of health professions programs . 6.2.2.1 CUSOM MSBS C redit Cal culation The CUSOM MSBS curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per s emester of study with a designated number of weeks per s emester . For the first year of the curriculum, there are two semesters of study each of eighteen (18) weeks duration. For the second year of the curriculum, there are two semesters of study, one of eighteen (18) weeks and one of sixteen (1 6) weeks duration. CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours utilizing 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a 1.0 credit course requires 15 60 contact hours so a course of 10 contact hours woul d be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. 6.2.2.2 Credit Re view Pr ocess CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Adm ission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM MSBS Curriculum Committee, as well as the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC), as necessary. To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, preced ent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistency with the CUSOM Mission . The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintained in the Office of Academic Affairs. All proposed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), a subset of the Dean's Council , and also the full Curriculum C ommittee for review, consideration, discussion and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an existing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non- substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other pro grams or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Academic Officer and Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curriculum, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the V ice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the MSBS Curriculum Committee. 61 Upon approval at all levels, the proposed changes are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree -granting higher education institutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requir ements and in a timely manner. 6.2.2.3 Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a grading system, in keeping with the CUSOM MSBS Mission, to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to a professional in the healthcare field . Throughout both years of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum, students must complete all required coursework with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review (See Section 6.7) . Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. CUSOM MSBS has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades: Grading Scale MSBS-1 and MSBS-2 Cours es Quality Points Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 IC Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 C*b 70 2.0 F < 70 0.0 P 70 4.0 P*b 70 2.0 a The maximum percentage cannot ex ceed 100. Pe rcentage grades are rounded to t he tenth from 0.50 upw ards, th erefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful r emediation of an initial failing grade. Incomplete (IC) and Withdraw (W) do not carry any quality points. 62 6.2.2.4 Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points and Class R ank A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. Stu dents who fail to successfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be earned for a remediated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remedi ated, passed Pass - Fail course. 6.2.2.5 Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and zero (0) points awarded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three -hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points. Incomplete (IC) and Withdraw (W), grades do not carry any quality points. 6.2.2.6 Class Rank Class ranks are calculated after all final grades have been submitted at the end of each academic s emester , in Years One and Two. The class rank has no direct correlation to the student's cumulative GPA. Final grades in all courses are calculated into the cumulative GPA throughout the two years. Class ranks are based solely upon the numerical grades earned in each course across semesters 1 through 4. 63 For example, two students could have a 4.00 GPA but one could be ranked number 1 and the other ranked number 6. The student ranked first achieved higher numerical grades in some courses (e.g., Student 1 earned a grade of 99% in Anatomy while Student 6 earned a grade of 93% in Anatomy). Class ranks are not reported on student transcripts ; however , higher class ranks may be identified on the Pre- Professional Committee Letter when applying to health professions programs . 6.2.3 Remediation Throughout the two years of the CUSOM M SBS curriculum, students must complete all required coursework with passing grades and other degree requirements as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. The APPS Committee may offer students who fail any part of the curriculum an opportunity for remediation (See Section 6.7) . A student in the first (MS BS-1) or second (MS BS-2) year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete. The student will receive a grade of C* for a passed graded course or P* for a passed Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation (See Section 6.2.3.5) . PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECISION MADE B Y THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME HE/SHE WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION. 6.2.4 Grading for Years One and Two Eval uation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM MSBS recognizes five categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to: 1. Written e xaminations 2. Quizzes 3. Assignments 4. Presentations 5. Other (e.g., Projects, In-class activities, Independent work ) 64 Each category is represented within the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A course grade can be determined by any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Academic Officer . Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the f ive categories identified above , yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated written exams typically occur four to five times in each semester in Years 1 & 2. Separate written exa ms are administered for Introduction to Biostatistics and Advanced Biostatistics. Journal Club I -II, Capstone Project I -II, Community Outreach, Professional Development, Clinical Experience, Introduction to Biostatistics, and Advanced Biostatistics are not included on the integrated exams. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. Integrated Quizzes are typically administered each Monday afternoon of the MS BS-1 and MS BS-2 curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from lectures given in the specified preceding week (s). Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points possible. Grades are defined by the course-grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllab us. As su ch, bonus point s are not pe rmitted. In rare instances, there may be except ions to the establish ed Grading Policy, whi ch require jus tification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the stude nts at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive th eir course grades. 6.3 Educational Records 6.3.1 Policy Statement on Student Information and Educational Recor ds It is the policy of CUSOM to release certain directory information of CUSOM MSBS students in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA; 42 USCA 1232g, as amended). Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records, as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information,\" see: www.campbell.e du/registrar/family-educat ion-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa/ 65 Campbell University will release information only with the student's written consent and/or in compliance with federal law and regulation. CUSOM has a secure, confidential, and onsite computerized record system with offsite secure network backup. All items entered into this system are retained as a part of the student's permanent record. The student's permanent record contains his/her trans cript from CUSOM, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, Standardized test scores, the student's application for admission, general correspondence with the student, and if applicable, letters concerning misconduct. Upon appointment with the Registrar, a student may examine their transcript and contents of their permanent record. University officials with access to the student's educational records are the President, Provost, Academic Deans, Registrar, Executive Director of Student Affairs , and designees of these University officials with a legitimate educational interest in the reco rd. Campbell University guarantees each student certain rights in compliance with FERPA. Please refer to the Annual Notification of There is a health and safety emergency exception which states that the institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record to appropriate parties including parents in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or other individuals. More information can be found at: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html 6.4 Attendance 6.4.1 Attendance Policy Attendance of first - and second- year students is expected at all lectures, and required at all labs and other scheduled curricular activities. Absences for emergencies are considered on a case -by-case basis through the Assistant Director of the MSBS program . Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violation. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Violations of the attendance requirement policy may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism issues in the student's record. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 66 6.4.2 MSBS-1 and MSBS-2 Years It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however, a student who misses a lecture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that particular session(s) . The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Make -up laboratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director in consultation with the Academic Officer when necessary. A student may be eligible to request an excused absence through the Assistant Director of the MSBS program by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For a medical co ndition/illness, the student must provide the Assistant Director of the MSBS program with a note fr om the exa mining physician (who is NOT a f amily member) indicating the medical visit, the amount of recommended time -off, a nd the student's re turn-to-class dat e. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitte d at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacations, weddings, graduations or other similar activities or events. Examples include: o Death in imme diate family stepparent , grandparen t, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. For attending CUSOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence request must be submitted, in writing, to the Assistant Director of the MSBS program at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipate d absence(s). To be considered for such request, students must have a cumulative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic standing. Students are allowed a maximum of two (2) excused absences per semester for voluntary a ttendance at conferences if all other excused absence criteria has been met. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . CUSOM accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any canc elled or delayed travel plans. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. 67 Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitted for approval to t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . Attendance is mandatory for laboratory (Anatomy) and select class sessions across certain MSBS courses (indicated as 100% mandatory attendance on MSBS Calendars) which require active student participation and group activities as indicated in course syllabi and by the direction of the Course Director, a separate excused absence request must be completed and submitted to the Course Director and t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . The same aforementioned criteria outlined above apply. The Assistant Director of the MSBS program will notify the Course Director of the decision if approved. Approval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a make -up with the Course Director . An unexcused absence from one of these activities may result in a grade of zero (0) or an overall grade deduction (refer to each specific course syllabus). In the event of any absence from an examination or quiz, approval must be obtained from t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program to arrange a make- up (approvals based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above ). It is essential each student make every effort not to miss any examination or quiz. Requests for make -up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program . An unexcused absence from an examination or quiz may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessment. For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program and complete the appropriate lecture or lab \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. The Assistant Director of the MSBS program will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of th e decision in a timely manner. If a student is failing any course or has been placed on Academic Probation, he/she may not be approved for an excused absence unless for an ext enuating situation determined on a case- by-case basis. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's responsibility to contact the Course Directors and the Assistant Director of the MSBS program to arrange a makeup fo r missed laboratories , course activities, or an examination/quiz where applicable. It is important to note that, although the Course Directors will do their best to accommodate the makeup requests, some missed experiences may not be able to be replicated , and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' discretion. In the case in which a missed experience is not able to be replicated , and therefore unable to be made up, the student may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, which may lead to an overall failing course grade. 68 Official Ho lidays CUSOM o bserves the f ollowing Univ ersity holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas ( Varies) Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University.

As noted above, in the cases of Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted to t he Assistant Director of the MSBS program at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the anticipated absence. Cons equences of Non-compliance of Attendance Policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The APPS Committee may consider non -compliance with the Attendance Policy by MS BS-1 and MS BS-2 students as a violation of CUSOM professionalism policy which may result in disciplinary action. APPS Committee actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, organizati on, or student government office; and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism in the student's record . In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 69 6.4.3 Severe Weather P olicy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through the Campbell University inclement weather line : On cam pus: dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: di al (910)-814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 It is recommended that students visit the Campbell University website at https://www.campbell.edu/alerts/ to sign up to receive campus alerts. In the event of a campus -wide emergency, a text message with information about the emergency and actions to take will be sent to all enrollees . 6.5 Dress C ode Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes, and workshops; this includes all on-site and virtual sessions. Men must wear appropriate business casual pants, shoes, and a collared shirt. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length for a professional setting (e.g., in the medical school or any clin ical setting) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for Anatomy labs. A clean and well -cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well - groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distrac ting to faculty, staff, or students. Shorts, jeans, sweatpants, scrubs, T -shirts, and athletic shoes are not permitted except in the Anatomy labs when appropriate. Revealing or tight, form-fitting clothing is unaccep table. Head coverings (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a head covering (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie, or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Student s inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus and not return until appropriately attired. Any class or lab missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming sha ll be presented to the Office of Student Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the APPS Committee. 70 Additional Dres s Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. Th is include s the laboratory classes of Anatomy. Anatomy Laboratory Dress C ode Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close d-toe shoes and long pants are required. Flip-flops, opened -toe shoes, shorts and spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy labs. All MSBS students have lockers on the 4th floor, near Classroom 400, where anatomy lab clothing can be stored. Students must provide their own locks and leave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the fourth floor lobby outside the laboratory. Students are not to leave their personal belongings in the fourth floor lobby. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (students provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemicals used in the laboratory). 6.6 Academic Standing and Progress 6.6.1 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's status at any time within a given academic semester of the CUSOM MSBS curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses at any given point in time and not on Academic Probation. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as conferen ces, student organizations, etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations or participate in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be consider ed. Academic Progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all s emesters in a sequential manner (i.e., all curricular 71 requirements for Year 1 Semester 1 must be satisfied before a student may start Year 1 Semester 2; Year 2 Semester 1 requirements before Year 2 Semester 2.) , successfully completing all curricular requirements in the s emesters , and meeting the requirements as set forth by the APPS Committee for students, including those in a Modified Course of Stud y (MCOS) . Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and administration. Completion of all Year 1 curricular requirements must be satisfied before a student is promoted to, and may start, Year 2 coursework. Students placed in a M COS must agree to comply with the plan as determined by the APPS Committee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the M COS , they will remain in full- time status. Students who do not follow the MCOS , or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a MCOS , may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. Second -year students should refer to S ection 6.9.1 of this Bulletin for further information regarding graduation requirements. Students not making satisfactory academic progress towards graduation will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and further recommendations, which may includ e but is not limited to, placement on a M COS , Academic Probation or Dismissal from the program. 6.7 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throughout the entire CUSOM academic program. Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), non- academic violations of the Honor Code or Code of Conduct, unprofessional conduct, or grievances . Additional information regarding these violations and corresponding procedures is found in this Bulletin at Sections 6.7.3 Honor Code, 6.7.4 Code of Conduct, and 6.10 Grievance Processes. The APPS Committee is appointed by the Dean, and membership may be subject to change at any time. The Registrar and Executive Director of Student Affairs participate as voting members. A quorum is defined as a simple ma jority of the members. The committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, may invite non- voting members to attend. APPS Committee meetings are considered academic proceedings and not legal hearings, and as such, neither attorneys nor other representatives ( e.g., healthcare providers) are allowed. 72 Faculty Recusal from APPS Committee Hearings Any CUSOM faculty member who is a health care professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student, in any CUSOM program, must recuse themselves from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. In the case of committee meetings, including, but not limited to, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee, the committee C hair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of interest , from committee members prio r to student case discussions. Any APPS C ommittee member(s) identifying a potential conflict, including a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship w ith a student, will be required to recuse themselves from both the discussion phase of the meeting as well as the decision- making process for matters in which a potential conflict exists. 6.7.1 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeti ng Regarding Academic Matters The APPS Committee meets at the end of any semester to review students who have achieved a failing course grade, failed to successfully remediate a failed course, when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or when deemed necessary. Any student who has failed a course in a semester must be available to meet in - person with the APPS Committee on Friday of Final Exam week per the Semester schedule. The Chair of the APPS Committee may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by a Leave of Absence or other factors. Students cannot request a meeting of the APPS Committee for any reason including to challenge or appeal an APPS Committee decision; appeals are handled through the Dean as outlined in Section 6.7.8 or through the Grievance procedures outlined in Section 6.10 of this Academic Bulletin. Reasons for an APPS Committee hearing include, but are not limited to , if a student has: Failed a course; Attempted and failed to remediate a course; Failed to pa ss any course while on Acad emic Probation; Failed to complete any degree or program requirements; or Failed to make acade mic progress, or follow directives set forth, in an assigned remediation plan or any Modified Course of Study. 73 Upon initial review of a referral of a student to the APPS Committee, the Chair of the APPS Committee has the discretion to determine an intermediary action, such as the student meeting with the Program Director or other designated individual , which may be warranted in an effort to resolve the issue in lieu of an APPS Committee hearing. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee have the following ro les: The Academic Advisor of the MSBS program reports on the academic progress of student(s), as necessary. The Program Director or other designated individual may submit a written or oral report documenting assistance the student has received or been offered, including, but not limited to, tutoring or advising. The Course Director, Program Director , or the student's Faculty Advisor may be invited to an APPS Committee meeting to comment on student performance and related topics, as necessary. The Executive Director of Student Affairs may report on documentation the Office of Student Affairs has which may be relevant to the student's academic progress. The Registrar is available to discuss the student's academic record, if needed. The APPS Committee Chair shall identify a secretary to record minutes and to ensure all communications occur in a timely manner. Each student reviewed by the APPS Committee is provided the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten -minute oral presentation (no PowerPoint presentations or handouts except for written reports from a medical provider) relevant to any issues or considerations the student wishes to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then directly question the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the student may be physically present. In lieu of an in- person oral presentation, the student may be allowed to phone or videoconference (e.g., Zoom or WebEx) into the APPS Committee meeting and has the option to submit a written document, no more than two pages, single -spaced. These options are only available upon approval by the Chair of the APPS Committee, pending a valid reason for not presenting in- person . Students who fail to appear at a scheduled meeting or provide a written document may be reviewed in absentia by the APPS Committee. Students are prohibited from recording (in audio or video format) any APPS or ad hoc Committee meetings or proceedings, including those held via phone or videoconference. The APPS C ommittee will not accept or consider any additional information from the student, or on behalf of the student, after the student has exited the APPS Committee meeting. 74 All sessions of the APPS Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. APPS Committee meetings are not considered legal hearings, therefore neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g., healthcare providers) are allowed to attend. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. Any APPS C ommittee member(s) identifying a potential conflict of interest, including a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a student, will be required to recuse themselves from both the discussion phase of the meeting as well as the decision -making process for matters in which a potential conflict exists. Subject to FERPA, a ll deliberat ions, minutes, findings, and recommendations of the APPS Committee functions remain confidential except where the student waives confidentiality or the release is required by law. All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Offic e of the Dean. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the decision of the APPS Committee meeting as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign and return the Notice of Decision within the timeframe defined in the letter. Policy on Student Response to CUSOM Request for Information Whenever this Academic Bulletin requires the student to provide a written response to be received by CUSOM on or before a certain date, CUSOM will not grant exceptions to t he stated deadline except in the case of a medical emergency, and in that case, the student must provide the response as soon as medically feasible. If the APPS Committee renders a decision which is considered appealable as delineated in Section 6.7.7.2 of this Bulletin, the student shall have the right to submit a written appeal of the APPS Committee decision to the Dean within five (5) business days of receipt of notification in accordance with Section 6.7.8 of this Bulletin. Note: students are not perm itted to appeal sanctions denoted as \"non - appealable\" as presented in Section 6.7.7.1 of this Bulletin . 6.7.2 Student Professionalism and Ethics Standards All CUSOM MSBS students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during the MSBS program is critical to the training of future healthcare professionals . It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards of student conduct and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM. 75 All CUSOM MSBS students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM MSBS students speak or act as private citizens, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As such, they should not identify themselves as CUSOM MSBS students when posting comments or material on websites, social media, or other forms of communica tion without the express permission of the Dean. As citizen s engaged in a profession which depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM MSBS stude nt, I will... Be guided by a deep c onviction of the w orth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the a dvancem ent of knowl edge and recognize the special responsibilitie s placed u pon m e; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly compe tence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical st andards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster hone st acade mic conduc t and ensure student evaluations reflect the stude nt's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and facul ty, stude nts and administr ation, and students and st aff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inqui ry of associates' exchange of ideas and sh ow respect for the opinions of others; and Give due regard to the paramount responsibilities within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done ou tside it. Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. Students must demonstrate respect for patients through appropriate language and behavior, including that which is non- threatening and non- judgmental. In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their families, patient privacy and modesty will be respected during history taking, physical examinations, and any other contact. It is critical for students to be truthful and not intentionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient which only the pa tient's physician should reveal. 76 Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with patients and peers, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectfu l manner when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduct. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect and obey the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local community, state and federal government. 6.7.3 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduct (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Camp bell University communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belief that every student is worthy of trust and it is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic environment free from injustice caused by dishonesty. Furth er, CUSOM MSBS students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner. Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity. It is not possible to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the standards of a CUSOM MSBS student. The following serves only as a guideline to students. In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution where CUSOM MSBS students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of these rules and regulations may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior which may constitute a 77 violation of the CUSOM Honor Code include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating: Providing , acquiring or receiving any unauthori zed assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing inf ormation f rom testing/exams is also conside red a form of cheating. Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or comput er code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof. Falsification: Fabrication of in formation on a ny form of academic work or attempt the reof; including, but not limited to, the f ollowin g: o Clinical and community service requirements; or o Assignments, projects, and presentations Disruptive Behavior : Any inapp ropriate etiquette or inappr opriate disturbance either solely or repeated often enough oft en enough to establis h a disrespectful trend.

Unacceptable use of technolog y: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as publ ished by the CU SOM IT department or as noted in the Campbell University Technology Usage Policy: https://www.campbell.edu/information -technology - services/acceptable- use-policy/ In addition, unaccept able uses of technolog y include, but are not limited to, the following: o Using compute rs for pur poses which are conside red unprofessional or i mmoral ; o Accessi ng pornographic material at any time while on any campus of the CUSOM community or using any equipm ent of the CUSOM community to acc ess such material; o Distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside CUSOM is an Honor Code violation. Lecture materials, 78 includi ng PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confide ntial and proprietary info rmation and material protected by intellectual p roperty laws. Students do not ha ve permission to sha re them.; or o Any device capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings, including cell phones, are not permitted in any laboratory (anatomy ), or in any clinical setting, including and not limited to standardized patients, the student health clinic , and other clinical experiences . Unprofessional or unethical behavior : Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending student or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, colleagues, or the-communi ty-at-large. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include, but is not limited to , the following: Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without appropri ate authori zation or during inappropri ate times; Knowingly and purpos ely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student func tions of the CUSOM community; Abusive or disrespectful conduc t toward members of the faculty, administrative or pro fessional staff, employees, students, patients, or visitors of the CUSOM communi ty. Medical simulators should be treated with the same level of respect and professionalism as standardized or actual patients ; Disclosure of privil eged information from campus activities or patient care; Taking pictures or recording video in the anatomy lab, clinical lab, OSCE rooms, or in any rooms housing clinical simulators; Impro per relationships or activities invol ving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may inclu de, but are not limited to, patients or othe r stud ents unde r supervisio n; Controlled substance screening tests which show abnormalities including, but not limited to , excessively dilute urine, or screening tests which are positive (i.e., evidence of the substance or showing presence) for alcohol, prescription medications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Cont rolled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. o As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. 79 o Anothe r example is a br eathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentr ation sample identi fying lev els of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or a similar charge. o The presence of these subs tances, regardless of any legal consid erations or adjudi cation by the courts, is c onsid ered unprofessional or u nethical behavior b y CUSOM . Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is consid ered a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the professional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community; or A violation of any policy of the Univ ersity or CUSOM .

Please note this include s substances which are illegal in t he state of North Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states; or Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of re spect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M. 80 6.7.5 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Non -Academic Matters Reasons for an APPS/ ad hoc Committee hearing/meeting for non -academic matters include, but are not limited to, allegations that the student has : Violated the CUSOM Honor Code or Code of C onduct; Violate d any CUSOM or Campbell Unive rsity policy/procedure or provision of this Bulletin; Failed a c ontrolled substance screening test; Failed to maintain required vaccinations as scheduled; Received f indings on a criminal backg round check that would affect the student's matriculation or potential ability to participate a clinical rotation; Failed to adhere to set timelines/due dates; Failed to update contact information; or Failed to respond in timely manner to email and other forms of communication from CUSOM. Allegations of misconduct may arise from an individual student, group of students, faculty member, clinical preceptor, staff member, or member of the community. For issues arising from Honor Code, Code of C onduct, or professionalis m or ethics violations, the person(s) identifying the issue(s) should report the issue(s) to the Executive Director of Student Affairs or the MSBS Program Director within five (5) business days of the issue(s) or becoming aware of the issue(s ). The Executive Director of Student Affairs or MSBS Program Director will collect documentation which may be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include, but is not limited to, a written report from the student(s), faculty or staff involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are reporting the suspected violation, unless required at a hearing, waived by the subject(s) of the alleged violation, or required by law, confidentiality of the reporting student is maintained, and the Execut ive Director of Student Affairs or MSBS Program Director will present the reporting student(s)'s testimony. Dated notes are taken to describe the discussion. The Executive Director of Student Affairs or MSBS Program Director notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected misconduct or violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinica l Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. 81 If forwarded to the APPS Committee pursuant to Section 6.7.6, the recommendations of the ad hoc committee or the decision of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs are presented to the APPS Committee at the hearing. The student( s) shall meet with the APPS Committee and be informed of the allegations and afforded an opportunity to explain him/herself and offer any mitigating factors. All sessions of the Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in th e case. APPS Committee meetings are not considered legal hearings, therefore neither attorneys nor other representatives (e.g., healthcare p roviders) are allowed to attend . Faculty Recusal from APPS Committee Hearings Any CUSOM faculty member who is a health professional with a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a CUSOM student, in any CUSOM program, must recuse herself/himself from all activities involving the summative assessment, grading, and promotion of that student. In the case of committee meetings, including, but not limited to, the Academic Performance, Progress and Standards (APPS) Committee or ad hoc committees, the committee Chair (or designee) will call for a declaration of any conflict of interest, from committee me mbers prior to student case discussions. Any APPS Committee or ad hoc Committee member(s) identifying a potential conflict, including a previous or ongoing therapeutic relationship with a student, will be required to recuse themselves from both the discus sion phase of the meeting as well as the decision -making process for matters in which a potential conflic t exists. APPS Committee Proceedings All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case.

If the student does not appeal within five (5) business days of receipt of notification, the Vice Dean's decision is final. 6.7.7 APPS Committee Sanctions Penalties or sanctions for violation of institutional policies or rules and regulations may be administered regardless of whether the actions of the student also constitute civil or criminal violations. Whenever disciplinary actions lead to the student le aving CUSOM, grades are assigned in accordance with the CUSOM grading policy. All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. Depending on the nature of the hearing, the following is a non- exclusive list of sanct ions the APPS Committee may recommend to the Dean or require to be imposed: 6.7.7.1. Non-appealable APPS Committee Sanctions The APPS Committee may impose a sanction, which is not appealable to the Dean, for students failing to make academic progress due to the following: Failure of two or more courses in any academic term; Failure to successfully remediate a failed course is considered an additional course/rotation failure; Failure of three or more total courses in one year of the curriculum; Failure of any course while in a Modified Course of Study; Failure of any course while on Academic Probation; Failure to successfully complete any curricular requirements; or Any other issues similar to the foregoing and deemed relevant. 85 In addition to imposing sanc tions for failure to make academic progress, the Committee may review student progress in order to remove students from Academic Warning, Academic Probation, or Suspension.

While on Conduct Probation a student is not eligible to serve as a Student Government, club or organization officer, serve on a CUSOM committee, attend an off -campus conference/meeting, or serve as a Tutor. Additional sanctions may be instituted based on the severity of the circumstance(s) leading to the Probation. Conduct Probation carries with it a warning that any further violations of CUSOM regulations will result in more serious disciplinary action up to, and including, dismissal. Conduct Probation will appear on the student's official transcript. 6.7.7.2. Appealable APPS Committee Sanctions The APPS Committee may also recommend to the Dean Suspension or Dismissal of a student from the program when the APPS Committee determines the student is unable to make academic progress due to, but not limited to , any of the following: Failure of two or more courses in any one semester in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum; Failure of three or more total courses in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum; Failure of any course while in a Modified Course of Study; Failure of any course while on Academic Probation; Failure to successfully remediate a failed course is considered an additional course/rotation failure; or Any other issues deemed relevant.

Any medical, psychological, or personal information, known to the student at t he time of the APPS Committee meeting must be divulged at the time of the APPS meeting in order to be considered and, if not divulged at that time, cannot be used by the student lat er as the basis of any appeal. Dean's Review of an Appeal The Dean will reply within ten (10) business days of receiving the written appeal. An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern five (5) business days after receipt of notification will not be considered, and the decision rendered by the APPS Committee is final. 89 While not required, the Dean may request a meeting with the student as part of the appeal process. The student must make no attempt to meet with the Dean to appeal an APPS Committee recommendation unless the D ean requests a meeting prior to making a decision on the student's written appeal. No legal counsel shall be present at an appeal meeting with the Dean as these meetings are not legal proceedings. The Dean's decision is final. 6.7.9 Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, inclu ding written reprim ands, are securely maintain ed in a confide ntial file. Such actions become a part of the student 's permanent educat ion record but are only released at the written disc retion of the D ean. Additional information regarding Educational Records is provided in Section 6.3 of this Bulletin. 6.8 Separation from the Program 6.8.1 Separation from CUSOM There are four (4) categories of separation from CUSOM: Leave of Absence Withdrawal Suspension Dismissal The Dean makes all final decisions regarding any separation from CUSOM. All current or former students returning from an approved period away from CUSOM MSBS (such as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year), must submit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen which typically follows these timelines and associated requirements: Separation from CUSOM of 1- 44 days: Supplemental application may be required Background check and controlled substance screen may be required All required documents must be received no earlier than 15 calendar days and no later than 7 calendar days prior to the anticipated return date For example, a stud ent returning from a 30- day Leave of Absence on July 1st must submit the required documentation between June 15th and June 23rd. 90 Separation from CUSOM of 45- 89 days: Supplemental Application, background check, and controlled substance screen must be recei ved no earlier than 30 calendar days and no later than 7 calendar days prior to the anticipated return date For example, a student returning from a 60- day Leave of Absence on July 1st must submit the required documentation between June 1st and June 23rd. Separation from CUSOM of 90 days or longer: Supplemental Application, background check, and controlled substance screen must be received no earlier than 60 calendar days and no later than 7 calendar days prior to the anticipated return date For example, a student returning from a 120 -day Leave of Absence on July 1st must submit the required documentation between May 2nd and June 23rd. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be required of returning students as deemed appr opriate. The Executive Committee of the CUSOM Admissions Committee, consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will determine whether or not the student has met the requirements to return. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full Admissions Committee to participate. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the re quirements for return, will need to re -apply through PostBacCAS and may not be guaranteed re -admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full APPS Committee to participate. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume at a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSB S curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 91 6.8.1.1 Accommodation Requests following return from a Separation All students, including those returning from any Separation from CUSOM lasting more than 180 days (including but not limited to Withdrawal, Academic Leave of Absence, Suspension, or return to repeat an academic year) requesting accommodations must follow the process as outlined in Section 7.2.3 of this Bulletin . Students returning from a Separation from CUSOM, who are requesting accommodations, must contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs to request services as soon as possible and identify their request in the \"Request for Accommodations\" sec tion of the CUSOM Supplemental Application. This applies to a request to receive the same accommodations that were previously granted by CUSOM or a request to receive new accommodations upon return from a Separation from CUSOM. The University is not responsible for identifying students with disabilities and is not required to provide services unless proper procedures have been followed in making a request. As noted above, accommodations are not provided retroactively. 6.8.1.2 Modified Schedule In rare instances, a student may need to enter a Modified Schedule, which does not require a Leave of Absence, usually due to a brief acute illness, or personal emergency. In such cases, the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs and the MSBS Academic Officer will develop a proposed Modified Schedule with the student which is subsequently approved by the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee. 6.8.2 Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A leave of absence is a temporary separation fr om CUSOM which may not last longer than 180 calendar days. Reasons for a leave include, but are not limited to, academic, personal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds 180 calendar days, it will become a Withdrawal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Executive Director of Student Affairs, who then provides it to the Dean. A Leave of Absence request must also include an anticipated date of return. The Dean in turn m akes the final determination on the Leave of Absence request. 92 In addition, a Leave of Absence request requires completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of t he Leave of Absence. The date for a Leave of Absence is the date of the Dean's approval of the Leave of Absence request. Process for returning from an approved period away from CUSOM of less than 180 days : 1. The Executive Committee of the CUSOM Admissions Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members, will determine whether or not the student has met the requirements to return. In cases in which there is a potential conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full Admissions Committee to participate. 2. Once approved for return, the Executive Committee of the APPS Committee consisting of the Chair, two Vice -Chairs and at least two other members will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved Academic Leave of Absence to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. In cases in which there is a potenti al conflict of interest or two of the above members are not available, the Dean may designate another member of the full APPS Committee to participate. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a spec ific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the MSBS curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 3. Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throug h PostBacCAS and may not be guaranteed re-admission. 6.8.2.1 Academic Leave of Absence An Academic Leave of Absence is a unique situation, usually of a one-year duration, which allows students to pursue a research opportunity or complete a one -year post -secondary degree. Upon completion of this additional educational, experiential activity or scholarly pursuit, the st udent minimally must submit a compl eted Supplemental Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, as described in Section 6.8.1. 93 In order to return from any approved Academic Leave of Absence, the stude nt must provide doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Academic Leave of Absence and an anticipated date of return as described in Section 6.8.1. The letter from the Dean approving an Academic Leave of Absence will delineate any specific outcomes required upon return from the leave, such as a list of abstracts, publications, grants submitted, letter from the supervising research mentor, or other tangible evidence of productivity resulting from the leave. 6.8.2.2 Personal L eave of Absence A Personal Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean and may not last longer than 180 calendar days. A Personal Leave of Absence is available to address situations such as a death of a spouse, child, or such other circumstance that would int errupt a student's education. A Personal Leave of Absence lasting longer than 180 days will automatically become a Personal Withdrawal. In order to return from any approved Personal Leave of Absence, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leave of Absence, including an anticipated date of return as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.2.3 Med ical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a valid medical reason requiring a leave of less than 180 calendar days and an anticipated date of return. Decisions regarding the granting of a medical leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days; if the leave extends beyond 180 calendar days it will automatically become a Medical Withdrawal as described below. In order to return fro m an approved medical leave, the student must provide the Dean with documentation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.2.4 Student Maternity Leave of Absence A Student Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a need to take a leave of absence because of their pregnancy. 94 The required period of leave may include time before the delivery, after delivery, or both. This documentation must include an estimated date of delivery or, if a leave must be continued beyond delivery, the date delivery occurred. A student returning from a Student Maternity Leave of Absence must provide a letter from their treating physician clearing them to return to CUSOM on a full -time unrestricted basis. Decisions regarding the granting of a maternity leave are determined by the Dean. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file a request for a Medical Withdrawal. Return from a Maternity Leave of Absence In order to return from a Maternity Leave of Absence, a student must provide a medical note from her medical provider indicating the definitive date of return the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full- time student, with no restrictions. If the treating medical provider places an activity or time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) a nd the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Returning students must also complete and submit any additional requirements as delineated in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. 6.8.2.5 Parental Leave of Absence CUSOM may grant leave for students whose significant other gives birth or adopts a child while enrolled in the curriculum. A Parental Leave of Absence may be granted on a case -by-case basis. Students requesting a parental leave of absence must be in good academic standing and pro vide appropriate documentation. A Parental Leave of Absence may be up to four (4) weeks for non - birth parents following the birth, or adoption, of a child. Students unable to return from a Parental Leave of Absence within four (4) weeks will be required to request a Personal Leave of Absence, which may last up to a total of 180 days. A Personal Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file a reque st for a Personal Withdrawal. 95 Students requesting a Pare ntal Leave of Absence must complete the following requirements: Meet with the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS BS-1 and MS BS-2) and the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated Parental Leave. Provide the Executive Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of the requested leave. Schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Office of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office as part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's financial aid. Following the birth or adoption, the non- birth parent will provide the Office of Student Affairs with an anticipated return -to-school date, not to exceed 4 -weeks from the beginning of the leave. Students unabl e to return from a Parental Leave of Absence by four (4) weeks will be required to request a Personal Leave of Absence as delineated previously. 6.8.3 Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM, which may last longer than 180 calendar days or permanent separation from CUSOM. Reasons for a withdrawal include, but are not limited to, personal and medical. Any request for Withdrawal must be completed prior to beginning the first final c ourse assessment (e.g., exam) of a semester. Failure to withdraw by this date may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Semester , which will be recorded on the student's transcript and adversely affect the student's GPA. A student ma y not withdraw if a grade has been assigned or if a final examination or assessment event has been started. If approved, withdrawal from a course after an examination has been administered, will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F . A Withdrawal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Executive Director of Student Affairs, who then provides it to the Dean. The student must schedule meetings and acquire signatures from the Office of Financial Aid and the Bursar's Office as part of their leave process to avoid any ambiguity with the effect the leave may have on a student's financial aid. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Withdrawal request. 96 The student must complete and return a Withdrawal Form and if approved, any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of Student Affairs before the student will be considered Withdrawn in Good Standing. The date for a Withdrawal is the date of the Dean's approval of the Withdrawal request. The Dean makes the final decision regarding Withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal Form. Upon receipt of the completed Withdrawal Form and CUSOM issued items, the student is Withdrawn in Good Standing from CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits (i.e., application for readmission or issuance of an official transcript if requested). However, st udents who fail to withdraw prior to beginning the first final course assessment (e.g., exam) of a semester resulting in the issuance of a grade of \"F\" on any course(s) within a semester , may withdraw, but they would no longer be in good academic standing. Students on Suspension are not enrolled students. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal from CUSOM, minimally must submit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CU SOM, as described in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal are required to provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal as described in Section 6.8.1. NOTE: Although different categories of Withdrawal are identified, the student transcript will reflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 6.8.3.1 Personal Wit hdrawal A Personal Withdrawal may be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM for personal reasons are not guaranteed re-admission. To be deemed Withdrawn in Good Standing, the student must have passed all classes, and be in good academic standing, complete all required paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process. 97 Students eligible to return from a Personal Withdrawal minimally must su bmit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM as delineated in Section 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. The student may also be required to provide the Dean with additional docum entation verifying completion of the terms of the approved withdrawal as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.3.2 Academic Wit hdrawal An Academic Withdrawal may be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM after encountering academic difficulties, including a failed course(s). Students withdrawing from CUSOM for academic reasons are not guaranteed re -admission, are not considered to be in good academic standing, must complete all required paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures duri ng the withdrawal process. 6.8.3.3 Med ical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an approved medical reason for a medical leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. A student returning from an approved Medical Withdrawal minimally must submit a completed Supplemental Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM as delineated in Sectio n 6.8.1 of this Bulletin. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medical Withdrawal, the student must also provide the Dean with documentation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum as described in Section 6.8.1. 6.8.4 Special Meet ings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who is returning from an approved Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, or Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Reco mmendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume at a specific point in the curriculum. 98 6.8.5 Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution during which time students are not enrolled, not registered and are not eligible for financial aid . The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recommendations from the APPS Committee. While on Suspension, students must not represent themselves as CUSOM MSBS students. In addition, they are not permitted to be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuses, participate in any clinical activities or wear their CUSOM white coat. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled, or the period of Suspension is greater than 180 calendar days, the student will be dismissed from CUSOM. 6.8.6 Dismissal The Dean makes the final decision on all student dismissals and his/her decision is not appealable. 6.9 Graduation 6.9.1 Graduation Requirements The degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences is granted to, and conferred upon, candidates who have : Satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation; Demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; and Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM, Campbell University and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the academic program. To become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all the above requirements within four (4 ) years following matriculation. The four (4) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academ ic, behavioral or other leave of absence. The Dean may, in exceptional circumstances, grant an extension to this 4- year rule. Professional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualitie s deemed necessary for professional success. Students may be dismissed from the MSBS program if any of these competencies are not met. 99 In addition, the revocation of the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree may occur following graduation for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean. A student must complete all curricular requirements at CUSOM MSBS , between the date of matriculation and graduation. A CUSOM MSBS student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determined by the individual C ourse Directors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and degree requirements to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee or Vice Dean recommendations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Committee or Vice Dean at the time of the initial hearing and d eliberation. Students must meet with Financial Aid and to complete all required exit documentation, including financial aid and debt counseling, in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM MSBS students must also attend the exit process in order to receive a diploma. Upon passage of coursework , and all other requirements as delineated in this Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation. 6.9.2 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is suspended, takes a Leave of Absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course failures or a deficiency in overall academic performance, the student will be placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) . As discussed in Section 6.6.2 of this Academic Bulletin, a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The institution of a MCOS will result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's graduation date. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression ma y affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education -based financial aid. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid for these or other indicat ed situations. 100 6.10 Grievance Processes 6.10.1 Resolution and Grievance Proced ure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the student to express their concerns in a professional and ethical manner. Concerns may involve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Committee, promotion, behavioral issues, financial concerns or issues related to external (e.g. , COCA, SACSCOC) accreditation standards and procedures. This grievance process shall not be used to appeal or review violations of the Honor Code or an appeal from the APPS Committee final decisio n by the Dean or the APPS Committee. All grievances must be filed in writing to the CUSOM Office of the Dean. All grievance material is securely maintained in the Dean's Office in a specific student/employee/faculty file as appropriate to the grievance. Each step of the Resolution and Grievance Procedure generally takes fourteen (14) calendar days to complete, unless otherwise noted. Extensions or waivers to this timeframe may be granted on a case- by-case basis. Notice of a request for an extension from a student must be submitted in writing to the Dean within ten (10) calendar days prior to the deadline. Decisions regarding the request for an extension shall be communicated to the student via letter within two (2) business days of receipt of the reques t for an extension. Likewise, if CUSOM needs to extend a deadline, the Office of the Dean shall provide said notice ten (10) calendar days before the due date. 6.10.2 Grievance for Academic Re solutions, Course Procedures, Grading Policies, and CUSOM Policies and Procedures 6.10.2 .1 Academic Issues An individual concern of an academic nature should be first discussed with the immediate instructor or preceptor and must be done in a professional manner. This concern generally includes those which arise from personal conflicts or actions taken against a student individually. For individual concerns, if resolution cannot be reached, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal, in writing to the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs . If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with a student if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. 101 A concern over general course procedures or grading policies should be addressed through the Class Representative (s) to the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs . If a resolu tion cannot be reached through the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, the Class Representative(s) may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs. If resolut ion cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the Class Representative (s) may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class Representative if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. Reminder : Course Assessment policies and test question challenges are not covered under student grievances. See course -specific syllabi for information regarding these issues. 6.10.2.2 CUSOM Policies and Procedures A concern over CUSOM policies and procedures should be addressed through the Class Representative(s) and the Executive Director of Student Affairs . If through the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, a resolution cannot be reached, the Class Representative (s) may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class Representative(s) if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. If the concern is financial, or with other areas of CUSOM, the student should follow the appropriate chain of command as defined by the CUSOM Organizational Chart. 6.10.3 Grievance Proced ure for Harassm ent or Discrimination Students who believe they have the right to exercise a grievance as described in Section 6.10.1, or an academic grievance not described in Section 6.10.2, (hereinafter a \"Grievance\") shall use the Grievance Procedure as hereinafter set forth. Retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process is strictly prohibited. I n the event a student or anyone who participated in the grievance process believes they have been subjected to retaliation, that individual may use the Harassment Grievance procedures listed below. 102 Step One: The Resolution Process Students who meet the Technical Standards for admission to CUSOM as described in this Academic Bulletin, and feel they have a Grievance shall first meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to explain their grievance.

After the investigation period of seven (7) calendar days, the student filing the Grievance, and the person against whom the Grievance is filed shall meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to discuss an informal resolution. This meeting shall be scheduled within fourteen (14) calendar days of the initial filing of the Grievance. A letter confirming the mutual decisions of the resolution shall be distributed, within ten (10) calendar days of the meeting, to all persons and kept within the permanent student and or employee files for possible future issues that may arise with the resolution. If the Executive Director of Student Affairs determines there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, he/she may close the Grievance and shall notify the student, within fourteen (14) calendar days, of his/her findings and inform the student of their right to request a Grievance Hearing. The Executive Director of Student Affairs shall keep a record of the grievance investigation, including all supporting documentation and a report of the findings. All material shall be filed as previously stated in this procedur e. Step Two: The Grievance Hearing Process If the student feels the informal resolution has not been successful, or disagrees with the informal resolution, he/she may request the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Dean to call a Grievance Hearing. The student has thirty (30) calendar days after receiving written notice of denial of the Grievance to request such a hearing. 103 The request must be in writing, signed by the student, and include the following information: A clear and precise stat ement of the G rievance; A statement explaining how the action is discrimin atory or the decision unr easonable if it is a denial of a requested accom modatio n; The n ame the r esponde nt pa rties (the p erson(s)) against whom the Grievance is filed); An explanation of each responde nt respons ible for the action or decision; The requested re medy; and Any request to bring a non-participating observer to the heari ng.

Student and Services 7.1 Student Health 7.1.1 Student Health CUSOM students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for confidential diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic medical services and personal health concerns. All personal medical information is kept confidential in compliance with HIPAA regulations. The Campbell University Health Center office hours can be found on the H ealth Center website: https://www.campbe ll.edu/health-center/ For medical emergencies and after -hours healthcare, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warranted by their situation including local Urgent Care facilities, Emergency Departments and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911- dispatch s ystem. 7.1.2 Health Insurance All students are required to have health insurance at the time of matriculation and maintain health insurance coverage through graduation. Students are required to either enroll in Campbell University's health insu rance plan or provide proof of active health insurance coverage obt ained through another company. Before registration and before the beginning of class annually, all students must either provide proof of health insurance and sign the Campbell University insurance waiver, or purchase the health insurance made available through Campbell University. Information on Campbell University Student Health Insurance can be found using the following link: https://www. campbell.edu/students/student-health-insurance/ 7.1.3 Vaccinations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all vaccination requirements through graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM MSBS curriculum and program requirements . Descriptions of CUSOM vaccination and testing requirements , including those addressing Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Hepatitis B, Influenza, and COVID -19 and Tuberculosis are presented in Section 3.10.1 of this Bulletin . 109 All incoming and current students must log all vaccination requirements on the standard AAMC Standard Immunization Form, available at: https://www.aamc.org/download/440110/data/immunizationform.pdf This form must be completed in its entirety and signed by a physician or qualified healthcare provider verifying the required information. In addition, students are required to submit support ing documentation such as vaccination records and titers. Important Notes Regarding Vaccination Requirements - See Section 3.10.1 Additional vaccinations may be required in order to be in compliance with the CCCC EMT training program, MSBS students are expected to meet those requirements. CUSOM does not waive vaccination or student health requirements for religious, medical or personal preferences. CUSOM may revise the vaccination requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with subsequent changes. 7.1.4 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controll ed substance screeni ng of learners and sta ff memb ers is mandatory at most healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. As such, a controll ed substance screeni ng test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substa nces, prescription me dications without a valid prescription, or substances classified as illegal in the state of No rth Carolin a, is required before matriculation into the . Addit ional screening or confirmato ry ay be required as determined by CUSOM . CUSOM reserves the right to require controll ed substance testing or a mental health evaluation of any student whe n there is an incident of erratic or unusual behavior or there is a reasona ble conce rn due to appear ance, or pe rformance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplina ry action up to, and includin g, dismissal from the program. Students found to have screening tests posit ive for alcohol, illicit substances, and control led substances (define d as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controll ed Substances A ct (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medi cations without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplina ry action up to, and including , dismissal. Please note this also includ es substances classified as illegal in the state of North Carolin a but which m ay be legal in other states. For examp le, althoug h the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the US Federa l Drug En forceme nt Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. 110 CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks, which may include charges of Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or similar offenses. Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Backg round checks revealing prior crimin al activity, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences or employment oppor tunities. 7.1.5 Medical Emergencies The safety of students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utilization of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provision of the most timely, efficient, and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopathic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in the domain of medical education. While many capable and compassionate healthcare providers ar e present on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance in a life- threatening emergency, these individuals should not be consulted to make treatment or disposition recommendations in non- emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be evaluated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS), which is activated by dialing 9 -1-1. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers fro m a medical emergency, the person of first contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Following activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and is responsible for contacting EMS to confirm t he need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of the patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security will complete and maintain an incident report form for any sit uation in which EMS is called to provide assistance even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment or transport. Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an injury during a CUSOM activity while on campus, the student must comple te an incident report, and call or go to the Campbell University Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from the Campbell University Health Center (910) 893- 1560. If the accident occurs at a clinical training faci lity, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical supervisor, the Office of Clinical Affairs , and the CUSOM Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs 111 should be contacted immediately for assistance. A copy of the facility's inciden t report must be sent to: Campbell University Health Center P.O. Box: 565 129 T.T. Lanier St. Buies Cr eek, NC 27506 7.2 Behavioral Health Confidential counseling services and mental health care, including access to a mental health representative, are available 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a-week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offere d by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) under the leadership of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Director (https://me dicine.campbell.edu/behavioral-health ) and StudentLinc, a 24/7/365 student assistance program offering wrap -around psychosocial support services.

The law states that a person with a \" disabil ity\" is: \"Someone with a physical or ment al impairm ent which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairm ent; or a person who is regard ed as having suc h an impairm ent.\" ( Section 50 4 of the Rehabilitation A ct of 1973) Equal educa tional opport unity me ans a person with a disabilit y who is qualified for admission must have access to the same university programs, services, and activities as all other students. If necessary to provide equal opportunity, Campbell will make reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue adminis trative or financial burden. Under the provisions of Section 504, unive rsities may not discriminate in the recruitme nt, admission, educat ional process, or treatment of students. S tudents who have self-identifie d, provide d document ation of disabili ty, and requested reasonable accom modations are entitled to receive approved modi fications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educat ional progra ms and activities. Section 504 specifies unive rsities may not limit the number of students with disabilit ies admitted, make preadmissions inqui ries as to wh ether or not an applicant has a disabi lity, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure the academ ic qua lifications of students with disabilit ies because special provisions were not mad e, exclude a qualified student with a disabilit y from any course of study, or establis h rul es and pol icies th at may adversely affect studen ts wi th disabili ties. In support of its commitment to provide equal educational oppor tunity, Campbell provide s a variety of services and accom modations to students with document ed disabilit ies. 114 Campbell Univ ersity's Student Guide for Accessin g Disability Services can be accessed here. Questions or comments about this manual should be directed to: Laura Rich Director of Disability Services Student Services, CUSOM will make reasonable accommodations as required by law for students whose disabilities will not prevent them from successfully completing the entire CUSOM curriculum and graduating (Section 3.5 of this Bulletin). Applicants who do not meet the Techn ical Standards and Vaccination Requirements should not apply to CUSOM. Matriculating or Cur rent CUSOM MSBS Students with 7.2.3.1 Section I: W to C ontact Students with doc ument ed disabili ties who de sire mod ifications or accom modations must contact the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs : Jennifer Parrish O'Dell , MEd CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine H all of M edical Sciences, Room without approval through the University's pro cess. A medi cal, psycholog ical or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabilit y if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. 7.2.3.2 Section II: Ho w to Obtain Services For any student deemed eligible, CUSOM provides accommodations or modifications to policies and practices in order to ensure that all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and activities. The purpose of accommodations is to provide access and equal educational opportunity for all students. 115 Accommodations are not provided retroactively. Any student approved for accommodations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date the approval is given. Even if the student can establish he/she had a disability at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expunge or re -examine coursework completed before the student was reviewed and approved for accommodation(s). No student is required to disclose his or her disability to the University. However, as discussed above, any student who discloses and receives approved accommod ations after he/she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accommodations on work completed before the approval for accommodations was made. Documentation of a student's disability is only shared with relevant CUSOM faculty, staff or ad ministration on a need- to-know basis with a release of information signed by the student. General Procedur e for Receiving Acco mmodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs to request services as soon as poss ible. The Unive rsity is not responsible for identi fying students with disabilit ies and is not required to provide s ervices unless prope r pro cedures have been follow ed in ma king a request. Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who consul ts with the Director of Disability Services to provide document ation of the disability and to com plete the a pprop riate paperwork. Step 3: The Executive Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting doc ument ation, if neede d. The process of review d epends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accom modations are made on a case-by-case basis. There is no stand ard accom modation for any particular disability . CUSOM will make r eason able modifi cations to its policies, practices and procedu res, unless doing so would funda ment ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or fin ancial bu rden. Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approve d, the Executive Director of Student Affairs generates a Letter of Accom modation (LOA) do cumenting the student 's individual, approve d accom modations. The O ffice of Students Affairs coordi nates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accom modations are not approve d is encouraged to meet with the Executive 116 Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Executive Dire ctor may discuss the g rievanc e procedure with the student at this time. Service Animal Information According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individually trained to work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability \". \"This includes , but is not limited to, guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals to an impending seizure or protecting individuals during one, alerting individuals who are hearing impaired to intruders, pulling a wheelchair and fetching dropped items\". Providing comfort or support does not qualify an animal as a service animal. If there are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, the Executive Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Di sability Services will make this determination . In compliance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all buildings on campus and may attend any class, meeting, or other event. Service animals are expected to exhibit reasonable behavior while on cam pus. The owners of disruptive and aggressive service animals will be asked to remove them from university facilities. If the improper behavior happens repeatedly, the owner will be told not to bring the service animal into any facility until they take significant steps to mitigate the behavior. Emotional support animals are animals that provide comfort and relieve symptoms of mental health disorders. Emotional support animals are not allowed in campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasonable accommodation and will be included in the student's Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from CUSOM. The CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affai rs can provide further information. Cleanliness of any approved service or emotional support animal on campus is mandatory. Consideration of others must be taken into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to cl ean up and dispose of all animal waste. If the service or emotional support animal becomes a disruption to other students, the animal must be removed to a location which does not cause a disruption to the education of other students. 117 Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed under the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.

Identify him/herself to the Executive Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accom modations. CUSOM is not respons ible for identi fying students with disabilit ies or for contacting such students to begin the accom modation request process. 2. Provide document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines. If the student's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for pursuing whatever additional document ation is required and to pa y any costs thereof. CUSOM r eserves the r ight not to provide services or accommodations until all of the documen tation specified in the guidelines is provided. 118 3. Any student approved for accommodations is r espons ible for retrieving his or he r Letter of A ccom modation (LOA) and Release of Information Form fr om the Executive Director of Student Affairs or available a t: https://cuweb.wuf oo.com/forms/cusom -release-of-information/ Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommodations Testing accommodations require frequent communication between the MSBS student and the Assistant Director of the MSBS program . It is very important that testing information be shared with these offices in a timely manner. At the beginning of the semester, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled quiz and exam, the student should discuss with the Assistant Director of the MSBS program all approve d testing accommodations. This discussion should address the questions of how, when and where the Assistant Director of the MSBS program will provide the testing accommodations. The student should make sure to have a calendar and a copy of the LOA with h im/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Assistant Director of the MSBS program of their need for accommodations at least one week prior to each quiz/exam. If at any time you feel that the MSBS program is not adequately meeting your accommodations, discuss this with the Assistant Director of the MSBS program and the Executive Director of Student Affairs immediately. Remember, the MSBS program is only required to provide accommodations specifically listed in the Letter of Accommodation. Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on campus must maintain state-issued handicap parking permits. The student is also required to purchase an appropriate parking sticker from the Campbell University Department of Campus Safety. If a student has consistent problems finding necessary handicapped parking near his/her class buildings, notify the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Campbell University Department of Campus Safety immediately. 119 7.2.3.4 Section IV: Doc umenting a Disability General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure reasonable and appropriate services and accom modations are provid ed to students with disabilit ies, students requesting such accom modations and services must provide current document ation of their disability . S uch documentation gene rally must include the f ollowin g: A clear diagnosti c statement of the disability prepared by a licensed prof essional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activit y and the s everity of the limitation It is the responsibility of the student requesting the accommodations and services to document the disability. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursuant to these guidelines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modifications to previously approved accommodations. The student will have to provide current supporting documentation for review at that time. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to supplement documentation, but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone. Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and other wise legible, a nd be comprised of the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qualified pro fessional who conduc ted the a ssess ment should be gin the r eport. Please note that memb ers of the stude nt's family and CUSOM faculty and staff a re not conside red appropri ate evaluato rs. Recen t Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate information about the stude nt's current lev el of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or compl ete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administe red, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e., domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. 120 Informal assessment, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan may help to supplement a more comprehensive test battery but are generally insufficient documentation when presented alone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful and should be included in the report. The summary should integrate the elements of the battery with background information, observations of the client during the testing situation, and the student's current academic situation. This summary should present evidence of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakness are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disability diagnosis. It should also demonstrate that the evaluator has r uled out alternative explanations for the learning problem. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discussed. This summary may include recommended accommodations, but these are in no way binding to the University. CUSOM reserves the right to evaluate all documentation and determine appropriate accommodations in each case. 7.2.3.5 Section V: Grievance Proced ure for Accommodations All reques ts for accom modations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs . Problem s with approve d accomm odations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs . If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs , the student and the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs should forward the compla int to the Director of Disability Services for an informal resolut ion. The Director of Disability Services will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs within ten ( 10) business d ays of receiv ing the compla int. If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the Director of Disability Services, the student and the Director of Disability Services should forward the complaint to the Vice President for Student Life for an informal resolution. The VP will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Disability Services within ten (10) business days of receiving the compla int. In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file complaint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the issue involves denial of an academic accommodation. 121 Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed. 7.3 Clubs and Organizations 7.3.1 Student Clubs and Organizations Student clubs and organizations are a very important part of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) and the MSBS program . The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but also the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, s kills, and experience. Many MSBS students are actively involved in at least one organization, and some students are members of several. MSBS Year 2 students may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional or national level; MSBS Year 1 students can be members . The goals of student clubs and organizations relate to the Mission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. As such, the following are the endorsed student clubs and organizations at CUSOM: Christian Medical and De ntal Association (CMDA) Graduate Chapter S tudent National Medical Association (SNMA) Minority Association of Pre -Medical Students (MAPS) Graduate Level Pre- SOMA, a division of the Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) The above list may not be all-inclusive and is subject to change at any time. MSBS can be invited to attend CUSOM medical student club activities, but cannot hold membership within those medical school clubs. Grade Requirements Students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale as calcul ated at the end of each grading period, no c ourse failures, and be in good academic standing in order to: Serve as a MSBS Class Representative ; Serve as a CUSOM MSBS club or organization officer; Serve on a MSBS committe e; Attend any off-camp us conference/meeting; Serve as a tutor and/or; Participate in research. Students may enter leadership roles beginning at the conclusion of Year 1. The cumulative GPA of each student wishing to participate in any of the above roles is reviewed by the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Registrar after each academic Semester and, if the cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, the student must relinquish his/her leadership role or other duties/privileges mentioned above. 122 For an activity requiring pre -approval for participation, such as a mission trip or a research project, the cumulative GPA at the time of application for the activity is utilized; however, if the cumulative GPA drops below 3.0 by the start of the activity, the student may not be allowed to participate in order to allow the m to focus on their academic well-being. CUSOM MSBS Class Representatives The Class Representatives serves as a voice for all MSBS students in both Year 1 and Year 2 . The responsibilities of Class Representatives include collecting and expressing stude nt opinions, acting as a liaison for the student body, promoting the MSBS program , supporting club and class activities and working to improve the quality of life for all MSBS students at CUSOM. The Director of the MSBS program serves as the advisor for any concerns brought forth by the Class Representatives on behalf of their cohorts. Recognition of Student Organizations The first step in obtaining recognition for a new student organization is the submission of a petition to the Office of Student Affairs. The petition must include the goals of the organization, the proposed charter, and the name of the proposed faculty advisor. Once the petition has been approved by the Executive Director of Student Affairs , the petition is forwarded to the Dean for final approval. Use of College Logo Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University , CUSOM or the MSBS program without the express written permission of the CUSOM Dean and University Communications and Marketing. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the program. The request form to use the school logo for any merchandise must be submitted to the Executive Director of Student Affairs who will process the request and grant final approval. Student Sponsored Ev ents Any event conducted by a student club or organization recognized by CUSOM 's MSBS program is considered a student -sponsored event. Events of this nature require the approval of the Office of Student Affairs and requests must be submitted in writing to the Office of Student Affairs. Requests must include a statement of purpose and the faciliti es required for the event. Event scheduling forms requiring the use of institutional facilities 123 are available through the Office of Student Affairs. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited at any on - or off- campus student club or organization event or activit y. Scheduling Extr acurricular Activities Students, or student organizations, wishing to host events involving extracurricular academic activities (i.e., speakers, mini -courses, pharmaceutical exhibits, or non- credit courses) must have the approval of the Office of Student Affairs. Written requests or activities request forms for approval must be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs. All off - campus events sponsored by a CUSOM MSBS club or organization must receive approval from the Office of Studen t Affairs prior to the event or activity and prior to contacting any off -campus facility or organization to schedule or host the event. Attending Conferences Students who meet the required criteria may be permitted to attend conferences (not greater than three consecutive days). Only students in good academic standing are eligible to attend, and time away from campus is counted per the CUSOM MSBS Attendance Po licy. Copies of the Student Organizations Handbook are available from the Office of Student Affairs. 7.3.2 CUSOM MSBS Alumni Student Society for Alumni and Friends The Student Society for Alumni and Friends (SSAF) is a student organization sponsored by the Campbell Medicine Alumni Association; the Executive Director of External Affairs and Alumni Engagement serves as the club advisor. The mission of SSAF is to conne ct students, alumni and friends of CUSOM MSBS by providing leadership opportunities, educating students about the impact of philanthropic engagement with CUSOM and the University, and inspiring future generation of alumni. SSAF helps students communicate the goals, purpose and impact of CU Advancement and Alumni Engagement while giving them the opportunity to educate other students about the importance of giving back. SSAF consists of a group of highly motivated students interested in the promotion of phi lanthropic awareness on campus and are leaders and volunteers for events such as Campbell Medicine Golf Classic, TAG Day, Founders Week, and Campbell Day of Giving. Students who serve as club 124 officers receive training in event planning, project management , fundraising, strategic planning and marketing. SSAF members serve as ambassadors to students, alumni and friends of CUSOM. Members serve as agents for their respective classes during their tenure as students and throughout their lifetime as alumni. Me mbership is free and participation in initiatives and events will be taken into consideration when of fering exclusive opportunities. 7.3.3 CUSOM Committees Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) and the MSBS program values the talents , perspective and experience of its students and the positive contributions they make to key operational, academic, and improvement efforts of the school. As such, student participation and contributions are solicited whenever possible. Appointments to Committees differs from appointment as a student representative or class leader, and appointment to, and service on, a CUSOM MSBS Committee should be considered a privilege. The process begins with the Office of Academic Affairs identifying student vacancies on CUSOM MSBS Committees, as approved by the Dean, prior to the start of each academic year (and as vacancies arise within an academic year). Student members of CUSOM MSBS Committees must meet pre - identified criteria including, but not limited to, the student being in good standing at all times relative to: Academic standing: A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher on a 4.0 scale is required at the time of appointment. If the GPA falls below the minimum required for appointment at any time, the student w ill be asked to step down from service to focus on her/his academics. Professionalism: No student is permitted to serve on a CUSOM MSBS Committee if they are on Conduct Probation or otherwise have any issues related to Honor Code or Professionalism infrac tions. Committee service of students with an Admonition is determined based on the recommendation of the APPS Committee at the time the Admonition is assigned or by the APPS Committee Chair if an Admonition is assigned by the Chair instead of an APPS Comm ittee hearing. If an appointed student has a documented professionalism issue at any time, the student will be required to step down from the committee service. Other: All other requirements necessary to be a registered student in good standing, such as payment of tuition, must be met. First-year students may not serve on CUSOM MSBS Committees, except in rare circumstances, until they successfully complete the first semester . 125 At designated times in the MSBS program , the class representatives may be asked by the Office of Student Affairs to solicit names of students who have interest in the identified CUSOM MSBS Committees which include student membership. The Office of Student Affairs provides the charge of each Committee and the desired qualities o f the ideal student member. Interested students submit materials addressing how they meet the stated needs of the Committee based on their interests and experiential base. These materials are submitted to the class representatives at a time designated by the Office of Student Affairs. The class representatives review all submissions in a fair, impartial, and unbiased manner, and send to the Office of Student Affairs their recommendations for no more than three (3) students they identify for each Committe e vacancy. The Office of Student Affairs then works with the Office of Academic Affairs to ensure each student recommended meets all the stated prerequisites for service. Once verified, the names are forwarded to the respective Committee Chairs, who are given a brief timeframe to review the applications and select the student(s) they wish to invite to serve on the committee. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the students selected to any MSBS Committees . All faculty and student committee appointments are subject to approval by the Dean. 126 8. Research and Scholarly Activity 8.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for developing its research capacity in order to continue to attract and retain top -tier faculty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in the healthcare field , biomedical research, and in making valuable contributions to society. Research and scholarly activity at CUSOM may take different forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational research. 8.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Scholarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive philosophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. As part of CUSOM's support of students in the area of scholarly activity, students receive instruction in research skills and complete a scholarly project paper as part of the curriculum in the first two years. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academic and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specifically applies to student extracurricular research and scholarly activities. CUSOM does not require students to comple te an extracurricular independent research project or scholarly activity as a requirement for graduation. However, CUSOM is committed to supporting students in pursuing research and extracurricular scholarly opportunities. Whereas students are encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member or preceptor who takes on the role of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all students who are interested in enga ging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent through the submission of the research notification form . Students receiving mentorship and/or working on a project not associated with CUSOM should make those projects and relatio nships known through the research notification form. As such, student -researchers are provided with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty or preceptor mentor. 8.3 Education in Research Principles Research processes an d principles of responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented during Year 2 of the MSBS curriculum . Topics include general principles of research ethics, statistical methods, project development, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSOM MSBS students in basic science, educational, and clinical research. Additional education al opportunities in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly activities are presented throughout the curriculum and through workshops associated with extracurricular research activities. As active members of a research team, students may be required to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. If such training is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean 127 of Research with documentation of completion prior to beginning work on the project. Additional training specific to the research project will be provided by the research mentors. 8.4 Research Opportunities CUSOM students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mentors in areas of biomedical and clinical research ar e available to provide guidance for student scholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall responsibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approval from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that students receive appropriate mentorship while engaging in scholarly endeavors. A faculty member must approve all scholarly activity undertaken by students or if working on a project outside of CUSOM, the student must identify an individual higher -ranking than that of a student who will serve as the project lead and mentor. However, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to research ethics. For a student -initiated project, the student must have a faculty, preceptor, or outside higher ranking sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and applications in close cooperation with the mentor. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance with University and institutional affiliates' research policies . Students participating in research must comply with all appropriate regulatory requirements, which may include Institution Review Board approval prior to initiation of the project. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropriate. 8.5 Student Presentation Processes Students are encouraged to share the results of their research through publication and presentation of their projects. The Associate Dean for Research oversees research publications and scholarly activities of students. Students are required to receive approval from the Associate Dean for Research prior to presentation or publication of any research project conducted while a CUSOM student. For meeting submissions, the final version of the abstract must be submitted and approved by the faculty mentor and/or the project lead, and the Ass ociate Dean for Research. The Associate Dean for Research must review and approve all compliance requirements before submission of the abstract for any scientific meeting. For manuscript submissions (case report, original research, or any other publicati on), the final manuscript draft must be submitted and approved by the Associate Dean for Research prior to submission to any journal for consideration of publication. T he faculty mentor and all listed co -authors must review and approve the final poster, presentation or manuscript prior to submission to the Associate Dean for Research for final approval for presentation and/or publication. The author(s) and mentor must be up-to-date on research compliance processes. Failure to adhere to any of these 128 requi rements is considered professional misconduct and will be reported through the appropriate channels for consideration by the APPS C ommittee as described elsewhere in this Bulletin . 8.6 Research Symposium Campbell University and CUSOM has a tradition of highlighting and showcasing student research interests. Annually, Campbell University hosts the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Symposium, which is an adjudicated competition open to s tudents, residents and faculty. The IPE research symposium is an opportunity for students to see other projects from their fellow students, as well as projects from other healthcare fields. MSBS students also have the opportunity to present their research as it applies to their Capstone coursework. 129 9.

The Univ ersity has reason to believe that an account or system is being used in viol ation of Univ ersity policy or federal or st ate law. Under these circumstances the university may authorize system support personnel to monitor the activities of a specified account or computer system and to search electronic information stored in that account. The authority for this search must be requested on an account -by-account basis, and monitoring will be restricted to the specified account. If this search provides evidence of violation, the account will be disabled and action taken with appropriate authorities. It will become increasingly possible for computer systems owned by students, staff, or faculty to be attached directly to the Campbe ll network via on- campus attachment or off - campus VPN services. The owner of a personal machine or device may use that machine at his or her discretion; however, the use of the University network is subject to all of the policies stated in this document including, but not limited to the following: The owner of any device or machine connected to the Campbell network is responsible for the behavior of all users of that machine and for all network traffic to and from the machine.

Technology Usage Computer systems and networks allow for a free exchange of scholarly ideas and information. This exchange serves to enhance learning, teaching, critical thinking, and research, as well as to promote the sharing of moral standards. While the constitutional right of free speech applies to communication in all forms, the Christian atmosphere of Cam pbell University prescribes only civil and respectful discourse. Campbell University computer and network services are available as a privilege to all full- time and adjunct faculty, staff, and students at the main and extended campuses. The number of people in the Campbell community dependent upon the University's computer and network services is sizable. Therefore, a respect for the needs of others is expected among users.

With the notable exceptions of the processes normally associated with grading, critique, assessment, and lecture or classroom illustrations, no other student, faculty, or staff member may make any use of another's work without the expressed consent of the creator. However, the Department and the University retain the right to display, copy, replicate, or distribute any work created through the use of the Department's production facilities for the purposes of promotion, representation, artistic display, publication, illustration, and recruiting, on the condition that the creator is given full, appropriately disclosed credit. No one, including the creator, may use the Department's production faciliti es for any commercial purpose. Pornographic or Obscene Material Users are required to use institutional resources in a responsible and respectful manner. Pornographic, obscene, or offensive material is prohibited on the Campbell University computers and network system.

Electronic mail (email) is also provided to all eligible users. These services are provided only for University -related purposes. Class R ecordings Class materials (h ereafter including PowerPoints, Handouts and Lecture Recordings) are distributed for the exclusive use of students in the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine. Student access to and use of materials are conditioned on agreement with the terms and conditions set out below. Any student who does not agree to them is prohibited from accessing or making any use of such materia ls. In a distance- learning environment, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a federal privacy law, continues to remain in effect and students need to understand their role in supporting the privacy of fellow students. In courses which incorporate remote interactions, students must be cognizant that shared pictures, written assignments, audio, videos, emails, blog posts, discussion boards, etc. remain part of the content of the course, just as they would if they were shared in the face -to-face classroom setting. The expectation is that each member of the class treat s those materials with care and does not reshare or post beyond th e course. Accordingly, any student accessing class or other educational materials on Blackboard or any other electronic media: 1. Acknowledges the faculty members' intellectual property rights and that distribution of the materials outside the course participants violates the copyright policy; and 2. Recognizes the privacy rights of fellow students who speak or appear on video in class; and 3. Accepts that recording, distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside the classroom is an Honor Code violation; and 4. Agrees that the materials are to be accessed and used only as directed by the faculty member(s) teaching the course. 142 10.
