Beacon Street Watertown, Massachusetts 02172 THE MX MISSILE: A FIRST STRIKE WEAPON Speaking at the May meeting of PSR/Boston, Jonathan King, Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , charged that the U.S. Air Force intends to deploy the MX missile system to give the U.S. the capacity to inflict a preemptive first strike against the Soviet Union. Such a step, he reasoned , would only prompt the Soviets to do the same, and so put the globe on a path of hair-trigger instability . As he recounted a history of the Russian\u00ad American arms race, he pointed out that for thirty years the policy of the U.S. was called Mutually Assured Destruction , or MAD, based on the assumption that if the Soviets launched a nuclear attack, the U.S. would be able to retaliate with total destruction of the enemy. Like two scorpions in a bottle, each would deter the other from a deadly attack, for fear of receiving the same itself. But, with the development of the MX missile, deterrence appears to be replaced in the cur\u00ad rent Carter administration with a willingness to use nuclear weapons first. The MX missile has been designed to deliver its load within 100 meters of its intended destination.

Feld and Kosta Tsipis. Copyright 1979 by Scientific American, Inc. LETTER (See Page 4) All rights reserved. I. EDITORIAL The Air Force Versus the Public In the name of national defense, the United States is poised to embark on an engineering project that will dwarf the Great Pyramid of Giza, cost between $31 and 100 billion dol\u00ad lars, and transform the Great Basin de5ert of Nevada and Utah into a labyrinth of roads, rails, and missiles. According to Air Force Brigadier General August Hecker, 'This is man's biggest project.\" When the MX missile was first proposed to the people of Nevada and Utah, their reaction was to trust the Federal government 's argu\u00ad ment that the MX missile would be a boon to the local economy. But as public hearings unveiled more of what the Air Force had in mind, an erosion of public confidence began to set in, to the point now where the gover\u00ad nors of both Utah and Nevada and a majority of the citizens of those States oppose the MX system. Not a small part of the coming battle over that project will be the rights of an aroused local populace against a formidable Federal bureaucracy . The MX missile has been proposed to counter an untestable notion, that the Soviet Union can destroy the American land-based Minute\u00ad man system of missiles in a single stroke. That the U.S. possesses 10,000 strategic weapons , and that more than half of them are not on land but aboard bombers and submarines , are facts that appear not to have been seriously weighed in the MX debate. Worse is the fact that for the MX to work, SALT II must be ratified. Without SALT II, there would be no way to prevent the Soviets from defeating the MX by building enough missiles, as weapons expert Carson Mark put it, \"to hit the gopher everywhere he sticks his head out of the ground.\" But such a move by the Soviets would almost certainly touch off a new cycle in the arms race, and encourage the Americans to expand the system indefinitely . Indeed, Major General Kelly Burke, staff member for Air Force research and develop\u00ad ment, told Congress recently, 'With this sys\u00ad tem we can dig holes to whatever level of confidence lets us sleep easy.\" By changing the design of the track system from ellipses to straight lines, as was proposed by the Penta\u00ad gon in April, holes could conceivably be dug from coast to coast. The Newsletter of Physicians for Social Responsibility, Inc., is issued quarterly to its members and the public for educational pur\u00ad poses. It is edited by Henry David Abraham , M.D. Inquiries and contributions should be addressed to the PSR Office, 56 North Beacon Street, Watertown , MA 02172, 617-924-3468 . The deadline for contributions to Volume I, No. 4 is September 28. Current estimates of land use range from 175 to 14,400 square miles. Water, always a pre\u00ad cious resource in a desert community , would be consumed in unprecedented quantities . Despite the fact that most of Nevada's ground water, as well as the Columbia River, has already been allocated for civilian use, there is a growing fear that the Federal government may claim the water in the name of national defense. This is a prospect that may chill the blood of the most patriotic rancher. The question is whether the MX legitimately contributes to the national defense. The answer is that it does not. The MX, despite its shell game strategy, is nevertheless targetable . Worse, the MX sets the stage for a potential 4,600 armed silos which, with superior guid\u00ad ance and multiple warheads, becomes a first strike system. In the face of such a threat, his\u00ad tory has shown that the Soviet Union is not likely to sit idle. What is more likely to occur is the most significant spurt in the arms race we have yet seen. But no growth curve can rise indefinitely. This is a lesson understood as much by the citizens of Nevada and Utah as by the most august academy of scientists . One hopes the lesson is shared with the rest of the country as well. The message is as obvious as it is urgent: the United States should not spend a nickel on the MX missile. Henry David Abraham , M.D. PSR TESTIMONY PRESENTED TO PLATFORM COMMITTEE, HEALTH GROUPS Physicians for Social Responsibil ity, in con\u00ad junction with the Campaign for Safe Energy, presented medical data on the health effects of nuclear technology recently to the Platform Committee of the National Democratic Party on June 13. PSR President Caldicott reviewed for the benefit of the Committee the dangers of radiation -linked cancers, genetic altera\u00ad tions, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons . Response to the day of testimony was particu\u00ad larly gratifying . The Platform Committee emerged with one of the most comprehen sive anti-nuclear planks of any national political body to date. The Committee called for a moratorium on new nuclear plants until rec\u00ad ommendations of the Kemeny Commission are enacted; a commitment to deal with nuclear waste as a \"highest priority;\" and a commitment to make conservation and renewable energy a national priority for the future. There was also a position to retire nuclear plants in an orderly manner as alter\u00ad natives become available. In parallel developments , Kathy Ryan of PSR/Boston and Tom Winters, M.D., of 2. PSR/Central Massachusetts , testified before the American Public Health Association and the Massachusetts Public Health Association on the medical aspects of nuclear technology . The A.PH.A. Governing Council in Novem\u00ad ber passed a resolution caJling for a halt to the construction of nuclear plants until 1) there was a complete review of the health effects of nuclear radiation, plant licensing, operating , and construction practices ; 2) the problem of waste disposal had been solved; and 3) a safe working environment could be guaranteed . The resolution ended with a call for more government support for conservation and development of safe renewable sources of energy. The M.P.H.A. at its annual meeting in April of this year adopted an even stronger posi\u00ad tion. In addition to a moratorium on new construction of nuclear power plants, the group called for a moratorium on the con\u00ad struction of new weapons facilities; indepen\u00ad dent monitoring of radiation exposure ; a new review of exposure standards; assumption by government and industry of the liability to workers for radiation linked illness; and an insistence that government and industry edu\u00ad cate workers and the public about radiation dangers. Other measures included: the devel\u00ad opment of decommissioning plans for all nuclear facilities; retraining and/or compensa\u00ad tion for all nuclear workers displaced as nuclear technology is phased out; allocation of funds from nuclear weapons and power towards renewable energy resources ; and an active government role in subsidizing conser\u00ad vation and safe energy. The A.P.H.A. in Detroit on October 22, 1980 is planning a special session on the issue as well. The program is called \"Nuclear Power, Safety, and Health.\" Speakers include Dr. Winters and Mr. Anthony Mazzocchi, Direc\u00ad tor of the Health and Safety Division of the United Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, who will speak on worker safety and health, as well as Barry Commoner , Director of the Center for Biology of Natural Systems, Wash\u00ad ington University, St. Louis. -Tom Winters, M.D. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S UPDATE PSR is booming . In the past six months, our membership has more than doubled -to about 1600, the number of chapters has tri\u00ad pled, and our activities have expanded faster than we could have expected . In this regular column, I'll keep you up to date on what we've done and what's coming up. Chapter Outreach. The list ot members orga\u00ad nizing as PSR chapters is large ; New Hampshire; New Mexico; Albany, Buffalo, New York City, Rochester, and Syracuse, New York; North Carolina ; Ohio; Ontario; ton; Wisconsin ; and Wyoming . We've started a Chapter Committee to keep track of all this activity, offer the chapters the help they need, and tap the chapters' talents. The first of the Committee's projects has been to write and distribute a survey of the chapters to figure out who they are and what we can offer them. The Committee is now working on a chapter organizing pamphlet using informa\u00ad tion from the survey responses, and has recently distributed a resource guide to the chapters. Many of National PSR's projects (speakers ' training, symposia, literature distri\u00ad bution) have been planned with the chapters in mind. lf you are interested in working with a chapter or would like to start one, please write to the Chapter Committee at the national office. National Symposia Series. The big news is that our extremely successful symposia on the Medical Consequences of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War (held in Cambridge, Massa\u00ad chusetts on February 9 and 10, and Washing\u00ad ton, D.C. on April 27) will be having offspring . PSR has obtained a grant to hold more symposia around the country, beginning with one in New York City on September 27 and 28, and another in San Francisco on November 17 and 18. The Council for a Liv\u00ad able World Education Fund will co-sponsor these symposia , along with local chapters and schools of medicine . Symposia administrator Mary Lord will coordinate the series along with President Helen Caldicott and myself. If you missed the February symposium but would like to hear the highlights , we now have two-hour tapes edited by National Pub\u00ad lic Radio station WGBH available from PSR at $10 each. We're still working on videotapes and a book of symposium transcripts . Speakers ' Training and Placement. In keeping with our commitment to speak out about the medical consequences of nuclear technology , PSR has now trained over 200 members as speakers in sessions held in Boston, Washing\u00ad ton, D.C., and New York City. These semi\u00ad nars, presented by Dr. Katherine Kahn and others, are so much in demand that we are now applying for funding to produce a speakers' training videotape that can be shown around the country. Currently , we're placing an average of ten members a week to speak at government hearings, grand rounds, rallies, workshops, commencements, conven\u00ad tions, and other meetings. We hope that chap\u00ad ters will soon be placing speakers in their areas. For more speaker information, contact Carol Belding, mornings, at the national office. Educational Materials. In the last six months, we've tripled the number of books, pam\u00ad phlets, posters, packets, slide shows, and A/V materials that we distribute . These materials. however , are not enough to answer the hun\u00ad dreds of specific technical questions that we get from the press, medical community , gov\u00ad ernments , workers, and radiation victims. We can now answer only a small percentage of this barrage. Can you help? lf you are willing and able to answer technical questions in any area related to nuclear technology or radia\u00ad tion, please write to Abe Claude of the Tech\u00ad nical Committee at the national office. National Office. With five full and two part\u00ad time employees , twenty volunteers, all of the above projects and more, we are a busy and growing organization. I urge you to continue your support of PSR with your time, funds, and expertise . -Wayne T. Jaquith, Esq. A CASE REPORT In the interests of stimulating discussion about the role of low-dose radiation in the epidemi\u00ad ology of cancer, the Newsletter will occasion\u00ad ally print a case report drawn from clinical experience or research. As with the case that follows, no conclusions can be drawn from an isolated instance, but scrutiny of such cases may lead to more thoughtful examination of what we see in our clinical practice and may, in turn, help us formulate epidemiological questions more accurately and appropriately . C. T. is a 62-year-old woman who presented to a university hospital Oncology Department with a chief complaint of phantom pain in her right leg. Her present illness appears to have begun approximately fifty years before, when, as a young child, she became beguiled by seeing the bones of her feet using the fluoroscope of her neighborhood shoe store. The machine, then used to help the clerk judge the shoe's fit, was easily operable by the child by inserting her feet into a port and pressing a button for as long as she liked. This she took to be a game, and often while walking past the shoe store, would run into the store and irradiate her feet, to the chagrin of t~e merchant. This game was played a large but uncounted number of times. J. She was well until 1975. At that time she developed a burning pain in her right foot. In 1976 a soft tissue mass the size of a golf ball was noted on the medial side of the right ankle. At surgery the pathological diagnosis was of a high grade leiomyos \u00b7 .. :oma, an exceedingly rare malignancy of smooth mus\u00ad cle. (The State of Massachusetts reported the diagnosis of 150 soft tissue sarcomas per year in a population of 5.7 million persons, but fig\u00ad ures for the smooth muscle subtype are not available .) Bone and CAT scans were negative. Treatment included resection of the mass, sec\u00ad tion of the posterior tibial nerve, 5400 rads istration of adriamycin , cytoxan, and DTIC. But in 1977 the patient suffered a pathological fracture of the right ankle. Because closed reduction was not feasible, and because radio\u00ad therapy had prolonged any potential bone healing time, a right below-the-knee amputa\u00ad tion was performed . She continued to receive chemotherapy for a total of nine cycles , until November, 1977, when on restaging her dis\u00ad ease, no pathology was found, and the che\u00ad motherapy was discontinued. The1', in 1979 she presented with phantom limb pain in her right leg severe enough to interfere with sleep and daily activity. A physical examination found a woman in no acute distress, and was unremarkable except for a well-healed scar below the right knee at the site of her amputation . It was noted that her prosthesis was ill fitting, and this was cor\u00ad rected. Her prognosis is not known. -Katherine Kahn, M.D. MAINE TO VOTE ON BANNING NUCLEAR POWER The State of Maine plans a referendum in September that seeks to close the Maine Yan\u00ad kee Atomic Power Plant in Wiscasset. Arthur Lerman of the Greater Portland Nuclear Ref\u00ad erendum Committee called the 80,000 signa\u00ad tures requesting such a vote the largest number ever submitted in the State's history. If the referendum is successful on September 23, it will mark the first time in the U.S. that such a plant was closed by the electorate . Spokesperson for Maine Yankee, Don Vigue, described the referendum as \"a serious threat,\" though he felt the plant has a \"good chance to defeat it.'' The plant has suffered a number of unpredicted shutdowns since its inception in 1972. In 1979 a spillage of radioactive water in the auxiliary building of the 850 megawatt reactor was caused by a faulty valve, but (Continued on page 7) MX MISSILE (Continued from Page One) accuracy is not necessary for deterrence, since a city or industrial complex can be leveled by bombs dropped or delivered within several miles of target. But the accuracy of the MX missile is required if the targets are small rein\u00ad forced silos holding enemy missiles. Figure 1 shows the basing scheme of the MX system. Two hundred MX missiles are planned to be shunted about 4600 protective shelters in a design aimed at confusing the Soviets in any first strike against the U.S. The MX missile would be larger than the current Minuteman missile, more accurate, and have more warheads. Each 100 ton missile would be carried on a flatcar which itself weighs three hundred tons, and shunted from garage to garage along a labyrinth of spur roads at 30 miles per hour. The system has already been approved by Congress , and is scheduled to be built on federal lands in Nevada and Utah. Cost estimates range from 31 to 100 billion dollars. King criticized the project at several points. The MX is designed under the assumption that SALT II, which sets a limit on the num\u00ad ber of missiles that either side could build, would be passed. But the future of SALT II is doubtful. If it is not ratified, the U.S.S.R. would simply be able to build enough missiles to target every garage. If, King observed, SALT II were ratified, a different problem -that of verifiability - would emerge. According to the Treaty, each nation must be able to determine the number of missiles the other has by \"national technical means,\" i.e., by its own technorogy . With the MX in place, verifiability , as defined by SALT II, would become dependent on the good will of the host country. The Air Force says that it would permit the Soviets to verify SALT II compliance by periodically opening MX garages. But what if the Chief of Staff or next President change their minds? Finally, King challenged the necessity of a sys\u00ad tem of so-called invulnerable land-based mis\u00ad siles. American (and Soviet) nuclear launchers are distributed among three basing modes - land-based silos, submarines , and aircraft - on the theory that if one leg failed, the other two would still prevail (see Figure 2). Only 25 % of American weapons are land based. One Trident submarine, only 2 % of our exist\u00ad ing nuclear force, could destroy all major population and industrial centers in the Soviet Union. Thus, invulnerable land-based missiles are not needed for deterrence. They are needed, however, if the United States plans on using nuclear weapons first. -E. J.

DANGER-NUCLEAR WAR To President Carter and Chairman Brezhnev: As physicians , scientists , and concerned citi\u00ad zens, alarmed by an international political climate that increasingly presents nuclear war as a \"rational\" possibility , we are impelled to renew a warning, based on medical and scien\u00ad tific analyses, that: 1. Nuclear war, even a \"limited\" one, would result in death, injury and disease on a scale that has no precedent in the history of human existence ; 2. Medical \"disaster planning \" for a nuclear war is meaningless . There is no possible effective medical response . Most hospitals would be destroyed, most medical person\u00ad nel dead or injured, most supplies unavail\u00ad able. Most \"survivors \" would die; 3. There is no .effective civil defense. The blast, thermal and radiation effects would kill even those in shelters, and the fallout would reach those who had been evacuated; 4. Recovery from nuclear war would be impossible . The economic , ecologic and social fabric on which human life depends would be destroyed in the U.S., the U.S.S.R., and much of the rest of the world; 5. In sum, there can be no winners in a nuclear war. Worldwide fallout would con-taminate much of the globe for generations and atmospheric effects would severely damage all living things. Therefore, in the interests of protecting human life, we appeal to you to: 1. Defuse the current tensions between our countries . 2. Ban the use of all nuclear weapons . 3. Recognize the threat posed by the very existence of our enormous nuclear arsenals, and begin dismantling them. We urge you to meet with us to discuss the medical consequences of nuclear war. We urge all physicians in the U.S.S.R. to join us in this appeal. The preceding letter was sent to President Car.ter and Chairman Brezhnev by prominent American physicians at the conclusion of the symposium on the Medical Consequences of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War organized by Physicians for Social Responsibility at the Harvard Science Center on February 9 and 10, 1980. The letter resulted in meetings by some signatories at the White House, the Soviet Embassy , and the Kremlin. The letter prompted a sympathetic response from prom\u00ad inent Soviet physicians. In addition, the let\u00ad ters received these personal responses from President Carter and Chairman Brezhnev . CARTER, BREZHNEV RESPOND: To Physicians for Social Responsibility : Your statement on the danger of nuclear war is a grim reminder of the almost incalculable price the world would pay in the event of nuclear conflagration . By describing so force\u00ad fully the terrible human costs of nuclear catas\u00ad trophe, you have made a valuable contribution to its prevention. The task of preventing nuclear war is the responsibility of all the nations of the earth. But it is a special challenge to the wisdom and statesmanship of the two nuclear super\u00ad powers, the United States and the Soviet Union. In a period of heightened tensions, it is all the more important to have reliable\u00b7con\u00ad straints on the competition in strategic nuclear arms. Equitable and verifiable limitations and reductions in nuclear arsenals are crucial - not only to the national security policy of the United States, but also to the peace and stabil\u00ad ity of the world. Our efforts to stop the pro\u00ad liferation of nuclear weapons are crucial as well. Again, I welcome your service to the cause of nuclear sanity and to public under\u00ad standing of this vital subject. Jimmy Carter To the American Scientists , sponsors of the statement \"Danger-Nuclear War:\" Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, I have studied your statement \"Danger-Nuclear War\" and I fully share your concern as scientists for the fate of mankind in connection with the danger of nuclear war. Since the time when the atomic energy was first used for military pur\u00ad poses the Soviet Union consistently stands for banning these and all other types of weapons of mass destruction and annihilation . The US scientists can substantially contribute to the explanation of disastrous consequences for mankind of a nuclear conflict between the USA and the USSR which would inevitably assume a global scale. Such explanation will further strengthen the will and activity of those who come out for stopping the arms race, for maintaining normal relations between all the countries including , of course, the USA and the USSR. You may rest assured that your humane and noble activities aimed at preventing nuclear war will met with understanding and support in the Soviet Union. With best wishes of success, L. Brezhnev BOOK REVIEW The Counterforce Syndrome, by Robert C. Aldridge, Institute for Policy Studies, Wash\u00ad ington, D.C., 1979. Available through Physi\u00ad cians for Social Responsibility , #B-02, $3.95 . This small volume marshals a prodigious argument against the notion that the United States lags behind the Soviet Union in the development of nuclear arms. The author, Robert Aldridge , knows his subject well. Born in 1926, he served in the Pacific in World War II, and worked as an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed in missile design until 1973, when he concluded that his work on the Trident submarine was leading the U.S. into a first\u00ad strike posture against the Soviets, at which time he resigned. He sets out five elements needed for a first\u00ad strike capability : 1) space warfare to destroy enemy satellites and their early warning sys\u00ad tems; 2) accurate missiles to strike an enemy's silos; 3) anti-submarine warfare; 4) domestic missile defenses; and 5) an elaborate system of command and control. The idea is as chilling as it is clear: a nation must be able to destroy in one knockout blow another nation's entire nuclear deterrent system. This force against force, i.e., this counterforce , is where the U.S. appears to be heading. Counterforce is his explanation of why the U.S. has 9,000 strategic nuclear weapons , when Robert McNamara twenty years before concluded that for a deterrent to be effective, the U.S. needed a scant 200 such weapons . And counterforce is his explanation of why the U.S. now plans to develop Missile-X , the Tomahawk Cruise, and the Trident subma\u00ad rine. Compounding that threat is the deploy\u00ad ment of MIRVs, or multiple independent re-entry vehicles, which Aldridge describes as follows: \" ... Several are attached to the front sec\u00ad tion of the missle, which is called the 'bus'. They are then covered with the missile nose cone. When the last rocket motor burns out and separates , the nose cone is ejected. What remains is the bus, which goes through the long coast phase, dropping off its lethal passenger for impact at different destinations. \" For deterrence , accuracy is irrelevant : but for counterforce , it is crucial. It is for this reason, Aldridge believes, the MARV, or maneuver\u00ad able re-entry vehicle, is being developed . Much of the book is devoted to advances in electronics in the tasks of intelligence , com\u00ad munication, and anti-weapons systems. He raises a provocative issue, when he cites a former defense official as saying: \"Computers are extremely important .. No human mind can enter the real time decision making loop and control the sys\u00ad tem. It has to be pre-programmed with s. logic so the computer can make the decision and run the game.\" The Constitutional safeguard of civilian con\u00ad trol over the military appears unchanged, but who controls the computers? Three times in seven months computers in the North Ameri\u00ad can Air Defense Command erroneously resulted in SAC bombers being readied for nuclear attacks against the Soviet Union. War was within minutes of being waged without the knowledge of the President or the assent of the Congress . Technology had surpassed for those moments our capacity to govern ourselves . The Soviet Union, however , has also been accused of moving towards a first-strike capacity. George Kistiakowsky , former Chief of the Explosives Division of the Manhattan Project, argues such a view. But Thomas Karras, spokesperson for the Center for Defense Information , disagrees : the vulnera\u00ad bility of Minuteman silos is an untested assumption ; U.S. submarines are essentially non-targetable ; and the U.S. leads the Soviet Union in satellite technology . One may argue that Aldridge 's position is based largely on systems that exist only on the drawing boards of the Pentagon . Yet he is a man who has labored long over such draw\u00ad ing boards. The implication of his argument is compelling : the only defense a nation has against a first-strike threat is to get its own missiles out of the ground first, unless each nation can avoid falling into a first-strike pos\u00ad ture in the first place. Deterrence may be a balance of terror, but counterforce is terror with all balance cast to the winds. This is the point in our history to which Aldridge 's argu\u00ad ment brings us. The Counterfor ce Syndrome is mandatory reading for anyone who seeks to comprehend and help shape this delicate time. -Mitchel Kling HELP IS SOUGHT FOR PSR INTER\u00ad NATIONAL EFFORT Physicians for Social Responsibility has launched an effort to encourage physicians in Europe to speak out against the medical impli\u00ad cations of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear war. It is hoped that notices similar to the PSR publication in the March 2, 1980 New York Times would be generated for the European press. Any persons in contact with European colleagues are asked to let the Inter\u00ad national Committee know about them, so that they may be included in future corre\u00ad spondence .

President NOTES FROM THE CHAPTERS PSR/ Albuquerque, N.M. Dr. Ted Davis reports the chapter is working toward a reduction of permissible radon levels in uranium mines. They also plan a study of birth defects in conjunction with the March of Dimes. PSR/Boston, MA Dr. Tom Graboys reports the chapter will present a fall lecture series on \"Nuclear Weapons and Methods of Disarmament \" at 7:30 p.m. in Lecture Hall G-1, Harvard School of Public Health with the following speakers: September 8 -'To be announced\" October 6 -Dr. Bernard Forsberg December 1 -Dr. Everett Mendelsohn PSR/Boston is now our largest chapter with 260 members . On August 9 the chapter held a fundraiser at the Cape Code Melody Tent with Joel Gray and Marvin Hamlisch. PSR/California Bay Area In addition to its investigation of the Liver\u00ad more Weapons Lab (see page 3), the chapter is working with Diablo Conversion Campaign to promote a feasibility study of converting the San Luis Obispo nuclear facility to non\u00ad nuclear fuel. The plant is only two and a half miles from a fault which the U.S. Geological Survey believes capable of generating an earthquake ten times more powerful than its structure was designed to withstand. PSR/Bay Area hosted the Heidelberg Radioecology Group and arranged meetings for them with the California Bureau of Radio\u00ad logical Health, the State Energy Commission , the Office of Emergency Services, the Califor\u00ad nia San Francisco Medical Center, and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Arrangements have been made for Dr. Susan Lambert to see patients with suspected radia\u00ad tion-induced disease by appointment at the Occupational Health Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital. She can be reached at 415- 821-8492 . A PSR symposium on the Medical Conse\u00ad quences of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War co-sponsored by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia School of Medicine will be held November 17 and 18 at Herbst Theatre, at the War Memorial. PSR/Central Mass. Ors. Tom Winter and Katherine Kahn report that the chapter has completed a monthly film series and a direct mailing to local physicians . The chapter is undertaking an investigation of the transportation of radionuclides through Central Mass. with the hope of minimizing the public's exposure and an investigation of X-ray exposure of different age groups. PSR/Columbus, Ohio In conjunction with the local American Medi\u00ad cal Students Association and the Central Ohio Safe Energy Committee, the chapter has been organizing responses to pro-nuclear power advertisements by the Committee for Energy Awareness . Under the federal fairness doc\u00ad trine, television and radio stations are obliged to air both sides of an issue of public concern . PSR/Columbus has succeeded in obtaining 30 radio spots on four stations that have run pro-nuclear ads and anticipates obtaining many more. For more information write Susan Montauk , Ohio State University Col\u00ad lege of Medicine, Box 624, 370 W. 9th Ave\u00ad nue, Columbus, OH 43210. PSR/Madison , WI This newly formed chapter held its first offi\u00ad cial meeting in May. The chapter was formed by medical students who learned of PSR at the American Medical Student Association convention in Philadelphia last March. The chapter plans to mobilize physicians in north\u00ad ern Wisconsin to testify on the medical effects of uranium exploration and radioactive waste storage. PSR/New York City The chapter hosted a speakers training pro\u00ad gram on June 15. They have spent the sum\u00ad mer working with National/PSR to plan a symposium on the Medical Consequences of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War to be held September 27 and 28 at Hunter College Audi\u00ad torium, 695 Park Avenue. Anyone who would like to stay with a PSR member in NYC during the symposium should contact Jon Rothblatt, Albert Einstein College of Medicine , 1300 Morris Park Avenue, U11423, Bronx, NY 10461, 212-430-2046. PSRINYC will begin a monthly program for its general membership in October. Planning for a November symposium on the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant has already begun. PSR/Philadelphia, PA The chapter sponsored a lecture on July 30 by Barbara Steinhibler-Schwab, one of the scien\u00ad tists who worked on the \"Heidelberg Study.\" This study is a detailed examination of the radioecological effects of operating nuclear power plants. ln the next year PSR/ Philadelphia plans to focus on the medical consequences of the Three Mile Island and Limerick nuclear power plants. PSR/Pittsburgh, PA The chapter completed a direct mailing to area physicians in May. They hosted a lecture entitled \"Some Public Health Lessons from Three Mile Island\" on June 9 by Dr. Gordon Macleod who was head of the Pennsylvania Public Health Department at the time of the accident. 6. PSR/Portland, OR Dr. Karen Steingart reports that a petition is being circulated calling for the Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council (EFSC) to immediately revoke the siting certificate for the Trojan nuclear power plant until: 1. Open hearings are held to hear testimony regarding the danger of Trojan's continued operation in light of Mt. St. Helens' active state; 2. Emergency planning is reassessed to include problems arising from the volcano's activ\u00ad ity; 3. Trojan's routine emissions can be re\u00ad evaluated due to possible increase in back\u00ad ground radiation from radioactive gases being released by the volcano; and 4.,Thequestion of damage to Trojan's cooling system from volcanic ash is resolved. The siting certificate was based on the assumption that Mt. St. Helens is a dormant volcano. At least 50 doctors have signed the petition. PSR/Rochester Finger Lakes Area, NY A group of doctors who were involved with Rochester Physicians for Safe Energy have decided to become a PSR chapter. They are planning a major meeting on nuclear waste in September. Contact Dr. Robert Mclellan , 10 Menlow Place, Rochester , NY 14620 for details. PSR/Seattle, WA Dr. Ken Lans reports that a referendum ban\u00ad ning nuclear waste transport is on the fall bal\u00ad lot. The chapter hopes to hold a conference on the medical effects of nuclear waste and to develop a pamphlet on the subject for public and professional education . PSR President Dr. Helen Caldicott will be in Seattle on Sep\u00ad tember 11 to give medical grand rounds at University Hospital at 8 a.m. and pediatric grand rounds at Children 's Orthopedic Hospi\u00ad tal at 9:05 a.m. She will meet with PSR/ Seattle on September 8.

Contact Dr. Mary Coleman , 2525 Bel\u00ad mont Road, Washington , D.C. 20008. BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEET PSR's Board of Directors held a well-attended business meeting on Saturday , July 12 at the home of Dr. Helen Caldicott. Each region of the country was represented . The Directors received Executive Committee, Financial, Fundraising, Medical Symposia , and Chapter Reports. There was an extended discussion of several proposals to relax PSR's member qualifica\u00ad tions and change its corporate name. A vast majority of directors felt that we should retain the name, Physicians for Social Responsibil\u00ad ity. The discussion revealed that many direc\u00ad tors favored retaining the current membership standards while some favored opening full voting membership to non-physician health care workers. The Directors asked the By-Law Committee to come up with concrete pro\u00ad posals on membership qualifications for a decision by the Board of Directors and the full membership. Another important policy discussion revolved around the relative emphasis PSR's program should place on the medical consequences of nuclear war v. health effects of the nuclear fuel chain. A consensus developed that while both issues are important and interrelated , the nuclear war problem was most significant. PSR will retain its current balance in the treat\u00ad ment of these issues. On behalf of the Executive Committee , Execu\u00ad tive Director Wayne Jaquith presented a detailed one-year plan for PSR. It emphasized the identification , development , and dissemi\u00ad nation of PSR's medical expertise and the expansion of our membership and resource base. The Directors adopted the plan unani\u00ad mously and authorized the establishment of fourteen national committees to implement it. The Directors also established a seven\u00ad member committee with representatives of each part of the country to propose new by\u00ad laws for PSR and an open committee to plan for an annual meeting of the membership for late 1980. Dr. Sidney Alexander was unanimously voted a director and the Treasurer of PSR. Dr. Alex-ander has substanti<1l experience in fundrais\u00ad ing for the Lahey Clinic and was the original PSR Treasurer at the time of its formation and incorporation . The Directors granted formal chapter status to PSR/Des Moines, Iowa; PSR/Madison, Wisconsin ; and PSR/Rochester Finger Lakes Area. PSR ILLUMINES DANGER OF WEAPONS LAB PSR/California Bay Area has become involved in the ongoing public controversy surrounding the operations of the Lawrence Livermore Nuclear Weapons Laboratory . Run by the University of California for the Department of Energy, the agency which pro\u00ad duces nuclear weapons, the Lab's proximity to the densely populated San Francisco Bay Area is causing concern for public health. Active earthquake faults run near the Lab, raising fears about the potential for a nuclear catas\u00ad trophe in the event of a major seismic distur\u00ad bance. Great quantities of nuclear material are kept in the Lab. In January two large earth\u00ad quakes rocked the Livermore Valley, damag\u00ad ing a 30,000 gallon tank of tritiated water and causing cracks to appear in the walls of the building, which houses almost a quarter ton of plutonium . Then, in April, two plutonium leaks occurred within a fortnight due to unex\u00ad plained failures of the ventilation system. According to news reports, the Lab claims that \"only several hundredths of a gram\" of plutonium were released within the confines of the building. It is known, of course, that microgram quantities of this substance can induce pulmonary and bone cancers. Thus, several hundredths of a gram represent the potential for several thousand neoplasms. Fur\u00ad thermore , metallic plutonium may oxidize spontaneously in air, forming micron-size par\u00ad ticles of plutonium dioxide which behave as a gas, passing through high efficiency particu\u00ad late air (HEPA) filters into the general environment. In May, the California Department of Health Services released a report showing that Lab employees had a five-fold greater rate of malignant melanoma compared to controls. The Joint Legislative Audit Committee of the California Legislature submitted the report to a panel of experts from across the US, all of whom concurred with the findings, while alluding to the generally accepted assumption that melanoma was associated only with solar ultraviolet and not with ionizing radiation . When the DOE convened its own panel at the Lab, lead by Dr. Arthur Upton, formerly of the National Cancer Institute, PSR members 7. presented half a dozen papers from the medi\u00ad cal and health physics literature linking mela\u00ad noma with ionizing radiation. Dr. Carl Johnson of the University of Colorado Medi\u00ad cal School and Director of the Jefferson County, Colorado Health Department , was flown in by PSR. He presented his findings on plutonium contamination of the Denver met\u00ad ropolitan area and cancer rates resulting from the operations of the Rocky Flats weapons milling facility, which resembles Livermore Labs in some operations . The DOE panel concluded that the increased cancers could possibly be due to radiation . While the melanoma rates were being reported, a group of parents in Livermore informed Friends of the Earth in San Francisco that there were four known cases of Ewing's sarcoma in Livermore children during the past four years. Investigation by PSR revealed that this is eighty times the expected rate. The NCI found only 26 in a similar period in a survey of seven metropolitan areas and two states comprising a population sample representing 10% of the US. (Young, J.L. and Miller, R.W. \"Incidence of Malignant Tumors in the US Children ,\" Journal of Pediatrics , February , 1975, pp. 254-258.) Pending verification of these cases by the State Tumor Registry, there may be clear evi\u00ad dence to warrant conducting a full epidemio\u00ad logical survey of cancer and genetic malformation incidences in the Livermore area. Given the possibility of both onsite and offsite releases of plutonium and other poi\u00ad sonous radioisotopes , a careful and meaning\u00ad ful survey of respirable surface dust concentrations seems mandatory . And given the demonstrated capacity for seismic sur\u00ad prises, consideration must be given to remov\u00ad ing altogether the most hazardous substances from this populous and fertile region. -Peter Joseph, M.D. MAINE TO VOTE (Continued from page 3) according to Vigue, resulted in \"no overexpos\u00ad ure of radiation to the population. \" An effort to defeat the referendum has been mounted by a campaign organization , Save Maine Yankee, chaired by John Menario . The effort employs a staff of seven, and is direct\u00ad ing mail appeals. A spokesperson for the organization did not know the size of the organization 's budget, though the work is being funded by a variety of sources, some of which have been obtained from out of state. The law, if adopted, would \"prohibit the gen\u00ad eration of electric power by means of nuclear fission.\" MEMBERSHIP INVITATION Name~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ Office Address Office Phone ( Home Address Home Phone( Affiliation Title I prefer to receive mail at 0 office 0 home address MC QC OS SC rn [illj rn MMDDYY A p I I I I I I I 0 rn Physicians for Social Responsibility , Inc.

Beacon St., Watertown, MA 02172 Phone: (617) 924-3468 The Physician and Nuclear Power stions \u00b7& Commonly Asked Questions About Nuclear Power Q. Are nuclear power plants safe? A. From a medical point of view, no. Due to large accidents , or smaller planned or unplanned releases, radioactive effluents enter the air and water. These effluents may contain isotopes that concentrate in the bones, muscles, thyroid, and other organs. These isotopes can cause cancers, leukemias , and genetic diseases. Q. Are the effects of these radioactive releases immediate? A. Not always. It may take many years for the isotopes to circulate through the food chain. Leukemias would not appear for at least five more years, other cancers may not appear for 15 to 30 years, and latent genetic damage might only become manifest generations later. Q. Can't nuclear wastes be stored safely? A. No. The average nuclear plant produces thirty-three metric tons of radioactive waste annually , including 500 pounds of plutonium . Some are highly toxic materials that must be isolated from human beings for many hundreds of thousands of years. That is 20 to 200 times the duration of recorded history. A study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said that there is no evidence that the integrity of high-level waste storage cannisters can be guaranteed for longer than a decade. Q. Isn't nuclear waste just a problem for those living near a dump? A. No. It's a problem for all of us. Radioactive wastes have already leaked into the environment in San Francisco Bay; Maxey Flats, Kentucky ; Hanford, Washington; Rocky Flats, Colorado; and West Valley, New York, among others. Radioactive isotopes have been found in rivers and oceans miles away from the leaks concentrated in fish, plants, and soil. Airborne isotopes can travel hundreds of miles to contaminate the air we breathe. Other isotopes can be absorbed in and travel around the world in the food we eat. Q. How can doctors argue against nuclear power, when they use X-rays? A. The use of X-rays in medicine is different from the radiation exposure to the public from nuclear power plants. A medical X-ray should be given to an individual after a careful assessment of its risks and benefits. The gonads are shielded. The dose is minimized . The beam is directed with precision. No one else is exposed, and the clinician constantly seeks alternative diagnostic tools. By contrast, a nuclear plant releases radiation indiscrimi\u00ad nately-affecting children, pregnant women, and other living things. Also, X-rays do not remain toxic for thousands of years, nor do they concentrate in the environment, like the products of nuclear fission. Q. But, don't we need nuclear power to solve the energy crisis? A. Not in the slightest. Nuclear power only provides 13 % of America's electricity and only 3% of our total energy. This contribution to our energy supply could be easily replaced by alternatives. Q. What are the alternatives to nuclear power? A. There are many. A five year study undertaken at the Harvard Business School concluded that America could cut its energy consumption by fifty percent through conservation and renewable technologies . Another study by the American Institute of Architects found that energy efficient buildings could save more energy than nuclear power generates. Ways to tap energy from the sun, wind, rivers, and biomass, and from increased efficiency in transportation, industry, and other areas already exist. But the capital and other resources needed to speed their implementation are now tied up in nuclear energy. Q. But what about the investment we've already made in nuclear power? A. Indeed, the country has spent billions of dollars to build these nuclear lemons, and there are those who want us to spend even more. But like any investment that goes bad, it is a lot wiser to cut our losses while we can, rather than pour good money after bad. Nuclear power, besides being bad medicine, is bad business. Q. Isn't nuclear power an example of the peaceful use of the atom? A. No. Nuclear power plants generate plutonium. Over twenty countries have thus gained access to the material for nuclear bombs, and the number of countries making such bombs is growing. Terrorists may fashion nuclear weapons using readily available technology and threaten entire cities. Authorities have discovered no way of preventing this and enough plutonium to make dozens of weapons is already \"unaccounted for\" at nuclear facilities. \"The splitting of the atom has changed everything save our mode of thinking, and thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe ... \" -Albert Einstein A Call To Medical Responsibility Physicians for Social Responsibility , Inc., is a non-profit organization committed to public and professional education on the medical hazards of nuclear technology.

Haney Harjan, Helen Hildreth, Anne Stein, Dr. Henry Mayer and Isobel Cerney, from our branch, attended some or all of the notable sessions at the Veterans Memorial Build\u00ad ing in San Francisco Nov. 17 & 18 presented by the Council for a Livable World and Physicians for Social Responsibility. Among over 1,000 people present were several hundred public health students, taking the course\u00b7for credit, viewing documentary films, charts, slides, and experiencing the courage and calm of the physicians detail\u00ad ing how and why THE MEDICAL CONSEQOENCE S OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR WAR make any plans, even for a \"limited\" nuclear war, out of bounds for sane, caring people. In I the balcony were dozens of young Third World people on scholarships , gaining public health credits from both Stanford and UC. Sydney Drell of SLAC gave an outstanding I speech. Over 500 physicians attenaed. Similar conferences, held earlier this year at Harvard and in New York City, received wide coverage. Dean Hiatt of Harvard's School of Public Health and the Dean of UC's School of Public Health both pledged that their curricula will give priority to devel\u00ad oping informed, concerned opposition to the nuclear arms race. They said there can be no adequate medical response to the firestorm and radiation , genetic damage, disrup\u00ad tion of all life-support, transportation and communication systems (including the deaths of most doctors and nurses).

The course, SWOPSI 104, taught by WIL member Judy Adams and Linda Shaw, starts Wed., Jan. 7, 7 -10 pm. and will run for 10 weeks (classroom is room. 13 in the History Corner, just to the left off Palm Drive, in the main quad). The class will be limited to 15 students, and while preference is given to Stanford students, community members are welcome to participate. The class sessions will be divided into two parts: first, group discussion of issues of women's history, 1920-80, with guest speakers, films, slide shows; the second part, discussion and practice of oral interview techniques. Of special need for the workshop are: 1) women who would consent to be intervi ewed. This would involve filling in a short biographical questionnaire, an initial meeting with the student doing the inter\u00ad view -for example, to talk about the project, their goals - things you'd like to talk about.

They told Reagan there is an \"absolute necessity for a properly informed medical consultant to the President on the medical effects of nuclear war,\" and expressed alarm at \"an international political climate 1, that increasingly presents nuclear war as a \u00b7rational ' possibility .\" The death, injury and disease that would result from nuclear war, they said, would have \"no precedent in the history of human existence .\" - <Continued on page 121 SA TU ROA Y.

We are all caught in the middle of an endless arms race that increasingly appears to be leading us to the unthinkable -nuclear war. While the nuclear nations talk of their fond hopes for reducing their nuclear 'arsenals, they always find some excuse to blame each other for adding new nuclear weapons to their stockpiles. How can we as average citizens possibly cope with this very difficult, yet most urgent problem of our time? It is easy to numb ourselves to potential nuclear disasters. Who wants to live their life feeling constantly panicked about nuclear annihilation ? Besides, what power do we really have to change a problem of such immense proportions? Deep down, we all know that this situation must change very soon, and that there must be some\u00ad thing that we can and should be doing. It's abundantly clear that simply leaving the problem up to our government so far has only made matters worse. So then, what can we really do? Behind the ominous headlines about new policies for fighting \"limited nuclear wars\" and the need to build still more sophisticat ed and expensive nuclear weapons systems, a new hope is emerging . With little publicity , a citizens' movement concerned about the threat of nuclear war has been grow\u00ad ing in the last few years that is potentially as powerful as the forces guiding us toward war. One of the first and most successful groups in the country at challenging the drift toward nuclear war is the U.C. Nuclear Weapons Labs Conversion Project. The people involved in the Labs Conver\u00ad sion Project have translated their deep concern about nuclear weapons and their hope for the future into an ambitious program of education and action aimed at ending the arms race. They are show\u00ad ing us through their persistence and successes that something indeed CAN be done to put sanity back on the agenda. Begun four years ago, the Labs Conversion Project is challenging the two principal mainsprings of the nuclear arms race -the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratories. These nuclear labs, administered by the University of California for the Department of Energy, have researched , designed and tested every nuclear warhead in the U.S. arsenal. These labs are more than just technical designers of nuclear weapons; they are strong proponents of a war\u00ad oriented defense policy, actively lobbying for weapon systems such as the neutron bomb and against arms reduction treaties like the Comprehensive Test Ban. Few people were aware of these labs and their powerful role prior to the formation of the Labs Conversion Project. It has attempted to take the debate on the arms race out of the military's cloistered rooms and into public view, demanding accountibility from the University , the labora~ tori.es, and the Department of Energy. Its work is having an impact. The Department of Energy admitted in a recent study that the Labs Conversion Project has challenged the laboratories \"with particular force.\" (over) Through ongoing research, education and organizing, the Labs Conversion Project has also accom\u00ad plished the following: o Uncovered the great health and environme ntal hazards the Lawrence Livermore Lab poses to its employees and the surrounding community in the San Francisco Bay area. o Mounted the most serious challenge ever to the University of California's operation of the weapons labs, pointing out how U.C. has lent a protective and legitimizing shield to the development of nuclear weapons. o Put together a conversion analysis of the Lawrence Livermore Lab, documenting how the lab personnel and resources could be put to better use developing safe, renewable energy sources (and thereby providing true national security). o Won a precedent-setting court case, securing the legal right to display disarmament literature at the Lawrence Livermore Lab Visitors Center. This coming year is a particularly critical one. The labs are gearing up to develop warheads for a number of proposed weapon systems. A series of government studies will be released on environ\u00ad mental hazards at Lawrence Livermore. And the University of California will decide next fall whether to renew its contracts to operate the laboratories. To meet these challenges during the next year, the Labs Conversion Project has developed an am\u00ad bitious program. But it can fulfill this only with our financial support. By supporting the Labs Conversion Project through our contributions, we can develop the power to turn back the threat of nuclear war. By raising our voices individually and collectively, we can make a compelling statement that there is still time to achieve true peace and security. Please give us as much as you can.

NAME~---------------------- ____________________ _ 9334 Berkeley, CA 94709 Stop the arms race where it starts. The Global Threat: ARMS RACE OR HUMAN RACE? Since the first atomic bombs were dropped in 1945, the likelihood of a catastrophic nuclear war has steadily increased. In the name of national se\u00ad curity, we have stockpiled 31,000 nuclear warheads, enough to kill every Russian 40 times over. We build three new nuclear bombs a day. Not content with tl1is overkill capacity, the U.S. is entering a fearful new stage in the arms race. By providing the accuracy for a \"first strike capability\" and the ability to wage a \"limited\" nuclear war, the new generation of nuclear weapons like the MX and the neutron bomb make the initiation of a nu\u00ad clear war a \"thinkable\" option. The Soviet threat is often used as the rationale in continuing and escalating the arms race. Most mili\u00ad tary experts believe that we are now at a rough equi\u00ad valency in nuclear strength with the Soviets. But new developments by the U.S. or the Russians prompt each side to advance the nuclear arms race a step further in response. As Herb York, former director of Lawrence Livermore National Labora\u00ad tory (LLNL), states, \"The great irony of the arms race is that nearly all the weapons which in the hands of others were {and are) threatening to our national ecurity, have been invented or perfected by us in the fir t place.\" Military spending has become a bottomless finan\u00ad cial pit. The U.S. has spent $2 trillion since World War 11 on defense and expects to spend another $2 trillion in the l 980's, yet Americans feel increasing\u00ad ly insecure. Escalating military budgets give us in\u00ad flation, unemployment, the deterioration of our cit- t' n that \u00b7-~-~ -m1sconcep 10 \"The most damaging d . n our view f d nd correcte 1 must be ace a I . n that nuclear war -the national de us10 IS ,, is unthinkable. . . -Air Force Assoc1at1on 1978 Policy Statement ies, and cutbacks in essential human services. Mean\u00ad while, the guns or butter priority debate has decidedly shifted in favor of the military. Disarmament and arms reduction agreements pro\u00ad vide a sounder basis for security than does an unend\u00ad ing arms race. The U.S. as historic leader of the nuclear arms race can help reverse the momentum by declaring a freeze on the development of new weapons and seeking agreement with the Soviets to follow suit. The Weapons Labs: THE BOMBS START HERE Every single nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal from the Hiroshima bomb to the neutron warhead was conceived, developed and tested by the nation's two nuclear weapon's laboratories : Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), located 40 miles east of San Francisco, and Los Alamos National Scientific Laboratory (LANSL) in New Mexico. These labs are the brains of a vast nuclear weapons production complex. The Department of Energy (DOE) provides about $900 million a year to the labs, more than half of which goes to wea\u00ad pons work. Current programs at the labs include development of nuclear warheads for the neutron bomb, the MX and the cruise .:v elrt~ group that meets with outside peo\u00ad ple'\". the defense community. They are workrng very aggressively , trying to influ\u00ad ence the DOD to consider using these neutron weapons ... \" -Harold Agnew, former Director of Los Alamos Lab officials do more than just design the wea\u00ad pons. Their active role in pushing for new weapons systems and lobbying against nuclear test ban treaty proposals profoundly shapes national military poli\u00ad cy. In 1978, a Washington Post editorial charged that the labs have led a \"brass-knuckled bureaucra\u00ad tic battle\" to beat down the American negotiation position on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Under contract with the DOE, the University of California has managed the labs since their begin\u00ad nings. Contrary to the spirit of open inquiry at the University, the labs are isolated from public view. The University plays a protective and legitimizing role -its prestige and \"objectivity \" attract capable scientists and ample government funding to the laboratories . The University, however, assumes no role in responsible oversight, allowing the labs almost total freedom of action. The Department of Energy shapes the program priorities at the laboratories . Because weapons de\u00ad velopment retains first priority of importance with\u00ad in the DOE, long-range U.S. energy planning takes place within a nuclear and military framework pre\u00ad empting needed research into alternative, renewable options. Pervasive secrecy within both the DOE and the laboratories denies the public information necessary for intelligent debate and decision on nuclear issues. Even if nuclear bombs are never used again, the development of these weapons at the labs poses enormous health hazards for lab employees and the surrounding communities. Large amounts of highly radioactive materials, such as plutonium, are rou\u00ad tinely transported, used and stored at the labs. The Livermore Lab sits on or near 13 active earthquake faults. Livermore Lab representatives insist the work of the labs poses no danger to public safety. Recent events, however, contradict that assumption. In January, 1980, a 5.5 earthquake rocked the lab. Structura l engineer John Rutherford stated that the plutonium building received \"significant structural damage.\" In April, 1980, the State Department of Health released a study concluding that melanoma, a rare form of skin cancer, occurs nearly 4 times more frequently among lab employees than among residents of surround- ing communities. ------------:--:---:: ~~ ' .

Above ground nuclear tests conducted by the labs prior to 1963 exposed thousands of civi\u00ad lians and soldiers to low level radiation. To\u00ad day, accidental ventings during below ground nuclear testing subject residents in the South\u00ad west to serious health risks. Thousands of cannisters of nuclear waste, pro\u00ad duced in part by Lawrence Livermore, have been dumped off the Farallon Islands. These cannisters are now leaking, thus introducing radioactive contamination into San Francisco Bay marine life. CONVERTIN G THE LABS There is only one way to end the global threats and local dangers posed by weapons work at the labs -conversion. Conversion means taking people out of soul-destroying and economically dead-end defense work and returning them to productive civi\u00ad lian activity. We do not need more nuclear bombs. We do need basic long-range research done on how the world is to best meet its energy needs. Preliminary analysis has shown that it is technically feasible to apply the valuable skills of LLNL and LANSL to solve pro\u00ad blems in the practical application of alternate ener\u00ad gy sources like solar, wind and resource recovery. A study done by the International Mach in ists Union demonstrates that spending on non-military work provides significantly more jobs per dollar than does spending on military activity. Conversion would seriously challenge the current mad momentum toward nuclear annihilation thus better meeting the real security needs of the world's people. Organizing for Change: THE U.C. NUCLEAR WEAPONS LABS CONVERSION PROJECT Since 1976, the U.C. Nuclear Weapons Labs Con\u00ad version Project has challenged the research and de\u00ad velopment priorities at Livermore and Los Alamos Laboratories and questioned U .C.'s adm in i trative role in legitimizing the arms race. The Project has mounted a successful nonviolent campaign that has made the U.C. operation of the labs a major issue and reawakened local public concern about the dan\u00ad gers of the nuclear arms race. The Conversion Project's current goals are to work through education and nonviolent action for: 1. An end to all nuclear weapons related work by LLNL and LANSL and their conversion to so\u00ad cially constructive uses as a step toward global disarmament. 2. An end to the non-democratic management of LLNL and LANSL, providing for rigorous pu\u00ad blic scrutiny and insuring public control. 3. An end to the University of California 's ties to nuclear weapon development . 4. An end to all work by the labs which involves radioactive materials posing a threat to the health and safety of lab employees and residents of sur\u00ad rounding communities. During the past few years we have researched, produced and distributed a con\u00ad version analysis for LLNL; motivated state and federal agencies to under\u00ad take a number of studies to evaluate the health dangers posed by the labs; organized efforts to force the U.C. regents to publically debate and vote for the first time in 36 years on continued University involve\u00ad ment with the nuclear research labs; mounted a successful legal challenge to ob\u00ad tain the right to display our literature at the Visitors Center of LLNL. This victory may result in the placement of alternative litera\u00ad ture at other Department of Energy weapons facilities nationwide. ~;\u00b7 \"I found your analysis and proposals for ~-the conversion of the Lawrence Liver\u00ad if more and Los Alamos laboratories .. _ it to be. \u00b7 \u00b7 very penetrating.

Washington , D.C. 20002 Phone: (202) 543-4100 Why it exists The Council for a Livable World was founded in 1962 by the eminent nuclear physicist Dr. Leo Szilard to combat the menace of nuclear war and strengthen national security through rational arms control. The Council continues to pursue its objectives by blending the resources of its knowledgeable scientists with the skills of practical politics, and by concen\u00ad trating its efforts on the U.S. Senate which has unique advise and consent powers in foreign affairs. Those efforts are two-fold: First, the Council's Washington Pro\u00ad gram provides Senators with sophisti\u00ad cated technical and scientific information that allows them to make intelligent deci\u00ad sions about nuclear arms control and strategic weapons , both present and planned. Second, the Council's Candidate Assistance Program helps elect to the Senate men and women who support serious arms control. The Council has enjoyed significant successes on both fronts: It was in\u00ad strumenta l in passing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, halting ABM, banning biolog\u00ad ical weapons , advancing the SALT pro\u00ad cess under four presidents and slowing nuclear proliferation. On the election front, the Council has helped elect 57 U.S. Senators since 1962, including 29 Senators now in Washington . How it works in Washington The Council's Washington Program monitors and influences arms control legislation in the U.S. Senate. Council board members and other knowledgeable authorities outside of government provide valuable technical, scientific and strategic information to Senators and their staffs at regular Coun\u00ad cil Seminars. These off-the-record sessions , often attended by as much as one third of the Senate, give plain-English explanations of the nature and dangers of present weap\u00ad ons systems, such as the neutron bomb, and of future technologies , such as \"charged particle beams,\" an anti-satellite device still under research. The Council also helps initiate and draft legislation, monitors appropriate committees -from the initial hearing to final markup, produces expert witnesses for crucial hearings and keeps accurate head-counts before crucial arms control votes are taken. In addition to its Senate activities , the Council lobbies key members of the Executive Branch, including represen\u00ad tatives of the White House, the National Security Council, the Department of State, the Pentagon and the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Why it succeeds in elections The success of the Council in helping elect 57 U.S. Senators in 19 years is due to the sophisticated methods of its Can\u00ad didate Assistance Program. The program begins with exhaustive political intelligence , gathered months, even years, before the elections take place. (This information is shared with Council members through its newsletter .) The Council carefully assesses every in\u00ad cumbent and every challenger in every state where there is a Senate election. But the Council does not get involved in every race. It chooses those races where the differences between the candi\u00ad dates on arms control issues are clear cut. It prefers to concentrate on smaller states and primary elections where cam\u00ad paign dollars go farther. And it recom\u00ad mends close races where funds from Council supporters can be crucial to the outcome . Unlike any other candidate assistance groups, the Council lets its supporters decide which of its endorsed candidates they prefer to support. Thus, Council sup\u00ad porters make contributions directly to candidates of their choice, but through the Council. This guarantees that the can\u00ad didates will know that the donations are issue-oriented, for arms control. Finally, the Council assesses each en\u00ad dorsed candidate 's true financial need. Because that need varies widely, Council supporters have in the past provided in\u00ad dividual candidates with as little as $1,000 and as much as $70,000.

The basic human needs of adequate food and education can be met if our resources are redirected from the destruction to the preservation of life. To achieve this goal a way must be found to end the arms race. \u00a9 Emilio Mercado At this crucial point in history a global approach to problem solving is necessary.

DRELL Arms Control: Is There Still I-lope? THE PATTERN OF RECE T EVENTS provides very little encouragement and few, if any, auspicious signals for the future of arms control. ALT 11 has been derailed, at least temporarily; the mutual balanced force reduction talks in Vienna remain stalled; little progress is reported from the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty or for limitations on antisatelli 1te activities. Indeed, one hear more these days about rearming than about reducing arms. Advances in weapons technologies are bringing with them prospects of a broader repertoire of missions for our nuckar armories, which continue to grow in numbers and improve in quality. More and more we hear of usable nuclear weapons and of nuclear war-fighting and winning . With these developments we have come once more to one of those perilous forks in the road from which several very different paths diverge. It is time for us to stop and ask as we enter a new decade: What are our goals? Where are we going? Do we even still remem\u00ad ber what nuclear explosions do' Does thie the post-Hiroshima generation ac\u00ad tually appreciate the horror of nuclear weapons and the dangers po ed by the prospect of a nuclear conflict? Thirty-five years have passed since the fireballs of the first atomic bombs over Alamagordo, Hiroshima. and Nagasaki lighted the dawn of the nuclear age, the age Winston Churchill called \"the second coming in wrath.\" Their increase by a factor of one thousand in the cale of de tructiveness was followed swiftly by yet another increase-aga in by a factor of one thousand-in ex\u00ad plosive power with the advent of the hydrogen bomb. Since then the world ha stockpiled some forty thousand nuclear b >mbs, about 99 percent of which be\u00ad long to the United States and the Soviet Union. Thi growth of nuclear tock\u00ad piles has occurred at the same time as, and despite, frequent official statements affirming the nations' solemn commitments to control and reduce the nuclear threat; despite also the realization that we: have accumulated so many nuclear weapons that the survival of civilization as we know it would be threatened were our nuclear stockpiles ever unleashed. lndieed, the number of nuclear warheads deployed by the United States and the Soviet Union on our long-range strategic systems has grown to more than fifteen thousand, or by a factor of more than two and one-half since we began the intensive SALT negotiating efforts a little more than ten years ago, with the primary purpose to limit these very same weapons. Not only have th y increased in numbers, their prodigiou s tech- 177 178 SIDNEY D. DRELL nological improvements have created new difficulties for arms control, for veri\u00ad fication, and for strategic stability at a faster pace than negotiations have progressed. We may draw some comfort from the fact that during all thi period our fear, revulsion, and respect for nuclear weapons have been effective in keeping us fr musing them-in spite of the fact that there have been numerous conflicts and opportunities. Indeed, deterrence has worked for more than three decades because we have recognized so far that the purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear war, and we have behaved accordingly. But how long will deter\u00ad rence last? The latest advances in weapons technology, especially in missile accuracy and reliability, now threaten to erode the very doctrine of deterrence itself. Jn its place are offered visions of limited nuclear war-fighting and win\u00ad ning. J consider these visions to be phantom s, phantoms that are dangerous as well as technically false. Their emergence, however, emphasizes the urgent need for us to learn to do things differently. That need is even more urgent now than it was twenty years ago when Jerome Wiesner wrote so eloquently in the 1960 issue of Daedalus devoted to arms control: \"Mankind 's almost universal desire is to halt the frightening arms race and to provide, by rule of law, the security now sought so futilely from nuclear armaments and ballistic missiles. While the goal is clearly visible, the course is not.\" Today we are still faced with a deadly dangerous dilemma. On one hand, we ha\\'e no evidence from history to lead to the conclusion that war in the long run can be avoided. On the other hand, there is also no evidence from history to tell us what a nuclear war would mean. An all-out nuclear conflict would shatter the whole fabric of our society and of our civilization built over the centuries. Beyond that, the long-term worldwide effects of a major nuclear conflict on man and the environment, and on their future evolution, are largely unpredictable. This dilemma of our nuclear times could be resolved in principle by doing away with war-or by doing away with nuclear weapons. Although neither of these achievements is very likely in the coming decade, or in the foreseeable future, they stand as mankind 's ultimate goals. They are, moreover, goals to be ad\u00ad dressed with some determination and hope. There is an old Navy saying to the effect that one wants to avoid disaster on his watch. In the past the limited goal of \"avoiding disaster on one's watch\" has proved tolerable for national security policy. But now that we are sitting on a deadly nuclear powder keg, such a view is no longer good enough. We can no longer work simply to \"get by on our watch.\" ot only must we avoid a nuclear conflict in our time, we must also meet the challenge to reduce and ultimately to remove the threat of a nuclear holocaust. This is the greatest challenge of our generation as well as our obligation to future generations. Andrei Sakharov has often expressed this same priority, most recently in a statement from his lonely exile in Gorky: \"] consiJer that averting thermo\u00ad nuclear war has absolute priority over all other problems of our times.\" How, then, should we begin addressing the question of nuclear survival? The recent collapse of the SALT 11 ratification process reminds us forcefully that it is neces\u00ad sary to have momentum and hope in our broad political task of resolving con\u00ad flicts and tensions while building toward a stable, just, and peaceful ARMS ONTROL : IS THERE TILL HOPE? 179 international order. In the narrower focus of efforts to control and reduce nucle\u00ad ar weapons and to avoid, or at least to minimize, the likelihood of nuclear con\u00ad flict, we have, in practice, but two means available to us: formal negotiations and mutual restraint in new weapons program s. (A third mean , unilateral dis\u00ad armament, I do not believe can carry us very far.) These two means-negotia\u00ad tions and mutual restraint-need not and should not be mutually exclusive. Indeed, we need them both! The record of the past two decades shows that neither means alone will suffice if we are to make effective progres in con\u00ad trolling and reducing nuclear weapons. During this time we have also experi\u00ad enced the difficulties that arise when negotiations have been allowed to stimulate anti restraint in the race to accumulate bargaining chips that too often, like Pinocchio, develop lives of their own. either the United States nor the So iet Union has a laudable record of r straint. Two notable examples of missed opportunities are MIRVs and the con\u00ad tinuing ICBM buildup following S LT I. Recall that the original justification for MIRVs was for penetrating ballistic mi sile defenses by saturating their comput\u00ad ers and radars and overwhelming their defensive firepower with an intense rain of man warheads. ev rth less, .s. MIR\\' programs proceeded full tilt after the SALT I treaty. which severely limited the deployment of ABM defen es and thereby removed the purported rationale for MIR s. Recall also that the con\u00ad sequence of the 'ALT I interim agreement on offensive systems was primarily to deflect the main focu. of work from the restricted to unrestricted area rather than to decrease it intensity. s a result, work proceeded full speed on missile improvements, leading to greater accuracy and reliability, and on more exten\u00ad sive MIRV deployments as the Soviets, in particular, built right up to the ALT limits. Independent of this dismal record of failure in restraint, both the nited States and the m\u00b7iet nion have recognized the importance of negotiati n and have worked hard at them, at lea t until very recently. Our progress is modest; to many, the achievements after years of effort are di appointing. They are not, however, negligible. In particular, we have the all-important ALT I treaty limit\u00ad ing ballistic missile defenses to a very low level of deplo ment. nd, of course, we also have the limited atmospheric te t ban treaty, on the books ince 1963. This is a major achievement. We, as will generations to come, value that treaty primarily for its contribution to protecting our environment from radioactive fallout. As an arms control measure, perhaps its greatest value was in setting so important and successful a precedent f vi ible cooperation in the arena of nu\u00ad clear weapons between the two major nuclear pow rs. Nevertheless, indepcnd nt of the e achievements and of the eventual fate of the SALT 11 treaty, th bankruptcy of modern man in our approach to nuclear weapons is evident. These are weapon of mass de truction, and the po ibility of ever using such weapon\u00b7 raises fundamental ethical and moral issue that should be faced at the center of our nati nal and international discussion and negotiation of nuclear weapon policy. Y t today these issue are muted in policy formulati on as \"vc continue to proliferate and diversify our nuclear stock\u00ad piles. How long can and will we continue to a\\\u00b7oid the fundamental question of u ing weapons of mass destruction? A Enrico Fermi and Isidor Rabi wrote in 180 SIDNEY 0. ORELL their addendum to the report by the General Advisory Committee of the A c in 1949 on the decision of whether or not to develop the so-called \"super\": It is clear that the use of such a weapon cannot be justified on any ethical ground which gives a human being a certain individuality and dignity even if he happens ro be a resident of an enemy country. The fact that no limits exist to the destructivcne s of this weapon makes its very existence and the kno\\\\'ledgc of its construc tion a danger to humanity as a whole. It i necessarily an evil thing considered in any lighr. At about this same time George Kennan wrote a personal paper as the coun\u00ad selor to Secretary of State Dean Acheson, expressing his concerns about the impact on t: .. policy of a growing reliance on atomic weapons of mass destruc\u00ad tion in our ar enals. The occasion was his resignation as director of the State Department Planning Staff, and he summarized his concerns eloquently: The ''capons of mass destruction ... reach backward beyond the frontiers of western ci,\u00b7ilization. to the concepts of warfare \\\\'hich were once familiar to the Asiatic hordes. They cannot really be reconciled with a political purpose directed to shaping. rather than de troying, the li\\\u00b7es of the adversary . They fail to rake account of the ultimate responsibility of men for one another, and even for each other's errors and mistakes. They imply the admission that man not only can be but is his O\\\\'n worst and most terrible enemy. And now thirty years and forty thousand nuclear weapons later the question of whether the use of nuclear weapons can be justified on any ethical grounds is rarely heard in our national debates, and almost never in our formal negotia\u00ad tions. All attention is riveted on questions such as how to put a ceiling on the further gro\\\\\"th in numbers of weapons by limiting the number of warheads to no more than ten per ICBM or fourteen per sea-launched ballistic missile! I am not suggesting that this is not also, in fact, an important question-as is our concern for maintaining a strategic stability based on our confidence that our nuclear weapons cannot be destroyed in a preemptive attack against them. But we seem to have so completely accepted the inevitability of a nuclear overarmed world, that we are lost in the maze of such details alone. Enmeshed in these details, we seem to have lost view ofthescaLe of the problem. We have grown so relaxed about the threat and so accustomed to coexistence as mutual hostages under a nuclear sword of Damocle s, that all our attention and effort is devoted to finely tuning a nuclear balance. With regard to our vast nuclear armories, which are continually being re\u00ad fined and polished and admired, I am reminded of the famous lines from Alexander Pope's Essay on Man: Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As to be hated, needs but to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace. Recall how Pope continues: But where th' Extreme of Vice, was ne'er agreed. and concludes: No creature own it in the first degree, But thinks his neighbour further gone than he. In a nutshell, that expresses our dilemma. Consumed by a detailed, quan\u00ad titative balancing of the nuclear vice that we have learned to endure and now embrace, each country accuses the other of owning more of what is evil than he himself possesses, and our nuclear debates and discussions have become like those of the cholastics f the thirteenth century. To them, the fundamental ethical and moral issues of religion had degenerated largely into questions of how many angels can fit on the head of a pin! In his recent book Endgame: The Inside Story of Salt II, Strobe Talbott has drawn the macabre parallel of how, for us, the nuclear debate has similarly microscoped down to how many MIRV can fit on the head of our m dern pins, the ICBMs. And, just as the de olation and devastation of the fourteenth century, with its hundred years of war , followed the thirteenth, are we destined to a similar or a worse fate in the twenty-first? Will future historians, if there are any, look back on the econd half of the twentieth century as the golden age of nuclear scholastics? If modern civilization is to improve its chances for avoiding nuclear holo\u00ad caust in the long run, it is absolutely necessary to return to fundamental issues uch as the one raised by Fermi and Rabi: \"It is clear that the use of such a weapon cannot be justified on any ethical ground which gives a human being a certain individuality and dignity even if he happens to be a resident of an enemy country.\" In today' world, with the initial conditions fixed by the existence of so many thousands of nuclear bombs and strategic rockets and bomb rs, we should not and cannot responsibly duck the same detailed is ues that ALT has elevated to such exaggerated prominence. Jt will help us to \"get b)' on this watch\" if we can reach agreement on these pe.cific issues-\u00b7uch a by negotiat\u00ad ing verifiable limits on numbers of warheads per mis ile, or on the volume, total thrust, and total throw-weight of different missile or bomber type . But it is now abundantly clear that we cann t and will not get \\\u00b7ery far if all our concern and efforts are f cused very narrowly on such detailed issu s. Furthermore, the rapidly advancing weapons technology and the gro\\\\'ing repertoire of u es and targets for nuclear weapons are threat ning to remove even the limited security we have sought through mutual deterrence. Before unbridled technology leads to this, we had better identify some basic principles that we must adhere to if we are to keep control over what is happen\u00ad ing. Perhaps then we may succeed in haping the future direction\u00b7 in arms control. I identify six such major principles. If we can hold to them and insist that they define the context within which con istent negotiating policies and restraint measures\\ ill be pursu d, we may have a chance. These principles are: I. The sole purpose of nuclear weapons in today's world, and for as long as they are deplo ed, must be to deter nuclear war. No other purpose should b assigned them. In singling out deterrence of nu lcar attack among the missions of our strate\u00ad gic nuclear forces, I am emphasizing that there are no sensible alternatives to a policy of deterrence for the foreseeab le future. Other missions for our strategic 182 SID Y D. DRELL nuclear forces have frequently been proposed , ranging from political or military coercion to limited nuclear war-fighting and \"winning.\" However , you can't win if you don't survive. I am convinced that the overwhelmingl y likely course of events of actually implementing any of these limited missions would be an escalation of hostilities to an almost total mutual destruction. Furthermore, this is a destruction against which, on technical grounds alone, there is no effective defense. Hence, I conclude that deterrence of nuclear attack is the proper mis\u00ad sion of our nuclear forces. Weapons development and force structures must be planned toward this goal as the single overriding priority. It has become stylish this year for revisioni ts to criticize as being immoral this view of deterrence as the u.s. strategic policy-it is frequently caricatured with the acronym MAD, for mutual assured destruction. We are told that the United tares should not be targeting cities and planning the annihilation of tens to hundreds of millions of people-but, with a higher morality, should target military and counterforce targets, sparing the innocent civilians. Frankly, I am puzzled as to why this strawman has been exhumed and is being Railed at this time, since it represents a circumstance with essentially no logical con\u00ad nection with today's weapons realities. ssured destruction requires but a small percentage of our deployed war\u00ad heads. Of our current total of well O\\\u00b7er nine thousand nuclear warheads on our strategic bombers and missiles, only a few hundred are needed to obliterate the largest Soviet citie along with two thirds of their total industrial base and close to 100 million residents-and this is due to immediate damage alone. Evidently, the United 'rates has a sizable counterforce capacity in addition to its capacity for assured destruction. In fact, we have had a substantial counterforce capabili\u00ad ty since the early 1960s. At pre\u00b7ent the characteristics as well as the large num\u00ad bers of our rapidly retargettable, highly MIRVed forces present very extensive counterforce capabilities. They give u , in particular, the potential to respond in measure with the provocation-known as tlexible response-against a broad spectrum of Soviet military targets, including na\\\u00b7al bases, air bases, petroleum depots, assembly points, transshipment points, and so on. A broad repertoire of flexible response and counterforce is a reality of today's strategic force -both for the nitcd States and the Soviet nion. In fact, it has long been recognized that flexible response enhances deterrence by increasing the range of political options and maneuvers prior to conflict. Moreover, flexible response is still growing as a result of our technical virtuosity with nuclear weaponry . It is this very growth in the repertoire of conterforcc missions, to include the capabilities to strike an opponent's missile forces in their hardened silos, that we now sec posing a threat to deterrence. Today's debate in the United States on Minute\u00ad man vulnerability and the need for a new basing scheme for a large new MX missile with ten MIRVS is a reaction to the developing Soviet counterforce threat against the Minuteman silos. The deployment of missiles that pose substantia l and credible preemptive threats against major components of each other's arsenals of nuclear retaliatory forces conflicts with the goal of maintaining a stable strategic deterrence. A clear choice between these two alternatives must be made by both the Soviet Union and the nited States. At this perilous fork in the road, both countries must effectively limit, as well as direct, the development of new weapons technology ARMS CO TROL: IS THERE TILL HOPE? 183 in order to maintain a deterrence ba ed on survivab le retaliatory forces. Such a stable deterrence is not an end in itself, but it can provide a base from which to work roward substantial reductions and, eventually, toward comprehensive disarmament . 2. No matter how small its yield, a nuclear weapon is fundamentally dif- ferent from a nonnuclear one. It has a long memory-a deadly radio\u00ad active memory. Furthermore, once the first nuclear weapon is used in anger, once the one-way bridge is crossed from nonnuclear to nuclear conflict, what will restrain the nations involved from escalating further when they believe their vital interests are at stake and they hold such vast stores of nuclear weap\u00ad ons in reserve? Will there be any effective limiting forces amidst the confusion and pressure of battle? This assertion that there is a fundamental difference between nuclear and nonnuclear weapons was widely challenged! several years ago during the extend\u00ad ed debate about the so-called neutron bomb-the enhanced radiation weap n that would be tail red to give more radiati 1n that is deadly to humans only, but le s blast and heat that destroy everything in their way. This weapon was proposed as a more usable nuclear weapon\u00b7-particularly in th defense of high\u00ad ly developed and den cly populated area such a Western Europe-because of the reduced collateral damage it would produce if delivered with precise accura\u00ad cy. On this basis it was argued that the impro\\\u00b7ed warhead, by making the initial us of nuclear weapons in battle seem more credible, \"\u00b7ould enhance deterrence. However, there is another side to this coin .. By the same token, it can be argued that this warhead also increases the likelih >Od that nuclear weapons would ac\u00ad tually be u ed in combat. Once this or any oth r nuclear weapon has been used, the danger of further nuclear escalation is j~ t as great. A decision to use the neutron bomb would be n less grave than a decisi n to u e any other tactical nuclear weapons. I can think of no more dangerous folly than trying to fuzz the fundamental difference between nuclear a111d nonnuclear weapons. 3. uclear war would be so great an extrap lation of the cale of di aster in human experience, and so great a physical disturbance of our environ\u00ad ment and ecosph re, that the unknowns of a nuclear conflict cl arly far out\u00ad weigh the knowns or predictables. Yet ther appear more and more detailed calculations that describe how hundreds of million of people will beha e in all\u00ad out conflict, when deadly radioactive rain will fall for many months. These calculations also predict casualty levels and recovery times \\Vith incredible pre\u00ad cision. The fascination with these calculations remind me of the exchange in George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara b tween Lomax, a oung man-about\u00ad town, and ndrew Undershaft, a millionair munitions manufacturer. To Lomax's comment, \"Well, the mor destructive war becomes. the s oner it will be abolished, eh?\" Undershaft retort: \"I\\ ot at all. The more destructive war becomes the m re fascinating we find it.\" Keep this in mind when you hear claims made on the basis of calculation as to how much ci ii defense will contribute to the survival of ho' many pc pie, and thereby to an ultimate victory, in a nuclear war for a nation that will suffer 184 SIDNEY 0. DRELL only 20 million fatalities while killing 60 million of their enemy! It is also well to keep in mind how rapidly individual units of society descend to chaos and fall apart at much lower levels of stress-just remember what happens during sud\u00ad den blackouts. Ir makes you wonder how societies will react after just one ther\u00ad monuclear weapon has hit-much less a hundred or several thousand. Civil defense is, of course, a very important issue. It is also a very personal, and at times emotional, one because it touches the basic human instinct of sur\u00ad vival. The potential for disaster is ever present in our society, and it hardly seems prudent to make no plans for survival or recovery in the event of a natural or a man-made disaster or accident, nuclear or otherwise. It is one thing, how\u00ad ever, t0 view civil defense preparations as one does the lifeboats on an ocean liner, as insurance against unanticipated disasters. It would be quite a different matter to chart a course through ice fields and tO risk running into icebergs because one plans to rely on the lifeboats for survival. The analogue of this reckless course would be to prepare tO wage limited nuclear conflicts, relying on extensive civil defense preparations to reduce nationwide fatalities due to fallout to relatively low levels. Yet this is precisely what the Defense Department advo\u00ad cated in late 1974 in its presentation to the Congress. Fortunately, many of the claims of civil defense effectiveness and of prospects of \"acceptably low\" casual\u00ad ty levels were quickly shown to be false in a study organized by the Congres\u00ad sional Office of Technology Assessment, and the United States did not reorient its basic policy of deterrence toward one of preparing, on dubious technical and dangerous strategic grounds, for limited nuclear war-fighting. 4. In striving for progress in arms control, one needs bold steps that are timely and negotiable-and preferably simple. In order to begin and to sustain such bold steps, there must exist a strong political will and commitment by our leaders. Otherwise, the experts become mired-at times, hopelessly-in microscopic issues of technical balance, in insignificantly delicate details. The SALT n negotiations became an object lesson on this very point. There are no issues of nuclear survival that require the negotiation of a finely tuned balance. The crucial value of political will and decisiveness for progress was well illus\u00ad trated early in 1972. After several years of almost stalemated haggling both within the government as well as in the negotiations themselves, President Nixon provided an important impetus when he announced that we would have an ABM treaty that year. And, indeed, it was not long thereafter that the experts successfully negotiated an ABM treaty that remains our greatest arms control achievement at this time. There is also a lesson in the failure of the comprehen\u00ad sive SALT 11 proposal of March 1977 by the Carter Administration. This pro\u00ad posal called for substantia l reductions in the deployment of strategic forces, along with restraints on missile tests that would have prevented, or at least greatly delayed, the weapons improvements that have created today's worries about ICBM vulnerability and the perceived need for the MX. Unfortunately, that most important part of the March comprehensive proposal was burdened by many detailed numerical provisions that were highly contentious; the pro\u00ad posal was presented publicly in a manner that diminished its negotiability; and eventua lly there was no alternative but to retreat from its bold and imaginative ARM CO TROL: IS THERE STILL HOPE? 185 provisions . I hope the lesson learned from that failure will improve negotiating tactics in the future, but not scare either the United States or the Soviet Union from making bold proposals. 5. In our society there is no substitute for, nor power equal to that of, a responsible public constituency that is. informed and aware of the basic issues of nuclear weapons policy. One need not master all technical details in the arms control debate, but the question of scale must be comprehended. In \"avoiding disaster on our watch' for the past thirty-five year , the sear\u00ad ing, vivid memories of the holocaust of Hiroshima and agasaki have been important. I wish l knew an effective means to keep those memories from fading away. A world that retains such vast nuclear\u00b7 armories as we have today, but that loses its pecial fear and appreciation of their enormous scale of destruc\u00ad tiveness, will be a more dangerous place to live. A nuclear overarmed world that ha forgotten the horror that led five-year-old M yeko in John Hersey's Hiroshima to ask, in the midst of the dust and debris of the devastated city, \"Why is it night already?\" is surely not safe. 6. Arms control is an important part of our national security. Thus far we have had no effe \u00b7rive controls on ffensive nuclear weaponry, and it is clear that each step forward in the arms race to more and improved weapons ha lessened our security. If we are to reverse thi trend, it will be neces ary to under\u00ad stand the arms control impact of new weapons bef re making a decision wheth\u00ad er to deploy them. The importance of the arms control factor was understood, and played an essential role, in the ABM debate of ten years ago. This also led to our negotiating the very valuable 'ALT I treaty that everely limited ABM de\u00ad pl yments. By way of contrast, we lo t important opportunit ies for arms con\u00ad trol by the decision to move ahead on MIRVs without fir t making a erious effort to avoid tbeir extensive deployment. At this very time we ee the dollar costs and the strategic costs of that lost opportunity in the form of the MX prograin. The MX is designed to be the u. s. response to the growing thr at to our land\u00ad based Minuteman force po cd by the highly accurate and reliable MIRVed I BMs now being deployed by the Soviet Union. It i a symbol of the failure of arms control. The deployment of the MX is a very major decision now being faced by our country. Not only will it shape the .. nuc'lear deterrent through the rest of this century, it will also have a major effect on the future of arm control. For these reasons I want to describe it in some detail. As currently proposed by the Carter dministration, MX refers to a large new missile and to a new basing scheme. The missile is the largest one con is\u00ad tent with the provisions of s LT 11. Its warhead is fractionated into ten MIRVs, which is also the largest number for an I BM that is consistent with SALT 11. (Do we see here, unfortunately, another effect f negotiations on re traint?) The proposed MX deployment is in a land-based multiple aimpoint sy tern that relies extensively on secrecy and deception in order to maintain uncertainty in the location of the missile, so that it cannot be targeted. ntil a short time ago this basing scheme took the form of two hundred racetrack s. The racetrack s have 186 SID EY D. DRELL since been straightened out into a linear grid pattern, but this change has very little impact on the operational complexitie s and deficiencies of the system. On each grid there will be twenty-three hardened concrete shelters, one genuine MX missile, and twenty-two dummy missiles. The dummy missiles are there to protect the location uncertainty of the real one by simulating all the signature of a real MX in each of the shelters or on the move between shelters. The first question it is natural to ask about the MX i : Do we need it? The loss fthe Minuteman force would not mean the loss ofu.s. retaliatory capabili\u00ad ty. The other t\u00b7wo legs of our strategic triad include approximatel y three fourth\u00b7 of our deployed nuclear warheads. They arc secure and arc being strengthened, the strategic bombers with longer-range air-launched cruise missiles and the nuclear ubmarines with the modern new Trident boats, as well as the longer\u00ad range and more powerful Trident mis ile . Therefore, it is natural to ask wheth\u00ad er we need to respond at this time to the percei\\'ed growing threat to our land\u00ad based ICB~ls in the fixed, hardened silos. Apparently, this question has already been answered in the affirmative by the country for a variety of reasons, in part political, in part strategic, and in part technical. It has been judged to be an unacceptable policy for the United tates simply to accept, without a response, a substant ial decrease in confidence in the in\\'ulncrability of a major component of our trategic retaliatory power, and we arc now moving ahead with an MX program. The mi sile itself is being dc\\'cloped with initial Right tests scheduled in 19 3. The basing scheme, however, is still being debated in the Congress. Although I recognize that the Carter Administrat ion has made a serious effort to de\\'ise a basing mode that is con istent \\\\'ith the past record of the SALT negotiations, and that will not impede prospects for future progress in arms control, l have serious problems with its proposal. I believe that a linear grid scheme-and, in fact, any land-based multiple aimpoint scheme-is seriously flawed for contributing to our national security and, furthermore, it presents seriou problems for arms control. I list the following as its mo t serious problems: The requirement of maintaining confidence in secrecy, in decep\u00ad tion, and in extensive simulation procedures amidst our society. n acute sensitivity to the threat. It is nece sary to be able to fore\u00ad cast accurately the number of warhead s the Soviets will be deploy\u00ad ing and that could threaten the MX. In particular, the ALT 11 restraints on numbers of warheads per missile, as well as on total numbers of missiles, are required in order to plan the number of shelters and dummy missiles we will have to deploy. In the absence of current or future SALT limits on the maximum number of threat\u00ad ening Soviet warheads, a multiple aimpoint system has no assur\u00ad ance of catching up with the threat. It may lead to nothing more than an open-ended race between Soviet warheads and u.s. con\u00ad crete shelter -hardly an attractive prospect. An alternati ve pros\u00ad pect of defending the MX with an antiballistic missile system has also been discussed. This would require abrogating the ABM treaty of SALT 1, an even less attractive prospect. The requirement of cooperative operational procedures to ensure that no more than the stipulated number of missiles are deployed in the guise of decoys; these procedures, which include barriers on access roads and removable plugs in ceilings of assembly buildings and shelters to allow periodic satelli1re viewing, will further stress the verification requirements of an enforceable arms control treaty. Thi will be a particular problem if the Soviet nion follows our example by depl ying a multiple aimpoint system of their own as their response to the extensive countersilo threat against their ICBMs that will be posed by the two thousand very accurate MLRVs on our two hundred MX missiles. The United States should not now make the commitment to deploy the MX linear grid system. It has flaws, and creates difficultie . Moreover, it is not necessary for us to plunge ahead at this time-given the two other components of the strategic triad that are strong and secure and are currently being further strengthened by major modernization programs. It is precisely the strength of the triad, that one can rely confidently on two good legs while solving the vul\u00ad nerabilities that threaten the third one. It is far more important that we make a wi e decision than a quick one for the new \\!IX deployment. As a technical man, I realize that it is not always possible to come up with a good technical answer to every technical problem, but I am confident that we can do beter than the MX linear grid system, both for our national security and for arms control prospects. It is at discouraging moments like this-with both the nited States and the Soviet Union moving roward decisions on major new weapons sy terns and with formal arms control negotiations recessed for an indefinite period-that we must remind ourselves again why we cannot give up hope f r arm control. We, meaning both the Soviet Union and the nited States, must remind ourselves of the enormity of the destructive power of tlhe nuclear weapons we are dealing with and of the scale of human tragedy and suffering if they were e\\'er used. It is imperative that we reestablish an effective, aggressive, national-as well as in\u00ad ternational-forum for discussing the basic issues such as addressed thirty years ago by those who questioned whether the use of nuclear weap ns could ever be justified on any ethical grounds. It is not en iugh just to discuss and anal ze the nuts and bolts of weapons technology. We must never lose sight of the change in the nature of war due to nuclear weapon . Shakespeare in Henry IV, Part II, wrote of the Archbishop of York who could ju tify his path of insurrection by saying: I have in equal alanc justly weighed V hat wrongs our arm may do, what wrongs we suffer, nd find our griefs heavier than our offences. That was before the nu lear era, which in our times transforms the Archbishop of York into Father Sieme , a Jesuit priest writing from the rubble of Hiroshima to the Holy Sec in Rome, as reported by John Hersey: The crux of the matter is whether total war in its present form is justifiable, even when it serves a just purpose. That question is today as inescapable as it is difficult. Pre ident Kennedy addressed it directly in his speech \"Toward a Strategy of Peace,\" at American niver ity in 1963: I speak of peace becau e of the new face of war. Tora! war makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relati,\u00b7ely invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to these forces. It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost I 0 times the explosive force deliv\u00ad ered by all of the Allied airforces in the Second \\,\\'orld War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by the wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generation yet unborn .... Peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be ine,\u00b7itable. Fi nail_ , we-and by this I mean, of course, the Soviet Union as well as the United States-must also not lose sight of the eventual goal of eradicating the vice of nuclear weapons as we parry and propagandize as to who owns, in lexander Pope's words, the \"Extreme of Vice.\" Right now is the time when it is crucial that both sides adhere to rules of reasonable self-restraint until negotia\u00ad tions get back on track. It is surely a deeply shared need of the United States and the Soviet Union\" not to let too many more watches pass before we make genuine progress in controlling and reducing nuclear weapon .

A-Blast, Doctors Warned By Charles Petit cience Correspondent A single one-megaton nuclear bomb detonated over San Francisco's City Hall would kill 780,000 persons outright and leave 382,000 persons doomed to die, a physician told a medical audience in San Francisco yesterday. A horrifying sC\u20acnario of the collapse of organized medicine in the aftermath of nuclear war was carefully spelled out by physicists and medical doctors in the War Memorial Veterans Building as part of a series of meetings designed to recruit the medical' profession into active opposition to the nuclear arms race. Its organizers emphasized that they do not support unilateral disarmament by the Onited States. They ex\u00ad pressed alarm at suggestions that the United States must acquire more and more nuclear arms, and at suggestions by some defense analysts that a nuclear war is winnable. The human casualties of a nuclear blast over San Francisco were spelled out to about 1000 persons, half of them physicians, by Dr. H. Jack Geiger, professor of community medicine at the City College of New York. He estimated that, from blast and radiation effects, and the firestorms following, 780,000 of the 3.6 million persons living in San Francisco, Alameda, Marin, San Mateo, and Contra Costa counties would die immediate\u00ad ly. There would be 382,000 persons seriously injured. Few would live. Many would survive if they were cared for in a modern medical center, he said, but such care would be virtually unobtainable . If the bomb hit during working hours, be estimated that of the 24,000 doctors in the five counties fewer than 3000 would survive in healthy enough condition to provide care. A third or more of the 63 hospitals and their 12,000 beds would have been destroyed, and those still standing would lack electrici\u00ad ty or water and would soon run out of medications. \"We tend always to think in terms of rescue from the outside,\" said Geiger, \"but in any likely scenario today there will be no outside, because every other major area will be similarly afflicted.\" \"There essentially would be no hope,\" be said. \"If every doctor treated people as fast as he could, and worked 20 hours a day, it would take them 15 days to work their way through all the injured, spending 15 minutes with each. \"Without X-rays, diagnostic equipment, and medi\u00ad cation, what good does it do to be a doctor?\" Dr. Howard H. Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, urged doctors who remain aloof from nuclear arms issue to reconsider . \"Our very silence permits or encourages the nuclear arms race to continue, making almost inevita\u00ad ble, either by design or by chance, what could be the last epidemic our civilization will know,\" he declared . The meeting was organized by Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Council for a Livable World Education Fund, with sponsorship from the University of California at San Francisco, Stanford University School of Medicine, and the University of CaWornia, Berkeley, School of Public Health. The meeting in San Francisco follows similar meetings earlier in the year in Cambridge, Mass., and New York. But whether they mark a genuine growth in popular support for disarmament is still not clear. An optimistic note among supporters of aggressive negotia\u00ad tion of disarmament was sounded by MIT physicist Bernard T. Feld, one of the participants in the Manhattan Project ~d editor of the influential Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists . Much of the traditional disarmament movement has been dominated by physicists , he said, \"but those are just crazy physicists in the eye of the public, guilty over building the bomb in the first place. H other groups, such as physicians, begin to speak up, however, maybe people will listen. \"1 must say that for reasons I can't really quantify, in the past six months people are getting more involved. There is interest from doctors, and also from educators and other professionals. These are not just ban-the-bomb-at-any-cost types, but thoughtful people who are seriously concerned.\" THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, Friday, November 28, 1980 How Doctors Hope to Stop Nuclear War By RICHARD D. JAMES Sta/! Reporter oJ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAN FRANCISCO -A somber audience of about 1,000 persons spent two days recently considering a ghastly scenario: Suppose a nuclear bomb packing the punch of a million tons of TNT were to burst over this city at 3 p.m. on a clear fall day. A circle of devastation would be spread three miles wide. Winds of 500 miles an hour generated by the shock wave would sweep everybody and everything out of high-rise office buildings. Four miles distant, wood frame houses and clothing would ignite spontaneously, the listeners were told. At more than eight miles, exposed people would suffer second\u00ad degree burns and windows would be turned into lethal particles traveling 100 miles an hour. Even at a distance of 16 miles, fire\u00ad stonns would raise temperatures to 2,000 degrees, and at 35 miles, persons who looked at the bomb's fireball would be blinded. In sum, it would be an almost unimagina\u00ad ble holocaust, killing about 800,000 people and fatally injuring another 400,000. The medical problems afterwards would be hor\u00ad rific. The medical aspect was what the 1,000 persons, half of them doctors, had gathered to hear about at a symposium here. Concerned Physicians Medical experts and nuclear scientists, members of a group called Physicians for Social Responsibility, vividly detailed the likely consequences of a nuclear blast and considered how doctors and nurses might deal with them. Their conclusion was that the country's sophisticated medical system would be over\u00ad whelmed by even a limited nuclear war and that there couldn't be any possible effective medical response or civil defense. The symposium, sponsored by the Uni\u00ad versity of California and Stanford University medical schools, was one of several held around the country in past months. Consciousness Raising The aim is to reduce the likelihood of nu\u00ad clear war by raising public consciousness about the medical consequences . \"Leaders of the world appear not to understand the medical realities of nuclear war and we are here to describe them,\" says Dr. Howard H. Hiatt, dean of Harvard's school of public health. \"Where treatment is ineffective, at\u00ad tention must be given to prevention.\" Physicians for Social Responsibility de\u00ad scribes itself as an organization \"dedicated to public education on medical aspects of nuclear technology. \" According to its presi\u00ad dent, Dr. Helen Caldicott , a Boston pediatri\u00ad cian and author, membership has grown to 2,500 physicians from 10 two years ago. One symposium theme was that a nu\u00ad clear attack would wipe out most of a city's doctors, nurses and hospitals because of their central location. Using data from Hiro\u00ad shima and Nagasaki, Dr. H. Jack Geiger, medical professor at New York's City Col\u00ad lege, estimates that, In the hypothetical San Francisco blast, only 2,000 of the area's 12,- 400 doctors would live and only 2,000 of 12,- 500 hospital beds would be left Intact. Unenviable Plight \"It works out that there would be one doctor for every 1,000 to 1,700 injured per\u00ad sons,\" he says. \"We are talking about inju\u00ad ries of the most severe nature.\" With sur\u00ad viving physicians working 20 hours a day, it would take them eight days to see every in\u00ad jured person. Even then a doctor could spend only 10 minutes with each patient, and without electricity and sophisticated medi\u00ad cal equipment , the visit would be of little use. That also assumes, he explains, that doctors wouldn't spend any time treating other illnesses. Burns would be the most crushing bur\u00ad den, according to Dr. John Constable, Har\u00ad vard Medical School professor and surgeon. Second and third degree burns would be sus\u00ad tained out to six miles from the blast. \"There is no injury that takes more medical manpower, \" he says. \"There would be thousands of severe burn cases, yet U.S. hospitals only have the capability of treating a total of 1,000 burn victims at one time; the medical system would choke completely on burn victims alone,\" Dr. Constable says. lllstory No Guide Disease from the dead would be wide\u00ad spread. In the San Fnlncisco blast, it was estimated there would be 300,000 to 500,000 corpses. \"We can find no recorded event of that magnitude, \" Dr. Geiger says. The scientists also dealt with other dev\u00ad astating effects. Radiation from detonating only a small fraction of exiSting nuclear weapons (about 50,000) would seriously de\u00ad plete the atmosphere 's ozone layer which screens out most of the sun's harmful ultra\u00ad violet rays. Anyone venturing outside with\u00ad out eye protection would be blinded. \"We can wear sunglasses , but the animals and birds can't,\" says Kosta Tsipis, Massachu\u00ad setts Institute of Technology physicist. \"They would be blinded and die, and the en\u00ad tire ecosystem would collapse,'' The sobering two-day meeting concluded with warnings fi:om several quarters. \"Military men today honestly think they can win a nuclear war,\" fonner Pentagon strat\u00ad egist Gene LaRocque, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, said. \"That's the nature of the military mind. We are conditioned to think we can pick ourselves up from the rubble and start again. Well, after a nuclear war, forget it.\" ON THE GO Sinall Hotels of San Francisco Give Special Charm to the City ... BY JERRY HULSE Times Travel Editor SAN FRANCISCO-And now for an update of our file on San Francis\u00ad co's little hotels. A roll of the drums, maestro, please. Although it has been three years since our last roundup, first place goes once more to that pleasant small hotel, the Raphael. It wins hands down and for good reason. The Raphael is spotless, it's cheery, it's charming and it's cheap (singles are $37 a night, doubles go for $49). Undisputedly, it remains San Fran\u00ad cisco's friendliest small hotel. Every\u00ad one, it seems, is smiling: the doormen, the maids, the cagruer. Yes, even its urbane manager, Phil Creamer. With 150 immaculate rooms, the Raphael at 386 Geary St. is conveni-ent to the theater district and only half a block off Union Square. Here is one of the city's few small hotels that provides air conditioning (other hoteliers insist this is nonsense in wind-washed San Francisco). In addition, each of the Raphael's rooms contains two telephones (one in the bath, the other beside the bed) as well as color TV and AM-FM radio. But it is neither telephone nor TY that provides the charm. It is the lit\u00ad tle touches that count. Among them is an exhibition of modern art: framed posters of such masters as Chagall, Matisse, Picasso and others. And then there are the guest room doors: Throughout the hotel each has been hand-painted and signed by art\u00ad ist Jedson Dalton. Bowls of flowers brighten the Ra\u00ad phael's cheery lobby with its books, its chandelier and grandfather . clock; Steps away, guests snack in a cof\u00ad fee shop and bar. Proprietors of the Raphael bill it as \"San Francisco's 'little' elegant ho\u00ad tel.\" Sens. Alan Cranston \u00b7and Barry Goldwater have slept here, as well as the Bishop of London. It is first rate. What more can I say? And then there is the Beresford at 635 Sutter St. (singles $28-$30. dou\u00ad bles $32-$34), with its intimate Vic\u00ad torian lobby and neatly furnished rooms. Office workers gather after work in the hotel's publike lounge, the White Horse Taverne. No London local ever provided more atmosphere. Pints are served to a standing-room-only crowd of San Franciscan~ and out-of\u00ad towners. Please Turn to Page 13, Col. 1 PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, INC.

He is a member of the California Medical Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and Physicians for Social Responsibility. What is the physician's role in the prevention of nuclear war? Recently, two physicians approached the organized medical community with this question. Speaking before the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association, Howard Hiatt, M.D., Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, suggested that, \"Talk of the use of nuclear weapons is a kind of epidemic but with the term epidemic stretched beyond any meaning previously known.111 Roger Bulger, M.D., President of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, wrote in the September 12, 1980, issue of the Journal of the American Medic2l Associ2ti on that, \" we as physicians have the - Obligation to transmit to our fellow citizens the nature of the effects of a nuclear war on us and the whole human race.112 Eighteen years ago, a group of physicians took up this question and published an article entitled, \"The 'Medical Consequences of Thermonuclear War,\" in The New England Journal \u00a3!._Medicine.3 The introduction reminded readers that, '' there are some situations in which prevention is the only effective therapy. It is hoped that readers will be stimulated to play a greater part in the search for peaceful alternatives to thermonuclear war.114 If the physician should accQpt a role in the prevention of this ultiC!ldte medical catastroph~, it is then necessary to consider factors which either increase or decrease the likelihood of nuclear war. It is here that the organized medical community has traditionally declined to become involved, observing that these considerations are outside the boundary of medical ex\u00ad pertise. I wo~ld like to suggest that in seve~al critical areas medical expertise can make an important contribution. These areas include: (1) The need to estimate the injury, death and disease that result from nuclear detonations. (2) The need to estimate the likelihood of accidental nuclear war due to the failure of technology and technology con\u00ad trol. (3) The need to estimate the likelihood of intentional nuclear war initiated by psychologically disturbed individuals. A recent Scientific American inquiry suggests that a serious underestimation exists among some military analysts of the destructive effects of nuclear \u00b7 weapons on health and the environrnent.5 This error may have led to the formulation of the new strategy of limited nuclear war. The effects of such a limited exchange may be far greater than realized and may lower the risk threshhold for all-out nuclear war.6 The editors of the New York Times were recently alarmed by the failure of a 46 cent electronic circuit at the Strategic Air Command that twice led to the incorrect perception of a Soviet nuclear attack within a three day per\u00ad iod. 7 As physi c~ans familiar with machinery upon which life depends we are continued cognizant of the potential for failure often inherent in complex systems. We are all aware of the occasional morbidity and mortality secondary to the malfunction of hardware such as respirators and heart-lung bypass devices. And we are all familiar with the rare but occasional failure of the well trained operators of such equipment. Whereas in our medical practice tech\u00ad nological malfunction may affect the health of one patient in the arena of the command and control of nuclear weapons it may lead to global holocaust. Finally, as physicians and scientists, we recognize the potential for the best of planning to be sabatoged by disturbed individuals. A glance at any daily newspaper informs us of the prevalence of this instability, too often present in the leaders of certain developing nations. It is thus most dis\u00ad turbing to know that the international availability of nuclear fuels for electricity generation is leading to the soon irreversible proliferation of nuclear weapons.8 It is quite likely that a medical contribution would result in an increased appreciation of the medical damage from nuclear detonations and an increased appreciation of the likelihood of nuclear war due to technological error or psychological aberration. This could be an invaluable c0ntrib Jtion tc the deliberations of policy makers who wish to increase the security of our CvJL.try and Lhe secucity of the w.:irl~. I strongly urge that the Committee on Environmental Health consider the question of the physicians role in the prevention of nuclear war. The con\u00ad tinued evolution of our civilization, our science, and our grandchildren may await our timely answer. I.

WARNKE Attorney Alfiliauons For ldentificauon Only September 1, 1980 Dear Council Supporter: At the recent Democratic National Convention in New York, major speeches were made by Council Board members Paul Warnke on the MX and John Kenneth Galbraith on arms control. I, as Council President, addressed the convention on a range of issues connected with nuclear weapons; this was carried on prime time television by the three major networks. The Council for a Livable World furnished important financial and organizational assistance to the delegates who sought to amend the Democratic platform by eliminating support for the MX. This effort lost by only 597 votes out of 3,151 despite the fact that President Carter appealed to each delegate in a handwritten letter as \"your Commander-in-Chief\" and put Defense Secretary Harold Brown as well as most of the Cabinet on the convention floor to lobby. Our July newsletter \"1980 U.S. Senate Elections and Arms Control\" listed Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon as a hawk running for re-election. He was also described as the heavy favorite against state senator Ted Kulongoski. Since then, Kulongoski has made extraordinary progress; public opinion polls now give him a good chance to upset the incumbent. There never was any question about Kulongoski's support for arms control, only about his electability. The Council for a Livable World endorses Ted Kulongoski with enthusiasm. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin is besieged by hawks and conservatives in his bid for re-election. In what has become the pattern for 1980, this solid and reliable arms control activist is being dramatically outspent. This is the second time the Council has appealed for contributions for Senator Nelson. He needs the funds if he is not to be upset. May we remind you that contributions made through the Council guarantee the candidates' awareness of a substantial issue-oriented constituency for arms control. ~1~~me Grossman~ President Enclosures: of Ted Kulongoski *Profile of Senator Gaylord Nelson ~\u00b7\u00b7 Founded in 1962 by Leo Szilard~ One of the sleepers of the 1980 election cam\u00ad paign may come in the Oregon Senate race. At the beginning of this year, Republican Senator Bob Packwood appeared to have clear sailing in his bid for a third term. Now he is faced with a determined challenge from a bright, young and articulate state senator, Ted Kulongoski , who has an increasingly promising opportunity for an upset. Ted Kulongoski has taken strong positions on Council for a Livable World issues, including sup\u00ad port for arms control measures and opposition to excessive military spending . But there was a serious question whether he could get elected against an incumbent raising record amounts of money and in a year when a tide seems to be running toward the Republicans . The evidence is building that in tact Kulongoski can win against the hawkish Packwood and that the challenger is building momentum tor the final two months of the campaign. Jn May Kulongoski won a surprisingly lopsided primary victory against tour opponents , polling close to 50% of the vote. Then in July, the Oregon AFL-CIO , which has been heavily courted by Packwood tor the last few years, surprised ob\u00ad servers by overwhelmingly backing Kulongoski over Packwood . Other independent unions have also endorsed the challenger . The latest polls also show a tightening race. Where Packwood led Kulongoski last December by a 55% to 25% margin with 20% undecided, the widely respected Oregon Poll released in August shows Packwood 's margin down to 42% to 34% with 24% undecided-despite the tact that Ku\u00ad longoski 's name recognition is only 47% in the state. An incumbent with only 42% of the vote at this point in the campaign has serious weak\u00ad nesses. One of Packwood 's problems is the general anti-incumbent feeling that has struck Republi\u00ad cans as well as Democrats , especially in Oregon. Moreover , there is disenchantment with his at\u00ad tempts to be all things to all people, rarely taking a strong position on issues. And finally. there is the money question. Packwood has been an extremely successful fundraiser in this campaign . He has already taken in over $1.5 million, the most by a factor of three in Oregon's political history. This money, helpful to be sure in running a campaign , has at the same time aroused resentment as an attempt to buy the election in a state known for low-key, low-budget retail politics. If Kulongoski can go on to victory, it would be a strong pick-up for arms control in the Senate. Kulongoski , born in Missouri, is a labor lawyer elected as an Oregon state representative and then state senator. He is a strong supporter of the SALT II Treaty. \"SALT II,\" says Kulongoski , \"is needed even more today than last year, due to the heightened arms competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and due to the economic problems this country faces. It is in America's military and economic interest and America's hope for world peace to try to limit the arms com\u00ad petition rather than to engage to new arms esca\u00ad lation.\" Kulongoski also opposes the MX missile. \"To spend billions of dollars on the MX missile that all the military strategists say will be obsolete by the time it is to be deployed makes no military or economic sense.\" Kulongoski has not hesitated to criticize the Carter Administration for its overreaction to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , accusing the Ad\u00ad ministration of trying to distract public attention from the equally serious problems of energy and the economy . He also opposes across-the-board increases in military spending whether in reac\u00ad tion to Middle East instability or to political pres\u00ad sures. Kulongoski told the Optimist Club in Roseburg , Oregon, that \"I personally do not be\u00ad lieve it is in the best interests of this country ... to attempt to resolve the energy problems of Amer\u00ad ica by larger and larger military budgets that di\u00ad rect more and more of this nation's natural resources to the military-industrial complex of our economy. \" Packwood's record on arms control and mili\u00ad tary issues, on the other hand, has been dismal. He first won election in 1968 by knocking oft the first and foremost opponent of the Vietnam war, the venerable Sen. Wayne Morse. Packwood won by fewer than 2,000 votes out of 784,000 cast. While being careful during the election campaign to avoid a label of hawk or dove on Vietnam and arms control \u00b7issues, upon taking office Pack\u00ad wood quickly began establishing a generally hawkish posture on major issues that has con\u00ad tinued to today. In one of his earliest key votes, Packwood helped to save President Richard Nixon's ABM plan in the dramatic 1969 50-50 tie vote on an amendment by Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R\u00ad Me.). Today, Packwood is a staunch supporter of the MX missile program , and voted against an amendment in 1979 by his fellow Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield (R) that would have terminated the program . Midway through his first term, Packwood voted for the SALT I Treaty, but at the same time sup\u00ad ported the Jackson (D-Wash .) amendment to the treaty resolution that weakened the spirit of the treaty and set the stage for the hawks' assault on SALT II last year. During the Senate's 1979 con\u00ad sideration of the now-shelved SALT 11 Treaty, Packwood refused to commit himself for or against the treaty, and raised concerns .ov~r the Soviet Backfire bomber and treaty venf1cat1on . When faced with military spending questions , Packwood tends to support higher military bud\u00ad gets. In 1979, for example , he voted for a Hollings (D-S.C.) amendment to the budget resolution to increase the defense budget by 5% real growth. During the debate on the Hollings proposal , Packwood jumped into the discussion with a Sep\u00ad tember 18, 1979 speech that included the follow\u00ad ing: \"At some stage, your level of military spend\u00ad ing vis-a-vis that of your principal opponent goes below a threshold where not only your opponent , but others, do not regard you as credible; and I am afraid we have approached and gone below that point. All during the 1960's, we increased our military spending and Russia increased her military spending . All during the 1970's, we cut our military spending and Russia increased her military spending. Now, in relative terms, absolute terms, by every conceivable standard of comparison , they are spending more money than we are, and they will continue to do so ~\u00b7\u00b7 absent some enormous change of policy, whether or not the SALT 11 treaty is ratified.\" Over the years, Packwood has voted again and again against amendments to reduce the level of military spending . In other key arms control votes, Packwood in 1977 followed the Scoop Jackson line by voting against Paul Warnke as chief SALT negotiator while supporting him as head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The same year, he again went against his Oregon colleague by vot\u00ad ing against a Hatfield amendment to stop devel\u00ad opment of the neutron bomb. He also supported continued funding of the Clinch River breeder reactor, a system which has dangerous nuclear proliferation implications . Packwood 's record on other foreign policy is\u00ad sues has been mixed. While voting to support the Panama Canal treaties, he voted in the early 1970's to continue the bombing of Cambodia and Laos. In 1978 and 1979, he voted to discontinue sanctions against the white racist Smith regime in Rhodesia at a time when, if the legislative efforts had been successful , the opportunity for a peace\u00ad ful settlement of the war might have been tor\u00ad pedoed. Kulongoski , to be elected, needs substantial financial help. By mid-August he had raised only $75,000 toward a goal of $300,000 for the Novem\u00ad ber election, an eventual total he feels sufficient for a solid Oregon campaign despite Packwood 's overwhelming financial advantage . The state AFL-CIO 's endorsement has begun to aid the fund raising effort, but he needs a lot of additional help to meet his minimum budget. If you would like to contribute , please make your check out to KULONGOSKI FOR U.S. SEN\u00ad ATE COMMITTEE and mail to: COUNCIL FOR A LIVABLE WORLD 11 Beacon Street Boston, Massachusetts 02108 September Update On May 6. 1965. only three U.S. Senators voted against President Johnson 's request for money to launch a ground war in Vietnam. They were Er\u00ad nest Gruening of Alaska, Wayne Morse of Oregon and Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin . Nelson said be\u00ad fore the vote: \"The support in Congress for this measure is clearly overwhelming . Obviously you need my vote less than I need my conscience .\" Senator Nelson's conscience is still guiding him in 1980. On key 1979 Senate votes on defense issues, he voted with the \"arms control\" position on four out of five amendments : -For the McGovern amendment to reduce military spending by $1.7 billion and to transfer $1 billion of that to domestic pro\u00ad grams (April 24. 1979) -Against the Hollings amendment to in\u00ad crease FY 1980 military spending levels by 3% over inflation, in line with President Carter's request but more than the Budget Committee approved (September 18, 1979) -Against the Hollings amendment to in\u00ad crease FY 1981 and FY 1982 military spending by 5% over inflation, above President Carter's request and way above the Budget Committee recommendation (September 18, 1979) -For the Proxmire amendment to elimi\u00ad nate a fourth U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier (November 6, 1979) -Against the Hatfield amendment to elimi\u00ad nate $670 million for development of the MX missile (November 9. 1979) Nelson voted against the Hatfield amendment because, while he opposed MX deployment , he did not oppose continued research on the sys\u00ad tem. which is all the authorizing legislation al\u00ad lowed. Nelson's current views on the MX: \"I continue to have grave reservations about the MX system. In particular , I am concerned about the feasibility, environmental impact, and the tremendous cost of a system that can be made obsolete if the Soviets choose to target enough warheads against it.\" Earlier Senator Nelson voted for the nomina\u00ad tion of Paul Warnke as Director of the Arms Con\u00ad trol and Disarmament Agency and chief SALT negotiator , against the neutron bomb, against arms for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, for the Panama Canal Treaty, and against the Clinch River Reac\u00ad tor. Throughout his 18 years in the Senate, Nelson has been among the most dependable advocates of responsible arms control. It was Nelson's amendment which first established the right of Congress to veto arms sales abroad in excess of $25 million. He never wavered in his outspoken support for the SALT II Treaty. As recently as May 7, 1980, Senator Nelson tried to cut $2.4 billion from the 1981 defense outlays and transfer the funds to domestic programs . Unfortunately his amendment to this effect was tabled. Gaylord Nelson is an institution in Wisconsin . He has held public office continuously since 1948. longer than any other statewide elected official. However , after the 1978 election when several of Nelson's liberal colleagues were de\u00ad feated by unknowns , no incumbent enjoys an automatic advantage . The substantial vote for Ronald Reagan in the Presidential primary this year is significant and unsettling to Nelson par\u00ad ticularly because of the large blue collar cross\u00ad over to the Republican ballot. Although Wiscons in has a liberal reputation , it is actually a state of political anomalies . It spawned Bob LaFollette and the Progressive movement as well as Joe McCarthy and his cam\u00ad paign against \"Commun ism in high places.\" Richard Nixon carried Wisconsin twice. yet in the seventies the state became decidedly Democrat ic. Although Nelson is unopposed on the Demo\u00ad cratic ballot, four major conservative candidates , all associated with big money, are vying for his seat within Wiscons in's resurgent GOP. The pri\u00ad mary date is September 9. Three Republicans declared early for the race, including former Congressman Robert W. Kas\u00ad ten, Jr., an established political figure with broad\u00ad based support from a previous statewide race. The others are Terry Kohler of Sheboygan , son and grandson of Wisconsin governors , and G. Douglass Cofrin of Milwaukee , also well-known and also extraordinarily wealthy. Shortly before the July 9 filing deadline the lieutenant governor jumped into the race. Russell Olson, a millionaire dairy farmer and an early Reagan supporter , is popular with the GOP es tab-lishment and immediately became, with Kasten, a favorite in the primary. All four Republican candidates are concentrat\u00ad ing their vast resources in attacks on Nelson. Kas\u00ad ten charges Nelson with \"responsibility for U.S. military weakness ,\" according to the Milwaukee Journal in February. Kohler has written: \"If I were in the Senate I would oppose SALT II because I know you cannot trust the Russians to live up to their end of any bargain, but Nelson supports SALT II even though many experts have told him we have no way of making sure the Soviets are complying with it.\" The March 1st Madison Capi\u00ad tal Times reports that Cofrin is a hawk, dead set against the SALT 11 Treaty, and a believer in \"peace through military strength .\" Nelson is threatened by a Republican money blitz. While Nelson had spent $194,000 by August 4, Cofrin had already spent $952,000 before July 1 and Kohler had spent $505,000. Nelson has not needed a lot of campaign money for a long time. He was reelected in 1974 having raised only $270,000. This year, Nelson .. budgeted $525,000: he has $405,000 so far. His opponent in the general election will have the further advantage of a check for $216,000 from the Republican Senate Campaign Committee the day after the primary; Nelson can expect only $17,500 from the comparable Democratic com\u00ad mittee. In his quiet, homespun and unassuming way, Gaylord Nelson is an effective senator. He is one of the most popular senators among his col\u00ad leagues, and they seldom take offense when he opposes them. They know he acts solely out of conviction and without posturing . They also know that he is passionately committed to the cause of arms control.

Plea \u00b7c 02108. 48111 9,' No. 377 A New Roots Interview Dr. Helen Caldicott WAKING AMERICA UP TOTHE NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE By Rob Okun The Anns Race is picking up speed. Currently , 35 narions have nuclear weapons capabilities and by the year 2000 as many as 100 nations will know how to acquire them. Many nuclear scientists calculate our chances of reaching 2000 at less than 40 percent. Doctor, mother and scientist Helen Caldicott thinks that figure may be too high. For close to a decade the Australian-born physician has been waging a public education campaign to infonn the plan\u00ad et's peoples of the hazards of the Nuclear Age. She was in\u00ad strumental in forcing France to halt its atmospheric nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and in alerting the Australian peo\u00ad ple to the dangers of fallout. Although noted for her medically-based opposition to nu\u00ad clear power plants (she is featured in two films discussing radia\u00ad tion and health), Caldicott has been concerned about nuclear anns since she first read On The Beach in 1955. Nuclear power compared to nuclear war, Caldicott says, is like \"a pimple on a pumpkin .\" Caldicott believes doctors must begin practicing \"political medicine. \"In 1978 she helped revitalize Physicians for Social Responsibility, an early sixties anti-nuclear testing group. This year PSR will begin mailing letters to the half million doctors, dentists, and osteopaths in this country, detailing the hazards of nuclear power and weapons, and enlisting their support. Last year she published her compelling, fact-packed book, Nuclear Madness: What You Can Do, and is currently at work on a revised edition. Caldicott moved to this country three years ago with her physician -husband and three children, and assumed a post at Bostons Children's Hospita~ specializing in the study and treatment of cystic fibrosis. Caldicott regularly criss-crosses the country to raise the nuclear question before church, college, civic and medical audiences. Last September she was one of a delegation of eight which visited the Soviet Union on a peace mission arranged by the American Friends Service Committee. While there Caldicott met with more than 100 Russian government officials, jour\u00ad nalists, scientists, diplomats, physicians, nuclear reactor plant managers, academicians , military officers and citizens. Dis\u00ad cussions centered around the SALT treaty and international nuclear weapons proliferation. During her visit Caldicott discovered that the virtual parity in weapons that currently exists between the super powers is being threatened . To her horror, she realized that America's decisions to continue developing its Launch-on-Warning sys\u00ad tem and to deploy cruise and Pershing II missiles in Europe, could mean that within two years the Anns Race will be out of human control. When she returned home in early October, the 41-year-old physician made one of the most difficult personal decisions of her life: she decided to virtually abandan the practice of medi\u00ad cine for the next two years to work on reversing the Arms Race. Not long ago New Roots News Editor Rob Okun interview\u00ad ed Dr. Caldicott to learn more about her decision, how she plans to spend her time, and her secret ingredient for saving the planet-women. Why do you say there are only two years before the Arms Race will be out of control? There are two reasons. Within two years the technologists at the Pentagon will have finished developing a system called Launch-on-Warning. That means when the computer in our reconnaissance satellite detects something in Russia -maybe it's a missile going off, maybe it's an accident, maybe it's noth\u00ad ing-it sends a message back to all the missiles in America which go off within three minutes. And there's no human input! No human being will be able to stop it. Then there are the cruise missiles. They are small c:.trategic weapons, about 10 to 20 feet Jong. Because they're so small they can be easily hidden and can't be counted. Up to now Russia and America could count each other's strategic wea\u00ad pons by satellite. That's why we got SALT 11-you don't have to trust each other. Without the cruise, America and Russia\u00ad for the first time-are essentially equivalent . The cruise missile means the end of any possibility for detente, the end of the SALT talks. Was there a national debate about this very impor\u00ad tant decision? Was it discussed in Congress and the Senate? No! We hear more talk about the energy crisis than the threat of nudear war. Are the American people aware of how grave the situation is? Not yet. Most of America is sound asleep. Do you know we nearly had a nuclear war last November 9'? A fellow in the Pen\u00ad tagon plugged a war games tape into a supposedly failsafe com\u00ad puter and the computer took it for real. All the American early warning systems arqund the world went on alert for six minutes. Three squadrons of planes took off armed with nuc\u00ad lear weapons. At the seventh minute the Presidential 747 com\u00ad mand post was readied for take-off. (They couldn't find the President. He was to be notified at the seventh minute.) lf in 20 minutes it hadn't been stopped, we wouldn't be here right now. Remember 20 minutes is currently the time limit for r.. retaliatory nuclear attack. There would have been a full-scale nuclear war and it was back page in the New York Times! But it was front page headlines in the London Guardian! The rest of the world is petrified! This country is a sleeping giant! It is totally unaware of the Incredible power it holds and the magnitude of destruction inherent in its arsenals. Many nuclear critics believe that most of the media is so caught up in listening to the Doublespeak of the Defense Department and the Department of Energy that they regularly miss oppor\u00ad tunities to break major stories. Why do you think they under\u00ad plll'fed such a gripping, nearly catastrophic story? Ct's typical. I really don't think they understand the gravity of the issue. Nuclear war has little to do with a post-Three Mile Island consciousness and it is something they don't want to think about. Were they told to hush it up by the Pentagon'? I don't know. The rest of the world is more awake than America because they know what war Is. That's why it made the front page overseas. Modem America has never suffered war on its own soil. How many nuclear warheads does the United States have right now? In the sixties, former Secretary of Defense McNamara figured that if the United States had between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads that would be enough to kill one third of the Rus\u00ad sian population and destroy two thirds of its industry. And when they say destruction of people, they are only talking about death by fire or blast. They don't begin to estimate death by fallout. America now has a staggering 25,000 to 30,000 tactical and strategic nuclear warheads, most of them hydrogen bombs much bigger than the A-Bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Accord\u00ad ing to Randy Forsberg, director of the Institute for Defense and Disarmament Studies. there are enough hydrogen bombs aboard one Trident submarine to destroy every major city in the Northern Hemisphere, and America is intent on building 27 Trident submarines. In spite of the fact that America has enough bombs to overkill the Russian population 40 times and Russia has enough to overkill. the American population 20 times, America continues to make three to 10 new hydrogen bombs a day. What would be the probable scenario of e nuclear war? If the button is pressed in Russia or America, the weapons go out into space and re-enter the earth's atmosphere at 20 times the speed of sound. And, they're accurately on target. Mean\u00ad while, the satellite from the other country has detected the attack and the button is pressed in that country. So a nuclear war takes about one to two hours to complete . If you live in a targeted area and you do manage to get into a fallout shelter ' . ' you wont survive because the firestorms will be so huge. One 20 megaton bomb (20 million tons of TNT equivalent) will create a firestorm of 3000 square miles. The fire will use up all the oxygen in the air, so if you're in a shelter, you 'II asphixiate . One ::!O megaton bomb would literally vaporize everything in Boston uo t~ Route 128. exceot reinforced concrete buildings . Are you saymg that no one will survive all-out nuclear war? Well, very possibly. And you might not want to survive. If you're in a rural area and you do hear the sirens and you get tc, a shelter in time, you can't come up for two weeks because short-lived radioactive isotopes are so intensely radioactive that you'd die. When you do come out in two weeks, from a psy\u00ad chiatric point of view. you'll be numb with grief, possibly psy\u00ad chotic. Certainly there will be no doctors left, or hospitals, be\u00ad cause they 're targeted. There will be no food. The water will be intensely radioactive . It's possible that the destruction of the ozone layer will be so 'intense that you won't be able to stay out in the sun for more than three minutes before you'd develop third-degree sunburn. That means the earth will be a parched, scorched planet. If you survive you must live under\u00ad ground to escape the fallout. And you'd probably get leukemia in five years. The civil defense manual written by the Pentagon says to very quickly bury the millions of dead, decaying bodies before disease becomes rampant. In a radioactive environment the bacteria and viruses multiply and mutate to become more vi\u00ad rulent and our immune mechanism is depleted. We'd see plagues of typhoid, polio, dysentery ... Things we've cured. They'd all come back. There would have to be large stockpile s of heroin and morphine to inject into the dying people. You can let your imagination wonder a little bit and envision generations later, the earth inhabited by bands of roving humanoi~s. unrecognizabl e as human beings. It will be the end of civilization-all the architecture, music, literature, art\u00ad and possibly, every organism on earth. There's real doubt whether any life would ultimately survive. Remembering how unstable President Nixon was at the end I wonder how many people have their finger on the button. ' No one without classified information really knows. The presi\u00ad dent has sole authority but there is a political chain of com\u00ad mand. The president isn't going to be the one feeding. all the codes through the black box. He can delegate authority. No\u00ad body knows about the decision-making abilities of the captains of nuclear submarines or the men in the ICBM silos. There are two men in the Titan missile silo-termed the sanest men in America by the Pen\\tagon--and each is armed with a pistol to shoot the other if he should exhibit abnormal behavior. Over the past few years, by official Army records, more than 30 of them have been diagnosed to be men\u00ad tally unstable. So even th.ough the presi\u00ad dent is in charge there are an unknown number of others down the chain of command . When you were in Russia, you met with a number of scientists, doctors, govern\u00ad ment officials, and everyday Russian citizens. What are their feelings about nuclear war? Un.iformly, every person we spoke to is very much against the Arms Race. They desperately wanted a freeze on the de\u00ad ployment of strategic nuclear weapons, desperately wanted SALT II ratified. They didn't want America to deploy the cruise and Pershing missiles in Eur\u00ad ope and they don't want China armed by America. They're frightened about nuclear war. They lost 20 million peo\u00ad ple in World War II and are very sensi\u00ad tive about war. in light of this anti-war sentiment , what do you think of the Russian action in Afghanistan? It certainly hasn't eased tensions between the super powers. I love what I'm doing. But I go to work and I just can't feel there's any point when there's a danger that every organism on earth will be destroyed in a couple of years. Certainly after people listen to you speak many must agree with your view of the nuclear situation. Do you have a pre\u00ad scription for mobilizing people to begin working to avert nuclear war? There's a tremendous untapped major\u00ad ity out there-women . We have a highly developed nurturing instinct. I think if we get moving we can save the earth ... but we haven't got much, time. I pro\u00ad pose establishing a Women's Party for Survival. Such a party would include every woman in this country, every sin\u00ad gle woman. This isn't just a feminist is\u00ad sue. You don't have to be.liberated to understand that your children may not survive to the year 2000, let alonE: the next five to 10 years. When women bear the warning, they blossom and a tremen\u00ad dous power becomes mobilized. Fem\u00ad inists have an important role to play. What they've done over the last 10 years has been vital-they've helped women find their power. But now women.have to move or we all won't be here much longer. Of course I think what Russia has done is wrong. But they're very frightened of China. Nearly a billion people live along a common border and they're afraid America will arm the Chinese. It's hap\u00ad pening. Secretary of Defense Brown was there not long ago. The Shah being brought here destabi\u00ad lized the entire mideastem area. It's Muslim area and there are 40 million Muslims living in the southern part of Russia. Russia has been in Afghanis tan in a partial way since 1978. Their re\u00ad gime wasn't working well and I guess \"You don't have to be liberated to understand that your children may not survive to 2000.\" 3ack in the early sixties, women were at the center of the fight against nuclear atmospheric testing. Groups like Another Mother For Peace mobilized the kind of woman po~er you're talking about. Their local drives and marches on Wah\u00ad ington made the government sit up end take notice. Why do you think thet momentum was lost? I think women by natu~ are passive. We haven't been bred to power. We have the babies; we nurture life. We are not exerting power in the world. Dr. Mary Ellen Avery, chief of medicine at Chil\u00b7 dren 's Hospital at Harvard says, \"Power not used is power lost,\" and she's richt. We have tremendous power. It's part of being a mother to make sute the world is safe for our babies. The situation they thought they had to be strong. I think they've done the wrong thing because they've pushed America-although 0 it was already very hawkish-into a much more war-like situation. A situation of hysteria now prevails on both sides and that's what leads to war. We can't have war anymore, yet we're both armed to the teeth, rattling our sabers. After you returned from Russia you made some personal and professional decision in response to the escalating Arma Race. What have you decided? I'm giving up much of my medical work. I was about to start doing some interesting research in cystic fibrosis. Now I've de\u00ad cided not to do it. The decision really tore me apart, because we're in today demands a revolution for survival. I understand you've been discussing the Lysistrata notion of women deciding en masse not to have any more babi until we have a peaceful planet. Do you support this idea? Yes. At a feminist conference in Germany recenUy, some wo\u00ad men advocated not having babies until the world is sale for children. I know I'd think carefully before having children again. What do you think environmental and anti-nud~ar groups ought to do to help reverse the Arms Race? Clear the decks of their own agendas and join you? This issue cuts across all movements . But people are just start-ing to think about it. These groups must make the Arms Race a part of their work, while not abandoning their other pro\u00ad jects. Linus Pauling said recently that if we do survive we're going to need an unpolluted planet for our descendants to in\u00ad habit. And it's not just the nuclear power plants. It's the chemicals the toxic wastes ... We're fouling our own nest. People' can fall into a\u00b7trap-it doesn't matter if you have a solar house, and eat the right food if we're all going to blow up in two years. We've got to get this in perspective. We've got to open our eyes, even if it's painful. You always seem to radiate-pardon the expression-a power\u00ad ful, positive energy every time I've seen you speak. How do you keep from getting depressed when you face the realities of the nuclear nightmare so often? Well, sometimes I do get depressed. When I was writing the chapter on nuclear weapons in my book Nuclear Madness, I became extremely depressed. I lived it and dreamt it, night after night. I saw bombs dropping out of planes; saw what the world would be like if there was a nuclear war and somehow my children and I survived. It was too terrible. But most of the time I practice what Robert Jay Lifton calls psychic numbing . He's tl'le psychiatrist who worked with survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Most of the time I don't think about it. I pre\u00ad tend that life will go on. I sew for the kids. I make cakes and look after the family. That's where my joy comes from-the family, the earth, other people. Life's a fantastic, precious thing. I don't think about it ending except when I write or talk about it. Sometimes I find myself having to consciously decide not to think about the horror of World W0 ar 111. What do you do in the way of spiritual practices to nurture yourself? I meditate most days and pray and that helps a lot. I get a lot of strength from that. Until two years ago I was an atheist. But now I believe there is some force you can tap into and it cer\u00ad tainly helps me. When you spoke of your personal nuclear nightmare, it made me think of Hiroshima. You were in Japan last year. What was that like for you? I went to Hiroshima on the anniversary of the dropping of the bomb. The bomb was dropped at 8:15 in the morning on a hot, muggy summer day. We were in the Peace Park at exactly 8:15 when they released thousands of doves into the air. I was profoundly sad but at the same time I felt an intense anger. I thought of all the people who are still dying now from what they called A-Bomb disease, but was in fact, cancer. The cancer incidence is still rising-35 years later. These bombs just don't kill people suddenly . They go on forever killing people. But we've learned nothing from that! In fact, I think we're hooked on nuclear weapons like a drug. We're paying for it with our taxes. Reverend WiHiarn Sloane Coffin, who was one of the three clergy who visited the American hostages in Iran, and a member of the delegation that visited the Soviet Union says it's like we're all sipping from the Pentagon Kool Aid vat. Your working so hard on behalf of the planet and its peo\u00ad ples indicates a tremendous respect for the earth. Where does it come from? When I studied medicine and I learned how the cells work, how the human body works-and how beautifully coordinated the whole thing is, it gave me a great reverence for life. When I had my own babies it was the most fantastically creative th!ng I eve~ did, _giving birth. The babies cried and my breasts pnckled with milk. The connection was even stronger. AJI women feel this potential creativity , I think even if they've never given birth to a baby. ' So man_y peo~le draw inspiration from your work to help them with their own efforts. What advice can you offer them to stay pqsitive? Well, I think in the face of catastrophe to do nothing and be passive is very depressing because you feel so powerless . But if you try and do something, it's the most exciting action you can take. If I'm feeling I'm having an effect and other people are starting to be mobilized , there's a tremendous reward So I say to myself, \"Even if the bombs go off, at ieast I'll be ~ble to say I tried.\" For me, it's a religious commitment to con\u00ad tinue evolution , to continue God's creation. We are the cura\u00ad tors of life on earth. But with the press of a button, we can wipe it out. Are you hopeful that people are heeding your message and will begin to work toward nuclear disarmament? Wha~ _I'm talking about is the ultimate fonn of preventative medicme . Human beings are capable of such amazing relation\u00ad ships;uch creativity . You know, this may be the only life in the whole universe, yet with the push of a button we can de\u00ad stroy it all. We have a responsibility to continue evolution on earth. Every single one of us can be as powerful as Henry Kissinger or Jimmy Carter because we inherited the earth just as they did. It's our birthright. o Thanks to Frances Crowe of the American Friends Service CommUtee , and Randy Kehler, co-director of the Traprock Peach Center, for assistance in the preparation of this article.

Wiley is seen in a selection of paintings , constructions , drawings , watercolors, and prints from the past twelve years. His own everyday experiences are subject matter, repre\u00ad sented in wry, humorous allegorical images. Dream-like landscapes evoking undiscovered worlds, mysterious maps suggesting journeys of the mind, figures in storybook garb recalling wizards of distant times, are aspects of his world. Working and teaching in Northern California , Wiley in his \"homespun \" thematic approach has found resource in the area and in his friends. He has also been an influential force locally and on the national art scene. Organized by Walker Art Center in Minneapoli s, this exhibition concludes its five museum tour in San Francisco , where it is supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Washington , D.C., a Federal agency, and a generous gift from Mason Wells and Frank Hamilton.

Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundeberg: A Retrospective Exhibition through November 16 Fourth Floor Galleries This retrospective exhibition of one hundred twenty paintings covers the careers of two of America's pioneer modernist painters who worked in Southern California. Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundeberg were associated through work and marriage from the early 1930s until Feitelson's death in May of 1978. The longevity and harmony of their relationship as well as their capacity to retain their individuality as artists is a rare phenomenon. Feitelson spent his early years in New York and Europe and, while still in his twenties, moved to Los Angeles where he became a spokesman for the avant-garde. Philip Guston and Ruben Kadish, as well as Lundeberg, were among his students. In 1934, Feitelson and Lundeberg oo\u00ad founded a school of \"subjective classicism\" or Music Mondays-at -Eight concert series presented by the San Francisco Contemporary Music Playe.\u00b7s Program Three Monday, November 17-8 pm Green Room, first floor Aaron Copland, \"Sextet\" (Short Symphony), for piano, clarinet, and string quartet; George Rochberg, \"Slow Fires of Autumn\" (UKIYO-E harp flute; Charles flute, trombone, violin, violc;i, cello and maracas.

During the late 1930s both artists worked on the Southern California federal art project where Feitelson became an administrator . In the 1950s and 1960s Lundeberg's painting continued to develop along post-Surrealist lines with more emphasis on real and imagined space. Feitelson turned toward hard-edge painting and formed a group called the \"Abstract Classicists \" along with John Mclaughlin, Karl Benjamin , Frederick Hammersley, and the Los Angeles crit\u00ad ic Jules Langsner. An exhibition of the Abstract Classicists was seen in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and London in 1960. Organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, this retrospective will travel to The Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery, University of Cali\u00ad fornia, Los Angeles, in March, 1981. The exhibi\u00ad tion is co-sponsored by the Museum and the UCLA Art Council of the University of California at Los Angeles. Catalog available.
