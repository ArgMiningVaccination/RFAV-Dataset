Most users of this drug also use other various drugs, creating cause for concern. There are many options when looking into DMT treatment and rehab that can fit the needs of the individual. Start the road to recovery N,N-Dimethyltryptamine ( [DMT](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/hallucinogens/dmt/)) is a Hallucinogenic drug that's been gaining popularity in recent years. DMT is a Schedule I drug which means it is illegal to possess, manufacture, and distribute it in the United States and it is considered to have no approved medical use. The 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health states that 1.4 million Americans aged 12 or older are current [Hallucinogen](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/hallucinogens/) users, and the number of people using DMT has been increasing since 2007. This drug has low addictive properties and has even been shown to aid some people who have treatment-resistant [depression](https://www.addictioncenter.com/addiction/depression-and-addiction/); however, there are still risks and potential adverse reactions when using DMT. In some cases, DMT treatment and rehab may be necessary, especially for those with polysubstance abuse tendencies. The naturally occurring chemical compound tryptamine is found in serotonin and melatonin, as well as in drugs like [Psilocybin](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/hallucinogens/psilocybin-mushrooms/) and DMT. [Young adults](https://www.addictioncenter.com/addiction/young-adults/) who use other drugs, especially psychedelic drugs, report a higher prevalence of tryptamine use. Combining drugs or combining [drugs and alcohol](https://www.addictioncenter.com/alcohol/mixing-alcohol-drugs/) is dangerous and can even result in death. There have been reports of users experiencing episodes of psychotic mania after consuming a DMT/ [Cannabis](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/marijuana/) solution. When it is not prepared in a brew ( [Ayahuasca](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/hallucinogens/ayahuasca/)), DMT is usually smoked. It can also be injected or snorted, but these methods are less common. When smoked, the effects of [DMT](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/hallucinogens/dmt/dmt-symptoms-signs/) take hold almost immediately. DMT is sometimes referred to as one of the most intense psychedelics, as it renders the user incapacitated and causes visual and auditory hallucinations that make the user feel as though they are outside of their body. Many people who have taken DMT describe the trip as traveling to another universe, such as one experience detailed in The Third Wave: \"The nature around me rapidly began to disappear, as if its resolution decreased from 4k down to a pixelated mess. The trees became blobs, the shaman's body became a stick, his curly dark hair now resembling the phosphorous head of a match.\" Join the thousands of people that have called a treatment provider for rehab information.

Hallucinations may be nightmarish, producing feelings of terror; the user may feel out of control, despaired, or that they may die. Patients have been known to hurt themselves while experiencing a bad trip, and professional treatment must be sought. [Benzodiazepines](https://www.addictioncenter.com/benzodiazepines/) may be prescribed to ease extreme agitation or seizures; most often, a quiet environment with little sensory stimulation will be provided while the patient comes down. Currently, there are no FDA approved medications to treat addiction to DMT or other Hallucinogens. Those seeking DMT treatment may benefit from [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/), which aims to identify and modify attitudes and behaviors towards drug abuse and focus on healthy life skills and coping mechanisms. Starting treatment begins with [detoxification](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/hallucinogens/dmt/withdrawal-detox/), followed by behavioral counseling and medication if needed. Being evaluated for [co-occurring mental disorders](https://www.addictioncenter.com/addiction/dual-diagnosis/), such as anxiety, depression, or trauma, is important so those issues can be addressed as well. An aftercare plan should be put together so the patient has resources to avoid relapse. Joining a [12-step program](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/12-step-programs/) may also be beneficial to some patients; they can connect with a community that will encourage them to continue on a path towards achieving their goals of sobriety.

Online Addiction Counseling Get professional help from an online addiction and mental health counselor from BetterHelp. Start receiving support via phone, video, or live-chat. Deciding on the right drug rehabilitation process depends on the individual's needs. Someone with a severe addiction may benefit from residential treatment, also called [inpatient rehab](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/inpatient-rehab/), where they live at a facility and have access to care 24 hours a day. Long-term residential treatment lasts 6 to 12 months, and short-term residential treatment lasts 3 to 6 weeks. Removing oneself from day-to-day life allows the patient to focus solely on their recovery as well as be held accountable by staff and other patients which make up a supportive community. For someone with a less severe addiction or who has already completed inpatient rehab, an [outpatient treatment](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/outpatient-rehab/) program may be beneficial. These programs let people receive treatment during the day and then return home at night. The schedule and level of [intensity](https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/outpatient-rehab/intensive-outpatient-rehab-programs/) depends on the needs of the patient. Although DMT and other Hallucinogens are not considered drugs with high addictive properties, it is still possible to develop a tolerance; more of the drug must be taken to achieve the same effects. It is also possible to develop a behavioral addiction and a belief that it is necessary to keep taking psychedelic drugs to maintain feelings of happiness and enlightenment. If you or a loved one is abusing DMT, other [illicit drugs](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/illicit-drugs/), or a combination of various drugs, there are reasons to be concerned. DMT has been known to increase heart rate and blood pressure, and cardiac and respiratory arrest have occurred after consuming high doses.
