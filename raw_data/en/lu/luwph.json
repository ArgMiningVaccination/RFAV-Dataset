ZenNaTai This fall, Velaa will bring Buathon Thienarrom, PhD, director of Sukkasart Institute of Healing Arts, on board to provide integrative bodywork, sound healing and mind training to resort guests. Her unique approach to holistic healing, which she calls ZenNaTai, encourages inner peace through releasing tension and generating chi flow in the body. Thienarrom, whose residency will take place September 1 to 14, 2021, plans to present this approach to guests through consultations, analyzing the influence of body structure on an individual's lifestyle, followed by energy-enhancing sound vibration rituals. The sessions are designed to develop personal awareness, and can be implemented in guests' everyday lives. "}
