Amidst the global health crisis, AAC is strictly following the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and [World Health Organization's](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) recommendations. We are taking many proactive actions to protect our current and future patients and staff members during this global health pandemic. Learn more about our specific health care and vaccination policies below. AAC Vaccination Policy Overview Various vaccines are now available to prevent COVID-19 infections. Per the [updated CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html), incoming patients who have been vaccinated may not have to quarantine in an AAC facility upon their admission. Patients will be asked about their vaccination status when they call our admissions center. People who have been vaccinated should bring their vaccination card with them to the AAC facility they will be entering upon admission, and present it to admissions staff members upon arrival. This being said, people do not have to be vaccinated in order to receive treatment at an AAC treatment center. AAC's own lab will also be conducting COVID-19 testing as an additional safety screening for patients admitted to its treatment centers across the country. Call us today at There, an admissions navigator is available 24/7 to discuss treatment options, verify your insurance over the phone, or answer any questions you might have about treatment. Alternatively you can try our insurance verification form below to see if your insurance provider may be able to cover all or part of the cost of treatment.

We are now offering rapid (same-day) COVID-19 testing for patients at the the following facilities. Patients who receive a negative result will be able to enter treatment without a mandatory period of isolation. Overview of Our Approach to Protecting Patients & Staff - Overall Patient and Staff Safety: Each facility has been tasked with establishing a Health Protection Committee (HPC). The purpose of the HPC is to ensure hygiene and safety measures are consistently in place and being followed at each facility, ensure a coordinated company response to any concerns and establish protective protocols in the event that the health of our patients or employees may have been compromised as a result of COVID-19. The HPC works directly and daily with AAC's Chief Medical Officer [Dr. Lawrence Weinstein](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/corporate-leadership/lawrence-weinstein)to implement and enforce the most up-to-date procedures as the coronavirus information evolves. - Admissions: AAC screens all patients prior to admission to determine personal travel history, potential exposure, potential contact with someone who has traveled to areas of concern, any direct contact by the patients with persons diagnosed with COVID-19, and any symptoms of illness. Those who screen positive will not be admitted to treatment. Those who screen negative will be eligible for admission. - Staff Monitoring: AAC is committed to ensuring staff at our facilities are not infected with COVID-19 virus. Staff who have traveled to areas of concern, have been in contact with someone in these areas, have been in direct contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, or shows any signs of illness are asked to [follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html), which dictates 14 days of isolation with no symptoms from the time of contact. - Facility Hygiene: We are maintaining our already stringent cleaning and disinfecting processes throughout the day along with regularly scheduled deep cleanings and encouraging staff and patients to practice strict hand hygiene and avoid skin to skin contact. We are also closely monitoring the health of our patients. - Specialized Treatment: Our therapists have been trained on the effects of anxiety related to COVID-19 and are running groups at facilities to address concerns.
