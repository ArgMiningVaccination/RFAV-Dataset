If this proves inadequate, then other means, such as treatment with natural medicines, may be recommended. Any Unani treatment prescribed by a hakim acts as an outside agent to help boost the patient's tabiyat and thus restore good health and a sense of well-being. There are various therapeutic approaches available to the hakim. Ilaj-bi-ghiza, or dietotherapy, involves recommending a specific diet, which is the simplest and most natural course of treatment by a hakim. For [fever](https://www.britannica.com/science/fever), for example, Unani [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine) stresses a nutrient-rich, low-roughage diet that might include dalia ( [porridge](https://www.britannica.com/topic/porridge)) and kheer (a milk broth). Both the amount and quality of food are taken into [consideration](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/consideration). Relatively infrequent in modern Unani therapy is ilaj-bi-misla, or organotherapy, a mode of treatment that involves healing a diseased organ with the use of tissue extracts from the same organ of a healthy animal. Ilaj-bi-dawa, or [pharmacotherapy](https://www.britannica.com/science/pharmacotherapy), is the use of medicines by Unani hakims. This treatment method is considered by hakims to be natural, eco-friendly, and less intrusive and more effective than many other methods. The Unani system's pharmacopoeia is vast, enriched with more than 2,000 medicines derived from various herbal, mineral, and animal sources. Unani medications are often processed by classical methods of preparation as originally described in Greco-Arabic medicine. Unani medicines are used singly or are [compounded](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compounded) with other substances to achieve synergistic, antagonistic, or detoxifying effects or simply as bases for effective ingestion and assimilation. In the 1920s Indian physician Ajmal Khan revolutionized Unani medicine by advocating that research be conducted on various natural products that were claimed by ancient physicians to effect miraculous cures. In the 1930s Indian-born scientist Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, who specialized in phytochemistry (the chemistry of plants), isolated potent [constituents](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituents) from a plant known in [India](https://www.britannica.com/place/India) as chhota chand (Rauwolfia serpentina). Subsequent pharmacological research determined that the plant was the source of a bioactive substance known as [reserpine](https://www.britannica.com/science/reserpine), which found use in Western medicine as a [tranquilizer](https://www.britannica.com/science/tranquilizer) and as an antihypertensive agent (lowering abnormally high [blood pressure](https://www.britannica.com/science/blood-pressure)). Those uses supported some of the medical applications that had been described by hakims. Siddiqui named the derived medicines, which included ajmaline and ajmalicine, for Khan as a tribute to his groundbreaking research efforts. Having gained recognition from the [World Health Organization](https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-Health-Organization) (WHO) in 1976, the Unani system became increasingly accepted internationally as a system of traditional medicine. In India several institutions engaged in Unani teaching and research. The Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), an undertaking of the Indian government, for instance, [facilitated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitated) the translation of classical heritage, the organization of [clinical trials](https://www.britannica.com/science/clinical-trial), the improvement of drug standardization, and the investigation of toxicological and phytopharmacological properties of natural products that had long been used by hakims. Classical Unani medicine recommended established \"regimental\" therapies (tadabeer) in the treatment of various chronic and [acute](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acute) diseases. Those therapies include dalak (massage), hammam (bath and sauna), karat (exercise), fasd (venesection, or opening a vein to let out [blood](https://www.britannica.com/science/blood-biochemistry)), hijamat (cupping, a process of drawing blood to the surface of the body by using a glass cup or tube), and amat-e-kai ( [leeching](https://www.britannica.com/science/leeching), or bleeding a person by using [leeches](https://www.britannica.com/animal/leech)). The essential function of all those [regimens](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regimens) is to remove impure blood or impurities from the body. Surgical interventions, or ilaj-bil-yad, are a last resort. Their practice generally is beyond the realm of the hakim's expertise. Obstacles in Unani medicine Although a complete system of treatment, the Unani system, similar to other systems of medicine, has drawbacks in terms of application and effectiveness. The vast materia medica, from herbal and animal to mineral sources, as described in ancient Unani textbooks, is sometimes so vague that authenticity must be established by modern pharmacognostic [assessments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assessments) (by means of a basic, descriptive [pharmacology](https://www.britannica.com/science/pharmacology)) before medicines can be put to use. In addition, the use in Unani medicine of [precious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/precious) stones and minerals, the chief ingredients of many polyformulations (medicines containing multiple ingredients), is expensive. Those items often are unavailable as well, thereby hindering effective treatment. Intense research is important for the use of kushta, the incinerated finely powdered substance prepared from known toxic metals, such as Medicines made with those minerals, when used with caution and expertise, may be effective, but they have significant toxic side "}
