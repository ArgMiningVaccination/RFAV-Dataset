Davis Meetings 2nd International Conference on Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever -Mike Bray Opening of the - Mike Bray ISAR PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE (Jos\u00e9 Est\u00e9) It is with great pleasure that I salute all ISAR members a nd friends in this new issue of ISAR News. As we move towards year's end, I take the opportunity to reflect on the tasks and accomplishments of 2017. The society could not be in a better shape. We have a consolidated number of members and our past conference was a success. I have received many notes of congratulations for the excellent program and the quality of presentations; organization with our new Congress Organizer went smooth and seamless from start to end; and we were able, after some years of financial effort, to return to a healthy situation. The society is now in an outstanding position to continue promoting excellence in science, distinguishing those who excel in antiviral research and stimulate the participation o f students, postdocs and young investigators with commitment and passion for antiviral research and antiviral drug development. This year was also of grea t significance to an institute that has been instrumental in the success of our society and in the de velopment of novel antiviral agents. The Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, celebrated the opening of its new location, a brand new building with state of the art technology devoted to drug screening and biomedical research. I congra tulate all the investigators at the new Rega and wish them success. Many ISAR members, including myself, had the privilege and honor to accompany our president -elect, Johan Neyts, our Secretary Graciela Andrei and many other friends and colleagues at th e Rega Institute during the two -day scientific symposium and celebration of the opening. On behalf of ISAR, I also congratulate John Martin, executive chairman of Gilead Sciences, for receiving an honorary doctoral degree from the KU Leuven. Such distincti on implicitly recognizes one the most productive collaborations in antiviral drug development led by John Martin, Erik De Clercq and Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd. We are now heavily involved in the planning of the 31st ICAR in Porto, Portugal, June 11 -15, 2018 . For the first time in many years the meeting will be held at a conference center, not a hotel venue. We hope this decision will allow participants to choose their accommodation without the society imposing it at the official hotel. Porto is a beautiful European city very attractive to tourists, and thus, it offers a wide range of hotels and accommodations to suit every need and price range. Porto can be reached from almost every major European city through a direct flight and from major U.S.A. airports. I encoura ge all participants to make their travel and accommodation arrangements at the earliest convenience and also benefit from our early bird registration fees. November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 2 The program for the 31st ICAR will maintain a balance between Keynote, invited speakers and selected presentations from submitted abstracts. Three focus symposia and a special session on technical issues will set the stage for an excellent line-up of speakers. Excellent science is the guiding standard. If you feel your work demonstrates excellence, I encourage you to submit your work. ISAR will continue its efforts in supporting the participation of young scientists. We look forward to seeing you in Porto. I hope you enjoy this new issue of ISAR News. Your participation is essential. We want to hear your thoughts and opinions on what is important to you. Please feel free to contact us at info@isaricar.com . Jos\u00e9 Est\u00e9 President, ISAR THE Program Committee (Mark Prichard and Justin Julander ) The International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR) will host the 31st ICAR in Porto, Portugal Monday June 11th through Friday June 15th, 2018. The conference will be held at the Alf\u00e2ndega Conference Centre, Rua Nova Da Alf\u00e2ndega, Edificio Da Alf\u00e2ndega, 4050 -430 Porto, Portugal. This venue is scenically located along the banks of the Douro River and is conveniently located in the heart of Po rto. Attending this annual meeting is important for all ISAR members as it serves to strengthen existing contacts and provides an opportunity to add new contacts to their network by meeting new scientists working in the field. Speakers at the meeting will present the latest scientific developments in antiviral research and will emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of this field. This year, the program will feature a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Symposium, including speakers involved in the latest efforts to und erstand and control disease. Featured speakers include William Britt, Paul Griffiths, David Kimberlin and Randi Leavitt. An exciting development in the treatment of CMV that will be discussed at this year's ICAR is the development of letermovir, a terminas e inhibitor that has successfully completed phase 3 clinical trials for CMV infection. The conference will also feature an Emerging Infections Symposium, a Virus Evolution Symposium, and a Hepatitis Symposium. The 31st ICAR will also include a newly imple mented Technical Session that will discuss innovations in technology and how they are being used in antiviral research. Other regularly scheduled sessions include the Keynote Address and four award lectures with more details forthcoming in the next issue o f ISAR news. Annual oral sessions on in vitro antiviral activity, medicinal chemistry, clinical trials, respiratory, DNA and emerging viruses and hepatitis are also scheduled. Two poster sessions are also included, which provide a great opportunity for students and investigators to present their data and provides opportunities to further discuss research presented at the conference. The meeting will also include networking opportunities for new members including a Women in Science Roundtable, a Career Devel opment session and a New Member reception . We will also have a PechaKucha contest at the 31st ICAR in Porto! PechaKucha is a presentation format where you have 20 slides, each on the screen for only 20 seconds. Your slides advance automatically so you hav e to keep up with the slides, as you won't have control of the speed. Some tips on a good PechaKucha presentation - incorporate humor, a surprise or something that is unexpected. Bottom line, you want to entertain the team of judges as well as inform! Why should you compete? There will be two cash prizes - $200 for first place and $100 for second place, but only graduate students and postdocs are eligible to compete. How to sign up? When you submit your abstract, please indicate that you want to compete - only seven people, as well as an additional three alternates, will be selected. Selection will be based on abstract quality, novelty, and content of the work. Be sure to submit your abstract and sign up early. See you in Porto!

ANTIVIRALS ON THE HORIZON RSV Therapeutics on the Horizon (Jerome Deval and Julian A. Symons ) Alios BioPharma, Inc., a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company , South San Francisco, CA, USA. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes one of the most common upper respiratory tract infections that take place during the winter season. In the majority of otherwise healthy adults, RSV infection usually lasts a week or two an d results in mild cold - like symptoms. However, RSV infection can also lead to severe lower respiratory dysfunction such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis in vulnerable populations such as infants, elderly and immunocompromised persons. RSV is the most frequ ent cause of hospitalization of infants and young children in industrialized countries. Approximately two -thirds of infants are infected by RSV in their first year of life, resulting in an estimated 132,000 -172,000 hospitalization s in the US, and 2.1 milli on out -patients visits annually among children under 5 years old. Severe RSV infections are also frequent among elderly patients, a population that often remains undiagnosed. RSV infection in the elderly results in approximately 177,000 hospital admissions and approximately 10,000 -14,000 deaths per annum in the US. Costs associated with hospitalization are estimated to exceed $1 billion annually. No vaccines are approved for the prevention of RSV infection. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed agai nst the RSV fusion (F) protein, is approved only for prophylaxis to prevent serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in high risk infants, but therapeutic efficacy has not been established. Ribavirin is the only approved treatment of serious R SV infections in hospitalized children, but its use via aerosol delivery is minimal due the inconvenient route of administration, lack of evidence for efficacy, and safety concerns. Therefore, novel therapeutics are needed for use both in the outpatient setting, to reduce the severity of infection and prevent hospital admissions, and in the hospital setting, to ameliorate the severity of symptoms and duration of time spent in the hospital. November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 5 In the last five years, a limited number of small molecule candida tes for RSV treatment have entered human clinical trial evaluation. Conventionally, these molecules are classified into two categories: fusion and non -fusion (or replication) inhibitors. Since the early 2000s, several compounds have been identified that in hibit virus -cell membrane fusion and cell -cell syncytium formation by binding to the RSV F protein. GS-5806 (presatovir; Gilead) is the most advanced RSV fusion inhibitor in clinical development, and is under investigation in Phase IIb studies in hospitali zed adults and patients undergoing either hematopoietic cell and lung transplants. Other RSV fusion inhibitors currently in early -stage clinical trial evaluation are the small molecule inhibitors; RV521 JNJ -678 (Janssen), nanobody, ALX -0171 (Ablynx). Non-fusion (or replication) inhibitors represent the second main class of anti -RSV agents. These molecules act at the intracellular level to disrupt viral replication by interfering with the polymerase complex that mediates viral genome replication and transcription. Although the first RSV replication inhibitors were reported over a decade ago (i.e. AZ - 27, RSV -604, BI -compound D), suboptimal potency and ADME properties hindered their progression either i nto clinical development or into later stage efficacy studies. To date, the only RSV replication inhibitor to reach human safety and efficacy evaluation is ALS -8176 (lumicitabine), a nucleoside analog prodrug discovered and developed by Alios BioPharma (fo r recent review on RSV replication inhibitors: [1]). The discovery of ALS -8112, the parent molecule of the prodrug ALS -8176, was the result of a screening campaign using a focused library of structurally diverse nucleoside and nucleotide analogs tested ag ainst RSV in an in vitro infectious assay [2]. The main scaffold identified from this screen was 2\u00b4difluoro -4\u00b4azido -cytidine. Further modifications at the 2\u00b4 - and 4\u00b4 - positions to improve anti -RSV potency and selectivity, led to the identification of (2\u00b4fluoro -4\u00b4chlorome thyl-cytidine). In vitro , ALS -8112 inhibits a broad panel of RSV A and B subtypes, as well as related pneumo -, paramyxo - and rhabdoviruses [3]. In particular, we recently reported that ALS -8112 inhibits RSV and human metapneumovirus with similar in vitro potency [4]. The molecular target of ALS -8112 was determined by two independent methods. The viral RNA polymerization function of the RSV L protein was identified as the target of ALS -8112 inhibition, first, by selecting and characterizing drug resistance - associated mutations located in the L gene. When introduced into a wild -type RSV genome, four amino acid mutations (M628L, A789V, L795I, -8112 [3]. Enzymatic assays using purified recombinant RSV polymerase were critical to validate the mode of action of ALS -8112. In these assays, the 5\u00b4 -triphosphate form of ALS -8112 (ALS - 8112 -TP) caused immediate chain termination of RNA synthesis and inhibition of the viral polymerization activity. This in hibitory effect was specific to RSV polymerase, since ALS -8112 -TP did not inhibit polymerases from host or viruses unrelated to RSV such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). Because of the low oral bioavailability of ALS -8112, a series of 2\u00b4, 3\u00b4 - diester prodrugs we re evaluated for improved pharmacokinetic properties. One prodrug, ALS -8176, formed high levels of monophosphate and triphosphate in the lungs when administered orally to nonhuman primates. Because of its high oral bioavailability, ALS -8176 was evaluated f or in vivo efficacy in African Green monkeys infected with RSV. At the end of treatment, RSV RNA was undetectable (< 50 copies/mL) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from all four ALS -8176 -treated animals whereas mean RSV RNA titers in the placebo -treated a nimals were 8.6 x 105 copies/mL [3]. Subsequently, a randomized, double -blind, clinical trial evaluated ALS -8176 given for 5 days to healthy adults inoculated with RSV [5]. The reduction in viral load area under the curve (AUC) in nasal washes associated with ALS -8176 treatment varied from 73% to 88% depending on the dose regimen compared to placebo -treated subjects. RSV RNA was undetectable 1.3 to 2.3 days after the start of ALS -8176 treatment compared with 7.2 days for placebo. Assessment of symptom sco res and quantity of mucus produced also showed a clear effect on RSV -induced disease. This is an important result that represents the first proof -of-concept validation that an RSV replication inhibitor can be efficacious in humans. ALS -8176 is currently in clinical development for the treatment of RSV infection in hospitalized infants and adults (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02202356, NCT02935673). ALS -8176 is the only RSV replication inhibitor currently in later stage, phase 2b, clinical trials, howe ver, other molecules that target the RSV replication are progressing into human clinical studies. PC786 ( pulmocide) is an RSV polymerase November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 6 inhibitor designed for delivery via inhalation that recently entered phase 1 clinical studies. In addition, there are s everal companies reporting pre -clinical programs on RSV replication inhibitors including EDP -938 (developed by Enanta) that is planned to reach phase I clinical trials later in 2017. Other companies such as Ark BioSciences and Aviragen Therapeutics have al so publically reported pre - clinical activities on RSV replication inhibitors. The perspective of having more than one replication inhibitor available for RSV treatment provides the opportunity to explore combination therapies. We have recently published in vitro antiviral synergy resulting from the combination of ALS -8112 with AZ -27 [6]. We therefore predict that synergistic effect between drugs and lack of broad cross -resistance induced by mutations in RSV polymerase will become strong arguments in favor of potential combination treatments, following the successful model of HIV and HCV therapeutics. In conclusion, recent efforts to discover and develop novel fusion and non -fusion RSV inhibitors are maturing with an emerging pre -clinical and clinical pipeline of exciting RSV therapeutic drug candidates. The next step in clinical development will be to assess the potential of these molecules to address the medical burden associated with RSV infection in infants and adults, both in outpatient and hospital settings.

COMMENTARIES Responding to emerging epidemics: Funding development of Rapid Response Vaccine Platforms (Ajoy C. Chakrabarti ) Platform & Portfolio Lead Polio, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle WA ajoy.chakrabarti@gatesfoundation.org The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) hosts a yearly event, the Product Development Challenge (PD Challenge) Forum, where key participants from industry, product development partnerships (PDPs), academia, Non-Government Organizations ( NGOs ) and BMGF G rantees gather to discuss current & future challenges related to product development for drugs and vaccines with global health applications. A highlight of the 2016 PD Challenge Forum was that the assembled participants were asked to select the most impo rtant area for the BMGF to focus on for 2017. Development and validation of rapid response technology platforms for production of vaccines to respond to emerging epidemics were identified as the top priority by a majority of the participants. That led to many follow -on discussions about how to advance this epidemic rapid response concept both within the BMGF and externally. The goal of developing rapid response platforms to interrupt epidemics dovetailed nicely with the recent launch of the Coalition of E pidemic Preparedness ( CEPI -http://cepi.net/), which views such platforms as essential to meeting their goals regarding epidemic preparedness. BMGF personnel are now working closely with CEPI to develop the review and assessment process for platform techno logies. The goal for CEPI will be to identify and fund the best of these new platform technologies by mid -2018. A formal announcement for a \"Call for Proposals\" (CfP) on development of platform technologies will be sent out in early September 2017. The Cf P will be aimed at developers who believe that their platform technology and manufacturing November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 7 operations can eventually meet the following attributes: Target a 16 -week timeframe from identification of antigen to product release for clinical trials Target a 6-week timeframe from administration of first dose to achievement of clinical benefit (i.e. immune response likely to result in clinical benefit) Produce 100,000 vaccine doses within 8 weeks to impact an emerging outbreak (i.e. from Go -decision to sca le-up to production, fill, finish, and release) Given these parameters, certain technologies are expected to be particularly well suited. For example, both DNA - and RNA -based vaccine platforms should be amenable to meeting the tight timelines for release of clinical trial material. However, other vaccine technologies are more advanced in terms of established large -scale commercial production, process optimization and completion of regulatory reviews. An ideal scenario would involve receiving submissions re lated to multiple platform technologies at various stages of development. However, the current breadth of platform technologies was not well understood. As a prelude to launching the CfP, it was felt that learning more about what platform technologies ar e currently available would be useful. Hence, a \"Request for Information\" (RFI) was sent out by CEPI in March 2017 to gather data on the current status of rapid response platforms, both for vaccines and therapeutic agents (typically monoclonal antibodies). A review of the summary findings from that RFI is informative in terms of understanding the general landscape of technologies that are currently under development. The geographic dispersion of respondents to the RFI is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1: B reakdown of submissions by region. Most of the applications came from North America and Europe. It is hoped that submissions from other areas will increase as awareness of the new funding opportunities associated with CEPI rises. The distribution of responses based on the type of organizati on that was submitting the response is shown in Figure 2 . The majority of responses coming from biotechnology companies was anticipated as the RFI was seeking novel approaches to manufacturing large amounts of vaccine under tight timelines. Given that many of the submissions consisted of multiple entities (primarily via consortia or partnerships), this sort of analysis may be potentially misleading , as often two types of organizations are submitting together. In those situations, the type of organization was classified by the member submitting the response. Figure 2: Distribution of resp onses by type of organization. Figure 3. Distribution of RFI responses by budget requested ( US$, millions). Finally, the proposed budgets for work submitted in response to the RFI are shown in Figure 3. The budgets and associated scopes of work represented a broad array of planned activities, ranging from limited lab studies to proposals to develop pilot -plant capabilities and fund clinical studies. As such, the value of a detailed analysis of the proposed budgets is November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 8 inherently limited. However, it is useful to understand from a funding envelope perspective that the majority of proposals were for > $10 million. T hus, any effort to fund multiple (3 -4, for example) proposals based on different platform technologies should be expected to cost at least $50 million. Assuming that clinical data was being requested, the overall budget for supporting multiple platforms in future grants could rise to be $100 million or more. The impact of the RFI data generated on the design of the upcoming CfP has been significant. The coming months will reveal the scope of rapid response technologies that are available and what additional work is needed to allow for the platforms to be valid ated. It is hoped that publications, such as this one, will continue to raise awareness of CEPI and the importance of rapid response vaccine platforms in preparing for future epidemics. Resources to support product development for antiviral agents and vaccines at NIAID (Sara E. Woodson1, Heather L. Greenstone2, and Mindy I. Davis3) 1Product Development Project Manager, HHS/NIH/NIAID/DMID Virology Branch 2Program Officer for Animal Model Antiviral Evaluations, HHS/NIH/NIAID/DMID Virology Branch 3Program Officer for Antiviral Discovery, HHS/NIH/NIAID/DMID Virology Branch Iododeoxyuridine was first described in the literature in 1959, and it later became the first antiviral drug licensed to treat ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection [1, 2]. This publication marked the dawn of antiviral drug discovery. However, for many in the medical field, antiviral drugs were thought to be an impossible therapeutic goal due, in part, to the theory that antiviral therapeutic dosages would be too toxic for use. Only a handful of compounds were identified in the 1960s, despite much in terest in the field. Since early drug discovery was expensive and few laboratories could conduct the testing, there was an obvious need to help advance the field. In 1971, the Collaborative Research Program was established at the National Institute of Al lergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as an extension of an existing interferon research and resources program. Over the years, that program has evolved into a comprehensive suite of contract services, colle ctively known today as the Preclinical Services Program of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) (hereafter referred to as the PCS Program). The PCS Program provides four types of research services: In Vitro Assessment, Prec linical Models of Infectious Diseases, Therapeutic Development Services, and Vaccine Development Services [3]. The PCS Program helps to fulfill NIAID's mission to \"conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases\" [4]. These resources, which are provided through a pool of pre -qualified contractors, are intended to lower the risk of, and assist with, drug discovery, testing, and preclinical development of promising produ cts. A broad overview, information about selection criteria, and other information is provided below for a few of the service areas that are most relevant to the ISAR newsletter readership. 1. In Vitro Assessment for Antimicrobial Activity This service provides resources to stimulate research and discovery of new antiviral therapies. Specific and broad -spectrum screens are available and the current panel contains 47 different viruses. The available viruses in the in vitro antiviral panel ar e dynamic, and viruses are added or removed based on current NIAID programmatic priorities. For example, Zika virus was added in 2016 to allow rapid screening of potential drug candidates against this re - emerging pathogen. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was remo ved from the panel in 2017 since numerous drugs have been developed and licensed for the treatment of HCV infections. The panel includes primarily human viruses with a few animal viruses that correspond with in vivo models such as the mouse and guinea pig cytomegaloviruses. The in vitro antiviral assays are replication -based and include assessment of the efficacy and cytotoxicity of the test article so that a selectivity index can be calculated. To access these services, product submitters (hereafter r eferred to as \"submitters\") must discuss the request with the relevant program officer and fill out an in vitro service request form (SRF). The information in this form allows NIAID to evaluate the request. Readiness for in vitro testing is evaluated based on the following: rationale for antiviral activity, mechanism of action, availability of high quality drug, product development plan, scientific priority, and availability of resources. A variety of molecules can be tested, such as purified small molecu les of known composition, peptides with known sequence, or antibodies. Serum or extracts are generally not November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 9 accepted. NIAID requests that submitters disclose the composition of the molecule. Examples of how the in vitro assessment services have been used by the extramural community include validating binding or enzymatic assay hits in an in vitro infectious assay, such as for Ebola virus which can only be tested under high -containment (BSL -4) conditions; determining if a molecule developed for one virus h as broad spectrum activity with other members of the family or other virus families; and assessing initial activity of a new molecule in the broad screen to evaluate whether it shows any activity in the other available virus families. 2. Pre clinical Models of Infectious Diseases . This service provides resources for assessing antiviral products and vaccines in vivo , developing novel models, or refining existing models of viral diseases; 40 different animal models of viral diseases are available. Most studies are conducted in mice or hamsters; testing in non -human primates is available for a limited number of viruse s including filoviruses and Zika virus. Investigators who wish to access these services must submit an in vivo SRF. Selection and prioritization for in vivo testing is based on factors such as the quality of in vitro and/or prior in vivo data, manufactu rability of the product, the likelihood that the product will be developed, and availability of resources. Acceptance for testing in non-human primates generally requires proof of prior activity in a small animal model. After acceptance for testing, a pr oduct -specific protocol is developed with input from the submitter, the relevant contractor, and NIAID staff; NIAID has the final authority on the protocol. Upon completion of a study, a report is generated by the contractor, reviewed by NIAID, and then p rovided to the submitter. The data can be used by the submitter as desired, for example, in a publication, as part of a grant proposal, to further the knowledge base of the product, or to inform decisions about the product's development potential. 3. Therapeutic an d Vaccine Development Services These services include a group of contractors that can fulfil l needs for optimization, testing, and more advanced stages of preclinical development in areas such as structure -activity relationships, synthesis/re - synthesis of compounds, pharmacokinetic analysis, feasibility and product development plans, formulation studies, toxicology, assay development, and cGMP manufacturing, among others. Preliminary data to support the product's developmental stage are required . Each request must be discussed with appropriate DMID staff from the respective scientific program and service type. Selection criteria for these services align with product category, and include program priorities and availability of resources. If the request is approved, the submitter will be invited to submit a formal proposal; senior leadership in DMID review all requests. All of the preclinical services offered by NIAID are open to investigators at academic institutions, not - for-profit organizations, small and large biotech companies, and governments worldwide. There is no need to have a previously established relationship with NIAID to utilize the services. DMID ensures that a submitter's intellectual property rights are protected.The services help advance discovery and preclinical development of products by providing testing to address specific resource -limited gaps. These preclinical services are not intended to be the sole source of development assistance. After the cost of product shipm ent, ser vices are offered at no cost to the submitter; however, resources for the services are limited and cannot be guaranteed to be available upon request. The submitter is obligated to sign a non -clinical evaluation agreement, provide preliminary data about the product, provide the product or the starting materials to the contractor, acknowledge the contribution of NIAID's support in publications/presentations, and report achievements about the product to NIAID. Data generated by the contractors are returned to the submitter and can be used to support future product development activities such as: go/no -go product development decisions, grant submissions, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) filings, and lifting of FDA clinical ho lds. Developing therapeutics and vaccines for viral diseases continues to be a challenge, with limited resources often making it difficult to bring promising products through the developmental pathway, and ultimately to those in need. NIAID has been supp orting the discovery, testing, and preclinical development of products to better cure, treat, or prevent viral disease since 1971. While this article has focused on antivirals and vaccine services for viral diseases, it should be noted that services are al so available through the PCS Program for the development of products for fungal, bacterial, and parasitic diseases.

March 1, 2017; 2nd International Conference on Crimean - Congo Hemorrhagic ever (Mike Bray ) Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widely distributed tick -borne viral disease of humans. The causative agent, an orthonairovirus in the family Nairoviridae (previously classified as a bunyavirus), has been recovered from ticks over a huge geographic region, extending from Spain across southern Eurasia to China and down the length of Africa. Sporadic cases and clusters of human infection have been observed throughout the endemic area, but are most common in Balkan countries and the Middle E ast (reviewed by (Bente et al., 2013)). In recognition of increasing scientific interest in CCHF, an international conference devoted to the disease was held in Thessaloniki, Greece in 2015 (Papa et al., 2015). Its success led to the organization of a s econd meeting, also held in Thessaloniki, from September 10 -12, 2017, which was attended by more than 100 researchers from 25 countries. Presentations at the conference covered a wide range of questions in the areas of epidemiology, virus replication, main tenance and transmission in tick vectors, immunology and vaccine development, diagnostic methods and antiviral therapy. Summaries will appear in a forthcoming meeting report, to be published in Antiviral Research. As its name suggests, CCHF was first reco gnized as a distinct disease in an outbreak in the Crimea in 1944, associated with the exposure of Soviet soldiers and farm workers to large numbers of tick bites. A virus isolated in the Belgian Congo in 1956 was shown 11 years later to be identical to t he Crimean agent, leading to the combined name of \"Crimean - Congo,\" and over subsequent decades closely related viruses were isolated from ticks, wild and domestic animals and human cases over a huge geographic area. Spain recorded its first indigenous cas e last year, and studies have shown the virus to be widespread in ticks in that country.

Courtesy of Pierre Formenty, WHO. CCHF is most common in Turkey, where the first patient was diagnosed in 2002. Strikingly increased numbers of cases were detected in subsequent years, with a total exceeding 5000 by 2009, and more than 1000 per year from 2010 -13, with a case fatality rate of just under 5%. The increase may have resulted in part from the re -occupation of abandoned farmland in eastern Turkey, leading to high tick exposures, but it is also likely that many mild cases that occurred before 2002 were not specifically diagnosed. Interestingly, the past two years have seen a significant decline in reported cases of CCHF in Turkey; whether this is a result of public health educational efforts to reduce tick exposure, or has been caused by other factors, is not known. November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 11 Maintenance of CCHF V in nature and modes of transmission to and between humans. Courtesy of Pierre Formenty, WHO As shown in the figure above, CCHF V circulates silently through persistent infection and vertical transmission in ticks, principally of the genus Hyalomma , with periodic amplification when ticks take blood meals from various small or large animals (Gargili et al ., 2017). Neither wild nor domestic mammals show any signs of illness, so that humans are the only animals to develop a visible diseas e when infected with CCHFV, and are thus the only \"sentinel\" species indicating the presence of the virus in a region. Human infections result most commonly from tick bites, though exposure may also occur through direct contact with the blood or tissues of viremic animals. Secondary human -to-human transmission has been observed, typically when a patient with unrecognized disease is treated by health care workers who fail to take precautions against blood - borne agents, though CCHF appears to be somewhat less contagious than the similar, but more severe Ebola virus disease. As indicated in the above figure, it is possible that CCHF resembles Ebola in the persistence of virus in \"sanctuary\" sites in convalescent patients, but studies are needed to confirm t he hypothesis. Mild cases of CCHF are characterized by fever and lethargy, but severe infections take on the features of viral hemorrhagic fever, with progressive hypotension leading to shock and variable degrees of hemorrhage. The development of bleedi ng in subcutaneous tissues, leading to the formation of extensive bruises, is characteristic of the disease . Early case reports indicated that the fatality rate from CCHF was typically in the range of 30 -50%, but as surveillance efforts have expanded and d etection methods have improved, overall case fatality rates have declined, and large series, such as those from Turkey, have had fatality rates of less than 5%. The presence of high seropositivity rates in domestic animals and humans in areas where few or no human cases have been reported suggests that most human infections are mild. As in the case of Ebola virus disease, severe infections leading to hospitalization may only receive a specific diagnosis when nosocomial transmission is observed. As sugg ested by the lack of observed illness in wild and domestic animals infected with CCHFV, common laboratory animals do not develop detectable disease when infected with the virus. However, success has been achieved in recent years in modeling major features of the human illness in interferon -deficient mice, and recent work reported at the Thessaloniki meeting described a severe illness resembling the human disease in cynomolgus macaques. Of greatest interest to antiviral researchers is the status of specif ic therapy for the disease. A number of case reports from the 1980s and '90s claimed a beneficial effect of treatment with oral or intravenous ribavirin, but the reports were based on a handful of patients and lacked a control group. Larger studies that have appeared since 2000 have given a mixed picture, with some appearing to show a benefit of therapy, especially when treatment is begun early after disease onset, while other patient series have failed to show an effect (reviewed in (Keshtkar - Jahromi, 20 11)). Carefully controlled clinical trials are therefore needed to determine the efficacy, if any, of ribavirin and to assess the benefit of novel therapeutic agents, such as favipiravir. This and other questions were the focus of a World Health Organizat ion (WHO) report earlier this year, which provided an authoritative review of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of CCHF in humans and identified important targets for research (Al -Abri et al., 2017). The following future directions for research and public health e fforts were listed in the report: 1. Standardization of case definitions for the early detection of CCHF patients; 2. Development of assays for CCHF RNA quantification that are rapid, precise and easy to implement at the point of care in resource -limite d settings; 3. Design and execution of a randomized controlled trial to properly validate or refute the efficacy of ribavirin, favipiravir and monoclonal antibodies; November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 12 4. Development of an algorithm as an aid to help clinicians rapidly establish the presump tive clinical diagnosis; 5. Sero -epidemiological studies for human and animal infection in the region, including in non - endemic countries; 6. Development of a set of risk communication messages for high -risk groups; 7. Identification of best surveillance practices for animal health for the early detection of potential spillover into humans; 8. Design and implementation of studies to develop CCHF or anti -tick vaccines for animals; 9. Ranking of areas by risk estimation and the spatial -temporal forecasti ng of CCHFV circulation and future outbreaks. These goals were presented and discussed by Pierre Formenty from WHO in the concluding session of the meeting. A proposal to form an International Society on CCHF was put forward on the second day of the meeti ng in Thessaloniki, and was approved by acclamation. Anna Papa, Ali Mirazimi and Roger Hewson were elected president, vice -president and secretary, respectively. An advisory council, consisting of researchers from 10 countries where CCHF is endemic, plus representatives from the USA and Germany, has since been created.

Papa A, Weber F, Hewson R, Weidmann M, Koksal I, Korukluoglu G, Mirazimi Opening the new Rega Institu te building at KU Leuven (Mike Bray ) The opening of the new Rega Institute building at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) , Belgium was celebrated in a two-day event on September 13 -14. The new facility forms part of the medical school complex on the Gasthuisberg medical campus and replaces the much smaller building on the Minderbroederstraat which had housed the Institute since 1954. The opening ceremo ny on September 13th was chaired by ISAR president -elect Johan Neyts. It began with a video presentation of the history of the Institute, whose name honors Hendrik Joseph Rega, a professor of anatomy who played a major role in leading the university throu gh the turbulent period of the early 18th century. The first Rega Institute, founded in 1882, was a two-story building that contained laboratories for research and teaching of medicinal chemistry and bacteriology. The scope of work expanded with the generation of antisera and other products before and after World War I, and was greatly increased in the late 1940s and 1950s, under the leadership of Pieter De Somer, when his company's success in the large - scale production of penicillin provided sufficient capital to support construction of a new Rega Institute of Medical Research. By the 1960s, De Somer had removed all links between his company and the Institute, but the concept of a partnership between science and industry to accelerate medical progress has continued to be a successful strategy, most evident in the collaboration with Gilead Sciences in the development of tenofovir. Following a series of presentations by leading figures at KU Leuven and the Belgian government and videotaped remarks by Pe ter Piot, the former executive director of UNAIDS, the highlight of the afternoon was the presentation of an honorary degree to John Martin, the executive chairman of Gilead Sciences. In his speech accepting the degree, John November 2017 ISAR News Vol. 27 No. 2 Antiviral Research 13 underlined the importance of collaboration in scientific research, as exemplified by his long -term partnership with Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd and Erik De Clercq, which led from the early evaluation of nucleotide analogue prodrugs to the remarkable success of tenofovir, which has prevented millions of deaths from AIDS, and is a component of therapy for some 90% of HIV -infected people who receive antiviral therapy. Erik De Clercq congratulates John Martin on receiving the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa. The scientific symposium on September 14th featured a series of keynote lectures on the range of scientific problems studied by Rega Institute investigators. Those of greatest interest to virologists were a presentation by Ab Osterhaus from the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany on \"Emerging virus infections and intervention strategies\"; by Phil Murphy from the US NIAID in Bethesda, Maryland on \"Bridging virology, immunology and clinical medicine with chemokine receptors\"; and by Robert Gallo from the Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, on \"Discoveries of human retroviruses.\" An important feature of the new Rega Institute laboratory is the P3 facility, shown above, which will make possible the study of all agents of human disease except for those, such as Ebola v irus, which require maximum P4 containment. The centerpiece of the lab is a state -of-the-art fully automated drug testing unit, which will be used for high -throughput screening of compound libraries for activity against a wide range of viral pathogens.
