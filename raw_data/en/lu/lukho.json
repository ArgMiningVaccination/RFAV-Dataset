The following requirement applies: Purpose: Vermont law requires that health insurers offer cov erage to parties to a civil union that is equiv alent to coverage provided to married persons. Definitions, Terms, Conditions and Provisions: The definitions, terms, conditions or any other pro visions of the policy, contract, certificate and/or riders and endorsements are hereby superseded as follows: 1) Terms that mean or refer to a marital relationship, or that may be construed to mean or refer to a marital relationship, such as any other such terms, include the relationship created by a civil union established according to Vermont law. 2) Terms that mean or ref er to the inception or dissolution of a marriage, such as \"date of marriage\", \"divorce decree\", \"termination of marriage\" and any other such terms include the inception or dissolution of a civil union established according to Vermont law. 3) Terms that m ean or refer to family relationships arising from a marriage, such as any other such terms include family relationships created by a civil union established according to Vermont law. 4) \"Dependent\" means a spouse, a party to a civil union established according to Vermont law, and a child or children (natural, stepchild, legally adopted or a minor or disabled child who is dependent on the insured for support and maintenance) who is born to or brought to a marriage or to a civil union established according to Vermont law. 5) \"Child or covered child\" means a child (natural, step -child, legally adopted or a minor or disabled child who is dependent on the insured for support and maintenance) who is born to or brought to a marriage or to a civil union established according to Vermont law. CAUT ION: FEDERAL LAW RIGHTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE Vermont law grants parties to a civil union the same bene fits, protections and responsibilities that flow from marriage under state law. Howev er, some or all of the benefits, protections and responsibilities related to health insurance that are available to married persons under federal law may not be available to parties to a civil union. For example, federal law, the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 known as \"ERISA\", controls the employer/employee relationship with regard to determining eligibility for enrollment in private employer health bene fit plans. Because of ERISA, Act 91 does not state requirements pertaining to a Version: February 2022private employer's enrollment of a party to a civil union in an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan. Howev er, governmental employers (not federal government) are required to provide health benefits to the dependents of a party to a civil union if the public employer provides health benefits to the dependents of married persons. Federal law also controls group health insurance continuation rights under COBRA for employers with 20 or more employees as well as the Internal Revenue Code treatment of health insurance premiums. As a result, parties to a civil union and their families may or may not have access to certain benefits under the policy, contract, certificate, rider or en dorsement that deriv e from federal law. You are advised to seek expert advice to determine your rights under this contract. 2.

The people who operate your Plan, called \"fiduciaries\" of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your em ployer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. 3.Enforce Your Rights If your claim for a welfare benefit is de nied or ignored, in whole or in part, you hav e a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Adm inistrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you hav e a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, i n whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. If the Plan requires you to complete administrative appeals prior to filing in court, your right to file suit in state or Federal court may be affected if you do not complete the required appeals. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you hav e sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is friv olous. 4.Assistance with Your Questions If you hav e any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.
