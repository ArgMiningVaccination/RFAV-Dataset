An effective holistic doctor can take the best of those practices and put them to use today. Our naturopathic doctor serves the area of North Hollywood, and finds natural ways to help our patients deal with their conditions and chronic issues. We offer a holistic approach to all kinds of problems, providing people with care that works with their body and helps it to heal. Those offering holistic medicine and holistic health services know what a body needs the most, and we work hard to make sure that every one of our patients has the care that they need. Help with Hormone Issues When hormones in the body are deficient or out of balance, this can negatively impact how the person feels and their overall health. In our assessment of the patient we may need to determine whether a person has the right levels of hormones in their body. Through a combination of testing and a thorough consultation, we can see if a person might need to receive bioidentical hormone replacement therapy or other treatments. Conditions that may require hormone balancing include menstrual issues, menopausal symptoms, low libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, insomnia, and depression. We also may address hormones to help a person experience optimal health as they age. Integrative Cancer Treatment When a person is dealing with cancer, they may choose holistic health options in addition to the help offered by their oncologist. We offer a mix of alternative cancer treatments that complement their conventional treatments, including high dose vitamin C, herbal medicines, supplements, lifestyle and dietary therapies, and off-label pharmaceuticals. We assist the body to fight the cancer, offering non-toxic treatment options, and also offer treatments to decrease the side effects that occur with conventional cancer treatment. Healing for Lyme Disease Patients An illness such as Lyme disease can affect the body in a number of ways and cause a variety of symptoms.
