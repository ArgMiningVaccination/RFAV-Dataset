In Oregon and many locations worldwide, Naturopathic Doctors are licensed as Primary Care Physicians that manage pharmaceuticals, practice IV therapy and perform minor surgery. Using a holistic approach that addresses underlying causes of illness and imbalance, we diagnose and treat acute and chronic diseases and conditions. We conduct holistic medical interviews, perform physical examinations, incorporate preventative and diagnostic examinations as well as laboratory tests to best determine individualized treatment plans. My approach to wellness includes utilizing clinical nutrition and lifestyle guidance, homeopathy, counseling, hydrotherapy, and herbal medicine to help reach your health goals. "}
