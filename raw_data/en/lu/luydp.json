(Or, you may prefer this nutritionist-approved [pumpkin spice latte recipe](https://www.thehealthy.com/food/recipes/pumpkin-spice-latte-recipe/).) This warm beverage hails from India, where turmeric has been used as a health boost and natural remedy for centuries. The drink\u2014you'll hear it called turmeric coffee, a golden latte, or a golden milk latte\u2014doesn't always involve coffee. Rather, hot golden milk includes heated cow's milk or plant-based milk with turmeric, [cinnamon](https://www.thehealthy.com/weight-loss/cinnamon-weight-loss/), and [ginger](https://www.thehealthy.com/food/ginger-health-benefits/). What's turmeric? Turmeric, golden spice used liberally as a colorant and peppery kick in Indian cuisine, has been touted as a digestive aid for centuries. \"Turmeric has many beneficial anti-inflammatory compounds, specifically curcuminoids, or curcumin, which have been found to fend off inflammation and keep the heart and brain healthy, too,\" says registered dietitian nutritionist Vicki Shanta Retelny, RDN, a culinary consultant and host of Nourishing Notes. There are thousands of [peer-reviewed studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=curcumin) on [turmeric's health benefits](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/things-happen-when-you-eat-more-turmeric/), including skin](https://www.thehealthy.com/beauty/hair/turmeric-beauty-benefits/). However, eating or drinking curcumin does not always guarantee health improvements. It must be ingested in a way that your body can easily absorb. Combining turmeric and coffee There are indications that coffee could diminish turmeric's health benefits, though the fat in some golden lattes could help your body absorb more curcumin. Both turmeric and coffee also offer loads of antioxidants. How coffee affects the absorption of curcumin A 2020 study published in the journal Molecules suggests [curcumin absorption](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/25/6/1397) is improved when combined with fat and liquid with a pH level of 6 or higher: The lower a pH number, the more acidic a substance is, and coffee comes in around pH 5. However, lattes containing whole milk or fatty plant-based milk could balance the acidity of the coffee and improve your chances of absorbing turmeric's health-boosting curcumin. What's more, coffee offers health perks of its own, according to Shanta Retelny. (Here are some [surprising health benefits of coffee](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/surprising-health-benefits-coffee/) to know.) \"Coffee beans have a variety of health benefits, as they contain over 1,000 bioactive compounds,\" she says. \"Coffee also contains antioxidants that can keep cells healthy, and coffee has been shown to fend off type 2 diabetes and heart disease, as well as increase longevity.\" Antioxidants in turmeric and coffee Mixing up a turmeric latte might diminish some of turmeric's benefits, but it's still an [antioxidant-rich](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/), low-calorie way to start your day. Shanta Retelny says that turmeric and coffee might have different types of antioxidant compounds, which could mean the combination is more beneficial than either ingredient alone. \"Research has shown that turmeric's antioxidants can activate antioxidant enzymes in the body to offer internal protection, too,\" she adds. annick vanderschelden photography/Getty Images The potential health benefits of drinking turmeric coffee The idea of adding turmeric to coffee is a fairly new trend. There is individual research on turmeric and coffee, but no data of its potential health benefits as a concoction. However, the combination of turmeric and coffee together could offer a potent drink. Here's the scientific data so far on the golden spice. May calm inflammation Research shows that turmeric can [reduce inflammation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2225411016302528) related to several health conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. Turmeric lattes often include ginger and cinnamon, two spices that some research suggests can also tamp down inflammation. The combination may help soothe the pain and redness related to joint inflammation. (Find out whether [coffee causes inflammation](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/does-coffee-cause-inflammation/).) May improve your mood If you're a regular coffee drinker, your morning cup of joe might already feel like a warm, comforting ritual. Add the potential [antidepressant activity of curcumin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23832433/) to the energizing jolt of caffeine, and you've got a beverage that could lift your mood. (This is what happens to your body when you [drink coffee every day](https://www.thehealthy.com/food/drink-coffee-every-day/).) May help with blood sugar Research published in the Journal of Nutrition & Intermediary Metabolism in 2018 suggests that curcumin may help people with type 2 diabetes [manage their blood sugar](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235238591730275X). Blood sugar control is critical for preventing complications from diabetes, including heart and kidney diseases, nerve damage, and vision deterioration. Of course, all bets are off if you add too much sugar or honey to your golden latte. In fact, a latte that's too carb-heavy could end up raising blood sugar. (Here are [natural sweeteners](https://www.thehealthy.com/food/natural-sweeteners/) that are better for you than sugar.) May ease digestive woes A 2018 research review published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine suggests that turmeric may relieve [stomach discomfort](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/7/10/298) from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These symptoms include diarrhea bloating, or painful stomach cramps. But, the researchers note, the benefit was small and the findings based on limited evidence. A small study published in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology suggests that adding curcumin to the prescription treatment for ulcerative colitis can [help soothe symptoms](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565%2815%2900158-5/fulltext). May lower heart disease risk Though many factors\u2014including genetic ones\u2014can contribute to heart disease, inflammation can also be a trigger\u2014and turmeric coffee packs an anti-inflammatory punch. A 2020 study published in Biotechnology Advances indicates that [curcumin's anti-inflammatory power](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0734975019300102?via%3Dihub)\u2014along with ingredients such as [cinnamon](https://www.annfammed.org/content/11/5/452.long) and ginger\u2014could help with some of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including cholesterol and blood pressure. Just keep in mind that a lot of lifestyle habits contribute to heart disease, and managing your [alcohol](https://www.thehealthy.com/heart-disease/alcohol-and-heart-disease/) and [tobacco](https://www.thehealthy.com/addiction/smoking/quit-smoking/) consumption, [stress](https://www.thehealthy.com/heart-disease/stress-and-heart-disease/), [obesity](https://www.thehealthy.com/heart-disease/the-sobering-connection-between-obesity-and-heart-disease/), and [activity levels](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/yoga/yoga-aerobic-exercise-reduce-heart-disease-risk/) will have a greater impact o your risk. Turmeric coffee isn't a cure-all It's important to remember that turmeric lattes are not well-researched. Potential perks, like a better mood or reduced pain, might be possible, but sprinkling spices into your morning java is no substitute for medical treatment. \"Turmeric coffee is not an elixir by any means,\" says Shanta Retelny. \"It's another way to get some turmeric into the diet, but adding turmeric to your culinary endeavors may not be enough as a therapeutic dose.\" She cautions against relying on turmeric coffee as a cure-all, adding that turmeric coffee can be a great treat if your diet is already full of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. In addition, turmeric coffee still contains caffeine. Shanta Retelny says, \"Overdoing coffee or any caffeinated beverage may cause irritability, lack of focus, heartbeat irregularities, and poor sleep. It's best to be moderate with any coffee beverage.\" (Here are the [signs you're drinking too much coffee](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/drinking-too-much-coffee/).)
