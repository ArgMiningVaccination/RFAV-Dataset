As you all know oral health has a direct effect on our general health and keeping our mouth as healthy as possible will help to decrease unnecessary negative impacts on our general health. So, this is a good time to think about the 6 things that can affect our oral health in a negative way. These are: Dental infections such as caries (decay), periodontal disease and dental abscesses all put stress on the immune system and both dental abscesses and periodontal disease have direct links to heart disease. In the case of periodontal disease, studies are now showing it has an association with degenerative neurological disorders such as dementia. Dental abscesses also create a short circuit in the energy pathway running through the tooth in question which creates an energetic imbalance along that energetic pathway (meridian) which may have a negative impact on the organs and glands in that pathway. Toxins from root canals and periodontal disease and mercury from amalgams all stress the immune system. Mercury from amalgams goes into the lungs during normal respiration and 80% is absorbed into the bloodstream. Microscopic fragments of amalgam are also swallowed on average 2,000 times a day into the GI Tract and create inflammation in the GI Tract. Inflammation of the GI Tract downregulates absorption of nutrients from your diet and also downregulates the excretion of toxins into the bowel. Also approx. 70% of your immune system is located in your GI Tract and if it's inflamed then your immune system is compromised. Removing amalgams is our specialty and it goes hand in hand with a specific heavy metal detoxification program specifically designed for you. Poor diet has been well known to not only negatively influence the health of the body in general, but a poor diet also has a negative impact on oral health. A diet high in organic meats and fruits and vegetables and drinking reverse osmosis filtered water is ideal for good oral and general health. Minimizing sugars, refined carbohydrates and soft drinks will help greatly. Allergens from diet and dental materials can also have a negative effect on both oral and general health. Removing allergy triggering foods from the diet is important and using the most biocompatible dental materials when restoring the dentition is highly important. Stress may be the trickiest one of all to minimize, especially in the environment we find ourselves in at the moment. Stress not only impacts our immune system but when mammals are stressed they clench their teeth and excessive clenching/grinding of the dentition can cause many issues such as broken/worn teeth, broken fillings, traumatic bone loss leading to loose teeth, TMJ issues, headaches/migraines, postural issues, increased release of mercury vapour into the oral cavity which is then inhaled and well as other issues. Meditation is probably the greatest tool we have to fight stress. Studies show that even 10 minutes of meditation daily can help to bring us out of stress mode back to relaxation/digestion/healing mode. There are many techniques for meditation, and we suggest finding the one that best suits you. Magnesium supplementation is hugely important to deal with stress also. Magnesium is the body's most important mineral and we burn up our magnesium really fast. Transdermal (through the skin) administration is our preferred way of increasing magnesium levels in the body as your skin is the largest organ in the body and it can absorb a lot of magnesium quickly. Either a topical spray of magnesium chloride or good old Epsom salt baths work very effectively. Epsom salts are and we recommend 1kg of high-quality Epsom salts in a bathtub of water and soak for at least 20 minutes. Floatation therapy is even more efficient at getting magnesium into the body as our float tank has 325kg of magnesium in it. It also helps to achieve a meditative state a lot quicker and deeper than trying to meditate normally due to the absence of external stimuli. The way we swallow and breath has a tremendous influence on how our mouth and lower face grows and functions. Incorrect swallowing and/or breathing and even habits such as thumb sucking in young children can impede normal growth patterns which may result in unfavourable growth patterns of the face and jaws and an undesirable occlusion (the way the teeth come together), as well as allergy issues.
