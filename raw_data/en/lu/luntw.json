Raymond A Williamson iiiABSTRACT Therapeutic Radiation has been used for the treatment of cancer and other diseases for nearly a century. Over the past 20 years, Hyperbar ic Oxygen Treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the more severe complications associated with the side e ffects of Therapeutic Radiation Treatment (TRT). The use of HBOT is based on the premise that increased oxygen tissue tension aids wound healing by increasing the hypoxic gradient and stimulating angiogenesis and fibroblast differentiation. As it takes up to 6 months for a hypoxic state to develop in treated tissue, following radiation trea tment, current recommendations for HBOT state that it is not effective until afte r this time. During th is 6 month period, immediately following TRT, many specialized tissues in or adjacent to the field of irradiation, such as salivary glands a nd bone, are damaged due to a progressive thickening of arteries and fibrosis, and th ese tissues are never replaced. Currently, HBOT is used to treat the complications of TRT, but it would be far better if they could be prevented. With this in mind a prospectiv e study was performed in an irradiated rat model to determine whether or not HBOT is effective in reducing the long-term side effects of therapeutic radi ation treatment to normal tissue, when 20 intermittent daily HBOT are started one week after the completion of the radiation treatment. The aim of this study then was to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or morbidity of TRT when HBOT is given a week after completion of TRT. The experimental model was designed to simula te a fractionated course of TRT that is commonly used in the treatment of can cer. The radiotherapy was given to the mandible to maximise the number of tissues for investigation. On e week following the completion of the radiotherapy, the animal s underwent a 4 week course of HBOT, ivusing the same treatment parameters used in the treatment of the complications associated with Radiotherapy. Four groups of animals were used: Group 1 as a control, Group 2 having a 4 week course of HBOT, Group 3 having a 3 week course of TRT, and Group 4 having both a 3 week co urse of TRT and a 4 week course of HBOT. Two animals from each group were sacr ificed at 8 week intervals until the end of the experiment at 253 days (36 weeks). All animals were give n tetracycline every 4 weeks in order to investigate tooth growth. Sections of teeth were viewed under UV li ght and clearly showed continued growth rings of tetracycline in Groups 1, 2 and 4, with the growth rate of the treated Group 4 teeth being almost three times the growth rate of the non-treated Group 3 teeth. Histological sections of tissu e taken from the angle of the mandible clearly showed maintenance of specialised tissues, such as salivary glands and osteoblasts, in the treated group compared to the non-treate d group of animals at the end of the experiment. In summary, this experimental mode l has fulfilled its prime objective of demonstrating that HBOT is effective in reducing the long-term side effects of therapeutic radiation treatment in normal tissue, when given one week after the completion of the radiation treatment and statistically disprove s the Null Hypothesis that there is no difference in the inci dence of postoperativ e complications or morbidity of TRT when 20 intermittent da ily HBOT are started one week after completion of TRT. This project provides an extensive descriptio n of the histological process and also proposes a hypothesis for the molecular events that may be taking place. \"Prevention is better than cure .\" Desiderius Erasmus (1466-1536) \"When mediating over a disease, I never think of finding a remedy for it, but, instead a means of preventing it .\" Louis Pasteur (1822 - 1895) vACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am extremely grateful to my two s upervisors Professor John McGeachie and Associate Professor Marc Tennant for thei r encouragement, guidance, friendship and support throughout this seemi ngly interminable project.

Since 1983 the pathophysiology of the irradiated wound has been better defined by Marx. 4 It is now understood to be a sequence of events that follow the radia tion treatment: a gradual and progressive obliterative endarteritis and cellular dysfunction leads to a Hypoxic, Hypovascular and Hypocellular tissue (the three ' H' principle).4,5,6,7 The clinical significance of these progressive changes lies in the potential sus ceptibility of patients to the complications of Radiotherapy Treatment. Although the comp lications will occur in any part of the body, treated by radiotherapy, they are most dramatic in the head and neck area, particularly the mouth. During radiation treatment patients will develop acute symptoms which include painful and desquamative mucositis. As the effects of the radiotherapy are progressive (three 'H ' principle), the patient will develop complications, such as dry mouth, difficulty chewing and swallo wing, and progressive dental caries, and in the long term thes e symptoms greatly decrease the patient's quality of life. Since Marx's 4,5,6,7 initial work in 1983, the us e of HBOT has been well established for over 20 years as part of the treatment for the complications associated with therapeutic radiation treatment. At pr esent, clinicians are able to treat the complications of radiotherapy using HB OT which improves wound healing through induction of vascular prolif eration, among other effects. 4,5 The mechanism by which 2HBOT acts on tissues damaged by radiatio n is by influencing the oxygen gradient necessary for proper wound heal ing. Irradiated tissue has a wounding pattern that is so diffuse that only a shallow oxyge n gradient is created. Ther efore, the physio-chemical response which identifies an injured area as a wound does not develop. HBOT produces a steeper oxygen gradient in the ir radiated tissue and this then provides the stimulus for the normal wound healing process. In previous studies on non-irradiated tissues (i.e. surgical wounds, tumours)8,9 it has been shown that a hypoxic tissue gradient is necessary for the initiation of angiogenesis and removal of such a gradient results in the cessation of capillary growth. It is the result of this hypoxic microenvironment that stimulates the re lease of macrophage-derived angiogenesis factors, which promote capillary budding. 6,7 However, in tissues damaged by radiation such steep oxygen gradients are lacking and therefore the stimulus by which angiogenesis and fibroplasia (i ncrease fibroblastic cell count ) are initiated is absent.10 HBOT is known to restore this oxygen grad ient needed for healing and its positive effects have been reported by many6,7,8,10 and will be elaborated in the Literature Review. While HBOT has proven effective in assist ing wound healing in irradiated patients, many specialized tissues in or adjacent to the field of radi ation, such as salivary glands, are destroyed. Loss of salivar y glands will cont ribute to complications such as dry mouth and radiation caries, which in turn may lead, in some cases, to osteoradionecrosis. HBOT is currently used only for the treatment of the soft tissue complications associated with radiotherapy a nd for the prevention or treatment of cases of osteoradionecrosis. The complications asso ciated with the loss of specialized tissues are not recoverable due the current policy of not treating the patients for at least 6 months after TRT is complete. Current recommendations for HBOT treatment 5,6,7,11 are 3based on the premise that the area to be treated must ha ve a low oxygen tension and be hypoxic. As the affects of TRT take up to 6 months to lead to hypoxia in the treated and surrounding tissues, current recommendati ons state that HBOT is not effective until the 6 month period has elapsed. . While the treatment of the complications of TRT is commendable and very necessary, it would be far better if they could be prevented. When patients are treated with HBOT, it is only given for an average time of 90 minutes per day for 30 sessions over 6 weeks. For the other 22.5 hours per day the patient breaths normal barometric air. Ther efore, the HBOT must be doing more than just increasing the hypoxic gradie nt and assisting wound healing. One of the well remembered quotes of the Dutch humanist, Desiderius Erasmus (1466- 1536), written in his publica tion Adagia (1500), is \" Prevention is better than cure .\" The French Chemist and Microbiologist, L ouis Pasteur (1822 - 1895) has also been credited with saying \" When mediating over a disease, I never think of finding a remedy for it, but, instead a means of preventing it .\" Louis Pasteur put th is thought in practice with the development of vaccines for anthrax, rabies and chicken cholera, as well as lending his name to the term \"pasteurizatio n\" of milk, which he first performed on April 20, 1862. With the inspiration of thes e famous scholars, a prospective study was performed in an irradiated rat model to dete rmine whether or not HBOT is effective in reducing the long-term side effect s of TRT to normal tissue, when 20 intermittent daily HBOT are started one week after the co mpletion of the radiation treatment. This study focuses on the comparative histolog y of various tissues of the oro-facial (mandibular) region of rat models, specifically that of teeth, sali vary glands, bone, arteries, nerves and muscle. To study th e effects of HBOT on irradiated damaged tissue, four groups were used: 4Group 1 - healthy air-breathing control; Group 2 - hyperbaric control, exposed to HBOT only; Group 3 - subjected to a course of radiation; Group 4 - subjected to a course of radiation and HBOT. Comparisons were made using various stains for light microscopy to demonstrate the tissues of interest, using morphological and qu antitative analysis of the various tissues of the rat lower jaw, thus indicating any potential clinical rele vance regarding the human model. The data obtained indicate that exposure to a 4 week course of HBOT, a week after a TRT has been completed, may prove benefici al in the prevention of extensive tissue damage and necrosis. This study, which focused primarily on the effects within the irradiated rat model, may be extrapolated to the human model and therefore apply to human treatment. 5CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1 CYTOKINES IN WOUND HEALING The response to injury is a phylogenetically primitive, yet essentia l innate host immune response for restoration of tissue integrity. Tissue disruption in higher vertebrates, unlike lower vertebrates, results not in tissue regeneration, bu t in a rapid repair process leading to a fibrotic scar . Wound healing, whether initiated by trauma, microbes or foreign materials, proceeds via an overlappi ng pattern of events in cluding coa gulation, inflammation, epithelialisation, formation of granulation tissue, matrix and tissue remodelling. The process of re pair is mediated in large part by interacting molecular signals, primarily cytokines, which motivat e and orchestrate the manifold cellular activities which undersco re inflammation and healing (Figure 1). Response to injury is frequently modelled in the skin,12 but parallel coordinated and temporally regulated patterns of mediators and cellular events occur in most tissues subsequent to injury. The initial injury triggers coagulation and an acute local inflammatory response followed by mesenchymal cell recruitment, proliferation and matrix synthesis. Failure to resolve the inflammation can lead to chronic nonhealing wounds, whereas uncontrolled matrix accumula tion, often involving aberrant pathways, fi brotic sequelae. Con tinuing progress in deciphering the essential and complex role of cytokines in wound healing provides opportunities to explore pathways to inhibit/enhance approp riate cytokines to control or modulate pathologic healing. The comp lex interplay between multiple cytokines, cells and extracellular matrix is central to the initiati on, progression and resolution of wounds and will be discussed under the following headings:- 6 Platelet Activation and Cytokine Release Inflammation Re-epithelialisation Granulation Tissue and Angiogenesis Matrix Production and Scar Formation Remodelling Phase Aberrant Healing Fig.1. Wound Healing is a complex process encompa ssing a number of overlapping phases, including inflammati on, epithelialisa tion, angiogenesis and matrix deposition. During inflammation, the formation of a bloo d clot re-establishes haemostasis and provides a provisional matrix for cell migration. Cytokines play an important role in the evolution of granulation tissue through re cruitment of inflammatory leukocytes and stimulation of fibroblas ts and epithelial cells.12 [Note: Figure 1 is adapted from Singer and Clark, 199912] 72.1.1. PLATELET ACTIVATION AND CYTOKINE RELEASE Most types of injury dama ge blood vessels, and coagula tion is a rapid response to initiate haemostasis and protect the host from excessive blood loss. With the adhesion, aggregation and degranulation of circulating platelets within the forming fibrin clot, a plethora of mediators and cytokines is re leased (Table 1), in cluding transforming growth factor beta (TGF- ), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that influence tissue oedema and initiate inflammation. VEGF, a vascular permeability factor, influences the extravasation of plasma proteins to create a temporary s upport structure upon which not only activated endothelial cells, but also leukocytes and epithelial ce lls subsequently migrate 13. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), the ligand for Tie- 2 receptors, is a natural antagonist for VEGF's effects on permeability, a key regula tory checkpoint to avoid excessive plasma leakage. Latent TGF- 1, released in large quantit ies by degranulating platel ets, is activated from its latent complex by proteolytic and non-proteolytic mechanisms14 to influence wound healing from the initial insult and clot formation to the final phase of matrix deposition and remodeling. 15 Active TGF- 1 elicits the rapid chemot axis of neutrophils and monocytes to the wound site16 in a dose-dependent manner through cell surface TGF- serine/threonine type I and II receptors and engagement of a Smad3-dependent signal.17 (See Append 1, page 141 for definitio n of Smad) Autocrine expression of TGF-1 by leukocytes and fibroblasts, in tu rn, induces these cells to generate additional cytokines including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1) and PDGF, as well as chemokines, as components of a cytokine cascade.18 Such factors act to perpetuate the infla mmatory cell response, mediating recruitment and activation of neutrophils and monocytes. In response to TGF- and other 8cytokines, which engage thei r respective cell surf ace receptors, intracellular signalling pathways are mobilized to drive phenotypic and functional responses in target cell populations.19 Among the upstream signalling cascades engaged in acute tissue injury are NF-B, Egr-1, Smads, and MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases, which result in activation of many cognate target genes, including adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, cytokines Wound Healing. Cytokines are listed in the first column and the cell sources of these cytoki nes are in columns 2 to 8. 92.1.2. INFLAMMATION Of the myriad of cytokines that have been investigated in terms of wound healing, TGF-1 has undoubtedly the broadest effects. Despite the vast number of reports documenting the actions of TGF- in this context, both in vitro and in vivo , controversy remains as to its endogenous role. The paradoxical actions of TGF- are best appreciated in inflammation, where de pendent upon the state of differentiation of the cell and the cont ext of action, TGF- acts in a bi-directional manner.21 Moreover, this understanding of the nature of TGF- has led to the hypothesis that it may act as a therapeutic tool in some circumstances, but also a target for therapeutic intervention in others.21,22 Recent studies, in particular those utilizing genetically manipulated animal models, have highlighted the impact of TGF- on various aspects of wound healing, and surprisingly, not all of its effects are conducive to optimal healing. Intriguingly, mutations within the TGF- 1 gene, or in the cell signalling intermediate Smad3, lead to normal or even accelerated cutaneous wound healing responses.17 The rate of healing of full-thickness wounds in Smad3 null mice was significantly greater than in their wild-type counterparts, associated with enhanced ep ithelialisation a nd keratinocyte proliferation, and a markedly diminished inflammatory response. These observations have broad implications for understanding the role of TGF- in the endogenous wound healing response, in that an excess of TGF- may be a normal constituent of the response for rapid and optimal protection of the host. In the absence of infection, however, reduction of this over exuberant r ecruitment, inflammation and keratinocyte suppression may result in a more cosmetically acceptable scar. This knowledge may allow clinicians to optimize the response by modulating selective cell pathways and to tailor therapy to specific cellular defects in pathological conditi ons such as chronic ulcers and fibrotic processes. 10With the initial barrage of mediators, including TGF- , a chain reaction is set in motion, with recruitment, proliferation and activation of the cell ular participants. Among the first cells to respond are the va scular endothelial ce lls, which not only respond to cytokines, but release them as well. Cytokine-induced enhancement of adhesion endothelium provides the platfo rm which selectins, Ig slowing down to sense the microenvironment and respond to chemotactic signals at the site of tissue injury.23 Adhesion molecule interactions between blood leukocytes and endothelium enables transmig ration from inside to outside the vessel wall in response to multiple chemotactic signals. In addition to the powerful chemotactic activity of TGF- 1 for neutrophils and monocytes,16,21 multiple chemokines are released to entice leukocytes into the site of tissue injury. Chemokines are represented by several families of related molecules based on the spatial location of the cysteine residues. Deletion of genes for chemokines leads to specific alterations in wound healing, underlying their role in this process 24-26. Migrating through the provisiona l matrix (scaffolding) provided by the fibrin-enriched clot, leukocytes release proteases and e ngage in essential functions including phagocytosis of debris, microbes and degraded matrix components. Proteolytic activity is not constitutive, but transcriptionally driven by the cytokines, TGF- , IL-1 and TNF-, released from multiple cellular sour ces (Table 1). Neutrophil recruitment typically peaks around 24-48 hours post wounding, followed by an increasing representation of monocyte s which are essential for optimal wound healing.27,28 Activation of these cells in the context of the wound microenvironment results in 11enhanced release of chemokines, recruitmen t of reinforcements, and amplification of the response, with the furthe r release of cytokines, TNF- , IL-1 potentially, endoc rine mediators of host defence. Antigen stimulation drives lymphocytic recruitmen t and activation, but at a delayed pace compared to the rapid acute response essen tial to maintain tiss ue integrity. Beyond the neutrophil, monocyte/macrophage and lympho cyte participants, mast cells have become increasingly recognized as active part icipants with increas ed numbers noted at sites of cutaneous injury.29 Mast cells respond to monocyt e chemotactic protein (MCP- 1) and TGF- 1, -2 and -3, and within the lesion, re lease mediators (histamine, proteoglycans, and cytokines, including TGF- and IL-4 (Table 1). Once the inflammatory cells are activated, they become susceptible to TGF- 1 mediated suppression to reverse the inflammatory process.18,21 Moreover, IL-4 may also dampen the inflammatory response as the inciting agent /trauma is dealt with and promote collagen synthesis during the repair phase. 2.1.3. RE-EPITHELIALISATION Clearance of debris, foreign agents, and/or infectious organisms promotes resolution of inflammation, apoptosis, and the ensuing repa ir response that encompasses overlapping events involved in granulation tissue, angi ogenesis, and re-epithelialisation. Within hours, epithelial cells begin to proliferate, migrate and cover the exposed area to restore the functional integrity of the tissue. Re-epithelialisation is critical to optimal wound healing not only because of reformati on of a cutaneous barrier, but because of its role in wound contraction. Immature keratinocytes produ ce matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and plasmin to dissociate from the basement membrane and facilitate their migration across the open wound bed in res ponse to chemoattract ants. The migration 12of epithelial cells occurs independently of proliferation, and depends upon a number of possible processes including grow th factors, loss of contact with adjacent cells, and guidance by active contact. TGF- 1 stimulates migration of keratinocytes in vitro ,17,30 possibly by integrin regulation and/ or provisional matrix deposition.31 Behind the motile epidermal cells, basal cell keratinocyte proliferation is mediated by the local release of growth factors, with a parallel up-regulation of grow th factor receptors including TNF- , heparin-binding epidermal growth (KGF or FGF-7). 32-34 Such growth factors are released not only by keratinocytes themselves, acting in an au tocrine fashion, but also by mesenchymal cells and macrophages (Table 1), as paracrine mediators.35,36 Numerous animal models in which cytokine genes have been deleted or over-expressed have provided further evidence that such factors are involved in the process of epithelialization.34 TGF-1, and -2 are potent inhibitors of keratinocyte proliferation, with the Smad3 pathway implicated as the negative modulator.17 Since epithelialisa tion is significantly accelerated in mice null for the Smad3 gene, with unchecked keratinocyte proliferation, but impaired migration in response to TGF- 1, the implication is that the early proliferative event is critical to normal epithelialization.17 Once contact is established with opposing keratinocytes, mito sis and migration stop, and in the skin, the cells differentiate into a stratified squamous ep ithelium above a newly generated basement membrane. Other factors secreted by keratinocytes may exert paracrine effects on dermal fibroblasts and macrophage s. One such factor is a non-glycosylated protein termed s ecretory 1 activation. In macrophage-derived cytokine with autocrine and paracrine activities,37, 38 but production by human macrophages has not yet be en demonstrated. In mice, an absence 13of this mediator of innate host defence (SLPI null) is associated with aberrant healing.37 2.1.4. GRANULATION TISSUE AND ANGIOGENESIS Granulation tissue forms below the epithelium and is composed of inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and newly formed and forming vesse ls (Figure 2). This initial restructuring of the damaged tissue serves as a tempor ary barrier against the hostile external environment. Within granulation tissue, angiogenesis ( i.e. the generation of new capillary blood vessels from pre-existing va sculature to provide nutrients and oxygen) is potentiated by hypoxia, nitric oxide (NO) , VEGF and (FGF-2)13,39 and chemokines, MCP-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1a).40 VEGF, released from wound epitheliu m and from the extracellular matrix by endothelial-derived proteases, en dothelial VEGF may be transcriptiona lly up-regulated in response to NO, which also influences vasodilatation, an early step in angioge nesis. In a cyclic fashion, VEGF also synt hase (NOS) in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells high receptors for VE GF, VEGF R1 (Flt-1) and VEGF R2 (Flk- 1), and primary target of this angiogenic and vascular permeability factor.31 Mice heterozygous for targeted inactivation of VEGF or homozygous for inactivation of its receptors are embryonically lethal, confirming the essentiality of VEGF in angiogenesis.43,44 ts involved in angioge nesis. FGFs recruit endothelial cells, direct their differen tiation and plasminogen activator synthesis. Clearly a multifactorial process, th e cellular events underlying neovascularisation are also impacted by TGF- 1, EGF, angiogenesis is a tightly contro lled process. It is characterized not only by the presence of endogenous inducers, but also inhibitors which mediate a decline in the process as the granulation tissue, named for the granular appearance of the blood vessels in the wound, matures and scar remo delling continues. Among the of MMPs (TIMPs), in addition to the recently recognized activities of angiostatin and endostatin13. Since loss of angiogenic control may have negative consequences as evident in tumours, rheumatoid arthritis, and endometriosis, identification of potential endogenous and therapeutic modulators continues. Fig. 2. The remodelling phase (i.e. re-epithelialisation and neovascularisation) of wound healing is also cytokine-mediated. De gradation of fibrilla r collagen and other matrix proteins is driven by serine pr oteases and MMPs under the control of the cytokine network. Granulation tissue forms below the epithelium and is composed of inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and newly formed and forming vessels12. [Note: Figure 2 is adapted from Singer and Clark, 199912] 152.1.5. MATRIX PRODUCTION AND SCAR FORMATION With the generation of new vasculature, matrix-generating cells move into the granulation tissue. These fi broblasts degrade the provisi onal matrix via MMPs and respond cytokine/growth prolif erating and synthesizing new extracellular matrix (ECM) to replace the injured tissu e with a connective ti ssue scar. Although the stage is being set for tissue repair from the beginning (provisional matrix, platelet release of PDGF and TGF- , cytokine reservoir), fibroblasts migrate into the wound and matrix synthesis begins in earnest with in a couple of days, continuing for several weeks to months. TGF- contributes to the fibrotic process by recruiting fibroblasts and stimulating their synthesis of collagens I, III, and V, proteogl ycans, fibronectin and enhancing protease inhibitors, favouring matrix accumulation. In vivo studies have confirmed that exogenous TGF- 1 increases granulation tissue, co llagen formation, and wound tensile strength when applied locally or given system ically in animal models. Increased levels of TGF- are routinely associated with both normal reparative processes, as well as fibropathology. In Smad3 null mouse wounds, matrix deposition (fibronectin) could be restored by exogenous TGF- , implying a Smad3-independent pathway, whereas collagen deposition was not restored, suggesting a dichotomous Smad3-dependent regulation. 17 The progressive increase in TGF- 3 over time and its association with scarless foetal healing have imp licated this member of the TGF- family in the cessation of matrix deposition.47 Other members of the TGF- superfamily may also contribute to the wound healing response. Activin A when over-expressed in 16PDGF, released at the outset by degranulat ing platelets, represents a family of cytokines consisting of two polypeptide chai ns (A and B) which form the dimers PDGF-AA, AB and B.50 In addition to platelets, P DGF is released by activated macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (T able 1) and is a major player in regulating fibroblast and smooth muscle cell recruitment and proliferation through PDGF specifi c receptor-ligand interactions.51 Beyond its role in fibroblast and matrix deposition, PDGF-A and -B also up-regulate protease production, in contrast to the anti-protease activity of TGF- .52,53 PDGF represents the only FDA approved cytokine/growth factor fo r the clinical enhancement of delayed wound healing. Also central to repair are the FGFs, whic h signal mitogenesis and chemotaxis,45 underlying granulation FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) have been the most intensely studied, but the additional members of this family ma y also support tissue repair and/or have clinical application.55 The role of FGF-2 has been confirmed in the FGF-2 null mouse which shows not only retarded epithelialisation but also reduced collagen production.56 With many overlapping func tional properties with FGFs, epidermal growth factor (EGF) orchestrates recruitment and growth of fibroblasts and epithelial cells in the evolution of granulation tissue. EGF and TGF- , TNF- and IL-1 , key mediators of the inflammatory process, also contribute to the reparative phase either directly by influenc ing endothelial and fibroblast functions or indirectly, by induci ng additional cytokines and growth factors. IL-6 has also been shown to be crucial to epithelialisation and influences granulation tissue formation, as shown in the wound h ealing studies of mice null for the IL-6 gene.58 As repair progresses, fibroblasts di splay increased expression levels of 17adhesion molecules and assume a myofibrobl ast phenotype, mediated in part by TGF- and PDGF-A and -B, to facilitate wound contraction.59 PHASE The remodelling phase, during which coll agen is synthesized, degraded and dramatically reorganized (as it is stabilized via molecular crosslinki ng into a scar), is also cytokine-mediated. Alt hough repaired tissue seldom ach ieves its original strength, it provides an acceptable alternative. Degrad ation of fibrillar collagen and other matrix proteins is driven by serine proteases and MMPs under the control of the cytokine network. MMPs not only degrade matrix components, but also function as regulatory molecules by driving enzyme cascades and processing cytokines, matrix and adhesion molecules to generate biologically ac tive fragments. TIMPs provide a natural counterbalance to the MMPs and disruption of this orderly balance can lead to excess or insufficient matrix degrada tion and ensuing tissue pathology. 60 Similarly, there exists a naturally occurring inhibitor of elastase and other serine proteases ( i.e. SLPI).37,38 The coordinated regulation of enzyme s and their inhibitors ensures tight control of local proteolytic activity. In physiologic circ umstances, these molecular brakes limit tissue degradation and facilitate accumulation of matrix and repair. 2.1.7. ABERRANT HEALING Rapid clearance of the inciting agent and resolution of infla mmation during healing minimizes scar formation, whereas persis tence of the primar y insult results in continued inflammation and chronic attemp ts at healing. Prol onged inflammation and proteolytic activity prevent healing as eviden t in ulcerative lesions . On the other hand, continued fibrosis in the skin leads to s carring and potentially, di sfigurement, whereas progressive deposition of matrix in internal organs such as lungs, liver, kidney or brain 18compromises not only their structure, but also function, causing disease and death. Inhibitors of TGF- (e.g. antibodies, decorin, Smad 7, antisense oligonucleotides)61-63 does local ad ministration of exogenous TGF- 336 or systemic delivery of TGF- 1.64 IFN- is a natural an tagonist of fibrogenesis through its ability to inhibit fibroblast proliferat ion and matrix production a nd has been shown to have clinical efficacy.65,66 IL-10 may be considered anti-f ibrotic via its anti-inflammatory activities,67 as are inhibitors of TNF- .68 Wound healing is a complex process enco mpassing a number of overlapping phases, including inflammation, epithelialisati on, angiogenesis and matrix deposition. Ultimately these processes are resolved or dampened leading to a mature wound and macroscopic scar formation. Although infla mmation and repair mostly occur along a proscribed course, the sensitiv ity of the process is underscored by the consequences of disruption of the balance of regulatory cyt okines. Consequently, cytokines, which are central to this constellation of events, have become targets for therapeutic intervention to modulate the wound healing process. Depe nding on the cytokine and its role, it may be appropriate to either enhance (recombin ant cytokine, gene transfer) or inhibit (cytokine or receptor antibodies, soluble re ceptors, signal transduction inhibitors, antisense) the cytokine to achieve the desired outcome. 2.2 RADIATION TREATMENT 2.2.1 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Radiation therapy has been in use for the treatment of cancer and other diseases for approximately 100 years. As early as 1897, it wa s concluded that X-ra ys could be used for therapeutic as well as diagnostic purposes, and in 1912, Marie Curie published the \"Theory of Radioactivity.\" Th e investigation of X-ray radiation for patient therapy 19moved into the clinical routine with the protraction-fractionati on studies of Regaud69 published in 1924 and paved the way for the co urses of radiotherapy as we know them today. The systemization of radiotherapy t ook place in the 1930s when surgeons who used radium, such as Stanford Cade70 and radiologists joined forces to become radiotherapists. The part played by Paterson and Parker in the in troduction of a formal system of radium therapy was especially noteworthy in the treatment of mouth cancer.71 At this time, too, the massive contribut ion of physicists to the specialty began to be widely evident. Since the Second Wo rld War the availabili ty of high energy X- ray machines with better beam penetra tion had allowed innovations in radiation treatment planning with improved tumour dos es and less irradiation of normal tissues. Since the first uses of radiation to treat can cer, important changes have been made in the field and numerous developments have been accomplished, including: the generation of higher energy radiat ion beams for more effective cancer treatment the development of versatile linear acce lerator and patient table designs to enable radiation to be delivered to th e cancer from a variety of angles and directions the implementation of \"multi-leaf\" collim ators (lead shutters) and other beam shaping devices for precision control and shaping of the radiation beam the use of Computer Assisted To mography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography and other image data sets to create three- dimensional planning models to accurately guide treatment 20 the implementation of networked com puters to track radiation treatment sessions and patient dose calculations (both planned and accumulated). The ultimate goal of all of the above change s, developments and improvements is the effective destruction of cancer tissue while delivering a mi nimal dose of radiation to adjacent healthy tissues. Another goal is to make the treatment ea sier and shorter for the patient to sustain and the physicians and other healthcar e professionals to perform.72-74 Despite these new developments, the side effects of radiotherapy still occur in the normal tissue surrounding the treated area, resulting in a reduction in the quality of life.1,2,3 Advantages of radi otherapy include: i) normal anatomy and function are maintained, ii) general anaesthesia is not needed, and iii) salvage surgery is availa ble if radiotherapy fails. Disadvantages mainly include: i) adverse side effects are common; ii) cure is not always achieved, es pecially for large tumours; and iii) subsequent surgery is more difficult and hazardous and the survival is reduced further. 2.2.2 FORMS OF RADIOTHERAPY Three basic types of TRT protocols have been used over the past few decades. External beam radiotherapy (teletherapy) is the mo st common, followed by interstitial or 21implant seed radiotherapy (brachytherapy, pl esiotherapy). Neutr on beam radiotherapy is now rarely used because of the serious radiation fibrosis and radiation necrosis complications. i) External Beam Radiotherapy - External beam radiot herapy is the most common form of radiotherapy where a patient lies on a couch and an external source of X-rays is pointed at a particular pa rt of the body. The radiation in teracts with tissues and is absorbed, damaging the DNA of the cell. The source of the X-rays can be from a ra dioactive source such as cobalt-60, iridium- 137, caesium or radium-226 (which is no longer available). Such X-rays are monochromatic and called gamma rays. Th e usual energy range is in the 300 kiloelectronvolts (keV) to 1.5 million electron volts (MeV). The other source of X-rays is from machin es that generate them, and there are two basic varieties used now: Conventional X-ray generators which produ ce X-rays called 'superficial' X-rays and 'orthovoltage' X-rays. These machines are limited to less than 500keV. Linear accelerators or li nacs which produce X-rays called megavoltage X-rays. These X-rays have an energy range from 500 keV up to any number but the highest available at pr esent is around 25 MeV. A third variety called the 'betatron' wa s used previously but was unable to match the linac for stability or ease of use and they were really noisy and frightened the patient. ii) Interstitial radiotherapy - ( Brachytherapy) Radioactive seeds or sources are placed in or near the tumour itself, giving a high radiation dose to the tumour while 22reducing the radiation exposure in the surr ounding healthy tissues. The term \"brachy\" is Greek for short distance, and brachythera py is radiation therapy given at a short distance: localized, precis e and highly technical. Impl ants of iridium-192 are commonly used. There are two major met hods of brachytherapy, permanent seed implantation and high dose rate (HDR) te mporary brachytherapy. Permanent seed implants involve injecting radioactive s eeds into the tumour and surrounding tissue. They give off their radiation at a low dose ra te over several weeks or months, and then the seeds are often left in the tissues permanently. HDR temporary brachytherapy instead involves placing very tiny plastic cat heters into the tumour, and then giving a series of radiation treatments through thes e catheters. The catheters are then easily removed and no radioactive material is le ft in the patient. A computer-controlled machine pushes a single highly radioactive ir idium-192 seed into the catheters one by one. Because the computer can control how long this single seed remains in each of the catheters, the radiation dose can be more closely controlled. This ability to modify the dose after the needles are pl aced is one of the main advantages of temporary brachytherapy over permanent seed implants. Brachytherapy causes fewer complications but is suitable only for tumours that are less than 2 cm in size and located in selected sites. 75 iii) Neutron Beam Radiotherapy - Neutron Beam Radiotherapy, the radiation therapy most damaging to normal cells as well as tumour cells, is rarely used these days because of its complications. A neutr on is 1,865 times the mass of a beta particle and, therefore, penetrates deeper into ti ssues, directly damaging DNA, RNA, enzymes and cell membranes. Patients who receive this type of radiation present with significant muscle and deep tissue fibrosis and are at the highest risk for osteoradionecrosis. 232.2.3 BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS TRT is a form of high linear energy transferred to tissues with the intent to kill cancer cells; however, normal cells are also damaged or killed. As cancer cells replicate more frequently than normal cells, they are more lik ely to be irradiated at vulnerable times in their cell cycle. Many normal cells may also be irradiated at vulnerable times in their cell cycle, depending on their frequency of replication, thereby creating a radiation- sensitivity spectrum. Germinal and lymphor eticular cells are th e most sensitive, endothelial cells and fibroblas ts are of intermediate sens itivity, and muscle and nerve cells have little sensitivity to radiation. It is th is intermediate group of endothelial cells and fibroblasts that is important to the clinician because they are the primary cells involved in healing.76 As mammalian cells may be considered as \"dilute aqueous solutions\", there are two possible mechanisms of interaction with bi ologically important molecules like DNA - the direct effect of radiation on the DNA or the indirect effect produced by intermediary radiation products. The DNA can be affected directly by the ionizing radiation by causing a change in the molecula r structure. This dire ct effect is most common for high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. Alternat ively, the photon may interact with water to produ ce free radicals. Although the free radicals are relatively short-lived, they can inte ract with the DNA causing a detrimental effect, or, conversely, can react innocently and revert to their former stat e. The likelihood of interaction versus reversion can be modifi ed by reaction with molecular oxygen, which would favour prolonging the life of a reactive species, or by reaction with sulfhydryl compounds, which will reduce the free radical life span by combining with them to return to innocuous substances.75 24Radiation effects, whether direct or indi rect, are random. This randomness is important in the general nature of cell killing. The major biologi cally important effects of radiation when considering radiation ther apy are those concerned with reproductive integrity. It is usually assumed that DNA is th e critical target for this radiation effect. Although this is highly likely, it has not been proven with certainty.75 Surely other biologically important effects of radiation (eg oedema) are far more likely to be caused by membrane effects of radiation. A ce ll damaged by radiation that loses its reproductive integrity may divide once or more often before all the progeny are rendered reproductively sterile. This is an im portant consequence of radiation; it means that an irradiated cell will not appear damaged until it faces at least the first division. At time of reproduction, there are a numb er of possible paths for this cell. It may die while trying to divide. i. It may produce unusual forms as a result of aberrant attempts at division. ii. It may stay as it is, unable to divide , but physiologically functional for a long period of time. iii. It may divide, giving rise to one or mo re generations of daughter cells before some or all of the progeny become sterile. iv. The cell may suffer none or only minor alte rations in the rep licative process. 2.2.4 EFFECT OF RADIATION TREA TMENT AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL TRT is one of the important modalities used in the treatment of cancer. It may be used alone or in combination with one or more of the other treatment modalities such as surgery or chemotherapy. TRT is most eff ective when given in fractionated form.77,78 The total dose of radiation is given in sma ll increments over a period of weeks so that a 25tumourcidal dose is achieved while surrounding normal tissue is minimally affected by the radiation. The pattern of radiation injury is importa nt because it explains physiologically why irradiated tissue worsens over time without the normal healing seen with most other injuries. In addition to direct cellular and vascular damage, radiation creates a concentric pattern of radiation injury, resembling a target. At the centre of the irradiated field is the greatest damage. From this centre the radiation damage slowly lessens until it becomes nonexistent outside the irradiated field. This pattern is established by the isodose lin es of external beam radiotherapy, by which means the tumour's centre, which has the greatest di ameter, receives the greatest dose. Away from the tumour's centre, the isodose lines plot a lesser radiation dose because of the tumour's smaller mass. This establishes an injury pattern in which the oxygen gradients from outside the irra diated field to inside the field, as well as within the irradiated field towards its centre, are very gradual. These oxygen gradients are of the order of only 2 to 7mm Hg. 10 Because the wound healing macrophage can respond only to oxygen gradients of the order of 20 mm Hg, irradiated tissue never benefits from macrophage-directed revascularizati on (angiogenesis) as do other tissues. This pattern of injury is si milar to that seen in diabetic ul cers of the leg. Because of the microangiopathy associated with diabetes , a gradual or low oxygen gradient is established, resulting in failure of wound healing in this disease as well.76 When interstitial radiation sources are used, the pattern of radiation injury remains the same, but it occurs through a different mech anism. With intersti tial radiotherapy, the gradual damage and, therefore, the low oxygen gradient fi eld is established by the distance from the radiation seeds or needle s. Because radiation energy decreases with distance from the radiation source by a power of four (Intensity varies inversely as the 26square of the distance); tissue that is farthe r away from the centre receives less damage by a power of four. Therefore, a gradual tissue damage gradient is established.76 Since 1983 the pathophysiology of the irra diated wound has been better defined by Marx. 4 It is now understood to be a sequence of events that follows the radiation treatment: a gradual and progressive obliter ative endarteritis a nd cellular dysfunction leads to a Hypovascular and Hypocellular tissue (the three ' H' principle).4,5,6,7 When tissue is irradiated in the treatment of malignancy, normal cells are also damaged. In spite of the concerted efforts of radiation therapists to enhance tumour kill and reduce normal non tum our damage such as fractionation, hyperfractionation, supervoltage , beam collimation, etc., norma l tissue is nevertheless damaged.76,79,80 The nontumour cells in the field of radiation are heterogeneous in their type (fibroblasts, endothelium, muscle, nerve, etc.) and heterogeneous in their sensitivity to radiation. This is partially becau se of the inherent ra diation sensitivity of different cell types. In descending order of sensitivity are tumour cells, endothelium, fibroblasts, muscle, and nerve cells. Varying e ffects may also be seen because radiation may either kill any cell type outright or inflict lethal dama ge so that it dies later. Radiation may also incapacitate a cell so th at it does not produce daughter cells or normal by-products of its metabolism such as collagen or saliva. The surviving cells may produce defective collagen or defective regulatory enzymes. Individual cells may totally escape damage. The result is a residual tissue that develops a progressive loss of vascularity and cellularity over time as cells li ve out their life span and are not replaced or fail to contribute to tissue integrity. The progressive radiation fi brosis and capillary loss with time have been shown to be almost linear and are an inescapable consequence of therapeutic radiation. 11,80 272.2.5 RADIATION DAMAGE TO ORAL TISSUES In treating head and neck cancer patients, su fficiently high doses of radiation must be used to destroy the tumour cells. These hi gh doses invariably cause some degree of permanent or transient damage to the surroundi ng tissues. The structures that make up the oral cavity are, to varying degrees, su sceptible to radiation and the effects of radiation on these tissues has been well documented and known fo r many years, with some publications appe aring as early as 1942.81,82,83 Clinically these tissue changes in the oral cavity following radiat ion treatment may be seen in the early stages as a mucositis and haemorrhage and later any of the following outcomes are possible: 1,84,85 - Difficulty in chewing or eating - Dry mouth (xerostomia) - Change or loss of taste - Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) - Altered speech - Difficulty wearing dentures - Increased tooth decay, erosion and accelerated wear - Pain - Interference with daily activities - Mood complaints - Interference with social activities - Hearing loss - Osteoradionecrosis - Trismus - Chronic Dermatitis - Developmental abnormalities 28The complications associated with radiotherapy in the head and neck region can be divided into acute/suba cute and chronic. I. ACUTE AND SUBACUTE COMPLICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY Acute reactions are those which arise duri ng or shortly after ra diation therapy and usually resolve within 90 days post-therapy.86-90 The following acute and subacute reactions to TRT and their treatment will be discussed: i) Oral Mucositis ii) Xerostomia iii) Change or loss of taste iv) Infection v) Candidiasis vi) Bleeding i) ORAL MUCOSITIS Oral mucositis is a very common side effect of radiation therapy, with 60% of people undergoing conventional radiation therapy for head and neck cancer suffering the condition.91 The severity varies with dose, volume and duration of therapy, although up to 15% require hospitalization for pain control and nutritional supplementation.91,92 Oral mucositis results from the mitotic death of epithelial ce lls and presents about 12 days following the commencement of radiation treatment.92,93 The mucous membranes undergo epithelial thinning, vascular dila tation, inflammation and of the submucosa which results in an erythematous appearance.92 Longer term radiation treatment results in the oral mucosa b ecoming denuded, ulcerated and covered with fibrinous exudates or pseudomembranes. After 4 weeks following the conclusion of radiation treatment, 90 - 95% of patients s how complete recovery from the symptoms of oral mucositis.94 Ulceration heals with fibrosis and decreased blood supply, with a 29subsequent loss of mobility and pliability.91,95 These atrophic tissues become more susceptible to further ulceration and infect ions and do not withst and denture trauma well.95 Oral mucositis may be induced by funga l or bacterial infection, xerostomia, direct cell damage or mechanical or nutritional damage.96 Patients suffering from oral mucositis complain of difficulties with speech and a sore throat, with pain, burning and discomfort if the pharyngeal mucosa is involved.92 This discomfort is exacerbated by contact with coarse or spicy foods.93 The Radiation Oncologist can minimise exces sive morbidity of the oral mucosa by designing portals that limit the exposure to tis sues not at risk for tumour reoccurrence. When interstitial implants are a part of a treatment protocol, soft tissues of the oropharynx are at greater risk for developing soft tissue ulcerations.86,87 Mucosal thickness, another important predictor of exaggerated tissue response, should be considered by the Radiation Oncologist in minimising mucositis. The anterior commissures of the mouth and the medial surf ace of the angle of the mandible are sites which contain very thin mucosa and be nefit from field blocks if possible. 86,87 Current Management of Mucositis 76,91 Oral mucositis should be treated as conser vatively as possible to minimize damage to the few remaining cells from which the epithelium will regenerate.93 T h e p a t i e n t should be advised to eat a soft, bland diet and avoid irritants such as smoking and alcohol. Impeccable oral hygiene should be maintained for as long as possible with tongue brushing included in the routin e to reduce overall bacterial load.95 Antiseptic Chlorhexidine rinses are a good adjunct to decr ease the risk of s econdary infection and should be used twice daily. However, commercial mouth rinses should be avoided as the alcohol and phenols contained in thes e preparations may further dehydrate the mucosa causing further pain. Currently accepted topical oral preparations elixirs which 30may reduce symptoms of oral mucositis dyclonine, and viscous severe enough to limit eating, syst emic analgesia should be considered.95,97 Mechanical trauma should be reduced by smoot hing any sharp restora tions or teeth, as well as ensuring any prostheses are well-fitting.95 The patient should be advised to stop or minimize denture wearing during treat ment and for a period of up to 12 months following treatment to prevent trau ma to the compromised tissues.92 Meticulous denture care should be encour aged, with Chlorhexidine a nd other commercial denture cleaners being recommended. Extremes in mucosal inflammation which demonstrate confluent lesions may warrant a treatment br eak to allow tissues to recover before therapy is continued. However, cessation in treatment can be dangerous by allowing rapid repopulation of tumour cells. Because of the high carriage rate of Gram-negative bacilli found in many high-dose radiotherapy patients,98-101 it has been postulated that selective elimination of these oral Gram-negative bacilli has a prophylactic or ameliorating effect on the development of radiation mucositis102. Spijkervet et al102 reported on the effect of the use of lozenges containing 2 mg polymyxin E, 1.8 mg tobr amycin, and 10 mg amphotericin B qid on the oropharyngeal flora in 15 ir radiated head and neck can cer patients. Patients were divided into three groups: (1 ) antibacterial lozenges, (2) chlorhexidine 0.1% rinsing, and (3) placebo rinsing. Th eir study found that in all patients using lozenges, eradication of gram-negative bacilli and yeasts was achieved within 3 weeks. A significant increase of ente rococci was found. Mucositis was significan tly reduced compared with the other two groups. All pa tients showed erythema only, whereas 80% of both the placebo and chlorhexidine rinsing patients suffered from severe mucositis, with signs of pseudomembranes developi ng from the third week of conventional irradiation protocol. Spijkervet et al 102 concluded that the effect of selective 31elimination of gram-negative bacilli from the oropharynx and the prevention of severe mucositis may be explained by the eradication of these bacteria and/or neutralization of salivary endotoxin, released by gram-negativ e bacilli, mediati ng the inflammatory processes. Another study by Spijkervet et al 103 reported that about one-third of patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment su ffered oral mucositis. Severe pseudomembranous/ulcerative mucositis lead to secondary infection of lesions, sepsis and even cessation of treatment. Their experi mental studies with TGF-beta 3, a potent negative regulator of epithelia l and haematopoietic stem ce ll growth, showed that it was possible to temporarily arrest oral mu cosal basal cell proliferation, and they suggested that this could therefore offer a ne w effective and safe form of preventative intervention for patients about to undergo aggressive regimens of cancer therapy. There is also a significant amount of preliminary research indicating that the administration of growth f actors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, keratinocyte growth factor) has a potential to reduce the development of radiation mucositis and can significantly promote healing104-108 The reduction of mucositis and promotion of healing by growth factors are most lik ely due to the stimulation of surviving stem cells109, but this needs further study, because these therapies may affect tumour response. This consideration is also applicable to the administration of the radioprotective agent Amifostine, during radiation treatment110,111 The results of these preliminary studies are promising and may finally l ead to modification of current oral care programs that are of limited efficacy in preventing and treating radiation mucositis. 32Vissink et al112 have published a comprehensive re view of the various possibilities to prevent or treat radiation-induced mucositis and concluded that only the administration of antibiotic lozenges has been shown to be of some use in the reduction of the severity of radiation mucositis. Results with the administration of growth factors and radical scavengers were promising and focused not only on the prevention of mucositis but also on the potential effects of these therapies on tumour response. In 2005, Saadeh113 reviewed the preventive strategies and treatment of chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis. He found that basic oral hygiene and comprehensive patient education were impor tant components of care for any patient with cancer at risk for development of or al mucositis. Nonpharmacologic approaches for the prevention of oral mucositis included oral cryotherapy for patients receiving chemotherapy with bolus 5-fluorouracil, and low-level laser therapy for Chlorhexidine, amifostine, haematologic growth factors, pentoxifylline, glutamine, and several other agents have all been investigated for prevention of oral mucositis. Results have been conflicting, inconclusive, or of limited benefit. Saadeh et al 113 concluded that treatment of established mucositis remains a challenge and focuses on a palliative management approach. They stated that the use of t opical anaesthetics, mixtures (also called cocktails), and mucosal coating agents l acked experimental ev idence supporting their efficacy; and that investigational agents that target the specific mechanisms of mucosal injury, such as recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor, show the most promise. In 2006, Stokman et al 114 published a meta-analysis in order to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for the prevention of oral mucositis in cancer patients treated with head and neck ra diotherapy and/or chemotherapy, with a focus on 33randomized clinical tria ls. A literature search was performed for reports of randomized controlled clinical studies, published between 1966 and 2004, the aim of which was the prevention of mucositis in cancer patients undergoing head and neck radiation, chemotherapy, or chemoradiation. The auth ors concluded that, to date, no single intervention completely prevents oral mucositis, so combined preventive therapeutic strategies seem to be required to ensure more successful outcomes. There is increasing evidence that the use of low-level laser can reduce the severity of mucositis associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) refers to the use of red-beam or n ear-infrared lasers w ith a wave-length of between 600 and 1000nm power from 5-500 m illiwatts. In contrast, lasers used in surgery typically use 300 watts. The LLLT is nonthermal. Due to the low absorption by human skin, it is hypothesized that the la ser light can penetrat e deeply into the tissues where it may have a photobiostimulati on effect. The use of LLLT is thought to act as a local application of high photon density monochromatic light source which activates epithelial healing. Maiya et al115 suggested the possible mechanism could be due to the anti-inflammatory and analgesic e ffect of the laser irradiation on the local tissue, which in turn increases the vascularit y, and re-epithelisation of injured tissue. In oral tissues the lase r applications could stimulate DNA synthesis in myofibroblasts, without degenerative changes, and could transform fibrobl asts into myofibroblasts, which may promote and activate the epithelia l healing of mucosa. Another mechanism that has been proposed for pain relief is the modulation of pain perception by modification of nerve conduction via rel ease of endorphins and eukephalins. In conclusion, Maiya et al115, found that LLLT during the ra diotherapy treatment was effective in preventing and treating the muco sitis in head and neck cancer patients. 34Another study by Genot and Klastersky116 also concluded that LLLT may be useful in decreasing the severity of chemotherapy-associated or radiotherapy-associated mucositis, even though there have been few controlled studies in the field of prevention. ii) XEROSTOMIA Xerostomia is a marked reduction in salivar y gland secretion. Clinical symptoms and signs of xerostomia include dryness, a sore or burning sensation (especially involving the tongue), cracked lips, slit s or fissures at the corners of the mouth, changes in the tongue surface, difficulty wearing dentures , and increased frequency and/or volume of fluid intake. The diagnosis of xerostomia is based on subjective impressions by the patient and the clinician. In 2000, O'Connell 117 reported that TRT for cancers of the head and neck irreversibly damages the salivary glands. He reported that xerostomia develops within the first week of therapy and is progressive, with deva stating effects on the qua lity of life of the individual. The xerostomia did not correlate with the degree of salivary gland hypofunction, but the degree of sa livary gland damage is co rrelated to the dose of radiation delivered and the volume of gla nd included in the fiel d of radiation. The molecular mechanism of acute radiation damage is not fully understood; but it is clear that long-term salivary gland dysfunction is associated with both loss of gland weight and loss of acinar cells. New studies are beginning to explain the lo ss of acinar cells and decreased salivary function. The \"bystander effects\", firs t reported by Nagasawa and Little 118, have been 35suggested as a major determinant of the response of cells to radiation exposure119. The \"bystander effect,\" which essentially refers to radiation- indu ced effects in non- irradiated cells, is mediated through the e ffects of extracellular mediators, including proteins, from neighbouring i rradiated human cells on non-irradiated cells. This has been shown with studies showing various bi ological endpoints, in cluding cell killing, micronucleus (MN) induction, mutation induction and changes in cell growth.120 It is believed that there are two pathways i nvolved in radiation-induced bystander responses. Some medium-derived soluble f actors such as shor t-lived reactive oxygen species (ROS)121, Nitric Oxide (NO)122-124 and cell line dependent transforming growth factor 1 (TGF- 1)125-126 could be released fr om irradiated cells, then further induce a series of damage in the non-irradiated neighbour cells. On the other hand, gap junctional in tercellular communications (GJIC) are relevant to the molecular events leading to the modulat ion of p53 and p21 gene expression in non- irradiated bystander cells127. Shao et al128 a n d D e l a C a l et al129 have shown that, following irradiation of saliv ary glands, the expression of mitochondrial Nitric Oxide synthase (NOS) is increased leading to the formation of large am ounts of NO that acts as a proapoptotic signal and subsequent increase in the num bers of apopto tic cells and reduction in salivary gland function. Shao et al11 investigated the signal factor and its function in the medium-mediated bystander effect during heavy-ion irradiation of human salivary gland (HSG) ne oplastic cells. NO participated in the medium-mediated bystander effects on cell proliferation and MN induction, depending on the LET of irradiation. ROS are well known to cause oxidative damage to DNA.130 Oxidative stress occurs in cells when the generation of ROS overwhelms the natural antioxidant defences of the cell. There is a growing consensu s that oxidative stress and the antioxidant state of a cell plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis.130 Since ROS production is associated with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy-induced oral 36mucositis and loss of salivary gland function, inhibition of these molecules would appear to be a promising strategy. Amifostine, an ROS inhibitor, was developed to protect U.S. soldiers from the effects of radiation. It lessens DNA strand breaks after radiation therapy; may protect endothelium, salivary glands, and connective tissue; and has been shown to reduce IL-6 and TNF in the blood of cancer patients.130 Local and total body irradiation may irrevers ibly reduce the production and quality of saliva in the major and minor salivary glands. 93,131 Xerostomia results from the inflammatory and degenerative effects of serous acinar cells of the parotid gland being the most vulnerable to radiation damage.94 When the acinar cells are destroyed they are replaced by ductal remnants with loose connective tissu e which is moderately infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells.95,96 In 2003, Radfar and Sirois135 reported on the development of an animal model, using Hanford mini-pigs, for radiation-induced salivary gland injury with a ra diation protocol identical to current clinical practice. The mini-pigs were subjected to fractionated dail y irradiation with a total dose of 70 Gray (Gy). Structural and functiona l measures were compared wi th those of a control group of mini-pigs. They found that irradiated submandibular and parotid glands were one- third to one-half the gross si ze of control glands. Whereas no pathologic changes were noted in control glands, irradiated glands consistently demons trated significant parenchymal loss with extensive acinar atr cells, and ductal dilatati on and proliferation. Stimulated salivary flow was reduced by 81% in ir radiated animals compared with pre-irradiation flow; salivary flow in the control group increase d by 30% during the same period. They concluded that observed radiation-induced structural and func tional salivary gland 37changes in the animal model are comparable in every respect to those observed following irradiation of human salivary glands. Radiation doses as low as 20 Gy will result in clinically noticeable changes such as sparse thick ropy saliva. In part icular, if the parotid glands are in a field which received 40 Gy or over, permanent dysfunction of the salivary glands can be expected. 136 These changes are often rapid and irreversible, especially when the salivary glands are included in the radiation fields.91 Both qualitative and quantitative changes to saliva occur following radiation treatment, with the reduced saliva being thick and viscous.91,93 These changes result in reduced lubrication, limite d antibacterial , antiviral and antifungal activity, loss of buffering capacity , reduced mechanical self cleansing of oral tissues and interference with normal remineralization of teeth and consequent increase in caries rate , especially in the ce rvical portion of the clinical crown at the cementoenamel junction.86,91 The dry mouth may also affect speech, taste, nutrition and the patient's ability to wear a prosthesis. Salivary flow measurably decreases within 1 week after starting treatment and diminishes progressively with continued treatment.133 The degree of dysfunction is relate d to the radiation dose and mass of glandular tissue in the radiat ion field. The parotid glands are more susceptible to radiation effects than the submandibular , sublingual, and ot her minor salivary glandular tissues,94,134 due to their superficial anatomical position, having no bony protection. In addition, the paro tid glands often lie in the primary beam of radiation treatment. Sufferers of xerostomia compla in of a burning sens ation, difficulty in denture use, compromised speech and degl utition with reduced or altered taste sensation.93 Saliva also contains protective i mmunoproteins, antimicrobial compounds (i.e. sIgA, and mucins) which reduce pathoge nic bacteria and decrease the risk of 38infection in the oropharynx. The change in salivary content and quantity also leads to an increased incidence of candidiasis and periodontal disease.104 Nature's demands on salivary glands are ex tensive and diverse and range from the reptilian need for a venomous drop to inca pacitate its prey to the 100 litres that ruminants require to digest a day's graz ing. Other species depend on saliva not for survival, but for improving the quality of lif e, using the fluid fo r functions varying from grooming and cleansing to nest-buildi ng. Humans can manage without saliva; its loss is not life-threatening in any immediat e sense, but it results in a variety of difficulties and miseries. Oral digestion pe r se is only of marginal importance in humans, but saliva is importa nt in preparing food for mas tication, for swallowing, and for normal taste perception. Without saliva, m ealtimes are difficult, uncomfortable, and embarrassing. The complex mix of salivary constituents provides an effective set of systems for lubricating and protecting the so ft and hard tissues. Protection of soft tissues is afforded against desiccati on, penetration, ulceration, and potential carcinogens by mucin and anti-p roteases. Saliva can encourag e soft tissue repair by reducing clotting time and accelerating wound contraction. A major protective function results from the salivary role in maintenance of the ecological balance in the oral cavity via: i. debridement/lavage; ii. aggregation and reduced adherence by both immunological and non- immunological means; iii. direct antibacterial activity. Saliva also possesses anti-fungal and anti-viral systems. Saliva is effective in maintaini ng pH in the oral cavity, contributes to the regulation of plaque pH, and helps ne utralize reflux acids in the oesophagus. Salivary maintenance of tooth integrity is dependent on: 39i. mechanical cleansing and carbohydrate clearance; ii. post-eruptive maturation of enamel. Saliva is necessary for normal oral functions such as taste, swallowing, and speech. Unstimulated whole salivary flow rates of less than 0.1 mL/minute are considered indicative of xerostomia (normal saliv ary flow rate = 0.3-0.5 mL/minute).137 Xerostomia produces the following changes in the mouth: i. Saliva does not lubricate and becomes thick and ropy, which is annoying to the patient. ii. Buffering capacity is eliminated. In a very clean dry mouth, pH is generally 4.5, and demineralization can occur (n ormal saliva has a pH of 6.6). iii. Oral flora becomes more pathogenic. iv. Plaque becomes thick and heavy, and debris remains present due to the patient's inability to cleanse the mouth. v. No minerals (calcium, phosphorus, fluoride) are deposited on teeth. vi. Acid production after sugar exposure result s in further demineralization of the teeth and leads to dental decay. Concomitant administration of medications which are known to induce xerostomia (i.e. psychotropics, antiemetics, an tihistamines, anticholinergics, and many other commonly prescribed medications.) should be caref ully considered as they will obviously exacerbate the problem.138 Current Management of Xerostomia Management of xerostomia in radiation ther apy cases is aimed mainly at symptomatic relief. Frequent small sips of water, va porizers, moisturizers or emollients on the lips all improve the patient's comfort.92 Current recommendations for the management of 40xerostomia mainly include the use of saliva substitutes or sialagogues.139,140 Saliva substitutes or artificial saliva pr eparations (oral ri nses containing hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulo se, or carboxymethylcellulose) palliative agents that relieve the discomfo rt of xerostomia by temporarily wetting the oral mucosa and replacing some missi ng constituents of saliva. Sialagogues pharmacologically stimulate saliva produc tion from intact responsive salivary glandular tissues, restoring normal salivary flow.141 Pilocarpine is the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admini stration for use as a sialagogue (5 mg tablets of pilocarpine hydrochlor ide). Treatment is initiated at 5 mg orally, three times daily, and dose is titrated to optimize clin ical response and minimize adverse effects. Some patients may experience increased be nefit at higher daily doses; however, the incidence of adverse effects increases propo rtionally with dose. Patients' evening (or bedtime) dose may be increased to 10 mg w ithin one week after starting pilocarpine. Subsequently, morning and afternoon doses may also be increased to a maximum 10 mg/dose (30 mg/day). Patient tolerance is confirmed by allowing 7 days between increments. The most common adverse effect at clinically useful doses of pilocarpine is hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating); its incidence and severity are proportional to dosage.142,143 Nausea, chills, rhinorrhea, vasodila tion, increased lacrimation, bladder pressure (urinary urgency and frequency), dizziness, asthenia, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, tachycardia and hypertension are al so reported, typically at dosages greater than 5 mg, three times daily.142-144 Pilocarpine typically increases salivary flow within 30 minutes after ingestion; however, maxi mal response may only be achieved after continual use.145 There is usually some improvement in salivary gland function in the long term, with some acinar cell recovery usually occurr ing approximately 12 - 18 months following completi on of radiation therapy.91 The sensation of dryness also may tend to diminish as a result of compensa tory hypertrophy of non- irradiated salivary 41gland tissue.93 Despite these improvements, patients will still experience a significant reduction in salivary flow fo r the rest of their lives.91 It has been reported that Pilocarpine may also exert a radio protective effect on saliv ary glands if given during radiation therapy to the head and neck.146 iii) CHANGE OR LOSS OF TASTE The precise mechanism of loss of taste has no t been explicitly di ctated, however it is thought to be a combination of direct dama ge to the taste buds and impaired salivary function.91,93 Histologically, taste buds show si gns of atrophy at 10 Gy and at cancericidal doses the microvill i may be virtually destroyed.91 Because of their location on the tongue, the taste buds are includ ed in the beam of radiation for most cancers and hence decreased tast e acuity is hard to avoid.97 Reduction in taste sensation usually has an eff ect on the patient's nutrition with decreased pleasure from eating and a loss of appetite leading to weight loss, w eakness, malaise and dehydration.93,97 Often, patients complain that many foods taste excessively salty which may reduce the motivation for adequate oral intake. In res ponse to their altered taste sensation, patients tend to compensate by increasing th eir intake of sugar, which contributes to radiation carie s. Dietary counselling needs to be implemented to ensure adequate nutritional intake and zinc s upplements improve taste acuity in some patients.95,97 There are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether the altered taste sensation returns to normal. The National Institute of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement reported in the American Dent al Journal in 1989 that the altered taste sensa tion is a transient phenomenon w ith the taste buds reported to recover in 2 to 4 months post therapy.87,88 In 2000, Andrews reported that taste sensation usually partially returns within 60 days and is almost always completely restored within 4 months following radiation treatment.92 However, a Japanese 42group,147 in 2002, reported that a 61-year-old male patient with right buccal mucosal cancer who underwent radiation therapy more than 11 years previously, did not recover his taste acuity. iv) INFECTIONS Oral bacterial infection is common in patie nts both during the radiotherapy and early post radiotherapy treatment period as the nor mal microflora of the mouth loses its protective mechanisms agains t colonization of pathogens , resulting in increased numbers of oral candida a nd gram negative bacteria.89,90,92,93,131 The majority of these oral bacterial infections are gram-negative due to the shift in the colonization of the oral cavity from predominantly gram-pos itive to enteric gram-negative organisms. Clinicians may elect routinely to culture the mouth and other po tential portals of microbial entry in patients who are expected to have prolonged bone marrow hypoplasia (surveillance cultures). Specimens that reveal a predominant organism among normal flora or a si ngle isolate are of value in iden tifying an infectious focus in patients with compromised immunity and in those who may not exhibit typical manifestations of infection due to incipient or frank neutropenia. Surveillance cultures also guide empirical an timicrobial selection.148 Because of the morbidity and mortality associated with disseminated fungal infecti on, early detection and treatment of local infections is imperative. Local infections can lead to sialadenitis, pe riodontitis, abscesses, pericoronitis, or other causes of ulceration. Management of these infections is commonly carried out using empiric treatment with antib iotics, which is usually adequate; however, periodontal lesions usually need additional debridement. The oral cavity may be the portal of entry for systemic infections. Therefore, chlo rhexidine rinses are commonly recommended for these patients.87 43Dreizen and colleagues149 reported that approximately 70% of oral infections in patients with solid tumours are caused by Candida albicans and other simplex ative bacilli accounting for approximately 10% each. v) CANDIDIASIS Up to one third of patients develop oral candidiasis during ra diotherapy which may cause soreness and, in rare cases, systemic infection.93,96 Colonization of the yeast on damaged tissue can intensify the symptoma tic effects of radiation on the mucosa.143 The oral candidiasis may present in any one of its multiple presentations, including pseudomembranous (removable white plaques with an erythematous base), chronic hyperplastic (leukoplakia like plaques that do not wipe away), and chronic cheilitis. Early recognition and treatment of candida in fections is universal ly recommended, to decrease mucositis and the chance of dist ant gastrointestinal infections. In some situations, such as severe immunosuppressi on, prophylactic medicati ons are indicated, however usually symptomatic treatment is sufficient.93 Treatment of oral candidiasis in the irradiated patient has primarily utili zed topical antifungals such as nystatin and clotrimazole. However, lozenges are not suitable in xerostomia patients and preparations containing sugar should be avoided.92 Other risk factors such as smoking, denture wearing and alcohol use should be removed. Compliance can be compromised secondary to oral mucositis, nausea, pain, a nd difficulty in dissolvi ng ketoconazole and fluconazole to treat oral candidiasis has proved effective and may have advantages over topical agents for patients experiencing mucositis.150,151 A slow normalization of oral flora is expected to take place, however, no long-term cl inical data are available to show this. 44vi) BLEEDING Radiotherapy patients may suffe r from gingival bleeding and this may be the first sign of thrombocytopenia or it may relate to the patients' limited ability to accomplish adequate oral hygiene. Oral bleeding may be minimal, w ith petechiae located on the lips, soft palate, or floor of the mouth, or it may be severe, with oral haemorrhage, especially in the gingival cr evices. Full blood counts are gene rally needed to eliminate systemic causes of gingival bleeding and in tensive oral hygiene undertaken. In some instances flossing may need to be discontin ued. Again chlorhexidine rinses are usually required to reduce pathogens found in plaque. 87 II. CHRONIC COMPLICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY Chronic complications of radiotherapy ar e those which arise many months after radiation therapy has been completed and may not resolve even with treatment.86-90 The following chronic complications of TRT and their treatment will be discussed: i) Osteoradionecrosis ii) Soft tissue infections iii) Muscle Trismus iv) Radiation Caries v) Impaired orofacial growth and development i) OSTEORADIONECROSIS The pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) can be explored through an understanding of the adverse side effects of TRT on the surrounding normal tissues. As the primary osseous complicat ion arising from radiation injury, ORN has clinically been defined in the literature as irradiated bone that has failed to heal in 3 months,152 more specifically, it is best described as a slow-healing radiation induced ischemic 45necrosis of the bone with associated soft tissu e necrosis of variable extent occurring in the absence of tumour necrosis, r ecurrence, or metastatic disease.80 In earlier literature, the lack of a well elucidated histopatholog ical changes of the bone and soft tissue alluded to a different theory as to the aetio logy of ORN. Microbio logic sepsis rather than a true wound healing process was give n credence in the pat hophysiological events that occurred in osteoradionecrosis. In an article published in 1970 by Meyer,153 he presented the unrefutable tria d of radiation, trauma, and in fection in the development of ORN. This paper153 documents clearly that in the irradiated bone there must be a traumatic event that propagat es an ingress of micro-orga nisms into the wound, with the traumatic events defined as tooth extraction, inadequate alveolectomies leaving sharp bony fragments, denture wearing, and tissue bi opsies. With the advent of a defining traumatic event or situation, an overwhelmi ng, severe radiation osteomyelitis becomes manifest, spreading easily through the bone whic h at this time has essentially lost its normal ability to resist and wall off this bacterial infection.4 Marx argues that this study fails to adequately demonstr ate this claim of bacterial invasion in compromised bone, stating that \" he (Meyer) did not demonstrate through cultures or tissue sections such a spread of osteomyelitis and micro-organi sms throughout the bone; neither did he demonstrate septic destruction in such avascular tissue, which can not mount an inflammatory response or wall off micro-organisms \".4 In addition, those cases of osteoradionecrosis in which there is no definable traumatic event, so-called \"spontaneous osteoradionecrosis\", as well as the indirect eviden ce of poor response to treatment with antibiotic ther apy casts doubt on this propose d series of events. It is Marx's contention that ORN is related to the cumulative tissue damage induced by radiation rather than to trauma or the i ngress of micro-organisms in the compromised tissue. 4 46In Marx's 1983 landmark study on the pathophysiology of ORN,4 he presented results which illustrated the following points: i. Not all cases of ORN could be correlate d with a traumatic event (35% of the cases studied were not associated with an inciting event); ii. Those \"spontaneous\" ORN cases were typi cally associated with significantly higher total radiation doses and more often associated with combination implant and external beam regime; iii. The microbial study did not demonstrate micro-organisms in deep bone samples from ORN samples on culture or tissue sections, only superficial, surface contamination.4 These results have been duplicated in se veral independent st udies and has given credence to the principle that ORN is not a primary infection of bone, rather a complex metabolic and tissue homeostatic deficiency seen in this Hypocellular, Hypovascular, and Hypoxic tissue.154-156 He refers to this as the three \"H\" principle. With radiation induced changes in th e tissue resulting in hypocellularity, hypovascularity, and overall hypoxia , this tissue has a marked ly decreased ability to initiate repair. In fact, th e area becomes so compromised that even the routine remodelling and repair that occurs conti nuously in normal tissue becomes markedly reduced. There are definite limitations for th is tissue to meet even the most basic metabolic demands imposed on it and when forced to increase these repair requirements associated with a traumatic event, for example dental extraction, a chronic, non-healing wound is easily produced. The classic sequence of radiation, trauma, and ensuing infection, therefore, is now replaced with a more current view that 47directly reflects the underlying metabolic and cellular changes regarded as basic to the pathophysiology of ORN. This sequence is: i. Radiation; ii. Hypoxic-Hypovascular-Hypocellular tissue; iii. Tissue breakdown in which cellular death and collagen lysis exceed synthesis and cellular repli cation, and finally; iv. The progression to non-healing wo und in which the energy, oxygen, and metabolic demands clearly exceed the supply. The basic conclusions in Marx's landmark article,4 in summary, are that: i. ORN is not a primary infection of bone , rather a homeostatic imbalance; ii. Micro-organisms play a surface contaminant role only; iii. Trauma does not necessarily need to be an inciting factor. With the principle of hypocellularit y, hypovascularity, and hypoxia in mind for the pathophysiology of ORN, there are a few factors that place the mandible at an increased risk when compared to other bone s in the craniofacial skeleton. In general terms, a bone with a more tenuous blood supply that is more mechan ically stressed is much more susceptible to the development of ORN. The craniofacial skeleton receives its blood supply in three dis tinct manners: vessels that enter the bone via direct muscular attachments, periosteal perf orators, and intramedullary vessels. Anatomically, the vast majority of the bones of the craniofacial skeleton receive their blood supply through nutrient vessels from the periosteum and muscular attachments; in contrast, these bones, with the mandible as an exception, genera lly do not have an intramedullary blood supply. In fact, the mandible has different dominant blood supply 48according to various regions in the bone itself. The posterior segment of the mandible (condylar process and neck, coronoid, angle, and upper ramus) rece ives most of its blood supply from the surrounding musculat ure, either from direct muscular attachments or through muscular perf orators penetrating the periosteum.157,158 Because of this muscle attachment, the posterior segment is typically less susceptible to radiation induced ischemia. In contrast, the anterior segm ent of the mandible does not have this prominence of nutrient vessels s upplied through the musc ular attachments. Injection studies in the mandible have show n that the primary nutrient source for the body, parasymphyseal, and symphyseal regions is through an intramedullary source, the inferior alveolar artery.155,156 There is a second, far le ss significant blood supply from small periosteal perforators in this region.125,126 In a study by Bras et al ,159 in 1990, on mandibles resected during the course of treatment for ORN, radiation induced obliteration of the infe rior alveolar artery was consiste ntly found and was considered to be a dominant factor in the onset of the disease. The study further detailed that revascularization or collatera l blood flow from branches of the facial artery are prevented from nourishing the ischemic ma ndible because of concomitant radiation induced intimal fibrosis of the small periost eal vessels as well as the direct fibrotic changes to the overlying periosteum itself.159 Irradiated mandibles that were not clinically characterized as osteoradionecros is, had significantly le ss fibrotic response with only partial oblitera tion of the supplying infe rior alveolar artery.157 Histologically, the effects of radiation on bone and the adjacent soft tissue have been well studied and documented in the literature.76,79-81 Marx and Johnson,80 in 1987, observed six identifiable histopathologic processes within tissue biopsies. When assessed as a function of time, they were (in order of appearance with some overlap) hyperaemia, inflammation (endarteritis), thro mbosis, cellular loss, hypovascularity and In general, they found that hyperaemia and endarteritis began early in the radiation sequence and persis ted for up to 6 months after radiation treatment. The remaining histopathologic pr ocesses appeared mainly from about 6 months onwards. Fibroblast populations underg o not only total ce llular depletion in response to radiation exposure but show a reduced activity or ab errant ability to produce and extrude collagen into the surro unding tissue. Equally striking is the histological evidence of progressive obliter ation of tissue vascular system, ultimately leading to a markedly hypoxic, hypovascular tissue bed.4,5,6,7,152 Specifically in bone, there is an imbalance in the radiosensitivity of osteocytes, with osteoblasts depleted much more than osteoclasts with a given ra diation dose. This leaves the compromised bone with an environment favouring osteocla stic resorption of bone with a reduced bone rebuilding potential . In addition, the over all progressive endarteritis markedly reduces blood flow through the Haversian and Volkmann's canals; leading to a pathological reduction of bone density.152 Consequently the bone and surrounding tissue in the irradiated field exists in a significantly challenged metabolic state. Figure 3 shows the relationship of ra diation tissue injury verses time76 and illustrates the essentially linear progressive radiation fi brosis and capillary loss with time and the difference between spontaneous ORN and trauma induced ORN. The upper curve shows the tissue response with high dose radiotherapy treat ment where there is rapid ascendancy in the subclinical range to just below the clinical threshold for ORN. The lower curve shows a much lowe r dose of radiotherapy treatm ent. It is noteworthy that both curves on the graph slope downwards in the first 6 m onths following irradiation, when there is an initial inflammatory hea ling response. The curve then turns upward at about 6 months when later interphase death adds to the earlier reproductive cell death 50and postradiation mitosis, making it impossible for cells to maintain their stromal integrity due to diminished synthetic capabilities. Fig. 3. Radiation tissue injury verses time. These curves plot damage resulting over time from two radiation doses: one extrem ely high (curve 1) and the other more moderate (curve 2). The clin ical threshold is a line of subclinical radiation damage above which development of clinically exposed nonviable bone ORN begins. Graph adapted from Marx.76 There are several significant factors in the head and neck irradiated patient that predisposes to or are associated with the occurrence of ORN of the mandible. The total dose of radiation therapy correlates with incr eased risks of devel oping ORN. Based on clinical experience from combined institutions reported in the literature, there appears to be direct relationship between the tota l dose and the incidence of ORN, with a 51threshold of 50 Gy. Total doses less than 50 Gy have a no to minimal risk. In contrast, when the total radiation dose is 70 Gy or gr eater, there is 10 times the relative risk of osteoradionecrosis when compared to the group receiving less than 50 Gy.160 In addition, the mechanism of radiation delivery can significantly impact the development and severity of necrosis, with brachytherapy implants having the greatest relative risk in combination with external beam exposures of 65 Gy (estimates ranging from 12 - 15 times).68 In an article by Kuluth et al,161 in 1988, on the factors contribu ting to this disease, there was a statistically significant increased incidence of ORN in those patients with more advanced tumours (stage III or IV), recurr ent tumours, tumours involving the tongue, retromolar trigone, and floor of mouth, and clearly with tumours invading bone. It is suggested that there is a higher incidence of ORN in those advanced, larger lesions as there is typically a multimodality approach, with surgical intervention being in part responsible for a diminished bl ood supply to the area. Other factors associat ed with an increased incidence of ORN include poor nut ritional status, continued use of alcohol and tobacco, use of chemotherapy in conjuncti on with radiation therapy and/or surgery, mass of the mandible within the radiation field, mandibulotomies within the field, and individual patient sensitivity. Poor dental status is a partic ularly significant factor associated with the development of ORN, especially in considering the unfa vourable environment of radiation induced xerostomia which further predisposes to dental caries and periodontal infection.159 Pre- radiation prophylactic dental extractions are one of the cornerstones in preventing ORN, especially by allowing the avoidance of post-radiation dental manipulations. Because the presence of car ious and periodontally compromised teeth in the irradiated mandible has often been a ssociated with ORN, the current school of 52thought is that extractions of grossly carious, periodontall y \"hopeless,\" or those teeth deemed to have poor prognosis for rete ntion beyond 12 months should be removed prior to the initiation of radiation therapy.160 Through a prophylactic extraction of poor teeth prior to radiation ther apy, dental manipulations can generally be avoided in the post irradiation period. With the basis in the hypocellular-hypova scular-hypoxia theory in the pathophysiology of ORN, extracting teeth in an irradiated fiel d presents too great a metabolic demand on the compromised tissue to allow for adequate wound healing. The irradiated mandible is at a significant risk of ORN if dent al extractions are performed at this time. Lambert et al, 162 in 1997, noted that the most common factors associated with ORN were post-radiati on extractions (26.5%), spontaneous bone exposure associated directly with the denti tion secondary to dent al disease (22.8%) and pre-radiation extractions (20.4% ). Different institutions give widely varying reports on the incidence of ORN when comparing pr e and post radiation treatment dental extractions. Andrews and Griffiths163 found that just over one third of ORN occurs spontaneously with soft tissue breakdown over non-viable bone with the remaining two-thirds of cases being initiated by trau matic incidents such as tooth extraction, biopsy, progression of periodontal disease, su bgingival scaling or ill-fitting dentures. Although Clayman160 states that there is little difference between the incidence of ORN associated with pre-radiati on extractions (4.4%) and post-ra diation extractions (5.8%), it is generally accepted that the extraction of any teeth with a dubious prognosis should take place at least 2 - 3 weeks prior to the commencement of radiation therapy.92-94,164 Review of data published in the last decade estimated that there is twice the risk of developing ORN from post ir radiation dental extraction.165 For pre-treatment extractions, the current recommendation is to minimize trauma by conservatively reflecting a mucoperiosteal flap, forceps extraction of the tooth, meticulous alveolectomy to reduce sharp bony fragments, and to close the wound 53under minimal tension.166 The post surgical healing time prior to starting radiation treatment has been under debate where some authors provide a 10 day healing period while some authors are strong advo cates for longer. Marx and Johnson80 compared the incidence of ORN in pre-treatment tooth rem oval patients to the timing of the surgical insult. From their data, most of the ORN th at developed was in those patents in which treatment was begun within the first 2 w eeks post extraction, wh ere there was an inflection point at 12 - 15 days showing a re duced incidence to a m oderate level. They found no cases of ORN, however, when the tiss ue was allowed to heal for 21 days or more.80 While dental manipulation in an irradiated bone is best avoided, as evidenced by the drive for pre-treatment prophylactic removal, dentate patients with dental disease may require surgical intervention. Extreme attention in avoidi ng reflection of the periosteum and conservative alveoloplasty is advocated. In a prospective study by Marx, Johnson and Kline,167 the prevention of ORN in the high risk irradiated patient requiring tooth extraction was investigated by using peni cillin versus HBOT as a prophylactic measure. One study group received a 10 day treatment period with oral penicillin in addition to a single preoperative dose of intravenous aqueous penicillin while the second study group re ceived no antibiotic but under went a 20 pre-operative and 10 post-operative HBOT exposures ( 100% humidified oxygen / 2.4 atmospheres absolute pressure / 90 minutes per exposure) . The results of this particular study showed a sixfold incidence of ORN at the socket site in the group receiving only antibiotic. The conclusion was that HBOT in this particular clinical situation may be extremely beneficial as a preventative. Additionally, the success of HBOT when compared to the use of antibiotics, according to the authors, further supports the view that the actual role of micro-organisms in the pathogenic development of ORN should be minimized. 54Clinically, Clayman160 describes ORN as a nonhealing, non septic lesion of the bone in which tissue breakdown exceeds the repair capabilities of the w ounded bone. Radiation induces thrombosis of small blood vessels, fibrosis of periosteum and damage osteocytes, osteoblasts and hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular environment results as vascul ar channels narrow and dama ged bone cells subsequently undergo cell death at the time of cell division.93,160 Although the risk for ORN is greatest in the 3 - 12 month period following irradiation, the risk remains higher than that of non-irradiated patients for the rest of their lives.160 Even with modern radiation protocols, 5 - 15% of patients undergoing radiation therapy will suffer from ORN, with an increased susceptibility with highe r radiation doses, frac tion sizes and number of fractions.92,93 ORN is more common in the mandi ble where there is a higher density of compact bone, meaning that it absorbs more radiation than the maxilla. A reduced blood flow to the mandible, particularly in the olde r age groups more commonly affected by head and neck cancer, also means that it is at a grea ter risk of ORN in comparison to the well-vascularised maxilla. The risk of ORN continues indefinitely following completion of radiation therapy.97 Marx80 describes the clinical de finition of ORN as exposed, necrotic bone typically associated with ulcerated or necrotic surrounding soft tissue which persists for greater than 3 months in an area that had been prev iously irradiated. This occurs in the absence of local primary tumour necrosis, recurrence, or metastatic disease. It is not an infection of compromised bone as Meyer153 had earlier reported, but an avascular necrosis of bone caused by the three-H ti ssue effects of radiotherapy. Infections associated with ORN are secondary infecti ons due to the exposur e of bone and deep tissue planes. This bone death may occur shortly after radiation injury or years later. 55There are three types of ORN, as described by Marx.76 Type I develops shortly after radiation th erapy and is secondary to the synergistic effects of surgical trauma and radiat ion closely coupled in time leading to devascularisation of the mandible. Type II develops years after the completion of ra diation therapy and follows a distinct traumatic event, representing the progressive endarteritis and vascul ar occlusion of the nutrient vessels in the bone, periosteum, a nd surrounding soft tissue with the absolute inability for wound repair. Type III is the type of ORN which occurs spontaneously without a defining preceding traumatic event and usually manifests between 6 months and 3 year s after radiation. As noted from the occurrence of ORN several years after the comp letion of radiation therapy, the irradiated tissue remains comp romised for the life of the patient. Common symptoms associated with ORN are pain, ha litosis, and food imp action in the area of the lesion. Examination will reveal the exposed bone with concomitant soft tissue ulceration or necrosis, but may also reveal an intraoral or extraoral fistula, mandibular discontinuity, or evidence of secondary local or systemic infection. Marx76 emphasizes that the evaluating physician ha ve a high index of suspicion that this presentation may be recurrent, or persistent, or even metastatic malignancy. Deep biopsy of the lesion is helpful with samples sent for pathology a nd bacteriology in guiding treatment of a secondary infection, if present. In the cour se of the evaluation of this patient, the treating radiation therapist should be consulte d with a careful review of the pertinent radiation therapy records incl uding the ports of radiation therapy, the total dose, dose per fraction, and timing of therapy. Any co mplications associated with the radiation treatment should be noted. A thorough dental examination should also be performed in those patients with remaining dentition. If indicated, an experi enced oral surgeon 56should be consulted. A history of preceding intraoral trauma should also be explored. Outside of the physical exam, radiographs wi ll provide the most accurate estimate of the extent of the disease. The orthopa ntomograph (OPG) provi des a cost-effective useful assessment of the disease process, showing mottled areas of lucency with sclerotic areas at the edge of the involveme nt. In the progressed states, a pathological fracture or a sequestrum may al so be identified. A Computer Assisted (CT) scan, using the soft ware of DentaScan may provide usef ul information in detecting soft tissue in the area of bony resorption whic h may represent a tumour. Current Management of Osteoradionecrosis Occasionally systemic antibiotics will be required when ORN develops. Technically it is not an infection of bone but rather a nonhealing hypoxic wound. 167 Systemic antibiotics are of limited value to the mandible itself due to the decreased vasculature and subsequent poor drug delivery to the site . However, in secondary infections they may have a role in preventing the spread of infection. Usually, no attempt is initially made to obtain primary soft tissue closure of bone, since most wounds less than 1 cm or less will heal in weeks to months wit hout surgical interventi on other than removing sequestrum. 168,169 For large defects in the jaw, su rgery is generally required with osseous and soft tissue reconstruction with the aide of preopera tive and postoperative hyperbaric oxygen. The role of HBOT will be more fully discussed under that heading. ii) SOFT TISSUE NECROSIS The primary aetiologies for this type of chronic complication are due to excessive doses delivered to the tissues via intersti tial implants or secondary to soft tissue irritation from an inadequate fitting prosthesis.150,168 If the patient can tolerate being edentulous, it is recommended for the first 6 months post-therapy to allow for adequate 57healing and remodelling of bone. Occasionally it is required to administer HBOT and antibiotics to alleviate the necrotic tissue.150,168 iii) MUSCLE TRISMUS Radiation induced trismus is not a conseque nce of the effects of radiation on the temporomandibular joint but in stead is due to either radiation fibrosis within the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles or to re strictive fibrosis in the mucosa of the anterior tonsillar pill ar and retromolar areas. Masticat ory muscle trismus is a common sequelae to radiation treatment of the head and neck, with 5 - 38% of patients suffering from the condition. The incidence is incr eased where the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) and masticatory muscles fall within th e radiation field, a lthough the severity and extent are unpredictable.92 The onset of trismus may not occur until 3 - 6 months following the commencement of radiotherapy due to the progressive nature of the condition. Progressive endarteritis with re duced blood flow to the affected tissues leads to scarring and fi brosis of the muscles.92,93 This can cause a reduced mouth opening and subsequent changes in speech and chewing patterns.95 In the more severe cases, existing prostheses ca nnot be inserted and new pr ostheses cannot be made, leading to a decline in th e ability to eat and carry out proper oral hygiene.92 T h i s process cannot be reversed, although mouth exercises can help to prevent excessive fibrosis and loss of interarch space in the short term.95 The patient should open and close their mouths 20 times, at least three ti mes a day and devices such as the Therabite or tongue blades are useful adjuncts in exercising the muscles.92,169,170 A substance called pentoxifylline and electrotherapy ma y also be useful in the short term.169 58iv) RADIATION CARIES Although some studies suggest that irradiated teeth decalcify more readily than non- irradiated teeth, it is generally accepted that increases in dental caries following radiation therapy are due to the lack of saliva as well as changes in the saliva's chemical composition. 94,97 These patients generally exhi bit caries on sm ooth surfaces such as cusp tips, incisal edges and ci rcumferentially in the cervical regions.92,93 The antimicrobial defensive mechanisms of the saliva are compromised as salivary electrolytes, lysosomes and immunoprotei ns, such as IgA immunoglobulins, are decreased and the salivary flow is reduced.92 An increase in plaque results, with a subsequent rise in the number of gram ne gative bacteria increasing the acid-producing potential of the plaque. This problem is exacerbated by the tendency of xerostomic patients to take more frequent meals that are often highly sweetened to overcome loss of taste sensation.92,93 The incidence of rampant carie s is not dependent on past caries history and can cause rapid destructi on in previously caries-free mouths.92 Although these mechanisms contribute to radiation caries, Marx76 maintains that they are not the only or most significant causes. Caries in non- irradiated individuals occurs in pits, in fissures and interproximally. It is also chal ky and soft from dissolved tooth structure. Radiation caries, by contrast, is hard and black. It occurs at the gingival margin, cusp tips and incisal surfaces. It w ould, therefore, be unrealisti c to accept radiation caries as a mere extension of non-radiation caries from reduced salivary flow. Moreover, radiation caries is either present only in the irradiated field or is more severe in the irradiated field, while the entire mout h is affected by xerostomia. In Marx's 76 opinion, radiation caries is mainly due to pulpal necrosis and odontoblast death, which causes deterioration of both the dentine and th e dentinoenamel junction. The enamel is subsequently lost from the dentine because of dentinal dehydration and dentinoenamel junction deterioration which he states is similar to the mechanism when enamel is lost 59in dentinogenesis imperfecta. Pulp testing teeth with radi ation caries may or may not produce a response. This is because traditional dental pulp testing reflects nerve response. However, vitality of any tissue is a matter of blood supply and perfusion, not of nerve response. This is because nerves are the most radiation resistant tissues and the pulpal endorgans actually arise in the Ga sserian ganglion, well outside the field of radiation. Therefore the irradiated teeth ma y respond to pulp testing but actually be nonvital due avascular necrosis of the pul pal tissues, and this would include the odontoblasts. When the pulp is examined histol ogically, it is avascular and exhibits the three-H tissue of radiation damage. Dental caries may become evident as early as three months following the initiation of radiotherapy. In severe cases, a previous ly healthy dentition can be completely degraded within a year. Vissink 112 describes three clinical types of caries lesions. All three types of lesions may o ccur within the same mouth. Th e histological features of the initial radiation caries are similar to those observed in normal incipient dental caries lesions, but erosive types of lesions can be observed as well. i. The first type is a frequently observed le sion that starts on th e labial surface at the cervical margins of the teeth. It ini tially starts as a \"ring-barking\" of the tooth with eventual amputation of the crow n of the anterior teeth and less often of the molar teeth. ii. The second type of lesion occurs with th e dental decay localized at the incisal or occlusal edges of the teeth and results in destruction of the coronal enamel and dentine, especially on the palatal and buccal surfaces. The lesion begins as a diffuse, punctuate defect and then progr esses to generalise d, irregular erosion of the tooth surfaces. 60iii. The third type of lesion is less frequen tly found and consists of a heavy brown- black discoloration of the entire toot h crown, accompanied by accelerated wear of the incisal and occlusal surfaces. Current Management of Radiation Caries The first approach in the treatment of ramp ant caries in the patient is directed to prevent future lesions developing. The patie nt is educated on the aetiology of caries and how this is affected by changes in the sa livary flow, diet and b acteria present in the mouth.92 Qualitative and quantitative changes in saliva mean that the patient must become more reliant on oral hygiene meas ures to reduce bacterial load. Vigorous rinsing following eating can recreate the flus hing mechanism of normal salivary flow and rinsing with sodium bica rbonate can help to elevate the salivary pH and improve the buffering capacity of the available saliva. Diet must also be changed, with a shift away from fermentable carbohydrates to subs tances that aren't readily broken down by bacteria to form organic acids, such as xylitol, saccharin and sorbitol. Fluoride treatments will become a life -long necessity and the patient needs to be encouraged to maintain compliance with at home treatments in the form of fluoride carrier trays. Regular reviews of the patient's oral hea lth as well as monitoring of oral hygiene measures ensure that early recognition of de ntal caries is allowed. All carious lesions should be removed and restored immedi ately as progression is very rapid.97 Marx 76 states that those teeth that receive mo re than 60 Gy are most at risk of developing radiation caries and even the best oral hygiene , dental care and fluoride carriers will not prevent all radiation caries. 61v) IMPAIRED OROFACIAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT The effect of radiation treatment on devel oping bone depends on the child's age, the radiation dose and the location and exte nt of bone in the treatment field.91 Doses in excess of 20 Gy may significantly impair bone growth and development resulting in oro-facial asymmetry and skeletal malocclusions.91,95 This altered growth may result in a small jaw with a poor occlusion, or an a ltered facial appearan ce later in life. However, many of the resultant deformities can be adequately corrected through a combination of orthodontic and/ or oral surgical procedures . Exposure to radiation can also affect tooth development, with matu re ameloblasts being permanently damaged with as little as 10 Gy and ameloblastic activity ceasing after exposure of 30 Gy. 91 A wide variety of dental abnormalities in th ese patients may be noted such as missing teeth, delayed tooth eruption, enamel opaci ties and altered tooth or root form.34,36,38 Unfortunately, there is little that can be done to avoid these side effects in teeth. 2.3 HYPERBARIC OXYGEN 2.3.1 HYPERBARIC AIR The earliest reference to the importance of air to life can be found in the bible. \"The Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.\" Genesis 2: 7 Historically, the development of hyperbaric medicine is cl osely associated with the history of diving equipment. According to Aristotle, Alexander the Great used a \"glass barrel\" at the Battle of Tyre in 332 BC. In the 1530s Guglielmo de Loreno developed the first diving bell. In 1691 Edmund Halle y improved the design by devising a way to replenish the air supply; he eventually bui lt a diving chamber that enabled him to remain 60 feet underwater for one hour. In 1865 Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste 62Denayrouse patented a compressed-air ta nk for underwater breathing. By adapting a car regulator in 1942 and 1943, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Emile Gagnan invented a way to deliver compressed air automatically to a diver as he breathed; their \" Aqua Lung ,\" a modern forerunner of today's scuba (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) The concept of using respirable gases at ra ised ambient pressures for the treatment of illnesses dates back three centuries. In 1662 hyperbaric air was used by Henshaw, a British clergyman, for treatment of \"affections of the lung\". 171 However, on considering the apparatus used at the time, it seems likely that the reported benefits were a placebo effect. 172 In 1834 Junod, in France, built a chamber to treat pulmonary conditions at pressures between 2 and 4 atmospheres absolute (ATA). Over the next one hundred years \"pneumatic centres\" were es tablished in various European cities and in the USA. Hyperbaric air was used to trea t a wide variety of a ilments, including lung infections, cardiac disease, carcinomas, diabetes, and demen tia, and was used as an aid to surgery, providing \"deeper anaesthesia and less cyanosis\". 173 By the 19th Century \"hyperbaric centres\" had begun to develop a reputation in competition with \"health spas\".174 Orval J Cunningham, a professor of anaest hesia at the University of Kansas in the early 1900s, is regarded as being the last exponent of compressed air therapy.175,176 His observations that people with heart di sease and other circul atory disorders did poorly at altitude and improve d at sea level formed the ba sis of his use of hyperbaric air.176 In 1918 he successfully treated sufferers of the Spanish flu epidemic with hyperbaric air. He went on to build the la rgest ever-constructed hyperbaric chamber, six stories high and 64 feet in diameter , in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1928. In 1930 the American Medical Association forced him to close the centre due to his refusal or inability to provide any scientif ic evidence for his treatments.177 632.3.2 EARLY HISTORY OF HYPE RBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY Early attempts to understand the role of oxygen date back to Hippocrates (460- 370 BC), who knew that inspired air contained something th at entered the heart and spread through the body. Aristotle (384-322 BC) showed that experimental animals would not survive in airti ght boxes. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) described how air entered the lungs by the bellows action of the chest wall. Despite the crucial role of oxygen in maintain ing human life, it wa s not until the 18th century that it was used as a therapy. In 1774, Priestley was the first to produce oxygen by heating red oxide of mercury in a glass vessel over metallic mercury. He showed that this gas supported life in mice and caused a candle to burn more vigorously. He called this \" dephlogisticated air \".174 However, it was his friend, Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-1794) who coined the term \" oxyg\u00e8ne \", derived from the Greek meaning \" acid producer \". However, shortly after its di scovery, reports of toxic effects of HBO on the central nervous system and lungs178,179 were enough to prevent its formal application under increased pressure. It was not until 1887 that the first use of HBO was reported in the Lancet. The modern literature on HBOT dates back to the 1930s when the US Navy studied the use of oxygen to accomplish decompression more rapidly in divers and to treat decompression sickness and arterial gas embo lism. Prior to this the basic physics and physiology of hyperbaric medi cine had been established over several centuries by luminaries such as Boyle, Priestley, Lavoi sier, Bert, Lorraine-Smith, and Haldane who in a paper published in 1917 on the therapeutic app lication of oxygen wrote: 64\"It may be argued that such measures as the administration of oxygen are at best only palliative and are of no real use, since they do not remove the cause of the pathological condition. As a phy siologist, I cannot for one moment agree with this reasoning. The living body is no machine, but an organism constantly tending to revert to the normal and the respite afforded by such measures as the temporary administration of oxygen is not wasted, but utilized for recuperation....The mistake is often made of not grasping the serious, wi despread, and lasting effects caused by want of oxygen ....\" 180 The application of HBOT in c linical medicine really began with separate work done by Churchill-Davidson and Boerema in 1955 a nd 1956. Churchill-Davidson, in the United Kingdom, used HBOT to enhance the radiosensitivity of tumours.181 Professor Ite Boerema, from the Department of Surger y at the University of Amsterdam, successfully used HBOT in cardiac surg ery to prolong the tim e allowed for cross- clamping of the major vessels.182 Throughout the 1960s, enthusiasm for the use of HBOT grew, as it had a dramatic impact in the areas of cardiac surgery, carbon monoxide poisoni ng and gas gangrene. Many chambers were established across Nort h America and Eurasia. As the number of chambers and excitement for the treatment grew, many centres began to treat a wide range of ailments with HBOT on the basis of very little scientific evidence or rationale. Often it was used to treat conditions that had failed to respond to conventional therapies, such as senility, stroke, arthritis and emphysema. 65In the early 1970s huge progress was made in the development of cardiopulmonary bypass equipment and hence the requirement to perform cardiac surgery under hyperbaric conditions declined. Cardiac surge ons had been some of the most energetic promoters of the use of HBOT. As these ea rly pioneers left the field of hyperbaric medicine so did much of the enthusiasm for extensive and high quality research. By the late 1970s there was a growing concern in the USA by both hyperbaric and general physicians that HBOT was bei ng applied indiscriminately, that there was a lack of scientific progress in the field and that there was no regulatory body. These concerns led the Undersea Medical Society (UMS), wh ich had been formed originally in 1967 by US Navy medical officers with an intere st in Diving and Submarine Medicine, to form an ad hoc Committee on Hyperbaric Oxygenation. 172 This committee has become the internationally recognised authority on accepted indications for HBOT. It regularly updates and publishes its list of accepted indi cations and discriminates between those conditions that are approved for treatment and those that are supported by sound scientific theory but are s till requiring research. The UMS is now known as the UHMS (Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society). Work in the past two decades has defined the mechanism of HBOT and confirmed its value in carefully selected applications . More recently HBOT has demonstrated a unique ability to reverse some of the ce llular changes and restore microvascular density to within 75-85% of normal. 10 2.3.3 HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY HBOT consists of exposing a patient to intermittent, short-term 100% oxygen inhalation at a pressure greater than one atmosphere in a Hyperbaric Chamber or Recompression Chamber. A HBOT chamber, pe r se, is not the therapeutic agent which 66produces angiogenesis and fibroplasia in ra diated tissue. Oxyge n is actually the therapeutic agent with the chamber serving merely as a dosing device. Marx, Ehler and Tayapongsak10 showed that oxygen at normobaric (1 ATA) pre ssure is in capable of producing angiogenesis or fibroplasia in an imal models. These authors also showed that increasing the pressure to an optimum of 2.4 AT A brought the dosage of oxygen into a therapeutic range while avoiding toxicity. T hus, oxygen, like any other medically useful agent, has a therapeu tic optimum between ineffective use and toxicity. The pressures and exposure times necessary to create angiogenesis and fibroplasia have been well explored by Marx and other authors in a number of publications. 10,11,23 Initially, studies documented both angiogenesis and fibroplasia in irradiated head and neck patients through bi opsy of human tissues before and after HBOT.11 Then, later, human transcutaneous oxygen measurements and animal studies traced the time course of this angiogenesis and fibroplasia.10,80 In 1983, Marx5 introduced a new protocol for the treatment of ORN using HBOT. He further investigated the success of his treatme nt protocol at a cellu lar level and gave a new understanding of the physio logy of HBOT in revascul arization in irradiated tissues5,6,7,10,80 and demonstrated that HBOT was able to reverse some of the cellular changes and restore microvascular de nsity to within 75-80% of normal.10,80 At least 18 to 23 HBO treatments were necessary before the revascularization of the irradiated tissues plateaued and remained at the level of 75-80% even when the course of HBO was continued to 40 treatments. Angiogenesis apparently stops because the hypoxic environment has been reversed, the stimulus of lactate has been removed, and the steep oxygen gradient has been eliminated. Marx found that repeat measurements of pO2 , using a transcutaneous oxygen monitor, rema ined essentially the same up to 4 years 67later, indicating that the angiogenesis is nearly permanent.10,80 This is illustrated in Figure 4 below. Fig. 4. Vascular density as a function of hyperbaric oxygen exposure. 7 Figure 4 shows the levels of oxygen saturati on measured against time, with the upper measurements (Control) taken from non-irra diated tissue and the lower measurements (Radiated tissue) taken from irradiated tissue. As can be seen in this graph, the lower curve, which represents angiogenesis and fibr oplasia, develops in re sponse to HBOT of 2.4 ATA, over a 20 session treatment course. Th e first response of the irradiated tissue (\"Three H\" tissue) to HBOT is referred to Marx as the \"lag phase\" because no measurable change is seen due to the cr udeness of the transcut aneous oxygen monitor.6 However, histological studies have show n capillary budding and cellular collagen synthesis.10 The radiated tissue's response be gins collagen productio n and endothelial proliferat ion, which occur during the VASCULAR DENSITY AS A FUNCTION OF HBO EXPOSURE 0 20406080100120 0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 40 2yr HBO SESSIONS (no./years) TISSUE pO2(%)Control Irradiated 68first 6 to 8 HBOT sessions. After 8 HBO sessi ons the curve in Figure 4 begins a steep upward deflection which Marx refers to as the \"rapid rise phase\".6 This rise is caused by the proliferation of lumenized and functi onal capillaries, which is measured by the transcutaneous monitor as increased capilla ry density. Histologi cal evidence shows a geometric development of capillarie s from the few pre-existing ones.10 That is, one capillary buds into two, two into four and so on. This vascular proliferation continues until 20 sessions of HBOT is reached, after which it levels off to between 75% and 85% of that seen in non-radiated tissue. Th is levelling off of angiogenic response is termed the \"plateau phase,\" by Marx. 6 The plateau phase consists of maximum revascularisation where the stimulus for further angiogenesis ceases. Histologically, it is associated with an observed reduction in tissue macrophages, capillary budding and collagen synthesis as compared to the \"lag\" and \"rapid rise\" phases. Most importantly, as illustrated in Figure 4, the angiogenesis effect is maintained for at least 4 years. Those patients, who were re-studied, demonstr ated the same level of angiogenesis after 4 years as they had immediately after th eir HBOT. Apparently, the new vessels induced by HBOT do not involu te after cessation of HBO treatment any faster than vessels involute at the norma l rate of aging. It should al so be noted that Figure 4 illustrates that there is a lack of any res ponse in non-irradiated tissue. HBOT does not induce a super-vascularisation in non-irradia ted, otherwise normal tissue and therefore cannot be expected to acceler ate healing in tissue which does not have a compromised wound healing potential. 2.3.4 HYPERBARIC OXYGEN PROTOC OLS AS ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR SURGERY In his landmark paper in 1983, Marx 5 describes a hyperbaric tr eatment (or dive) as a patient breathing 100% oxygen for 90 minutes at 2.4 ATA. The term dive is used as 69the treatment for the complications of TRT were developed within the long established treatment protocols for diving medicine, involving treatment for Caisson Disease (Decompression Sickness or the Bends). Pa tients require a minimum of 20 treatments before surgery and 10 sessions post surgery, ma king a total of thirty sessions. This is called a 20/10 protocol. The se ssions are carried out 5 days a week for 4 weeks and then appropriate surgery is undertaken. Th e patient then return s for a further 10 sessions over 2 weeks. The 20/ 10 protocol is used for dentoalveolar surgery where there is no evidence of ORN, eg dental extrac tions in the field of irradiation. Marx goes on to describe three further progressive pr otocols for recalcitran t surgical problems, where there is demonstrable ORN. (see Appe ndix 2 for a complete description of the Marx HBOT protocols) 2.3.5 MECHANISM OF HYPERBARIC OXYGEN INDUCED ANGIOGENESIS AND FIBROPLASIA The mechanism by which HBOT achieves angi ogenesis and fibroplas ia in irradiated tissue has been studied 6 and found to be stimulated by a similar oxygen-gradient phenomenon that Knighton, Silver and Hu nt have found to be central in the angiogenesis and fibroplasi a of normal wound healing.8,9,183 Radiation tissue does not spontaneously revascularise as do other w ounded tissues because of the unique physics and pattern of tumourcidal ra diation delivery. Normal wounds have a central area of tissue injury or haematoma surrounded by relatively normal tissue and normal perfusion. Therefore, the oxygen tension in th e central area of th e wound is extremely low (often 0 to 5 mmHg) and the adjacent tissue is normal (approximately 50 to 60 mmHg). The oxygen gradient is thus naturally steep across a short distance. Such steep oxygen gradients are the physio-chemotac tic factor attracting wound regulating macrophages to a wound. 184,185 Steep oxygen gradients, along with the lactate, iron and 70the low pH inherent in wounds, stimulate macrophage derived a ngiogenesis factor (MDAF) and macrophage derived growth fact or (MDGF) which in turn promote the capillary budding and collagen synthesis of wound healing.184 Radiated tissue does not spontaneously re vascularise because the wounding pattern is so diffuse that only shallow oxygen grad ients are created. Th erefore, the physio- chemical response which identifies an in jured area as a wound does not develop, and the body, in a sense does not recognise the radiation injury as a wound. 80 In fact, as the late radiation effect on cells makes the tissue worse with time, the continuation and worsening of the \"Three H\" pattern make the natural tissue oxygen gradients even less. 4 The diffuse pattern of radiation injury is created chiefly by the isodose concept of tumourcidal radiotherapy. That is, a tumour is conceptualized as a spheroidal mass with the greatest number of target cells in th e diameter of its equator. A greater dose or boost dose is given to the tumour centre. At incremental distances fr om the equator, the tumour's cellular mass is less, and therefore the delivered dose is less. This progressively diminishing dose from the tu mour's centre to the periphery of the planned radiated area creates a gradual lessening of tissue inju ry and therefore a gradual or shallow oxygen gr adient. The divergence of the radiation beam from its source further contributes to this shallow oxygen gradient; even when collimators are used. This creates greater cellular damage at the centre of the radiat ion port than at the periphery. Studies by Marx and others 6,7,10 have identified that the ce ntre of an uncomplicated radiation injured area has oxygen tensions around 5 to 10 mmHg. This value is not far above the 3 mmHg of oxygen tension at which spontaneous wound breakdown is thought to occur.8,9,151,152 Measurements taken at 1 cm increments from the centre show 71a gradual improvement in tissue oxygen tensions until one reaches the limits of the radiation field, where normal 55 to 60 mmHg oxygen tension is found.6,7,10 During exposure of the patient to HBOT at 2.4 ATA, measurements by Marx7 indicate a seven to ten-fold rise at each 1 cm increment, including the non-irradia ted tissue outside the radiated field. Since each incremental area shows an increase in oxygen tension, the underlying shallow oxygen gradient is magni fied into a steep oxygen gradient. In addition, at every increment, increased oxygen is available at the cellular level. After 10 exposures, when the radiated tissue is in th e early portion of the rapid rise phase, the oxygen gradients move centrally, indicating th at much of the angiogenesis comes from outside the radiated field. Af ter 18 exposures of HBOT, when radiated tissue is in the later portion of the rapid rise phase, the oxygen gradient is not only seen to move more centrally but is eliminated at the outer ar eas. This indicates that the bulk of the angiogenesis comes from outside the radiated field and suggests th at angiogenesis in that area eliminates the oxygen gradient alt ogether. After 20 to 24 exposures of HBO, oxygen gradients are either eliminated or are so small that gr adients above 20 mmHg cannot be achieved even with HBOT. Thus HBOT creates steep oxygen gradients in radiated tissues which cannot develop them naturally as do other wounds. These steep oxygen gradients then trigger the recogniti on of the radiated tissue as a wound and initiate the series of biochemical steps seen in normal tissue angiogenesis. The angiogenesis induced by HBOT remains unde r the same regulatory control as normal wound angiogenesis, so that when sufficient capillary perfusion oxygen sequence shuts off and over- angiogenesis is prevented. Marx 7 has shown that HBOT stimulates angiogenesis to create a vascular architecture of 75% to 85% that of non-radiated tissue. This seems to hinge on the fact that angiogenesis shuts off when oxygen gradients dip below a fixed point (suggested to be 20 mmHg), not necessa rily when the gradient is absolutely 72zero.185,186 In non-radiated, non-compromised wounde d tissue, there is already a steep oxygen gradient. HBOT only adds to the stee pness of the gradient which is already producing a maximal stimulus, and the capac ity for further response is lost. Since oxygen gradients stimulate angiogenesis, rath er than increased oxygen availability, a mere increase in oxygen availa bility will not enhance wou nd healing in normal tissue. Interestingly, patients followed years afte r HBO exposure show evidence the vascular density regressed as the transcutaneous oxyge n tension remained at or within 90% of the values recorded dir ectly after completing hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The rationale for the 10 post extraction sessions in this preventative protocol is to reduce wound dehiscence through the promotion of collagen production at the incision lines.183 Regardless of the cause, a common denominator in most problem wounds is tissue hypoxia, which can be corrected by HBOT in partially ischemic and infected wounds and in irradiated tissue. Breathing high le vels of oxygen under pressure substantially increases the amount of oxygen in physical so lution in plasma and interstitial fluid. This serum hyperoxia is the critical fa ctor in problem w ound angiogenesis and infection control. Breathing room air at sea level (normobaric air containing 20% oxygen) results in an arterial pO 2 of about 100 mm Hg. Haem oglobin is 98% saturated and there is 0.31 ml of oxygen/dl of bl ood in physical solution. The same person breathing 100% oxygen at sea level can satu rate haemoglobin only to its' capacity, so little is gained in th is area in tissue oxygen delivery. The arterial pO 2 increases to 673 mm Hg and yields 2.09 ml of oxygen dissolved in each decilitre of blood. However, no further elevation of oxygen levels can be ach ieved without the addi tion of pressure. If the pressure is increased to 2.4 atmosphere s absolute (ATA) while the patient breathes 100% oxygen the arterial pO 2 increases to 1795 mm Hg with 5.56 ml of oxygen 73dissolved in each decilitre of blood. It is this increased oxygen availability at the cellular level that stimulates angiogenesis . The elevated pressure of the delivered oxygen establishes the steep oxygen gradient necessary for angiogenesis and wound repair.8,9 If a wound is to heal, new tissues must be supported by neovascularity. The vasculature cannot grow beyond its' collage nous support, so cells and collagen must therefore precede new capillaries. Cells be yond the most distal capillaries in a wound multiply in this steep oxygen gradient. They migrate from these capillaries and synthesize collagen as far as their oxygen supply allows. The extremely high dose of oxygen during the actual hyperbaric treatmen t is followed by a return to the hypoxic state, with lactate build-up between treatments. Tissue macrophages migrate to the area and secrete a variety of biochemical me ssengers, including a chemotactic wound angiogenesis factor, in response to the high la ctate levels that exis t in the wound space. Capillary buds are signalled to grow into th e hypoxic area by this angiogenesis factor. These new capillary buds are then able to grow into the newly synthesized collagen framework and establish a new capillary arcade. The intermittent availability of high dose oxygen is followed by a return to the hypoxic state and the resulting lactate stimulus. There is replication and migrati on of cells. Collagen synthesis is carried farther into the wound, and healing progresses in a cyclic manner. The capillary pO 2 is greatly elevated during the daily HBOT, in creasing the oxygen reaching the advancing cells, which migrate further from the distal capillaries. The vascular supply continues to advance, and the wound can continue to heal. A number of researches have contributed to our understand ing of this mechanism of oxygen influence on wound healing.187-190 The impact of hyperbaric oxygen expos ure on the irradi ated tissue has therefore been shown to be one of fibroplas ia and angiogenesis, but this has only been shown to occur in tissue that has been irra diated for some time where the effects of hypovascularity and hypocellularity have produced a steep hypoxic gradient. 742.3.6 OTHER MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF HYPERBARIC OXYGEN The clinical benefits of HBOT have b een explained theore tically above by the mechanical effects of pressure and the physics of gas laws, the physiological and biochemical effects of hyper oxia, and also thro ugh the reversal of local hypoxia in irradiated tissues. In summary, at sea le vel the dissolved oxyge n concentration in plasma is 3mL/L.191,192 At rest normally perfused ti ssue requires about 60ml of oxygen per litre of blood. At 3 ATA the dissolv ed oxygen concentrati on rises to about 60mL/L,192 sufficient to supply the tissue oxyge n requirement without the need for oxygen to be carried by haemoglobin.7 Hence, the benefits of HBOT are obvious in pathologies involving haemoglobin, such as carbon monoxide poisoning and severe anaemia. Table 2 lists the effects of high partial pr essures of oxygen on va rious organs, tissues and biochemical reactions. 193 The effects are multiple and often complex and no further discussion will be entered into as th ey are outside the parameters of this study. 75Table 2.

Indications for hyperbaric oxyge n therapy approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society a nd by Medicare under the Australian Government.211 Air or Gas embolism Carbon Monoxide poisoning and smoke inhalation; carbon monoxide poisoning complicated by cyanide poisoning Clostridial myositis and myonecrosis (gas gangrene) Crush injury, compartmental syndrome, and other acute traumatic ischaemias Decompression sickness Enhancement of healing in selected problem wounds Exceptional blood loss (anaemia) Intracranial abscess, actinomycosis Necrotising soft tissue infections Osteomyelitis (refractory) Delayed radiation injury (s oft tissue and bony necrosis) Skin graft and flaps (compromised) Thermal burns 2.3.8 CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF HYPERBARIC OXYGEN IN THE HEAD AND NECK REGION FOR POST-RADIATION INJURY Marx's 20/10 HBOT protocol7 has been used for 20 years now as part of the treatment of post-radiation injury, which includes bone graft reconstruction, soft tissue flaps, tooth removal and more recently as part of osseointegrated implant treatment, for both implant born teeth and maxillofacial prostheses. (see Appendix for complete description of all Ma rx's HBOT protocols) 77i) Bony Reconstruction of the Jaws In the early 1970s, early experiences of HBOT and bony jaw reconstruction used HBOT empirically in the postoperative phase of treatment of patients with ORN. These initial results213,214 were disappointing because of in sufficient knowledge of the basic mechanism of HBOT and ba sic tissue angiogenesis response; until Marx and Ames11 focused the attention of HBOT on the pr eoperative phase. Si nce then, Marx and Johnson,80 Marx, Johnson and Kline,167 and Marx, Ehler, and Tayapongsak10 have elucidated the mechanism and time course of angiogenesis and fi broplasia discussed earlier and radically changed the treatmen t of ORN. The importa nce of preoperative HBOT relates to the basic biology of bone graft healing. HBOT has literally revolutionized facial bone rec onstruction of the radiated pa tient and its' complications, such as osteoradionecrosis, because it ha s made outcomes predictable and functional and the patient's healing is le ss complicated. Prior to the regular use of Marx's 20/10 HBOT protocol, mandibular reconstruc tion success 50%.215,216 With the use of 20/10 HBOT protocol, success rate s meeting six rigid cr iteria have been 90% to 93%.7,11 Marx7 lists the six criteria for success in jaw reconstruction as: 1. Restoration of jaw continuity, 2. Restoration of alveol ar bone height, 3. Restoration of osseous bulk, 4. Restoration of arch form, 5. Maintenance of bone (minimum 18 months), 6. Restoration of facial contours. ii) Soft Tissue Flaps En bloc cancer resection removes significan t soft tissue, while radiation treatment causes further soft tissue necrosis and enda rteritis obliterans. Therefore pedicled 78myocutaneous or free microvascular flaps are often required to reconstruct such defects left by cancer treatment. Although these flap s will bring with them their own blood supply, they will, nevertheless, be put into a bed of \"three-H\" affected radiated tissue, unless the patient undergoes a pre-operative HB OT. The vascularised flap will then be placed in a re-vascularised tissue bed and not be almost totally dependant on its pedicle for both its' short and long term blood supply. 7,11 iii) Tooth Removal ORN is one of the most dreaded complicat ions of radiotherapy and the single most common precipitating event leading to ORN is tooth removal; with 89% of all trauma- induced ORN being secondary to tooth removal.160 When a tooth is removed from a jaw which has previously received 60 Gy or more, the bone and surrounding mucosa have a compromised ability to mount a heal ing response. The greater the time elapsed since the completion of radiot herapy, the greater the effect of the \"three-H\"response and the less likely the socket is able to meet the demands of healing. The common scenario is then ORN. In 1985, Marx, Johnson and Kline 167 published the first randomized, prospective study dealing with th e effects of HBOT on radionecrosis. The study involved 74 patients who needed te eth removed from mandi bles that had a minimum of 68 Gy (average 72 Gy). One half of the group were given penicillin pre- operatively and ten days postoperatively for tooth removal. The other half of the group were given a 20/10 HBO protocol for the t ooth removal and no antibiotics. All patients were then followed up and at 6 months those patients with exposed, non-healing wounds were considered to have ORN. The antibiotic group developed a 29.9% incidence of ORN verses 5.4% in the HBOT group. In addition, 8 of the 11 patients who developed ORN in the antibiotic group required jaw resection and HBO for resolution. Of the 2 patients in the HBOT group who developed ORN, neither required 79jaw resection, indicating a less severe form of necrosis. Since this study the 20/10 HBOT protocol has become the standard form of adjuvant treatment for tooth extraction in patients with a histor y of radiotherapy of the jaws. iv) Osseointegrated Implant Treatment The landmark papers217,218 of Br\u00e5nemark and his team on the use of titanium implants have brought about a new age in implant surgery for not only the replacement of teeth but also in maxillofacial prosthetic recons truction. Head and neck cancer patients have often undergone the surgical removal of all or parts of their jaws a nd teeth. In addition many of these patients also have combined radiotherapy treatment which further complicates their reconstruc tion. While facial reconstruc tion with the patients' own tissues, using microvascular or rotational flap techniques, can be ve ry successful, these patients may also benefit from the use of osseointegrated surgical and prosthetic reconstruction. As with bony and soft tissue reconstruction, the use of HBOT should enhance implant integration and long-term survival. Granstr\u00f6m 219 gives a fixture failure rate of 53% when they are insert ed into radiated bone and only 5.3% when inserted into radiated bone that has had a 20/10 HBOT protocol. 2.3.9 OXYGEN IN WOUND HEALING Attempts to treat pr oblem wounds with HBOT began almost simultaneously in Japan, Europe and the United States during the de cade of the 1960s. By the late 1970s many clinical studies had been published which s uggested a beneficial role for the use of supplemental oxygen administered under incr eased pressure for the treatment of selected wounds. These early promising resu lts and subsequent continued favourable responses noted by clinicians encouraged its ongoing use. During th is era it was also quickly recognized that the vast majority of problem wounds that responded to HBOT 80were associated with conditions which compromised the blood supply and oxygenation of tissue. These conditions included ra diation damage, diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerosis, vasculitis, venous stasis, tobacco abus e and the increased oxygen demand of infection.220 The pioneering studies of Niinikoski, Heughan and Hunt221 on the pivotal role of oxygen in the wound h ealing process and the work of Sheffield222 in the measurement of tissue oxygen provided the beginnings of a physiological underpinning to support the use of hyperbaric oxygen in problem wounds. During the early decades of this form of treatment the vast majority of hyperbaric physicians thought that HBOT was merely a tool to supply oxygen to tissue that needs oxygen. Non-healing wounds were oxygen deficient; these wounds were given oxygen and they got better. The mechanism of the benefit was assumed to be the providing of oxygen for tissue in order to restore normal physiological function. To physicians of that era, oxygen was being used in its usually concei ved roll in oxidative cellular respiration. Not enough was known about molecular biology at that time which could allow the consideration of any other possible mechan ism. The idea howev er, that one could supply oxygen to hypoxic tissue for only 90 minu tes a day, 5 days a week, for a basic 20/10 protocol; i.e. 6.25% of the day, not counting the ti me off for weekends, and make things better was counterintuitive to some in the hyperbaric medical community and it was ludicrous to many in the scien tific community at large. If tissue needs oxygen as a respiratory metabolite, it needs it all the time. Tissu e does not have an \"oxygen stomach\" where excess can be stored and then stoked into the oxidative furnace as needed. In the 1970s and 1980s, th e probable deleterious effect of the prolonged period of hypoxia between HBO tr eatments was partiall y explained by the assumption that an adequate supply of oxygen persisted for several hours after each treatment. It was also known that hypoxia is an early and important event in the initiation of the healing process in acute wounds and therefore it was assumed that a 81period of hypoxia was an essen tial ingredient for the stimulation of the healing process in chronic wounds. Recent accurate meas urements of tissue oxygen during and following HBOT however, document that this form of treatment delivers hyperoxia, not physiologic concentrations of oxygen, and that adequa te supplies of oxygen remain in ischemic tissue only a few hours at most.223 These facts forced some in the HBO community to rethink the fundamental assu mptions about the basis of HBOT. Clearly, when a patient with a non-healing hypoxic wo und is treated with HBO, they are not just getting a physiological dose of oxygen fo r an appropriate amount of time if the therapy is only fuel for the cellular oxidativ e process. The HBOT must in some way be acting more than just as a deliverer of oxygen to hypoxic tissue. In 1994, some possible suggestions were made by Zhao et al ,224 who noted a 100% reversal of the healing deficit induced by ischemia in experimental animals when wounds were treated with HBOT and growth factors simultaneously. Clea rly this synergistic response suggested a direct interaction between oxygen and gr owth factors rather than the response expected from restoring adequate nutrition to sick cells. The nature of this interaction was deduced by Bonomo et al225 who reported a statistically significant rise in the production of PDGF (Platelet De rived Growth Factor) recept or protein I in ischemic wounds that were treated simultaneously with both HBOT and PDGF. This finding leads strong support to the c oncept that HBOT functions as an intracellular signalling transducer and thus is a modulator of ge ne function. Siddiqui et al223 who documented that HBOT produces hyperoxic (not physiolo gic) concentrations in ischemic wounds and that oxygen concentration falls promptly to pre-treatment levels in ischemic tissue also demonstrated a progressi ve increase in the real oxygen concentration in ischemic tissue when it was challenged with 100% oxygen at one atmosphere as well as a more rapid washout of oxygen from tissue after se rial HBO treatments. The magnitude of these changes was proportional to the number of HBO treatments. Davidson and 82Mustoe226 attributed these acute changes in th e responsiveness of ischemic tissue to serial HBO treatments and suggested a pr ompt but transient production of a potent local vasodilator. Since HBOT is a signal transduction agent whic h can modify protein synthesis in the case of PDGF receptor, Davidson and Mustoe226 questioned whether hyperoxia could also act as a signal transducer in a pathway that increases the activity or production of nitric oxide synthase. It w ould seem that there is increasing data to suggest that the transient hyperoxia of HB OT functions as an intracellular signal transduction agent or modulator of gene f unction via more than one signalling pathway in addition to supplying the critical elem ent for cellular respiration. Oxygen, supplied under hyperbaric condition is therefore more than just nutrition for starved cells. The Marx 20/10 protocol5 used for wound healing provides a short pulse of oxygen lasting 90 minutes in a 24 hour day; and only 5 days a week over four weeks. Such a short time provision of elev ated oxygen could not significantly e ffect wound healing through oxidative cellular respir ation support alone. HBOT is now thought to act in a number of other ways to affect the wound after the HBOT has stopped. Current opinion considers that there are 8 principa l methods in which HBOT is capable of affecting tissue: i) Pressure effects of oxygen ii) Vasoconstrictive effects of oxygen iii) 100% oxygen concentration effects on the diffusion gradient iv) Hyper-oxygenation of ischaemic tissue v) Down regulation of inflammatory cytokines vi) Up-regulation of growth factors 83vii) Leukocyte effects viii) Antibacterial effects. i) Pressure effects of oxygen: The effect of elevating the ambient partial pressure of the inspired gas, usually to 2.4 ATA, is unimportant in wound healing, but quite significant when dealing with the gas bubbl e diseases, decompression sickness and air gas embolism. At elevated pressures the harm ful effects of gas bubbles in the tissue are minimised. Research by Zaroff et al227 on wounds exposed to elevated pressures demonstrated no evidence of an isolated pressure effect. ii) Vasoconstrictive effects of oxygen: The vasoconstrictive e ffects of HBOT can be used effectively to treat patients. HBOT causes a significant reduction of oedema, which has been shown to be beneficial in reperfusion injury, crus h injury, compartment syndrome, burns, wound healing, and failing flaps.228-231 iii) Oxygen diffusion effects: The diffusion of nitroge n out of the tissues in decompression sickness is facilitated by the use of 100% oxygen. In wound healing the beneficial effects of oxygen are primarily related to the c oncentration of oxygen molecules in the tissue, rather than by di ffusion kinetics. Diffusion kinetics may be briefly defined as \"movement of a gas or liq uid from an area of hi gher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\" Diffusion is a result of th e kinetic properties of particles of matter and the particles wi ll mix until they are evenly distributed . However, the rate of oxygen entry into the wound environment is affected by the rate of diffusion from the capillaries. Oedema adversely affects the achievement of high oxygen concentrations in the wound and increases the interc apillary diffusi on distance. As the rate of diffusion is inversely related to the square of the distance, even a small increase in tissue oedema can dramatically slow the rate of oxygen entry into the tissues and thus contri bute to tissue hypoxia. 84iv) Hyper-oxygenation of tissue: The oxygenation of hypoxic tissue is one of the key mechanisms by which HBOT accelerates w ound healing. Numerous studies have shown a dose response curve for the pr ovision of oxygen in the wound healing environment.227,231-236 However, oxygen is a powerful agent and just like other agents, it is possible to give too lit tle or too much. Chronic w ounds are frequently hypoxic and the provision of HBOT corr ects the hypoxia, albeit tempor arily. It then allows for acceleration of the wound hea ling process through processes which continue long after the HBOT session has ended and tissue oxygen le vels have returned to pre-treatment values. Over time the oxygenation of th e chronic wound improves with HBOT. Marx and Johnson demonstrated that for irradiated wounds, HBOT induces neovascularisation, which becomes significant after about 14 treatments and continues for years after the HBOT has ceased.6 A typical chronic wound w ill usually require 20 to 30 HBO treatments. This probably repr esents the amount of neovascularisation needed to sustain wound healing. v/vi) Cytokine down regulation and growth factor up-regulation: Interleukin 1 (IL 1), IL 6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are typical examples of multifunctional cytokines involved in the regulation of the immune response, haematopoiesis, and inflammation. Their functions are widely overlapping but each shows its own characteristic properties. IL 6 was originally identified as a B cell differentiation factor, and thus one of the major functions of IL 6 is antibody induction. As these cytokines are pro-inflammatory, they may contribute to the overall pattern of radiation damage at the local level, but more importantly also have dramatic catabolic effects at both the local and systemic level. Both IL-1 and TNF are known to be pot ent activators of bone resorption, and of catabolism of both hard and soft tissues. 237 A study by Ling et al238 determined the effects of administration of tw o of these cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), on host wasting in rats. The effects were compared 85with those observed in a matched pair-fed group to distinguish the contribution from anorexia. Both TNF and IL-1 produced weight loss, net nitrogen loss, and skeletal muscle catabolism and increased liver weight. Such effects were independent from and additive to those resulting from semistarvation. However, under equivalent nutritional conditions, TNF infusion led to a greater effect on muscle pr otein catabolism and liver weight and caused liver protein anabolism, whereas only the group receiving IL-1 had altered glucose metabolism in the postabsorp tive state. Tachyphylaxis was seen in the response of food intake over time af ter administration of IL-1. These actions define the two principal mechanisms for the development of protein calorie malnutrition that occur because of cytokine action, anorexia producing semistarvation and an increased net protein catabolic rate reducing anabolic efficiency. In patients with Crohn's (IL-1), IL-6, and tumour n ecrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels are diminished during HBOT.239 It follows then that if HBOT can be effective in reducing these cytokines, then it will reduce their pro-inflammatory effect of radiation. HBOT is capable of favourably influencing a number of other cytokines and growth factors important to wound healing. When administered after wounding, HBO up- regulates collagen synthesis thro ugh pro-al(I) mRNA expression.240 In rabbit ear wounds HBOT been shown to up-regulate mRNA for the increased effect over that seen with FGF alone.241 In situations where FGF is ineffective, HBOT can render it highly effective,242 although the effect is different from up-regulation. TN F levels in normal rats become elevated after a single exposure to HBOT.243 For different physiological conditions HBOT may cause up- or down regulation of cytokines. Va scular endothelial gr owth factor (VEGF) is hyperoxia of HBO also up-regulates this factor.244 86The effects of transforming growth f actor (TGF)-beta1 and PDGF-beta are synergistically enhanced by HBOT.224 vii) Leukocyte effects: Oxygen is key to the phagocytosis and killing of bacteria by neutrophils or polymorphonuclear cells (P MNs). This process involves the production of oxygen radicals and superoxides and is directly influenced by the oxygen concentration in the tissue. As the oxygen tension falls below 30 mmHg the efficiency of bacteriocidal action of PMNs begins to drop off dramatically.203,245 This was demonstrated by Knighton et al in 1984 where the phagocytic activity of ne utrophils in ingesting Staph. aureus was compared to oxygen tension.246 PMN-mediated killing of several aerobic Staphylococcus species - is diminished in hypoxia.247 Increasing the concentration of oxygen over ambient level reduces infection.248 When supplemental oxygen was administered during a surgical operation and for 2 hours po stoperatively, inf ection rates dropped by as much as 54%.249 Thus, increasing tissue concentr ations of oxygen has a beneficial effect on the ability of PMNs to comb at bacteria and prevent infection. viii) Antibacterial effects: HBOT has six actions which have been used to combat clinical infection: a) Tissue rendered hypoxic by infection is supported b) Neutrophils are activated a nd rendered more efficient c) Macrophage activity is enhanced d) Bacterial growth is inhibited e) Release of certain bacteria l endotoxins is inhibited 87f) The effect of antibio tics is potentiated a) Support of infect ed hypoxic tissue: Soft tissue and bone in fections are frequently accompanied by localised areas of tissu e hypoxia caused by the inflammatory processes accompanying infection and by subsequent vascular thrombosis.250 As the infected tissue becomes infiltrated with in flammatory cells (PMNs and platelets) the partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) falls.251 In clostridial gas gangrene the production of phospholipase C has been with platelet and neutr ophil aggregation and vascular thrombosis with subsequent hypoxia.250 Administration of HBO can cause the pO2 to increase five-fold in infected tissue.252 b) Neutrophil activation: As tissue pO 2 rises, leukocyte killi ng of bacteria becomes much more efficient. Below a pO 2 of 30 mmHg PMN killing is markedly reduced.253 Because areas of hypoxia accompany serious ti ssue infections, HBOT is an effective means of raising tissue pO 2 to levels at which PMNs can function effectively. By raising tissue pO 2 to levels higher than that achieved by breathing oxygen at ambient pressure, bacterial killing by PMNs is further enhanced.254 Thus, by increasing tissue oxygen tension, a better than 'normal' antibact erial effect can be achieved. Hunt and colleagues have demonstrated that the clear ance of bacteria fr om hypoxic tissue is enhanced by hyperoxic breathing mixtures.255,256 c) Enhancement of macrophage activity: Macrophages, like PM Ns, are affected by tissue oxygen tension. They perform a key role in combating infection by scavenging bacteria and foreign material. Under hypoxic conditions macropha ges are unable to scavenge effectively and produce peroxides.257 Hypoxia also indu ces intracellular adhesion adversely a ffect the response to infection.258 While it is not yet known whether HBOT can enhance macrophage function, it may be needed to bring 88the pO 2 of hypoxic tissue up to normal levels so that macrophage s can function optimally. d) Inhibition of bacterial growth: Anaerobic bacteria are part icularly susceptible to increased concentrations of oxygen.259 The more sensitive the anaerobic organism is to oxygen, the lower the level of superoxide dism utase, an enzyme that allows cells to defend themselves against oxygen free radicals.260 With HBOT large amounts of oxygen free radicals can be generated, ma king anaerobic bacteria particularly susceptible to oxidative killing. HB OT of anaerobic infections caused by Clostridial perfringens has increased patient survival, reduced the need for additional surgery, shortened hospital stay and improved outcome.261 When used appropriately in Fournier's gangrene, a rapidly progressing necrotising infection of the perineum, HBOT has reduced morbidity, extension of necrosis, and systemic toxicity.262 e) Inhibition of endotoxin release: In C. perfringens infections the major source of tissue injury and death is caused by the al pha toxin. Secretion of this toxin is suppressed by HBOT.263,264 In rats exposed to E. coli peritonitis, HBO administration increased survival from 0% to 92%.265 One of the mechanisms by which HBO appears to have worked is by antagonising some of the harmful effects of bacterial endotoxin release. However, to be optimally effective, HBOT must be given early in the course of infection and combined with appropriate surgical debridement and antibiotics.266 f) Potentiation of antibiotics: Both Knighton et al248 and Hunt et al256 have demonstrated that oxygen adds to the eff ectiveness of antibiotic s; the greater the concentration of oxygen, the more pronounced the effect. This has been demonstrated in experimental Staph. aureus osteomyelitis treated with cefazolin.267 In Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections HBOT has an additive eff ect with aminoglycoside antibiotics, reducing morbidity and mortality.268 89In conclusion it can be said that HBOT is a powerful treatment for acute and chronic wounds, acting on injured and healing tissue in a number of ways. Hypoxic tissue, reperfusion injury, compartment syndrome, cr ush injury, failing flaps, chronic wounds, burns and necrotising infections have all been shown to respond favourably to HBO. As we learn more about how HBOT benefits wounds by up-regulating growth factors, down regulating cytokines, reducing oedema, and suppor ting angiogenesis and new tissue ingrowth, the potential benefits to wound healing will become clearer. 2.3.10 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF HYPE RBARIC OXYGEN TREATMENT The adverse effects of HBOT can be thought of in two groups - those related to the effects of pressure on enclosed gas spaces and those related to the toxic effects of oxygen. i) Middle ear barotrauma Middle ear barotrauma is the most common side effect of HBOT with published reports indi cating an incidence of 2-17%. 269 Patients who have head and neck tumour irradiation, especi ally of the oronasopha rynx, have a higher likehood of middle ear equalisation problems due to the inability to carry out the Valsalva manoeuvre used on de scent. In an unconscious pa tient, tympanic membrane rupture would occur before the round or oval windows rupture. Inner ear barotrauma can result in permanent heari ng loss, tinnitus and vertigo. ii) Sinus squeeze is the second most common compli cation of HBOT and causes pain on compression when the openings to various sinuses are blocked, usually associated with an upper respiratory tr act infection or rhinitis.269 Treatment with decongestants can allow the HBO therapy to continue. iii) Air embolism and pneumothorax are very rare complications of HBOT. If they do occur, it is usually in patients with severe pre-existing lung disease. 90iv) Tooth pain (aerodontalgia) can occur during compre ssion or decompression and this typically follows dental treatment that has created an air space under a dental filling. v) Reversible hypermetropia is also observed in some patients under HBOT and is dose related. Its exact mechanism is unknown but it is thought to be due to changes in the shape of the lens. vi) Cataract formation has only been documented in patients receiving in excess of 100 treatments of HBO. 270 vii) Neurological oxygen toxicity lowers seizure thresholds precipitating generalized seizures that are self-limiting once oxygen therapy is ceased and cause no permanent damage. It is a rare complication of HBOT, but is dose related, with a quoted incidence as low as 1.3 per 10,000 HBO treatments.269 viii) Pulmonary oxygen toxicity can occur in patients exposed to 100% oxygen at 1 ATA for prolonged periods. It develops mo re quickly in patients receiving HBOT. Symptoms are not produced in patients exposed to daily treatments within the limits of accepted treatment protocols.211 Symptoms include retrosternal chest discomfort, chest tightness, dyspnoea and cough. These patients may also show significant reversible reductions in their forced vital capacity.271 ix) Decompression sickness as a result of HBOT is hi ghly unlikely in patients unless they are given air for prolonged periods of time under pressure. However, the risk for attendants who breathe chamber air is grea ter. The Royal Adelaide Hospital reported only two cases of decompression sickne ss in chamber attendants from 3,900 HBO treatments between 1895 and 1991.272 The risk of decompression sickness in these subjects was minimized by administering 100 % oxygen to attendants for the ascent to aid in the elimination of nitrogen from their tissues, and by limiting the number of 91dives in the chamber to one a day for each attendant. These safety practices are adopted by most hyperbaric units. x) Fire is by far the most common fatal compli cation of HBOT. Over the last 20 years (with millions of compressions worldwide) there have only been 52 deaths reported, most due to inadequate fire precautions. 273 2.3.11 CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR HYPE RBARIC OXYGEN TREATMENT The contraindications for HBOT, listed in table 4, are extensively discussed by Kindwall271 and no further discussion will be en tered into as they are outside the parameters of this study. When consider ing these contraindicat ions, the potential benefits will obviously need to be wei ghed against the patient's condition and the potential side effects of treatment. The onl y absolute contraindi cation is untreated tension pneumothorax. 92Table 4. Contraindications for HBO Treatment. Absolute Untreated tension pneumothorax Residual mitotic disease in the lung Relative Upper respiratory tract infection Emphysema with carbon dioxide retention Asymptomatic pulmonary lesions seen on chest x-ray History of thoracic or ear surgery Uncontrolled hyperthermia Pregnancy Claustrophobia Seizure disorder 2.3.12 RELATIONSHIP OF HYPERBARI C OXYGEN TO ORAL CANCER Since we know that HBOT induces endotheli al proliferation and angiogenesis, there has been a real concern that it may accel erate the development or growth rate of mitotic cells. The possi bility of tumour cell stimulation has been raised but has never been proven. Well controll ed studies involving animal s and humans with various malignancies, including cancer models, have shown no difference between HBOT and non-HBOT groups with respect to tumour size, metastasis and long term survival. 274-277 The most comprehensive review of this subject was given in a presentation by Professor John Feldmeier, Professor of Onco logy, Medical College of Ohio, USA, at 93the joint European Society for Therapeu tic Radiology and Onco logy and European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine , in Lisbon, in October, 2001,278 which I attended. He listed 73 papers from the literature, dating from 1966 to 2001; including both animal studies and human follow-up studies . He concluded that \"The available published evidence strongly suggest that in termittent HBOT has no enhancing effect on cancer primary or metastatic growth. Like wise, there is no cred ible evidence that HBOT is an initiator or promoter of cancer de novo.\" Professor Feldmeier's final recommendation was \" that patients for whom hyperbaric oxygen treatments are likely to be useful for treatment of radiation inju ries should not have this therapy denied to them because of unsubstantiated fears that hyperbaric oxygen might cause a higher likelihood of tumour recurrence or metastases .\"278 From 1985 to 1991, Robert Marx7 followed 405 patients who ha d been treated for oral squamous cell carcinoma by surgery and radiat ion therapy or radiation therapy alone and found a decreased incidence or recurrence in those patients treated with HBO. The differences were small and only somewhat st atistically significant, but nevertheless indicated no promoti on of mitotic activity. 2.4 LOWER INCISOR TOOTH GROWTH 2.4.1 RATE OF ERUPTION OF RAT LOWER INCISOR TOOTH A review of the literature reveals that th e mean eruption rate of the rat mandibular incisor has been measured by many authors, using a number of tec hniques with a range of results.279 The mean unimpeded eruption rate of the rat mandibular incisor, measured by Law et al,280 using an image analysis t echnique, is reported as 1.0+/-0.1 mm/day. Chiba and Yamaguchi reported the aver age eruption rates of the rat incisor to 94be 0.406 and 0.516 mm/day.281 using radioautographs, measured the thickness of dentine laid dow n per day as 0.015 mm. It is clear that the growth rate of teeth is effected by many factors, including age of animal,280,283 the physical properties of the diet,284 and medications.285 Harari and co-authors 283 reported a mean growth of 0.542+/-49 mm/day in young rats compared to 0.443+/-25 mm/day in mature rats. Burn-Murdoch284 reviewed two groups of rats fed in alternative periods on standard laboratory pellets and in the intervening periods on the same material ground to a powder. In each period, one group was fed pellets and the other powder. The impeded incisors lengthened during the experiment and the lengthening was greater on powder than on pellets. Ranggard 285 reported that even a single low dose of te tracycline (2 mg oxytet racycline per 100 g) caused a disturbance in normal am elogenesis in the rat incisor. 2.4.2 TETRACYCLINE AS A MARK ER OF TOOTH GROWTH Tetracyclines were introduced in 1948 as br oad-spectrum antibiotics that may be used in the treatment of common infections in children and adults.286 The use of low dose tetracycline as a histological bone marker has been well established since the 1960s with papers by Bevelander et al287, Ibsen and Urist288, Faccini289, Frost290, and more recently by Ranggard285, Engstrom291, and Sun et al .292 It was discovered that tetracycline is incorporated into hard tissues calcifying at the time of their administration and subsequently could be studied in undecalcified sections by fluorescence microscopy. 293 This gave researchers a safe tissue marker with which to measure hard tissue formation dynamics micros copically and directly in these tissues more safely and conveniently than was possible with alizarin or heavy metal markers.290 This group of antibiotics ha s the ability to chelate calcium ions and to be 95incorporated into teeth, cartilage and bone.294-298 The affinity for mineralizing tissue is the result of binding to calcium to fo rm a tetracycline-calcium orthophosphate complex.299 The more rapid the rate of minera lization, the more tetracycline is deposited.288 When ultraviolet (UV) light (450 -490 nanometres [nm]) is applied to tetracycline-stained hard tissues, it exhibits a yellow Fuchsin Fluorescence. Fluorochromes are substances that absorb energy in the form of light, which causes electrons to move into hi gher energy shells away from the nucleus. When these electrons return to more stable, lower-ener gy shells the energy is dissipated as both heat and light In epifluorescence microscopy, an excitation filter selectively transmits light at the excitation maximum to strike the fluorochrome and, en route to the eyepiece, a barrier filter blocks this wave length while transmitting as much as possible of the fluorescence emission. Hence tetracyclin e compounds are utili zed in hard tissue research as a vital fluorescent dye for meas uring the rate of ha rd tissue formation. 300-304 The tetracycline tends to remain incorporated into the newly formed hard tissue areas for some time after systemic administration.302 A study by Peli and Oriez305 concluded that tetracycline can be used to conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations of tooth growth in rats. Twenty rats were injected intraperitoneally with tetracyclin e at weight-adjusted doses. Mesio-distal sections of the first mandibular molar regions were prepared and the 60 to 80 \u00b5m sections were examined by fluoromicroscopy using reflected light. Visible lines of fluorescence could be seen in the radicu lar dentin and cementum. Each line corresponded to one in jection. Peli and Oriez305 reported that it was possible to define two periods: the first, from day 22 to day 59, corresponded to the immature tooth; the second, from day 59 to day 101, to the mature tooth. During period 1, the mean speed of radicular lengthening by cement al and dentinal apposition was 8.23 \u00b5m/24h (0.00823mm/24hours). It was with the foregoing Review of Lite rature that the following hypothesis was generated to plan an experimental pr otocol for this thesis in Chapter 3. 97CHAPTER 3 EXPERIMENTAL AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS EXPERIMENTAL AIMS One of the current uses and recommendations193,211,212 for HBOT is to treat the complications associated with radiothe rapy. The HBOT protocols are based on the premise that the tissues must be in a hypoxic state for the treatment to be effective and therefore HBOT is not recommended until at least 6 months after radiation treatment has been completed.2,3,4,8 The mechanism by which HBOT induces angiogenesis and fibroplasia in irradiated tissue has been studied6 and found to be stimulated by a similar oxygen-gradient phenomenon that Knighton, Silv er and Hunt have found to be central in the angiogenesis and fibroplasia of normal wound healing.8,9,183 However, as Marx4,5,6,7 has pointed out, the pathophysiology of irradiated tissue is such that it does not spontaneously revascularise because the wounding pattern is so diffuse that only shallow oxygen gradients are created. Ther efore, the physio-chemical response which identifies an injured area as a wound does not develop and the body, in a sense, does not recognize the radiation injury as a wound. 80 Once the \"three H\" (Hypocellular/Hypovascular/Hypoxic) state has been reached by the irradiated tissues, many of the specialized tissues contained wi thin the area of irradiation, such as salivary gland, have fibrosed, with little chance of recovery. The patients develop complications, such as dry mouth, diffi culty in chewing and swallowing, and progressive dental caries; in the long-term these symp toms greatly decrease the patient's quality of life.1,2,3 So, while it is commendable that current HBOT protocols are able to treat the more serious co mplications of radiotherapy, such as 98osteoradionecrosis, it would be far better if the complications could be reduced or prevented. It is becoming increasingly apparent that HBOT is a powerful treatment for acute and chronic wounds, acting on injured and healing tissue, not just as a mere nutrient in support of its roll in oxidative cellular re spiration, but in a nu mber of other ways. 226 Hypoxic tissue, reperfusion injury, compartm ent syndrome, crush injury, failing flaps, chronic wounds, burns and necrotizing inf ections all respond favourably to HBOT. This role of oxygen in wound h ealing is understood to be by such mechanisms as: by up-regulating growth factor s, down regulating cytokine s, reducing oedema, and supporting angiogenesis a nd new tissue ingrowth.226 The nature of this interaction between tissue factors and HBO was initially pointed out by Bonomo et al193 who reported a statistically significant rise in th e production of PDGF receptor protein I in ischemic wounds that were treated simulta neously with both HBOT and PDGF. This finding leads strong support to the concept th at HBO functions as an intracellular signalling transducer and thus is a modulator of gene f unction; not just as a mere supporter of oxidative cellular respiration. As part of the preparation in undertaking th e research project I discussed the proposed work and personally met with the many lead ers in the fields of hyperbaric medicine and chronic wound healing and th ese are listed in Appendix 3. In addition I attended: 1. The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medica l Society, in Stockholm, in 2000. 2. The European Society for Therapeuti c Radiology and Oncology and European Committee for Hyperbaric Me dicine in Lisbon in 2001. 99HYPOTHESIS The aim of this study is to te st the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications or morbidity of TRT when HBOT is given a week after completion of TRT. Although dur ing the six months following radiation treatment the hypoxic gradient between normal tissue and irradiated tissue may not be sufficient to stimulate angiogenesis and fibr oplasia, other mechanis ms of HBOT, found in the treatment of wounds, may prove effect ive in treating the acute tissue damage of radiotherapy. It is hypothesized that givi ng 20 intermittent daily HBOT, beginning one week after completion of TRT, will enhance cell survival, particularly specialized cells such as salivary glands, and therefore reduce the long-term side effects of radiotherapy. This project provides an extensive descript ion of the histological process and also proposes a hypothesis for the molecular events that are taking place. 100CHAPTER 4 MATERIALS AN D METHODS 4.1 PROPOSED ANIMAL MODEL Pilot Study One animal was used as a pilot study. The pur pose of this study was to ensure that the animal could undergo the proposed experiment al procedures without undue stress and to ensure that all experimental equipmen t functioned under the parameters of the proposed experiment. This animal underwent 9 sessions of TRT over 21 days with the animal being anaesthetised during irradiat ion. This was followed by 20 intermittent daily HBOT sessions, started one week after completion of TRT. It was then sacrificed and the mandibular tissues removed for histol ogical analysis. A nu mber of histological stains with Hemat oxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Luxol Fast Blue / Cresyl Fast Violet (LFB). As no problems were enc ountered the main study was then commenced. Main Study For the purpose of this resear ch project, the Animal Hous e at Royal Perth Hospital supplied and supervised the we ll being of thirty male Wi star rats (250 - 300gm). The rats were held in a 12 hour li ght-dark cycle environment at 22 oC + 2oC. All experimental surgical procedures were carried out under licen ce from the Animal Ethics Committees of Royal Perth Hospital an d The University of Western Australia in accordance with National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia guidelines. 101Animal Identification for Tracking Group 1 (Control) Rats had no markings and were numbered 1-6 on their tails. Group 2 (HBOT) Rats had a notch, shown with ' V', placed in the most superior edge of the ear rim and were numbered 1-6 on their tails. Group 3 (R x) Rats had a notch placed in the most lateral edge of the ear rim and were numbered 1-8 on their tails. Group 4 (R x+HBOT) Rats had a notch placed in th e most inferior edge of the ear rim and were numbered 1-10 on their tails. Colour Identification of data As a ready reference for data analysis, e ach group of rats was assigned a colour, displayed below, which will be used throughout this dissertati on in tables and graphs to aid identificati on of rat groups. The rats were divided into four groups:- 1. Air Breathing Control Group (Control) - no treatment (6 rats). 2. Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Only Group (HBOT) - (6 rats). 3. Radiation Treatment Only Group (R x) - (8 rats). 4. Radiation Treatment plus Hy perbaric Oxygen Treatment Group (R x+HBOT) - (10 rats). 1024.2 TIME FRAME FOR PROJECT Experimental time table: The experiment ran for 253 days (36 weeks). Day One was nominated as the first day of radiati on treatment. The experimental time table was to be made up of:- a) 3 weeks of radiotherapy for Groups 3 and 4. b) 1 week recovery time for animals. c) 4 weeks of HBOT for Groups 2 and 4. d) Two animals from each group were then sacrificed at 85 days, 141 days and 253 days. 1. Radiation Treatment. Day 1 to Day 15. Nine sessi ons were planned, but only seven sessions were completed as some rats had started to suffer and three rats were put down. This resulted in an adjustme nt to the time table with time frame for Radiation Treatment being 15 days only an d three rats being lost early in the experiment. These rats were put down as th ey did not appear to be coping with the radiation treatment as they started to loos e condition and lost in terest in eating and it was therefore decided not to a llow them to suffer any longer. 2. Rest Period. Day 16 to Day 21. Animals were given one week of recovery time. 3. HBOT. Day 22 to Day 47. Twenty sessions were carried out. All animals coped well with the HBO treatment, incl uding the changes in pressure. 4. Tetracycline Bone Marker. Three treatments of 5mg/ra t/day of Alamycin were administered as an Intraperitoneal (IP ) dose every four weeks, beginning on Day 22. Tetracycline was administered on th e following days: Day 22 to Day 25, Day 10350 to Day 52, Day 78 to Day 80, Day 106 to Day 108, Day 134 to 136, Day 162 to Day 164, Day 190 to 192, Day 218 to Day 220, Day 246 to 248. 5. Sacrifice of Animals . - With only 3 sacrifice days (SD) (Day 85, Day 141 and Day 253) and Groups 1 and 2 only having 6 animals, it was difficult to formalise an order for sacrifice, so animals were sel ected propter hoc, in a random pattern, with selection being out in conj unction with consideration being given to the overall animal welfare. This then precluded the animal from further suffering and also minimised the loss of animals during the experimental time frame. Over the period of the experiment, some of the anim als from Group 3 and Group 4, which had received radiation, lost condition to th e point where it was considered in the interest of the animal's welfare to sacrifi ce them earlier than the time table dictated. from these animals was included in the study with their sacrifice date (SD) taken into cons ideration within the experimental time table. Table 4 shows the sacrifice schedul e for all groups of ra ts, including those animals sacrificed earlier than expected a nd those that were sacrificed according to the experimental timetab le at Days 85, 141 and 253. 6. Number of Animals. - The number of animals in th is study was restricted due limitations placed by the Animal Ethics Committee of Royal Perth Hospital. In addition, although the lower jaw of each animal was divided into two specimens, only one half of each jaw was submitted for histological analysis due to restrictions placed by the laboratory at the Dept. of Anatomy and Human Biology, UWA. 104Table 5.

The dosage and route of administration of the Nembutal were taken from the recommendation of the Office of Animal Research Services 306 and confirmed in a personal communication with Professor Le n Cullen, Division of Veterinary & Biomedical Sciences, Murdoch University, Western Australia. Initially the rats were given 0.22ml Nembutal Intra- Peritoneal (IP) for the firs t three Radiation Treatment days (Day 1, 3, 5). It was observed that the rats were becoming anaesthetized more 105quickly and taking longer to r ecover. Therefore, it was de cided to reduce the dosage of Nembutal progressively, according to the c ondition of the animals, and continue to give it IP for the remainder of the radiation phase. Anaesthetic Controls - One rat from each of Groups 1 and 2 were used as anaesthetic controls as they had not undergone any radi ation treatment. They were given the same dosage of Nembutal as the irradiated Groups 3 and 4, to ascertain any differences in anaesthetic response between the ir radiated and non irradiated groups. Sacrifice of Animals - When it was necessary to sacrific e the animals, they were given an IP overdose of Pentobarbitone (50mg/kg bodyweight). 306 4.4 RADIATION TREATMENT Fractionation of radiation dosage, over a period of time, has been used as the traditional approach for use of radiotherapy in treatment of cancer.104-110 As one of the basic parameters of this research is to si mulate a therapeutic c ourse of radiotherapy, 18 rats, of the 30 Wistar rats used in this study, underwent a therapeutic course of radiation, similar to that used in cancer treatm ent in humans. Moulder et al307 has shown the applicability of animal data to cancer therapy in humans, thereby allowing the data from this experiment to be ex trapolated to the human condition. Peterson et al136 showed that as little as 20Gy will eff ect salivary gland function and that if the parotid glands are in a field which receive d 40Gy or over, permanent dysfunction of the salivary glands can be expected. Engstrom et al308 reported on the effect of local irradiation on longitudinal bone growth in the rat and used tetracycline as a bone growth marker. The following parameters fo r therapeutic radiation in the rat model for this study were therefore based on th e previous work of these authors.136,307-309 A 250 106kVp machine with a half valu e layer of 0.5cm Cu was used to deliver a dose rate of 1.30 Gy/min (Fig 5). The use of this machine was kindly offered for this experiment by Dr Thomas Tuchyma, Physicist from the Medical Technology & Physics Dept, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH). The radiation course was given to the experimental animals by the author. The therapeutic course of radiation was initially planned to be carried out 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a total of 9 fractions. 109,110 The daily dose was 6 Gy, initially planning a total dose of 54 Gy.308,309 When undergoing radiation treatment the rats were anaesthetized using a graduated dose of sodium pentobarbitone. A lead shield with a one centimetre hole was used to confine the area of irradiation to the ri ght side of the lower jaw of ea ch rat. The rats were given 48 hours to recover from each radiation dose before being retreate d, being treated on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week for the 3 weeks, thereby also allowing 72 hours for recovery over each weekend. Towa rds the end of the course of radiation treatment, two rats became quite ill and it wa s decided to put down these two rats and cease the radiation treatment at 7 treatments. This gave a total dose of 42 Gy, which fell within acceptable limits to be consid ered a therapeutic course of radiation.134,307-309 The scatter dose of radiation was measured using a Farmer 2670 Radiation Sensitivity Meter (Fig 6.) and the sensitivity probes were placed at two positions. Position A measured the scatter dose immediately above the craniu m of the anaesth etized animal and Position B measured the scatter dose immediately above the hind legs of the animals. The dose due to scatter at position A (which was the one nearer to the main beam) was 1.85 mGy/min. This was 8.63 mGy fo r the duration of the irradiation (4 minutes 40 seconds). This was 0.14% of the 6 Gy radiation that the rat was receiving (for the same time). For position B (the position that was closer to the hind legs of the rat), the dose value was 0.18 mG y / min, and this was 0.85 mG y for the duration of the 107irradiation. This was 0.014% of the 6 Gy radi ation that the rat was receiving (for the same time). This therefore showed that the scatter dose of radiation outside the primary target zone was not clinically significant. Fig. 5 Anaesthetised rat dur ing radiation treatment. Fig 6. Farmer 2670 Radiation Sensitivity Meter. 108Radiotherapy Machine - The machine supplied by Dr Tuchyma, Physicist from the Medical Technology & Physics Dept, Sir Ch arles Gairdner Hospita l (SCGH) was the only one available in Western Australia for us e in animal experimental research. This machine has the following technical specification: 250 kVp Siemens Stabilipan Or thovoltage Therapy machine Machine Make - Siemens Machine Model - Stabilipan DXRT Distance from source to animal skin surface - 25 cm. kVp - 250 mA - 10 Filter - half value layer of 0.5cm Copper Measured Dose Rate - 1.30 Prescribed dose - 6.0 Gy Time to achieve dose - 4 min 37 secs Contact was made with several Radiotherapy Units in Perth that were used to treat human subjects for cancer to see if it was possible to have access for this research study. All units were very busy and the problem of mixing an imals with human subjects proved too difficult to overcome. It was therefore decided to accept the offer of Dr Tuchyma to use the 250 kVp machine which was in good working order and had been used in the treatment of human subj ects until the machine was recently retired. All radiotherapy sessions were conducted by A/Prof Williamson. Dr Tuchyma granted access to the Radiotherapy Unit and gave the initi al instruction in its use, including all safety requirements. 1094.5 HYPERBARIC OXYGEN TREATMENT One week post radiotherapy, to allow recove ry time for the experimental animals, Groups 2 and 4 of the rats underwent 20 intermittent daily HBOT, over 4 weeks, similar to that used by Marx5,6 to treat human subjects wi th osteoradionecrosis. This treatment course was carried out in a sp ecially built HBOT chamber, supplied by the Royal Australian Navy, for experimental HBO treatment for small animals (Fig 7&8). The course involved the rats undergoing 20 tr eatments of HBO. A hyperbaric treatment is defined as breathing 100% oxygen for 90 minutes at 2.4 ATA.5,6 A HBOT, also called a Dive as this the terminology aros e from diving medicine for treatment of Caisson Disease (Decompression Sickness or the Bends), consists of: 1. Compression (Descent time) - 15-20 minutes. 2. Time at pressure (Bottom time) - 90 minutes of HBO under 2.4 ATA pressure. 3. Decompression (Ascent time) - 15-20 minutes. Descent and ascent times allow pressure equalization within the sinus cavities and ear drums. The HBOT regime followed the treatm ent protocol used for treatment of first stage osteoradionecrosis with the animals be ing treated 5 days a week from Monday to Friday, with no treatments on Saturday and Sunday for four weeks. Marx, 6,10,11 who developed these dive profiles for the treatment of osteorad ionecrosis, has shown that exceeding the chamber pressure above 2.4 ATA and giving longer periods of HBO may increase the possibility of oxygen toxicity. Marx uses a so called 20/10 HBOT protocol for treatment of stage I osteoradio necrosis. As discussed earlier in Figure 4, Marx 7 has shown that the vascular density (a measure of oxygen saturation) of hypoxic tissues begins to rise after eight treatments of HBO. At eighteen to twenty treatments, the vascular density plateaus out and does not change. The 20/10 pr otocol is designed to give twenty treatments to stimulate angiogenesis and fibr oblast differentiation before a surgical procedure and then ten treatments post- operatively to aid new blood 110vessel growth in the surgically healing tissu es. As the animals in this experiment did not have a surgical procedure and theref ore did not need post operative HBOT, only twenty treatments were give n to initiate a wound healing response, as suggested by Davidson and Mustoe.226 Fig 7. HBO chamber used fo r animal experiments. 111 Fig 8. Animal cage being placed in HBOT chamber. 4.6 TETRACYLCLINE The use of low dose Tetracycline as a histological hard tissue marker has been well established and allows clear evidence of c ontinued hard tissue growth in experimental animals. 285-290 A veterinarian-approved tetracycline was administered to all rats as a marker of tooth growth. The tetracycline is taken up by growing teeth and can be seen histologically as bands of gr owth, like growth rings in a tree section. Tetracycline is available, as a Veterinary Approved Dr ug (Alamycin), in vials of 200mg/ml for Intravenous/Intramuscular/Intraperitoneal use in Australia and was used in this study. Oral tetracycline is very poor ly absorbed (only 2% bei ng absorbed) and dose depends on the amount of water an animal is drinking and therefore was not us ed in this study. Three treatments of 5mg/rat/day (20mg/kg)290 of Alamycin (oxytetracycline) were administered as an IP dose every four w eeks, beginning on Day 22, the same day as HBOT commenced, and continued for the le ngth of the experiment. The dosage of 11220mg/kg of tetracycline for animal use has been reported by Frost290 and confirmed in a personal communication with Professor Len Cullen, Di vision of Veterinary & Biomedical Sciences, Murdoch Universit y, Western Australia. This was most effectively given as an IP dose as correct dosage could be assured and there was minimal effect on the animal's intestinal flora. 4.7 SOFT DIET It became apparent during the second week of the experiment that the animals were developing sore mouths as a result of the ra diation treatment. This was exhibited by a reduced ability to chew thei r normal pellet diet. Therefore, Groups 3 and 4, (the two irradiated groups), were given a supplemental soft diet that consisted of Osmolite. This is an isotonic, low-residue liquid food, for s upplemental or total nutrition. It is useful for tube-feeding patients sensitive to hyper-osm olar feeds. Because of its mild taste, it is also appropriate as an oral feed for patients experiencing altered taste perception. Osmolite provides a complete and balanced nu trition as an isotonic formula with an osmolarity of 300mOsm/kg H 2O. It is not for parental use. See Appendix 5 for nutritional breakdown. Dates given as dietary supplem ent to group 3 and 4 only. Day 15 to Day 29 , Day 82 to Day 90 , Day 100 to Day 116 , Day 124 to Day 130. Group 5 : Six rats that were not involved in the experiment were placed on an Osmolite Diet to assess any long term effects of a liquid diet. These rats remained on the Osmolite diet from Day 194 to Day 249, a to tal of 55 days. Weekly weight changes were recorded. 1134.8 CLINICAL DATA COLLECTION a) WEIGHT CHANGE All animals in this research project were weighed on a weekly basis for the total time of the experiment (see Appendix 6). b) CLINICAL CONDITION All animals were critically examined on a w eekly basis for total time of the experiment and given a numerical rating of their clinical condition (see Appendix 6). The numerical rating was numbered from 1 to 10 and was based on a clinical assessment which included: i) Weight ii) Condition of the animal's coat iii) Condition of the animal's mouth The Numerical Clinical Condition Rating may be seen in Table 6. Table 6. Numerical Clinical Condition Rating. NUMBER RATING CLINICAL CONDITION 10 Excellent 9 Very Good 8 Good 7 Wet 6 Wet/Dirty 5 Very Dirty 4 Bad 3 Very Bad, consider euthanasia 2 Very Bad, euthanasia 1 Dead 1144.9 HISTOLOGICAL TISSUE COLLEC TION AND PREPARATION a) MANDIBLE At necropsy, the mandibles were resected en bloc, then hemi-sected through the fibrous symphysis, and the lower incisor te eth removed. The specimens were then put into separate specimen pots, with appropriate labelling of left or right and animal group and number; and fixed for 1 week in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The specimens were processed by the School of Anat omy and Human Biology Laboratory, The University of Western Australia. Followi ng fixation, the specimens were rinsed in distilled water and decalcified with 4% Et hylenediaminetetra-acetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) (pH 7.4), at which time the specimens were continuously dehydrated through an ascending ethanol series and paraffin embedded. Each hemi-mandible was trimmed and placed into a labelled mould and fille d with paraffin wax. The wax blocks were removed from their moulds and trimmed down to a size suitable for sectioning. Consecutively numbered serial sagittal sections (5 \u00b5m thick) were cut through the full thickness of each specimen. Slides of every series were then stained with Harris' Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The H&E s ections of each group were used to determine the general morphology of the tissues for standard histolog ical description of basic tissues which included salivary gland, bone, muscle , blood vessels and nerves. Two slides of consecutive tissue sli ces from each specimen group, which best represented each tissue type, were selected for specific analysis. One of the slides had been stained with H&E and a second consecuti ve slice of tissue wa s stained with Luxol Fast Blue / Cresyl Fast Violet (LFB). The LFB was particularly useful in demonstrating the presence of salivary gland tis sue, especially in those sections where the salivary tissue was undergoi ng radiation fibrosis and wa s very difficult to see in H&E sections. Coronal sections of the angl e of the mandible were selected for slide 115analysis.

Mandibular Artery iv. Mandibular Nerve v. Masseter and Internal Pterygoid Muscles Details of Processing Sche dule for Rat Hemi-mandibles 1. Rat Hemi-mandibles were placed in Ne utral Buffered Formalin (pH 7, supplier Amber Scientific) for approximately 1 week. 2. Samples were rinsed in saline x2 changes 30 mins each prior to the decalcification step. 3. 4% Ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid di sodium salt (EDTA) was used as the decalcification agent. As immunohistochemistry was proposed to be studied this was the choice of decalcifying agent. 4. Samples were placed in labelled containe rs onto a rocker (agitator) to allow for better penetration of the ED TA into the bone. After one week the samples were tested for completion of decalcificati on. The decalcification test was done by using a Neuro Vas machine, C Arm image intensifier, series 9800, if any calcium was detected the samples were placed into fresh EDTA for further decalcification. The total time taken was approximately 4 weeks until the end point was reached. 5. The samples were subsequently trim med to size for the \"mega\" cassettes (Tissue-Tek biopsy cassettes dimensions ar e the same as regular cassettes but the \"mega\" cassettes are twice as deep & accommodate larger samples). 1166. Manual dehydration processing commenced on Friday afternoon in 70% EtOH with 30% Normal Saline using the rocker for agitation. 7. Friday 4pm 70% EtOH (+ normal saline) 8. 4pm Absolute EtOH 11.

Friday 9am samples were removed from automatic processo r and placed into vacuum embedder for 30 minutes. 14. Shandon Histocentre 2 was used to embe d specimens into individually made cardboard moulds and orientat ed posteriorly with the di stal surface of the jaw to be cut first. 15. Initially the blocks were trimmed with a Leica disposable blade until the point where teeth were exposed. 5 \u00b5m sections were cut using a Leica RM 2135 rotary microtome. 16. Subsequent sectioning of the block comp rised of taking 5 sections per level. Each level was 100 \u00b5m apart. Sectioning continued unt il very little of the tissue remained resulting in 15 levels being taken for each block. 11717. Sections were collected from a Rate k Instruments Waterbath onto Menzel- Glaser Superfrost Plus slides. 18. Slides were allowed to dry overnight in a 45 \u00baC oven. 19. The first slide for each level was stained with H & E (see Appendix 7). 20. The second slide from selected levels (depending on H&E analysis) was stained with LFB (see Appendix 8). 21. Slides were then microscopically exam ined and imaged as necessary using a Leica DMR microscope with a Nikon digital camera. Photography and transfer to electronic format Both H&E and Luxol Fast Blue stained slides were examined, photographed and transferred to electronic format for an alysis using the facilities of the Image Acquisition and Analysis Facility, Sc hool of Anatomy and Human Biology. The images were acquired on the new Nikon 90i microscope, using the Nikon DXM1200F using the ACT-1 capturing software. After im age acquisition, the files were analysed by Metamorph Imaging 6.0 Software System by the IAAF and used to carry out both histomorphological analysis and histomorpho metric quantification of the images. b) TOOTH PREPARATION The two lower central incisor teeth from each animal were removed and placed in formalin. The teeth were prepared by the Sc hool of Geographical and Earth Sciences at The University of Western Australia using the following procedure: 1. The teeth were dried overnight in an oven at 400C. 2. Each tooth was set in a plastic block us ing Epo-Tech 301 resin and allowed to set overnight at 400C. The Epo-Tech 301 is a two com ponent epoxy adhesive with a very low viscosity and is spectrally transparent. It is primarily designed for optical filters 118but has many instrument and geological uses as it adheres to many different types of substrates such as glass, quartz, metals, mo st plastics and plastic fibre optics. A similar technique of using methylme thacrylate to embed bone samples has been reported by Erben.310 3. Each tooth was then ground down to half its longitudi nal thickness using 600 grit Carborundum. 4. Each remaining half tooth was then glued to a glass slide using Epo-Tech 301 resin. 5. Each half tooth, glued to the glass slide, was then furt her reduced in thickness using a diamond bladed rock saw. 6. The tooth slices were then ground down to approximately 40 \u00b5m thickness using 600 grit Carborundum. 7. The tooth slices were then polished on 3 grades of polishing cloths (KPM, MSF, +MRE) (KPM, MSF and MRE are the manufac turing companies designations for the polishing cloth types), using 3 gr ades of diamond paste (6.1 + 0.25 \u00b5m diamond paste). (The KPM cloth is a sprayed on hard flock cloth used with 6 \u00b5m diamond paste for 10 minutes, the MSF is a fine woven silk cloth used with 1 \u00b5m diamond paste for 20 minutes, and the MRE is a soft velvet type of cloth used with 0.25 \u00b5m diamond paste for 5 minutes to finish. All stages also us e Kemet brand Type W wa ter based lubricant, which contains glycol). 8. The polishing removes approximately 10 \u00b5m leaving the tooth slices 30 \u00b5m thick and glued to the glass slides. 9. Magnification of teeth - Images of the teeth were taken with a x2.5 objective. To that is added x10 Magnification (built in th e microscope). Then x0.7 adaptor was used with the Nikon Camera. Therefore the magnifi cation of all the teet h images are - 2.5 x 10 x 0.7 = 17.5 (Magnification). 11910. The mounted tooth sections were view ed at 17.5 magnification using fluorescence microscopy with a narrow band, blue-light filter block (450-490 nanometres [nm]). The fluorescent labelled slides were ex amined, photographed and transferred to electronic format for analysis using the faci lities of the Image Ac quisition and Analysis Facility, School of An atomy and Human Biology. 4.10 ANALYSIS OF DATA TEETH Analysis With the generous assistance of Guy Ben-Ary, and using the facilities of the IAAF and an Image Pro Plus 4.0, the digital images were examined and the following measurements made: i) The distance between tetracycline grow th bands, to determine the growth in 25 days; the time between tetracycline dosages . This measured the growth of tooth structure when the rat was not receiving tetracycline. ii) The width of each band was also measured to determine the growth over 3 days when the rat was being given the tetracycline. Statistical Analysis. The mean distance between the bands was calculated. Two sample t-tests, assuming equal variance were done to compare the means of group 1 and 2 and the means of group 3 and 4. An value of 0.05 was set to determine if the P values were significant. Kolmogorov-Sm irnov and Shapiro-Wilks statistics were carried out to assess the normality of distribution of all variables. All were normally distributed with signi ficance levels > 0.05\". DECALCIFIED TISSUES a) SALIVARY GLAND The salivary glands would seem to be one of the tissues most sensitive to radiotherapy. Therapeutic Radiation Treatment for cancers of the head and neck irreversibly 120damages the salivary glands. Radiation doses as low as 20 Gy will result in clinically noticeable changes such as sparse thick ropy saliva and doses over 40 Gy will result in permanent dysfunction of the salivary glands. 136 Xerostomia develops within the first week of therapy and is progressive, with deva stating effects on the qua lity of life of the individual. The animals in this study were given 42 Gy and therefore histological analysis should demonstrate these changes in the salivary gland tissue. When the acinar cells are destroyed they are replaced by ductal remnants with loose connective tissue which is moderately infiltrated with lym phocytes and plasma cells. With time, the fibrosis and destruction of glandular arch itecture make the iden tification of salivary gland tissue difficult using traditional H & E stain. LFB was found to be particularly useful in demonstrating the presence of salivary gland tissue, even when it was difficult to see the remnant tissue under H & E. Consecutive histological tissue slices were thus used and stained one with H & E a nd the next with LFB. Slide sections were selected upon the basis of the best repr esentation of the sa livary gland tissue. Analysis of Gland Tissue Initial analysis of the salivary gland tissu e began with a compre hensive histological description of the slide which best represented the salivary gland tissue from each rat specimen (see Appendix 9). The salivary gla nd tissue in this study was examined under a light microscope at 100 and 200 X magnifi cation and the number of (individual serous and mucous acini we re counted and then added together since submandibular glands are a mixture of both types). A number of methods are available for estimating the rela tive areas of profiles visible on a section. Morphology or Stereology allows quantitativ e data such as number, volume, surface area, and thickness of histologi cal structures to be assess ed from two-dimensional light and electron microscopic sections or images. 121Multipurpose Test System This study employed a point-counting techni que called the Multipurpose Test System, which is based on the stereological principl es originally described by Weibel and Gomez311 in 1962 and further outlined in reviews by Bolender and Weibel312 in 1973, Weibel313,314 in 1979, Meyer and McGeachie315 in 1988, Snedecor316 in 1989 and Chagnac et al317 in 1999. The Multipurpose Test Syst em stands as a tried and true technique for analysis of quantitative data such as the number of salivary gland acini.A multipurpose test system, which combines ar ea, points and lines (Fig 9), was used since it enabled a variety of tissue elements to be counted with in one test system. Figure 9 shows the template, a clear cellulose acetate sheet, used in this test system. The square area contains 21 lines of constant length nominated as 'Z', which are arranged on seven equidistant and parallel rows, whereby the distance between the end-points of the lines is 'Z' in every direc tion. The ends of each of these 21 lines are known as 'end-points,' making the 'Test Point Number' (P T) 42, in this study. For point counting, the end points of the test lines are used as ma rkers. The test system is enclosed in a square frame whose sides m easure 6 Z x 6.06 Z; it encloses an area which corresponds to P T = 42 area values of the test points. This frame defines the 'Test Area' (A T), for counting the number of end-poi nts used for determination of the number of structures in the unit area. The short-line multipurpose test system template was overlaid onto the digitally displayed histological section of a computer screen. The tissue element that aligned with each end-point (marker) was id entified and listed in a MS Excel TM Spreadsheet. Each slide would therefore lis t 42 tissue elements for that section. This allowed direct counting of tissue elements which included se rous and mucous acini, connective tissue, salivary gland ducts, blood vessels, nerves an d miscellaneous tissue. The number of 122serous and mucous acini were then added together to obtain the total number of salivary gland acini in each tissue secti on. In addition the proportion of connective tissue per histological section could also be measured by counting the number of connective tissue elements that corresponded to the end-points and including them in the MS ExcelTM Spreadsheet. Fig 9. Multipurpose Test System Template. 123b) BONE When viewing healthy bone under the light mi croscope, osteoblasts will occupy almost all lacunae. Some lacunae may appear to be empty and this may be due to the angle of the section, whereby the section passes th rough the edge of the lacunae and doesn't include part of the osteoblast; or there ma y have been recent loss of the osteoblast through normal cellular turnover.318-320 In this study, bone hea lth was determined by calculating the percentage of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts. This was carried out using the 'test area' of the Multipurpose Te st Cellulose Acetate Template. The short- line multipurpose test system template was overlaid onto the digitally displayed histological section of a co mputer screen which contai ned the maximum density of lacunae. In this case the 42 test points were not used. The bone in this study was examined under a light microscope at 100 and 200 X magnification and all lacunae and osteoblasts contained within the 'test area ' were counted and then expressed as a percentage in a MS Excel TM Spreadsheet. c) ARTERIES With time, the arteries within an area of irradiation undergo progr essive endarteritis obliterans as described by Marx in his three \"H\" principle4. Histologically the arterial walls are seen to progressively thicken with the lumen becoming narrower. The tissue collected in the study was taken from the angl e of the mandible so as to include the Inferior Alveolar Artery in the samples. The Inferior Alveolar Artery will naturally vary in its thickness and size according to individual variations of the animals and direct measurements of the arterial walls wi ll not represent the true extent of changes due to the radiotherapy. Ther efore, in this st udy, the ratio of ar tery wall diameter divided by wall thickness was determined as a m easure of the extent of endarteritis and listed in a MS Excel TM Spreadsheet. 124d) NERVES Neural tissue is one of the most radioresistant tissues in mammalian physiology and should show the least amount of histological change.4-7 The tissues collected in the study were taken from the angle of the mandibl e so as to include the Inferior Alveolar Nerve in the samples. Histological slides were scanned and the largest diameter nerve from each animal was measured and listed in a MS Excel TM Spreadsheet. 4.11 STATISTICAL METHODS Data were entered in MS ExcelTM Spreadsheets and data analysis was done using SPSS (Version 12). Statistical significance tes ting when comparing means between groups was done using the t-test for independent samples when two groups were compared and analysis of variance (ANOVA) where more than two groups were compared. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks statis tics were carried out to assess the normality of distribution of all variable s. All were normally distributed with significance levels > 0.05\". Si gnificance levels were set at the 95% level (p< 0.05). All graphs were generated from the MS ExcelTM Spreadsheets. The graphs which are presented from Figures 19 onwards have variation bars that indicate standard deviations. Tables have been included in Ap pendix 4 which shows the mean and standard deviation values for each group for each variable. 125CHAPTER 5 RESULTS 5.1 ANAESTHESIA 5.1.1 Dosage of anaesthesia Initially the rats were give n 0.22ml (40mg/kg) Nembutal IP for the first three Radiation Treatment days (Day 1, 3, 5). It was ob served that the rats were becoming anaesthetized more quickly and taking longer to recover. It was therefore decided to reduce the dosage of Nembutal to 0.20ml and continue to give it IP on the fourth treatment day (Day 8). Again it was noted that the rats, when given 0.20ml of Nembutal, anesthetized very quickly and took longer to recover. The rats were then given 0.18ml of Nembutal IP on the fifth a nd sixth treatment days (Day 10 & 12). The animals anaesthetized very quickly and were very deep but arous ed quickly. All rats dehydrated, some more than others. The ra ts showing any signs of dehydration were given 4 mL of subcuticular injection of De xtrose/Saline. On the seventh treatment day (Day 15), the dose of Nembutal was reduced to 0.12ml for most of the rats. All rats had lost much of their condition. Rats G#3/5 a nd G#3/7; and G#4/7 and G#4/10 were given 0.10ml Nembutal as they were considered to be in the worst condition. Most rats became further dehydrated so radiation treat ment was suspended at seven treatments (Day 15), which gave a total dose of 42 Gy. This dosage was considered to be within the range of radiation treatment protocol as doses as low as 20 Gy will result in clinically noticeable changes such as sparse thick ropy sa liva. Rat 3#7 was put down overnight on Day 16 by one of the Animal Carers, who felt that the animal was becoming too distressed. On Day 20, Ra t G4#3, and on Day 21 Rat G4#10 had died overnight. A macroscopic autopsy was undert aken on these three animals and they were all found to have only air in the entire Gastrointestinal Tract, from the stomach through to small and large intestines. The intestines were infl amed with no food or 126macroscopic gut flora visible. The liver was pale and mottled looking and the lungs were congested with haemorrhagic patches. These three animals had obviously become distressed and stopped eating. As stated, as the irradiation phase progresse d, it was noted that in the irradiated rats that a lower dose of Nembutal could be used to achieve a su itable level of anaesthesia. The reduction in Nembutal dosage of 0.22 ml down to 0.10ml represents a 55% reduction in dose of drug to achieve the sa me level of anaesthesia. This finding does not reflect the norm in drug administration where the level of dosage to achieve a clinical effect does not cha nge or where there is the de velopment of tolerance to Barbiturates such as Nembutal. Drug tolera nce can be defined as a progressively diminished response to a drug with recurrent exposure. 321 Development of tolerance to drugs that depress the central nervous syst em, such as Barbiturates like Nembutal, is not uncommon.290 However, in a study carried out by Setlock et al322 in 1996, using Propofol, an alternate sedative/ hypnotic drug, used for anaest hesia, it was shown that 'tolerance to an induction dose of Propofol did not develop in children receiving Propofol for high-voltage radiation therapy .\" The young children in this study underwent deep sedation to facilitate daily high-voltage radiation therapy for several weeks. As the reduced dose effect in this study di d not follow the accepted norm in repeated anaesthetic dosages, it was decided to take one rat from each of Group 1 (Control) and Group 2 (HBOT) to use as anaesthetic contro ls to investigate th e repeated use of Nembutal in rats that had not been irradiat ed. These two rats were anaesthetized over seven sessions, using the same dosage of Nembutal (Pentobarbitone 40mg/Kg), 307 IP, as was used for the rats in Groups 3 (R x) and 4 (R x+HBOT), during the irradiation 127phase These anaesthetic control rats were weighed each day and their condition clinically assessed. The drug dose required to achieve the same level of anaesthesia as for Groups 3 (R x) and 4 (R x+HBOT) during the irradia tion phase, was noted. A comparison of the dosage of Nembutal ve rses time between the irradiated group (Groups 3 & 4) and non irradiated control group (Group 1 & 2) is shown in Figure 10. This graph demonstrates that with time the irradiated group of ra ts required less and less Nembutal compared with the non-irradiated control group. The dosage of Nembutal in the irradiated group required only 45% the starting dose at the conclusion of the irradiation phase. The dosage of Nem butal in the control, non-irradiated group, remained fairly consistent through the same number of anaesthetic phases, although was a reduction of drug dose to 92% of starting dose.

Dosage of Nembutal versus Time. 1285.1.2 Weight change during anaesthesia/radiation phase The weight of the two control animals a nd all animals undergoi ng irradiation was noted over the period in which anaesthesia was given and compared in Figure 11. While both groups lost weig ht during the period of an aesthesia/irradiation, the irradiated group lost, on average, 21% of th eir starting body weight compared to just 4.3% of the starting weight of the contro l group. The average weight loss over the period between the two groups is statistically significant (p< 0.05, t-test), and is directly attributable to the irradiati on treatment. The irradiated group of rats all lost some condition during this phase of treatment as was noted above. The loss of clinical condition was judged through daily examination of the animals and each animal was given a Clinical Condition Grading (see Table 6). Three animals became so clinically distressed that they were put down. It was noted that the animals lost interest in the normal pellet diet and also became dehydrat ed. As noted in Chapter 4, the animals were started on a supplementary liquid di et, Osmolite, on Day 15, the last day of irradiation of Group 3 (R x) and Group 4 (R x+HBOT).

Weight change during anaesthetic/radiation phase. 1295.1.3 Explanation for Reduced Dose of Nembutal in Irradiated Rats. The observation of the unexpected finding that the irradiated rats required a reduced dose of Nembutal to achieve the same le vel of anaesthesia was discussed with Professor Len Cullen and Dr Geoffrey Gri ffith, from the Division of Veterinary & Biomedical Sciences, Murdoch Universit y. The short term anaesthetic action of thiopentone and pentobarbitone is initially due to the redistribution of the agent away from the central nervous system (CNS) to other tissues and to the metabolism of the agent by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In rats that have lost up to 21% of their body weight over the 15 days of TRT, it is reasonable to conclude that in this catabolic state, the individual animals would have very little or no body fat reserves. During anaesthesia, pentobarbital is f ound in its highest concentrati ons in the brain and liver, but it is highly lipid soluble 323 and is normally redistributed away from the brain. It is this redistribution of the drug that partly accounts for its short duration of activity. In rats with very little or no fa t, it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the duration of action of the pentobarbita l would be increased. In addition, it is known324 that in starving animals the activity of hepatic microsomes to metabolise drugs is significantly reduced. 5.2 WEIGHT CHANGES OF ANIMA LS COMPARING OSMOLITE AND PELLET DIETS All animals were weighed on a daily basis dur ing the first phase of irradiation for 15 days and then on a weekly basis for the rest of the experiment. As Group 3 (R x) and Group 4 (R x+HBOT) animals had started on a liqui d supplement diet of Osmolite, it was decided to add 6 more animals, matched for age and sex to existing experimental groups, and to be known as Group 5 (Osmolite). These animals were not involved in any other way in this research except that they were placed on an Osmolite diet, to act 130as a control group, to assess any long term ch anges associated with a liquid diet. They were given an Osmolite Diet for 12 weeks and their weight changes noted over this period of time (Fig 12). One animal lost condi tion to a point where it was considered in the best interests of the animal to put it down 10 weeks from the time the animals started on the Osmolite diet. All other animals gained weight when they were given the Osmolite diet (Fig 12).

The animals on the Osmolite diet, Group 5 (Osmolite) had an average weight gain over this 12 week period of 100% of th eir starting weight compared to the animals on the standard pellet diet where the weight gain was only 5% on the st arting weight. This average weight gain was statistically highe r (p<0.05, t-test) in Group 5 (Osmolite). It would seem clear that the animals on the Osmolite diet, (Group 5) did much better with regard to weight gain over the same pe riod compared with those animals on the standard pellet diet. However, it should be pointed out that the average starting weight of the Osmolite animals (Group 5) was 240.8gm compared with the starting weight of the animals on the standard pellet diet which was 572.5gm. Despite an effort being made to try and compare animals of similar age, in this case the starting weights were quite different. The large differences in body weight in the various groups make it difficult to compare directly the data in absolute terms. As the mature weight of a Male Wistar Rat is report ed to be 500 to 700,306 it is obvious that th e animals on the pellet diet were more mature than the animal s on the Osmolite and therefore had less potential for growth and weight gain. In essence both groups of animals continued to put on weight no matter which diet they were given. 5.3 WEIGHT CHANGE OVER PERIOD OF EXPERIMENT Figure 14 compares the weight of two an imals only from Groups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBOT) over the entire time period of the experiment. As can be seen the animals in both groups had a steady increase in weight beginning with an average weight of 411gms and finishing the experiment on Day 253 with an average weight of 600gms. 132This represents a 46% average increase in weight gain. There was no significant difference in weight change between Group 1 (Control) and Group 2 (HBOT) animals. Fig 14. Weight chart showing weight change of animals from Groups 1 (Control) and Group 2 (HBOT) over the entire time period of the experiment. Figure 15 compares the weight change in the animals from Groups 3 (R x) and 4 (Rx+HBOT) over the entire period of the e xperiment. The animals from Group 3 began the experiment with an aver age weight of 450gm and comple ted the experiment at Day 253 with an average weight of 447gm. This represents a weight loss of less than 0.01%.The animals in Group 4 began the expe riment with an average weight of 370gms and completed the experiment at Da y 253 with an average weight of 420gm. This represents a weight increase of 13.5% over starting weight . Of the animals in Group 3, one animal gained weight, (G3#6 - 420gm to 460gm) a nd the other lost weight (G3#8 - 480gm to 435gm). Both anim als from Group gained G4#1 (370gm to 390gm) and G4#9 (370gm to 450g m) over the period of the experiment.

During the 23rd week of the experiment, three an imals began to show considerable distress with steady weight loss throughout the week. They became very lethargic, dehydrated and exhibited respiratory distress with laboured rapid breathing. They had stopped eating and their stomachs felt bloated. These three animals were put down; G4#2 on Day 155, G4#6 on Day 156 and G3#3 on Day 159. A macro scopic post mortem found them all to have only air in their entire GIT, from the stomach through to small and large intestines. There was no food or macroscopic gut flora visible and the liver was pale and mottled appearance. Foci of haemorrhage were seen the lungs. 5.4 LOSS OF HAIR Figures 16, Group 3 (R x) and 17, Group 4 (R x+HBOT), are photographs of two rats, one from each group, showing the area of irra diation, when the hair was first seen to WEIGHT CHART COMPARISON BETWEEN GROUP 3 (Rx) & Group 4 (Rx+HBOT) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1 85 141 253 TIME (days)WEIGHT CHANGE (grams) G3#6 G3#8 the experiment; and at Day 253 (16b, 17b), at the conclusion of the experiment. All rats in both Group 3 (R x) and Group 4 (R x+HBOT) lost hair around the angle of the mandible at day 26 of the experiment. Interestingly, this hair loss was restricted to the side of the rat facing the radiation machine only (Fig 18). Hair regrowth first b ecame noticeable in Group 3 (R x) animals at an average time of Day 56 (range 50 to 57) of the experiment and in Group 4 (R x+HBOT) animals at an average time of Day 51 (range 43 to 57). A graph of this is shown in figure 19. The regrowth of hair in the Group 4 (R x+HBOT) animals began an average of 5 days earlier than in Group 3 (R x) animals. Although regrowth occurred in both Group 3 (R x) and Group 4 (R x+HBOT) animals, the grow th of hair in Group 3 (R x) was very sparse compared with the Group 4 (R x+HBOT) animals, as seen in figures 16b and 17b which shows the hair regrowth at Da y 253. In the photo (17b) the hair regrowth seen in the Group 4 (R x+HBOT) animal has essentially return ed to that of the control animals compared with that of the non-treated Group 3 (R x) animal (16b), which still remains sparse at the conclusion of the experiment , Day 253. No easy met hod of quantification of the hair regrowth could be determine d, so only photographs and clinical observation were used. 135 Fig 16a.

Quantification of tooth growth In order to quantify the growth of the teeth using the tetracy cline banding and to ascertain whether there is any difference in gr owth rate in the presence of tetracycline, two measurements were taken: i. The width of the tetracycline band: This demonstrates the growth of the tooth over the 3 days that the animal was rece iving the tetracycline and is shown in the photograph in Figure 24 and quantified in the graph in Figure 25. ii. The distance between the tetracycline bands: this demonstrates the growth rate over the 25 days that the animals were not receiving tetracycline and is shown in the photograph in Figure 26 and quantified in Figure 27. Figure 28 shows a comparison between the growth rate of the teeth in the presence and absence of tetracycline. 141 Width of tetracycline band (growth in 3 days) Fig. 24 .The width of the tetracycline band demonstrates the growth rate over the 3 days that the tetracycline was administered to the rats.

From the data shown in Figure 25, showing the growth rate of the teeth during the administration of tetracycline, it can be seen that the growth rate of the teeth of Group 2 (HBOT) is significantly hi gher (p<0.05, t-test) and twice that of Group 1 (Control). This was an unexpected fi nding as studies to date189,224,226,249,252 would suggest that HBOT does not effect growth in norma l tissue. The growth rate of Group 4 (Rx+HBOT) is comparable to Group 1 and is more than three times the growth rate of Group 3 (R x) (p<0.05, t-test). In comparing Gr oups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBOT) and Groups 3 (R x) and 4 (R x+HBOT) where the onl y difference was the addition of HBOT, the data suggest that HBOT had a significant effect on growth rate of the teeth, during the period that the tetracycline was administer ed. From a treatment point of view, when tetracycline was being administered, the data suggest that HBOT had a positive effect in re-establishing the growth rate of irradiated teeth to a rate comparable to that of the Control Group. 143 Distance measured between tetracyclinebands (growth in 25 days) Fig. 26.The distance between the bands demo nstrates the growth rate over the 25 days that the animals were not re ceiving tetracycline.

From the data shown in Figure 27, showing the growth rate of the teeth in the absence of the administration of tetracycline, it can be seen that the growth rate of the teeth of Group 1 (Control) and Group 2 (H BOT) are comparable. This was to be an expected finding as studies to date189,224,226,249,252 would suggest that HB OT does not effect growth in normal tissue. The growth rate of Group 4 (R x+HBOT) is less than 50% that of Group 1 (Control), but is more than twice the growth rate of Group 3 (R x). In comparing Groups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBOT), and Groups 3 (R x) and 4 (R x+HBOT), where the only difference was the addition of HBOT, the data suggest that HBOT has a significant effect on growth rate of the teet h, during the period that no tetracycline was administered. From a treatment point of view, the data suggest that HBOT has a positive effect in re-establishing the growth rate of irradiated teeth. Differences in Tetracycline Staining of Teeth between each Group. It was found that all teeth in Group 1 (Control) and Gr oup 2 (HBOT) had tetracycline bands, both single band and double bands, depe nding on the day when the rats were sacrificed. Only the two animals from Group 3 (R x), which had been sacrificed on the last day of the experiment, had convinci ng bands (G3#6 and G3#8), with the rest of Group 3 (R x) animals having no tetracycline bands at all. Only two animals from Group 4 (R x+HBOT), (G4#3 and G4#10) that had been sacrificed during the radiation phase and hence had not received tetracyc line did not show te tracycline banding. The remaining 8 animals from Group 4 (R x+HBOT) all had convincing measurable tetracycline bands. The mean for tetracy cline band width for Group 1 was 0.0296 mm, 0.0597 mm in Group 2, 0.0085 mm in group 3, and 0.0332 mm in Group 4. The mean for the distance between tetracycline banding for Group 1 was 0.416mm, for Group 2, 0.466mm, Group 3, 0.079 and for Group 4, 0.182mm. It had been expected that Group 1451 (Control) and 2 (HBOT) would not have a di fference in the growth rate, as they were both normal tissues. In this experiment the growth rate of Group 2 (HBOT) was higher than Group 1 (Control) (p < 0.05, t-test). Group 4 (R x+HBOT) had almost three times the growth rate of the teeth in Group 3 (R x) (p<0.05, t-test). This showed clearly that HBO had indeed helped the teeth to grow in Group 4 (R x+HBOT) compared to Group 3 (R x). Fig. 28. Growth Rate of Teeth comparing growth in the presence and absence of tetracycline. Growth Rate of Teeth comparing grow th in the presence and absence of tetracycline. Figure 28 demonstrates the growth rate of teeth compari ng growth in the presence and absence of tetracycline. A lthough there are differences between the \"tetracycline present\" and \"tetracycline absent\" groups, none of these are statis tically significant (ANOVA). The positive effect of HBOT on growth rate can be seen in Group 4 whether tetracycline was present or abse nt. Interestingly, in the presence of tetracycline, the growth rate in Group 4 wa s comparable to the growth rate in the Group 1 (Control). GROWTH RATE OF TEETH 0 0.0050.01 0.0150.02 and 32a show hi stological sections stained with H&E (Magnification x 100) of an example of the salivary gland tissue taken from a rat from each experimental group that had been sa crificed at Day 253 and figures 29b, 30b, 31b and 32b show histological sections stained with of the cons ecutive corresponding H&E slice. The LFB was particularly useful in demonstrating th e presence of salivary gland tissue, especially in those sections where the salivary tissue was undergoing radiation fibrosis and was very difficult to see in H&E sections. 147 Fig. 29a.

(LFB) 151Figures 33, 34 and 35 compare the average nu mber of salivary gland acini in each group at Day 85, 141 and 253 of the experime nt. This investigation was able to comparatively quantify the histological presen ce of salivary gland ti ssue in each group. All the graphs clearly demonstrate that the presence and quantit y of salivary gland acini were comparable in each of Groups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBOT). Again, this was to be an expected finding as studies to date189,224,226,249,252 would suggest that HBOT does not effect growth in normal tissue. The pres ence and quantity of salivary gland acini in Group 4 (R x+HBOT) was seen to be comparable to that of Groups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBOT), compared with Group 3 (R x), which has less than 50% of the quantity of salivary gland acini. Group 3 (R x) had significantly less than the other three groups (p<0.05, ANOVA). Figure 36 compares the average number of salivary gland acini over the period of the experiment . Again it can be seen that the mean number of salivary gland acini in Group 4 (R x+HBOT) (25.9) is comparable to that of Groups 1 (Control) (24.2) and 2 (HBOT) (22). This compares to Group 3 (R x) (15) where the numb er of salivary gland acini is only 58% of that of Group 4 (R x+HBOT) and 62% of Group 1 (Control). This finding again supports the hypothesis of this st udy that HBOT is effective in reducing the loss of salivary gland acini in radiotherapy and in so reducing the side effects of TRT. 152 Fig. 33.

It is immedi ately clear that there are far fewer lacunae occupied by osteoblasts in Group 3 (R x) compared with the other three groups. In addition Group 4 (R x+HBOT) exhibits areas of new bone growth (reversal lines) compared to Group 3 (R x) which has no areas of new bone growth. Fig. 37. Example of Bone from Group 1#1 (Control). (H&E) 155 Fig. 38. Example of Bone fr om Group 2#3 (HBOT). (H&E) Fig. 39. Example of Bone from Group 3#8 (R x). (H&E) 156 Fig. 40. Example of Bone from Group 4#9 (R x+HBOT). (H&E) In this study the percentage of lacunae o ccupied by osteoblasts was used to quantify the vitality of the bone over the time fram e of the experiment. Figures 41, 42 and 43 compare the percentages of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts in each group at Day 85, 141 and 253 of the experiment. The percentage of osteoblasts that occupy the lacunae is a clear indication of the v itality of the bone. While all lacunae may not be occupied in any one histological section because of th e natural cell turn over and the section of the histological cut, healthy vital bone will have almost 100% occupancy of osteoblasts in lacunae. All thre e graphs demonstrate that throughout the experiment that Group 4 (Rx+HBOT) had a similar percentage of lac unae occupied by osteoblasts as Groups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBO), while Group 3 (R x) had less than 40% of the occupancy of the other three groups. Group 3 (R x) had statistically less than the other three groups (p<0.05, ANOVA) at days 85, 141, and 253. 157Figure 44 compares the percen tage of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts over the period of the experiment. Again it can be seen that the percenta ge of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts in Group 4 (R x+HBOT) (87.5%) is comparable to that of Groups 1 (Control) (96.3%) and 2 (HBOT) (96.3%). This compares to Group 3 (R x) where the percentage of lacunae occupied by oste oblasts is only 47% of that of Group 4 (Rx+HBOT) and only 43% of the control group. This finding again supports the hypothesis of this study that HBOT is eff ective in reducing the loss osteoblasts in radiotherapy and in so reduci ng the side effects of TRT. Fig. 41.

As can be seen in these slides , although the histological sections were consistently taken through the angle of the mandible in order to pick up the main trunk of the Inferior Alveolar Artery and Nerve, both structures had divided into smaller branches at this anatomical level. Howeve r, as analysis of the arteries involved measuring the ratio of the individual artery diameter to wall thickness in all animals, the fact that the arteries varied in size be tween animals should not affect the ability to quantify any change in this ratio. The analys is of the Inferior Al veolar Nerve will be discussed in the next section (5.9).

Example of an artery from Group 4#9 (R x+HBOT). (H&E). 162There are many reports in the literature4-7,108-110 to indicate that with time arteries in the field of TRT progressively undergo endarteritis obliterans with thickening of the vessel wall. In designing this experiment, the angle and ramus of the mandible were irradiated and sections of tissue were taken in the co ronal plane through this area in order to demonstrate the key tissues to be examined. The inferior alveolar artery enters the mandible through the mandibular foramen on th e lingual surface of the ramus of the mandible. Unfortunately, it is we ll recognised that arte rial size is not always consistent. Therefore, in this experiment, the ratio of the artery diameter divided by the wall thickness was used as a measure of the develo pment of endarteritis obliterans, rather than trying to compare the arterial diameter of individual animals. The development of a decreasing ratio would indicat e a thickening of arterial wall thickness and therefore indicate a tendency towards the development of endarteritis obliterans. Figures 49, 50 and 51 demonstrate the ratio of the artery diameter divided by the wall thickness in each group at Day 85, 141 and 253 of the experi ment. As endarteritis obliterans is a slow progressive condition that takes many months to deve lop, all groups should start with a similar arterial ratio, apart from the possible effect of inflammatory changes that will occur as a result of the TRT in the acute phase. As the first sections were taken at Day 85 of the experiment, the possible effect of the acute inflamma tory changes should have settled by this time. The graph in figur e 49 demonstrates the arterial ratio at Day 85, with Group 1 (Control) ha ving a ratio of 5.5, Group 2 (H BOT) a ratio of 4.2, Group 3 (R x) a ratio of 4, and Group 4 (R x+HBOT) a ratio of 5. In reviewing Group 1 (Control), the graphs in figures 49, 50 a nd 51 demonstrate some consistency in the arterial ratio, with ratios of 5.5 at Day 85, 4.6 at Day 141 and 4.6 at Day 253. The differences in these numbers may be attrib uted individual animal variation as the numbers in this study were restricted. In reviewing Group 2 (HBOT), the graphs again demonstrate some consistency in arterial ratio, with ratios of 4.2 at Day 85, 3.9 at Day 163141 and 4.5 at Day 253. In Group 3 (R x), the graphs again demonstrate some consistency in arterial rati o, with ratios of 4 at Day 85, 3.75 at Day 141 and 5 at Day 253. Group 3 (R x) should have shown a reduction in th e arterial ratio score if it was to demonstrate the development of endarteritis obliterans. Although th is is seen between Day 85 and 141, there is an increase in the ar terial ratio at Day 253. Again this may be attributed to individual animal variation. Group 4 (R x+HBOT) showed a similar consistently to the other three groups, but a higher ar terial ratio than Group 3 (R x) throughout the experiment, with ratios of 5 at Day 85, 5.4 at Day 141 and 5.8 at Day 253. Figure 52 shows a graph of the ratio of ar tery diameter divided by wall thickness over the period of the experiment. Again the differences in arterial ratio between the groups (G1 - 4.9, G2 - 4.2, G3 - 4.5, G4 - 6.4) are not significant. All that can be said from the data of arterial ra tio is that Group 4 (R x+HBOT) showed a cons istently higher ratio than Group 3 (R x) throughout the experiment indi cating a possible reduced tendency for the development of endarter itis obliterans, but the diffe rences are not statistically significant. 164 Fig. 49.

As can be seen in these slides, although the histological secti ons were consistently taken through the angle of the mandible in order to pick up the main trunk of the Inferi or Alveolar Nerve, the nerve was often divided into smaller branches at this an atomical level. Therefore it was difficult to obtain consistent nerve trunk diameter measurements in this study. In designing this experiment, the angle and ramus of the mandible were irradiated and sections of tissue were taken in the cor onal plane through this area in order to demonstrate the major tissues to be examine d. The Inferior Alveolar Nerve enters the mandible through the mandibular foramen on th e lingual surface of the ramus of the mandible. Nerve size will vary with the si ze of the animal and therefore may not always be consistent. In addition, as stated above, the nerve was of ten branched in the sections of the angle of the mandible. In Group 1 (Control), the nerve diameter ranged from 330 to 519 \u00b5m, with a mean diameter of 422 \u00b5m. In Group 2 (HBOT), the nerve diameter ranged from 111 to 539 \u00b5m, with a mean diameter of 354 \u00b5m. In Group 3, (Rx), the nerve diameter ranged from 326 to 509 \u00b5m, with a mean of 409 \u00b5m. In Group 4 (R x+HBOT), the nerve diameter ranged from 350 to 1078 \u00b5m, with a mean of 732 \u00b5m. Marx4,5,6,7,11 reports that nerve tissue is the least affected by TRT and therefore should show the least histological change . Figures 53, 54 and 55 compare the average diameter of the largest nerve found in each animal section in each group at Day 85, 141 and 253 of the experiment; and Figure 56 compares the nerve diameters over the period of the experiment. The graphs in figur es 53 to 56 demonstrate little variation in nerve diameter within each group, which is a consistent with reports by Marx.4,5,6,7,11 167 Fig. 53. Average Nerve Diameter at Day 85.

While th ere would appear to be some difference in the histological appearance of these four exam ples of muscle tissue, related to density of colour of the muscle tissue and the number of muscle nuclei, it proved difficult to quantify differences between them histological ly. In the clinical setting, it would be expected that the i rradiated groups (Groups 3 and 4) would develop the \"three-H\" scenario, leading to increasing fibrosis in th e muscle tissue, but with retention of the histological muscle tissue architecture. Fi gure 61 shows a comparison of the number of nuclei in the muscle tissue at Day 253. As can be seen from this graph, the numbers of nuclei do vary, but this may be due to the histological sections being carried out at varying angles to the longitudinal orientation of the muscle fibres. In any case, there is little statistical significance be tween the four groups. However, it is of interest to note that in the two groups that underwent HB OT (Groups 2 and 4), Group 2 (HBOT) had more muscle nuclei than its compar ative control Group 1 (Control); and correspondingly Group 4 (R x+HBOT) had more muscle nuclei than its comparative control Group 3 (R x). However, Group 3 (R x) has more muscle nuclei than the untreated Group 1 (Control), whic h would not be expected w ith the development of the three-H\" scenario, leading to increasing fi brosis in the muscle tissue of the Group 3 (Rx) animals. The muscle histological secti ons were examined by two researchers (Dr Thea Shavlakadze and Hannah Radley) from the Skeletal Muscle Research Group, School of Anatomy and Huma n Biology, University of We stern Australia, and they both felt that \" there were no striking changes in images that were viewed. \" Dr Shavlakadze suggested that more valuable da ta for a comparative histological analysis of the muscle tissue from the four groups may have been obtained by taking fresh 170frozen samples of muscle tissue from identical areas from each animal and comparing measurements of the Myofibre cross s ectional area, using the fixative Cornfix.

TOOTH GROWTH The mean growth of teeth in Gr oup 1 (Control) group was 0.010 mm/day during the period of tetr acycline administration a nd 0.016 mm/day when no tetracycline was be ing administered. The mean growth of teeth in Group 2 (HBOT) group was 0.020 mm/day during the period nistration and 0.019 mm/day when no tetracycline was be ing administered. The mean growth of teeth in Group 3 (R x) was found to be 0.003 mm/day with or without the administration of tetracycl ine. This represen ts only 33% of the growth rate in Group 1 (Control), (p<0.05, ANOVA). The mean growth of teeth in Group 4 (R x + HBOT), was found to be 0.011 mm/day during the period of tetracyc line administration and 0.007 mm/day when no tetracycline was being administer ed. This growth rate was more than three times the growth rate of teeth in Group 3 (R x), the non-treated group (p<0.05, t-test). The difference in comparing the growth ra te of teeth within individual groups, in the presence or absence of tetracycline administration was considered small (ANOVA). 174SALIVARY GLAND After 253 days the presence and quantity of salivary gland acini in Group 4 (Rx+HBOT) was seen to be comparable to that of Groups 1 (Control) and 2 (HBO). After 253 days Group 3 (R x) had only 47% of the quantity of salivary gland acini when compared to the Group 1 (Control) (p<0.05, ANOVA). When the submandibular glands are in the field of TRT which received 40 Gy or more, permanent dysfunction of thes e salivary glands can be expected. BONE After 253 days the percentage of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts in the treated Group G4 (R x+HBOT) was 87% that of group s 1 (Control) and 2 (HBOT) compared to the non-treated Group G3 (R x) which had only 31% of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts . (p<0.05, ANOVA) When bone lies in the field of TRT which received over 40 Gy or more, permanent loss of at least 69% of the osteoblasts can be expected. ARTERY The data measuring the arterial ratio showed that Group 4 (R x+HBOT) had a consistently higher ratio than Group 3 (R x), throughout the experiment, indicating a possible lower tendency for the development of endarteritis obliterans in the treated group (p<0.05, ANOVA). 175NERVE A comparison of the nerve diameters over the period of the experiment showed little variation in nerve diameter within each group, which is consistent with reports in the literature. MUSCLE While there would appear to be some difference in the hi stological appearance of these four examples of muscle tissue, related to density of colour of the muscle tissue and the number of muscle nuclei, it proved difficult to quantify differences between them histologically. More valuable data for a comparative hist ological analysis of the muscle tissue from the four groups may have been obtai ned by taking fresh frozen samples of muscle tissue from identical areas from each animal and comparing measurements of the myofibre cross s ectional area, using the fixative Cornfix. 176CHAPTER 6 6.1 GENERAL DISCUSSION This study completes for the first time a prospective quantitative histological investigation on the long-term side effects of therapeutic radiation treatment to normal tissue, when 20 intermittent daily HBOT are started one week after the completion of the radiation treatment. To date, the benefit of HBOT is based on the premise that the tissues must be hypoxic, hypocellular and hypov ascular, and theref ore treatment with HBO is only effective when given no sooner than 6 months after TRT, when these hypoxic tissue conditions have developed. This study is therefore the first investigation to show that HBOT can be effective in reduc ing some of the side effects of TRT when 20 intermittent daily HBOT are started one week after completion of TRT. In addition this study has shown that the long term survival of specialised tissues such as salivary gland and osteoblasts can be enhanced by treatment with HBO when given one week after the completion of TRT. This study has al so shown that if HBOT is not given one week after completion of TRT then specialis ed tissues such as salivary gland and bone will be progressively permanently lost. In particular, if the submandibular glands are in a TRT field which received 40 Gy or more , permanent dysfunction of the salivary glands can be expected. When bone lies in the field of TRT which received 40 Gy or more, permanent loss of at least 69% of the osteoblasts can be expected. Current HBOT protocols are designed to ma nage some of the complications of TRT, particularly osteoradionecros is (ORN). Prior to the in troduction of HBOT, conditions such as ORN could not be surgically tr eated as operating on e xposed bone lead to 177further soft tissue breakdown and exposure of more irradiated bone. Treatment regimes consisted of Tetracycline Mouthwash and a c onservative approach to sequestrectomies. The introduction of HBOT to mana ge ORN by authors such as Marx6,7,8,9 gave surgeons the ability to operate on patie nts with exposed ORN bone and to remove teeth with a reduced incidence of devel oping ORN. HBOT has been shown to induce angiogenesis and fibroblast differentiation10,11 with resulting revascularisation of the hypoxic does not retr dead or dyi ng tissue such as salivary gland and bone that lies within the field of n; it simply revascularises Once the speci alised tissues are lost, they are lost forever. Therefore, while HBOT gives surgeons the ability to treat ORN, using current protocols where patients wait at least 6 months before the HBOT, it does not prevent the complications asso ciated with TRT. In summary, this experimental model has fulfilled its prime objective of demonstrating that HBOT is effective in reducing some of the long-term side effects of th erapeutic radiation treatment in normal tissue, when given one week after the completion of the radiation treatment. To date HBOT has been used to treat the complications associated with TRT and this study is the first investigation to show that HBO can be used to prevent some of the complications associated with TRT. \"Prevention is better than cure .\" Desiderius Erasmus (1466-1536) \"When mediating over a disease, I never think of finding a remedy for it, but, instead a means of preventing it .\" Louis Pasteur (1822 - 1895) The tissues primarily investigated in th is study were teeth, salivary gland, bone, arteries, nerves and muscle. This study show ed that following TRT, when treated with HBOT, the teeth continued grow at similar rate as the controls. In this study, the mean 178growth of teeth in the Group 1 (Control) was 0.010 mm/d ay during the period of tetracycline administration and 0.016 mm /day when no tetracycline was being administered. This compares with the studies by Fatani and Raja,282 who reported 0.015 mm/day. The mean growth of teeth in Group 2 (HBO) was 0.020 mm/day during the period of tetracycline administration and 0.019 mm /day when no tetracycline was being administered. This also compares with the studies by Fatani and Raja. 282 However, in the irradiated Group 3 (R x), the mean growth of teeth was found to be only 0.003 mm/day with or without the administ ration of tetracycline. This represents only 33% of the growth rate in Group 1 (Control). In the HBO treated Group 4 (Rx+HBOT), the mean growth of teeth was found to be 0.011 mm/day during the period of tetracycline admi nistration and 0.007 mm/day when no tetracycline was being administered. This growth rate comp ares favourably with Group 1 (Control) and represents more than three times the grow th rate of teeth in irradiated Group 3 (R x), the non-treated group. The differenc e in comparing the growth rate of teeth within individual groups, in the pr esence or absence of tetr acycline administration, was considered small in this study. This study confirmed the findings of a number of authors 117,135,136 that TRT, in the head and neck area, irreversibly damages the salivary glands. The animals from the irradiated Group 3 (R x) showed a reduction of salivary gland tissue to a level of only 47% of that of the Group 1 (Control) after 253 days. In addition this study showed that when the submandibular glands are in the fi eld of TRT which received 40 Gy or more, permanent dysfunction of these salivary glands can be expected which is consistent with the study by Peterson and Sonis.136 Peterson and Sonis136 also showed that radiation doses as low as 20 Gy will result in clinically noticeable changes such as sparse thick ropy saliva. These changes are often rapid and irreversible, especially 179when the salivary glands are included in the radiation fields.91 In 2000, O'Connell117 also reported that TRT for cancers of the head and neck irreversibly damages the salivary glands. He reported that xerostomia develops within the first week of therapy and is progressive, with devast ating effects on the quality of life of the individual. The mechanism of tissue injury in humans has not been fully elucidated, but some progress has been made with animal models. The molecular mechanism of acute radiation damage is also not fully understood; however , long-term salivary gland dysfunction is associated with both loss of gland weight a nd loss of acinar cells. Acinar cells are the most radiosensitive component, with serous acinar cells of the parotid gland being the most vulnerable to radiation damage.94 When the acinar cells are destroyed they are replaced by ductal remnants with loose connective tissue which is moderately infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells.95,96 In 2003, Radfar and Sirois135 reported on the development of an animal model, using Hanford mini-pigs, for radiation-induced salivary gland injury with a radiation protocol identical to current clinical practice. The mini-pigs were subject ed to fractionated daily irradiation with a total dose of 70 Gray (Gy). Structural and functional measures were compared with those of a control group of mini-pigs. They found that irradiated submandibular and parotid glands were one-third to one-half th e gross size of control glands. Whereas no pathologic changes were note d in control glands, irradi ated glands consistently demonstrated significant parenchymal loss with extensive acinar atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, enlarged nuclei in remaining acinar cells, and ductal dilatation and proliferation. Stimulated salivary flow was reduced by 81% in irradiated animals compared with pre-irradiation flow; saliva ry flow in the cont rol group increased by 30% during the same period. They concl uded that observed radiation-induced structural and functional saliv ary gland changes in the anim al model are comparable in every respect to those observed following ir radiation of human sa livary glands. Tissue 180from animals from Group 3 (R x) sacrificed at 85 days in th is study showed that salivary gland tissue was found to be reduced to 47% of Group 1 (Control) levels and histologically demonstrated significant pare nchymal loss with extensive acinar atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. These histological findings are cons istent with the findings of O'Connell117 and confirm the early loss of sa livary gland tissue after TRT. The histological findi ngs from animals from Group 3 (R x) at Day 141 and Day 253 had similar levels of reduction of salivary gl and acini to 47% compared to the Group 1 (Control). These histological findings, over the period of the experiment of 253 days, show that loss of salivary gland tissue occu rs very early after the completion of TRT. Of more important note, tissue from this study examined at 85, 141 and 253 days, demonstrated the presence and quantity of salivary gland acini in the HBO treated Group 4 (R x+HBOT), that was comparable to th at of Group 1 (Control) and Group 2 (HBOT). This is a clear demonstration th at HBO, given one week after TRT, was effective in preserving the salivary gland ti ssue. As stated earlier, salivary gland has been shown to be one of the most sensitive tissues to TRT and xerostomia develops in the first weeks of treatment. Therefore, early intervention th rough treatment with HBOT, a week after TRT, has been clinically shown in this study to reduce the effect of the TRT on the salivary gland tissue. The molecular basis by which the early activation of the wound hea ling cascade as a protective mechanism to salivary gland tissue is further elucidated under the concluding hypothesis. Histologically, the effects of radiation on bone and the adjacent soft tissue have been well studied and documented in the literature. 76,79-81 In general, the initial damage resulting from radiation i nvolves acute inflammation, hyperaemia and oedema with the development of acute hypoxia. Hyperaemia and endarteritis was found to begin early in the radiation sequence and persisted for up to 6 months after radiation treatment. 181The remaining histopathologic processes a ppeared mainly from about 6 months onwards. Specifically in bone, there is an imbalance in the radiosensitivity of osteocytes, with osteoblasts depleted mu ch more than osteoclasts with a given radiation dose. This study confirmed the finding that the numbers of osteoblasts become reduced with time to a point wher e after 253 days the pe rcentage of lacunae occupied by osteoblasts in the irradiated Group 3 (R x) was only 31% of that of the Control Group. This study therefore demonstr ates that when bone lies in the field of TRT which received over 40 Gy or more, permanent loss of at least 69% of the osteoblasts can be expected. Throughout the experiment on Days 85, 141 and 253 and when all the figures were combined for the period of the experiment, the percentages of lacunae occupied by osteobl asts in HBO treated Group 4 (R x+HBOT) were seen to comparable to that of the Group 1 (Control) and Group 2 (HBOT). This again is a clear demonstration that HBOT, given one week af ter TRT, was effective in preserving the osteoblasts. As with salivary gland tissue, in Group 3 (R x), the greatest percentage loss of osteoblasts (50%) occurre d soon after completion of TRT at Day 85, with further reduction at Day 141 to reach a level of only 31% at Day 253. This would seem a clear indication again that early intervention with HBOT is necessary to reduce the loss of osteoblasts in irradiated tissue. Measurement of the arterial ratio in this study, as a gauge of endarteritis obliterans, showed that the HBO treated Group 4 (R x+HBOT) had a consistently higher ratio than the non-treated Group 3 (R x), throughout the experiment , indicating a possible lower tendency for the development of endarteritis obliterans in the treate d group. It has been shown by a number of authors76,79-81 that hyperaemia and endart eritis begin early in the radiation sequence and persist for up to 6 months after radiatio n treatment, it would therefore be logical to speculate that th e reduced tendency to the development of 182endarteritis obliterans in HBO treated group (Group 4), f ound in this study, may well play a part in the reduction of the de velopment of long term complications of radiotherapy; and again illustrating th at early intervention is necessary. This study showed that there was some diffe rence in the histological appearance of muscle tissue from each of the four groups, re lated to density of colour of the muscle tissue and the number of muscle nuclei. However, it proved difficult to quantify differences between them histologically. In th e clinical setting, it would be expected that the irradiated groups (Groups 3 and 4) would develop the \"three-H\" scenario, leading to increasing fibrosis in the muscle tissue, but with retention of the histological muscle tissue architecture. It can be conc luded then that H&E and LFB stains do not show a quantifiable difference between the muscle tissues of the four groups. Dr Shavlakadze (personal communication) sugge sted that more valuable data for a comparative histological analysis of the muscle tissue may have been obtained by taking fresh frozen samples of muscle tissue from identical areas from each animal and comparing measurements of the Myofibre cross sectional area, using the fixative Cornfix, and this will be in cluded in a future study. Oxygen is one of the primary elements of life and can be considered an agent in therapeutic management. When an agent is given as part of the therapeutic management, a basic principle of treatment is that the agent must be maintained at a sufficient clinical tissue concentration to be effective. This is obviously why drugs such as antibiotics are given 3 to 4 times a day to maintain minimal clinically effective blood concentration levels. When patients are treated with HBO, it is only given for an average time of 90 minutes per day for 30 sessions over 6 weeks (Marx 20/10 protocol). 5 For the other 22.5 hours per day the pa tient breaths normal barometric air 183and the irradiated tissues return to their hypoxic state.7 Therefore the physical presence of oxygen is not being mainta ined at HBO tissue levels.7 The HBO must therefore be doing more than just increasing the hypoxic gradient and assisting wound healing by its physical presence. During the short e xposure of HBO, the oxygen must therefore initiate the wound healing process, which is then able to continue when the tissue oxygen tensions return to the non HBO state. It has been well documented by a number of different authors, (Marx, Knighton, Hunt)4-11 and clearly illustrated in the graph in figure 4, page 67 of this document, (Vascu lar density as a function of hyperbaric oxygen exposures) that there is a minimu m number of HBOT exposures required to initiate the well documented processes of angiogenesis and fibrobl ast differentiation. The graph in figure 4 shows that there is li ttle response in the va scular density curve until at least 8 sessions of HBOT have been given and the response curve then begins to curve upwards to plateau at 18 to 20 sessions. A further 10 sessions of HBOT is then recommended to allow the long-term esta blishment of the newly generated blood vessels and to promote collagen produc tion. Therefore, although the oxygen is physically present in the hypoxic tissue for only the limited treatment time, it needs to be given repeatedly over a minimum of 4 w eeks to achieve minimal clinical treatment levels. The mechanism by which HBOT achieves angi ogenesis and fibroplas ia in irradiated tissue has now been elucidated 6 and found to be stimul ated by a similar oxygen- gradient phenomenon that Knighton, Silver a nd Hunt have found to be central in the angiogenesis and fibroplasia of normal wound healing.8,9,183 The HBOT creates an oxygen gradient that is steep across a shor t distance between irradiated and normal tissue. Such steep oxygen grad ients are the physio-chemotac tic factor attracting wound regulating macrophages to a wound.183,184 Steep oxygen gradients, along with the 184lactate, iron and the low pH inherent in wounds, stimulate macrophage derived angiogenesis factor (MDAF) and macrophage derived growth factor (MDGF) which in turn promote the capillary budding and collagen synthesis of wound healing.184 Some other possible suggestions for the mechanis m of HBOT in wound healing have been made by Zhao et al224 in 1994, who noted a 100% reversal of the healing deficit induced by ischemia in expe rimental animals when wounds were treated with HBOT and growth factors simultaneously. Clearly th is synergistic response suggested a direct interaction between oxygen and growth factor s rather than the response expected from restoring adequate nutrition to compromised cells. The nature of this interaction was deduced by Bonomo et al225 who reported a statistically significant rise in the production of Platelet Derive d Growth Factor (PDGF) recep tor protein I in ischemic wounds that were treated simultaneously with both HBOT and PDGF. This finding lends strong support to the concept that HBOT functions as an in tracellular signalling transducer and thus is a modul ator of gene function. Siddiqui et al223, who documented that HBOT produces hyperoxic (not physiolo gic) concentrations in ischemic wounds and that oxygen concentration falls promptly to pre-treatment levels in ischemic tissue, also demonstrated a progressi ve increase in the real oxygen concentration in ischemic tissue when it was challenged with 100% oxygen at one atmosphere as well as a more rapid washout of oxygen from tissue after se rial HBO treatments. The magnitude of these changes was proportional to the number of HBO treatments. Davidson and Mustoe 226 attributed these acute changes in th e responsiveness of ischemic tissue to serial HBO treatments and suggested a pr ompt but transient production of a potent local vasodilator. It has been known for decades that specializ ed cells respond to varying oxygen levels. The kidney for example increases erythr opoietin production in response to hypoxia. 185Chemoreceptors in the carotid body and in the aortic arch respond to a fall in sensed oxygen tension. Hypoxia also induces cellular proliferation and an increase in the production of transforming growth factor- in fibroblasts, as well as enhanced cellular migration in keratinocytes.325,326 Endothelial cells respond to hypoxia with a seven-fold increase in PDGF messenger RNA.327 VEGF, which is the most stringently regulated of all growth factors, is upregulated by the hypoxic milieu in the centre of many solid tumours.328 It has become evident in recent ye ars that hypoxic stim ulation of many genes depends upon the activatio n of hypoxia inducible factor.329 Nathan330 stated that infected tissues, wounds, rheu matic joints and parts of tumours that have outgrown their blood supply share two features: tissu e oxygen tensions are lower (hypoxic), and there is leukocyte infiltration. Marx4,6,7 has also shown that tissues that have been irradiated are also hypoxic. Cramer et al331 proposed that a single protein mediates both the response of these cells to hypoxia and their ability to participate in inflammation as a coordinated immune respons e to tissues injuries as those mentioned above.332 The protein, hypoxia- inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), regulates the expression of at least 30 genes when tissues are hypoxic.333 Cramer et al331 have shown that HIF- 1 also controls several key aspects of in flammation: redness and swelling of injured tissues and the ability of leukocytes to en ter these sites. Hypoxia causes macrophages and neutrophils to activate a variet y of their genes, including VEGF.334 This gene activation is achieved by means of HIF-1 . To do so, HIF-1 must first bind to its partner, HIF-1 , and this interaction is controlled by oxygen levels. When oxygen is abundant, there is little HIF-1 and conversely under hypoxic conditions, levels of HIF-1 rise. During HBOT the extremely high dose of oxygen is followed by a return to the hypoxic state and this may suggest that the benefit of HBOT may be this abrupt reduction in tissue oxygen tens ion which upregulates HIF-1 during the normobaric time. Cramer et al331 have shown that HIF-1 is needed for leukocyt es to generate ATP 186(Adenosine Triphosphate) in th e hypoxic conditions of injured tissu es and hence for cells to function. Nathan330 states that these findi ngs suggest that HIF-1 might make a good target for drugs aimed at reducing infl ammation associated with many diseases. Inflammation also activates a gene that produces an enzyme that leads to the production of Nitric Oxide ( NO); and hypoxia, via HIF-1 , contributes to this activation.335 NO promotes swelling and other aspects of inflammation and helps macrophages kill microbes. Under hypoxic conditions, NO inhibits ATP formation in the mitochondria of cells and thus inhibits cellular function. Since HBOT is a signal transduction agent which can modify prot ein synthesis in the case of PDGF receptor, Davidson and Mustoe 226 questioned whethe r hyperoxia could also act as a signal transducer in a pathwa y that increases the ac tivity or production of nitric oxide synthase. It would seem that th ere is increasing data to suggest that the transient hyperoxia of HBOT functions as an intracellular signal transduction agent or modulator of gene function via more than one signalling pathway in addition to supplying the critical element for cellu lar respiration. O xygen, supplied under hyperbaric condition is therefore more than just nutrition for starved cells. In addition, Hunt and his colleagues have reported comp lementary evidence for this concept by demonstrating an increased production of vasc ular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by macrophages after exposure to hyperoxia.336-338 The search for mechanisms by which oxygen exerts its vital functions in wound heal ing moved another step forward in papers by Hunt, Hussain and Sen339 and Gordillo and Sen,340 in which they state that Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are a constructive force in wound healing. In the right quantity and place, they promote angiogenesis and collagen synthesis. Gibson et al341 confirmed that HBOT can be angiogen ic and added, because the effect was inhibited by anti VEGF antibody, it is medi ated by VEGF. Since current doctrine is 187that hypoxia is a key trigger of VEGF expression, and the data that hypoxia does instigate VEGF production must be accepted, it fell to Sheikh et al342 to show that VEGF protein levels in actual wounds ar e raised by HBOT. Hunt, Hussain and Sen339 have therefore concluded that both hypoxia and hyperoxia can promote VEGF activity or release. It therefore logically follo ws that HBOT in normal tissues produces hyperoxia which in turn promotes VEGF, wh ich therefore could e xplain the clinical and histological findi ngs in this study. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) include oxygen ions, free radicals and peroxides both inorganic and organic. They are generally very small molecules and most are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired valence shell electrons. ROSs form as a natural by-product of the normal metabolism of oxygen but can damage cell membranes by causing oxidative stress. Cells are normally able to defend themselves against ROS damage through the use of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. The effects of ROS on cell meta bolism have been well documented in a variety of species. These include not only roles in programmed cell death and apoptosis, but also positive effects such as the induction of host defence genes and mobilisation of ion transport systems. This is implicating them more frequently with roles in 'oxidative signalling'. 343,344 Mammalian cells possess multiple sources of ROS, including, among others, xanthine oxidase, Evidence suggests that plasma membrane-associated oxidases may provide one source of ROS associated with cell resistan ce to triggers of apoptosis.346-348 188At some point, almost all of the reactions that oxygen undergoes require intermediation of the short-lived oxidant forms. 'reac [ROS] than ROS includes oxygen-derived radicals as well as non-radical oxidants.) However, in the role referr ed to here, oxygen acts not merely as a chemical transient; rather, it acts through ROS, which in turn act as autocrine and paracrine messengers, i.e., as messengers within and between cells.349 The operational term is 'oxidant or redox signalling'. Signalling oxidants such as Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2O2) survive longer up to several minutes, and may travel appreciable distances, even across cell membranes. Many have found the concept of oxidant signalling difficult to accept because, until recently, oxidants have been thought of as mainly injurious - the cause of cell death, inflammation, scarring, etc. Oxygen, in fact has a \"dark si de\" and ROS are often the medi ators of disease, but when they are controlled, as they have been ev olved to be, they may also be beneficial. Oxidant signalling is required for life and function. That oxidants have an important constructive place in wound healing should not be a surprise. For example, Cho, Hunt and Hussain have shown that H 2O2 stimulates macrophage vasc ular endothelial growth factor release.350 Although there are many sources of oxidants, inflammation (required for healing) is probably quantitatively the most importa nt in wounds. Leukocytes are activated on their way into the wound. Af ter activation, the leukocy te isoform of the NADPH- linked oxidase is assembled. The enzyme converts molecular oxygen to superoxide by reducing it (adding an electr on). From here, a variety of oxidants are generated including H 2O2, hypochlorite and peroxynitrite (reac tion between nitric Some of these enter the extr acellular fluid, possibly from incompletely sealed phagosomes or surface activation of the enzyme. Consequently, the wound 189environment is rich in oxidants. However, peroxide and nitric oxide (NO) undoubtedly exist in relatively high (for such molecule s micromolar is high) concentration among and between the leukocytes, macrophages, and advancing fibrobl asts and endothelial cells that make up the edge of the heali ng tissue. This is the site where VEGF originates and where collagen production is first stimulat ed, and where the ROSs are most active. What is oxidant signalling? Though much of the chemistry remains to be elucidated, the presence of ROS changes the confor mation of a number of cell components. 330, For instance, they break sulfhydryl bonds in proteins to form disulfide linkages. DNA is 'nicked' - i.e., one of the paired strands is broken. A number of transcriptional proteins then appear. Among others, tumour suppre ssor protein P53 may be activated. Thut et al351 have shown that the P53 is a transcripti onal regulator that enha nces the expression of proteins that control cel lular proliferation. Caspases (important initiators of apoptosis) are activated or inhibited depending on specific conditions. Injured DNA demands and signals for activation of PARP (polyadenosyldiphoshporibose synthetase), which, in a complex manner and with lactate, activates collagen synthesis as well as VEGF synthesis. It appears that VEGF (the ma jor stimulus for angiogenesis in wounds) release is promoted in several ways. 328,338 Endothelial cells are also affected, but few details are known. If exposur e to ROS is extensive, PARP consumes so much NAD+ that energy transfer beco mes impossible and necrosis follows. In a separate mechanism, Caspases, P53, and others lead to apoptosis.339 It seems likely that the duration and site of oxidant exposure will be found to be important in the extent to which the constructive, functional effects of oxidants become overtaken by the destructive changes. It is entirely possi ble that the same ROS that accelerate acute healing can, in larger quanti ties, inhibit it in chronic, inflamed wounds. The , tissue-, and/or cell-specific. Some cells, among them liver and retinal cells, produce VE GF in response to NO. Others ignore NO and respond to H 2O2 instead. The confusing irony in this issue is that both hypoxia and hyperoxia enhance ROS production. 339 Hypoxia produces oxidant stress. As cells run out of ADP and accumulate adenosine (become severely deprived of energy), a shift occurs in the enzymes that metabolize oxygen. This is the so-called \"X-to-O\" sh ift, and residual oxygen, instead of going into en ergy production, is given an electron and converted to superoxide. From there, a number of oxidants including peroxynitrite, H 2O2, etc., are formed.352 If hypoxia is severe and sustained, th is conversion becomes quantitatively great enough to lead to apoptosis. After le sser exposures, only f unctional changes may occur. In an ironic and confusing twist, the ultimate 'cure' for hypoxic oxidative stress is more oxygen - from which there will al ways be an obligatory, though temporary, increase in oxidant exposure. On the other hand, hyperoxi a increases oxidant production as well. Activated inflammatory cells, the most vigorous oxida nt producers, make oxidants in direct proportion to the pO 2, of their environment. This was shown by Allen et al .353 and accounts for the exceptional vulnerability of hypoxic wounds and the efficacy of HBO in dealing with certain inf ections. These recent discoveries showing the role of oxygen in wound healing, via the production of ROS,226,326-330,337-353 further support the findings of the benefit of hyperoxia in w ound healing. Almost all wound-related cells possess specialised enzymes that generate ROS (including free radicals and H 2O2 from Oxygen). Defect in these enzymes is associ ated with impaired healing. Low wound pO2 will compromise the function of these en zymes. At low concentrations, ROS serve 191as cellular messengers to s upport wound healing and in the case of the congestion seen in the acute inflammatory reaction in th e early weeks following TRT, where the pO 2 will temporarily be reduced in directly e ffected tissues. This may go some way to explaining the mechanism behind the clinic al findings in this study. The hypothesis being that the initial inflammatory reaction caused by the TRT causes a temporary reduction in pO 2. Early treatment with HBO then produces a hyperoxia state which in turn stimulates the production of ROS from local cells. As shown by Allen et al ,353 these local inflammatory cells produce oxi dants in direct proportion to the local pO 2, with HBO therefore directly increasing this production and therefore the ability of the inflammatory cells to cope with the insult of the TRT. The oxygen acts not merely as a chemical transient; rather, it acts through RO S, which in turn act as autocrine and paracrine messengers, i.e., as messengers within and between cells. The operational term is 'oxidant or redox signalling'.226 Fortunately, the incorporation of ROS into wound-healing theory leaves nothing to unlearn, nor does it replace anything that is already known. For instance, that oxygen modifies the structure and the secretion and de position of collagen, and that its role in cross-linking gives collagen its' stiffness. 240 In fact, the conversion of collagen prolines to collagen hydroxyprolines, a pa rt of the stiffening process, with ascorbate a required component, is transiently changed to an oxidant radical. It is also known that bactericidal oxidants produced by inflamma tory cells and secreted into phagosomes, are vitally important to kil ling contaminating organisms.246,253 Note that leukocytic oxidants in this case promote their functions: bacterial killing, angi ogenesis, and matrix production. Lactate, the by-product of oxidant production, reinforces two of these functions still further by promoting both co llagen and VEGF transcription, synthesis, and post-transcriptional modi fication. This is a remarkable system in which all symptoms of energy insufficiency - ad enosine, oxidants lactate, and hypoxia - 192individually as well tively lead to signals that in itiate angiogenesis to stave off impending death. The curious thing is th at periodic hyperoxi a can imitate it. The emphasis is on 'periodic' because prolonged exposure is harmful. It has clearly been shown that the pr esence of hypoxia or hyperoxia stimulates a cascade of biological events which leads to wound healing. 328,338 If the biological element or elements that act ually initiate the wound healing cascade process could be discovered, then this could be given to the patient instead of them having to undergo the HBOT. Sheikh et al354 have stated that ' increased VEGF production seems to explain in part the angiogenic action of HBO. This supports other data that hypoxia is not necessarily a requirement for wound VEGF production.' For example, Constant et al355 have shown that Lactate elicits VEGF from macrophages as a possible alternative to hypoxia. Coulthard et al356 found, following their search of the literature, that there were no randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT ), according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, comparing HBO with no HBO for implant treatment in irradiated patients. They recommended that there is a need fo r RCTs to determine the effectiveness of HBO in the irradiated patient. Evaluati on of the effectiveness of oral health interventions is essential for several reasons, the most important of which is the health benefit and wellbeing of patients. In addi tion HBOT requires significant patient compliance and involves expensive equipm ent and cost per patient treatment. Coulthard et al356 therefore states that there is a need for RCT's to determine the effectiveness of HBOT in the irradiated patient as systematic reviews can provide guidance to clinicians and patients about clin ical decisions. This study should therefore contribute to a better und erstanding of this subject of HBOT and TRT. 193In summary, our knowledge of the mechanis ms of the hypoxic para lysis of healing, and the cure, providing more oxygen, is stre ngthening in depth and detail. Some of these details may tell us more about the mo st effective depths and cycle lengths of hyperbaric oxygen for wound healing. In part icular, however, this new information should help to show that the oxyge n 'free radicals' are not all bad. 6.2 HYPOTHESIS Although not examined in the experiments of th is thesis, it would seem appropriate to provide a possible explanation of the molecu lar events that may underlie the clinical findings. Figure 62 is a diagrammatic summary, dr awn by the author, of this author's hypothesis. It has been well demonstrated th at HBOT supplies the critical element for cellular respiration and this is particularly apparent in damaged tissues, especially during the initial damage, resulting from radi ation, which leads to acute inflammation, hyperaemia and oedema with the development of acute hypoxia. 5,349 It has been more recently suggested that Hyperoxia may act via an 'oxygen sensing transduction pathway' to impact on other important re gulators of cell growth and metabolism.339,340 Hyperoxia may act as an Intracellular Si gnalling Transducer, which modulates gene function, which in turn modifies protein synt hesis to produce a significant rise in the production of:- i. PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor) receptor protein I, ii. Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta1, iii. PDGF-beta, iv. Vascular endothelial gr owth factor (VEGF). Oxygen acts not merely as a chemical transi ent; rather, it acts through ROS (Reactive oxygen species include oxygen ions, free radi cals and peroxides both inorganic and organic), which in turn act as autocrine a nd paracrine messengers , i.e., as messengers 194within example (H 2O2) stimulates macrophage vascular endothelial growth factor release.350 Although there are many sources of oxidants, inflammation (required for healing) is probably quantitatively the most importa nt in wounds. Leukocytes are activated on their way into the wound. Af ter activation, the leukocy te isoform of the NADPH- linked oxidase is assembled. The enzyme converts molecular oxygen to superoxide by reducing it (adding an electr on). From here, a variety of oxidants are generated including peroxide, hypochlorite and peroxyni trite (reaction between nitric acid and superoxide). Some of these enter the extr acellular fluid, possibly from incompletely sealed phagosomes or surface activation of the enzyme. Consequently, the wound environment is rich in oxidants. However, peroxide and nitric oxide (NO) undoubtedly exist in relatively high (for such molecule s micromolar is high) concentration among and between the leukocytes, macrophages, and advancing fibrobl asts and endothelial cells that make up the edge of the heali ng tissue. This is the site where VEGF originates and where collagen production is first stimulat ed, and where the ROSs are most active. Lactate, the by-product of oxidant production, reinforces two of these functions still further by promoting both co llagen and VEGF transcription, synthesis, and post- transcriptional modi fication. This then, all in turn, leading to the Wound Healing Cascade, which in the case of this investigation, would appear to reduce the acute inflammatory damage caused by the TRT and thereby preservation of specialized tissues, which in turn, leads to a reduction in the long term comp lications associated with TRT. 195 Fig. 62 Wound Healing Pathway elicited by HB O (Summary of Author's Hypothesis).

Caries in non-irra diated individuals occurs in pits, in fissures and interproximally. It is also chalky and soft from dissolved tooth structure. Radiation caries, by contrast, is hard and black. It occu rs at the gingival margin, cusp tips and incisal surfaces. It would, therefore, be unrealistic to accept radiation caries as a mere extension of non -radiation caries from reduced salivary flow. Moreover, radiation caries is ei ther present only in the irradi ated field or is more severe in the irradiated field, while the entire m outh is affected by xerostomia. In Marx's76 opinion, radiation caries is mainly due to pulpal necrosis and odontoblast death, which causes deterioration of both the dentine and the dentinoenamel junction. The enamel is subsequently lost from the dentine because of dentinal dehydration and dentinoenamel junction deterioration which he states is similar to the mechanism when enamel is lost in dentinogenesis imperfecta. This is reflected in the clinical finding in Radiation Caries which is predominantly found around the cervical margins of teeth in the line of radiation. In the author's opinion, when radiation carie s appears around the ce rvical margins of the teeth, it is due to a shearing affect wher e the enamel approaches the neck of the tooth, at the level of the cementoenamel junc tion, due to the shri nkage of the dentine component of the tooth structure. This shrinkage of the dentine and shearing of dentinoenamel junction results in the enamel becoming undermined, producing 197cavitations at the neck of the tooth. This cavitations would accumu late plaque, due to all the other oral complications associated w ith TRT, resulting in further weakening of the tooth enamel at the neck of the toot h with fracture of the undermined enamel, thereby leading to the classic pattern of cervical radiation caries, which clinically appears as the typical \"ring- bark\" radiation caries around th e gingival margin level of the teeth. Pulp testing teet h with radiation caries may or may not produce a response. This is because traditional dental pulp testi ng reflects nerve response. However, vitality of any tissue is a matter of blood supply and perfusion, not of nerv e response. This is because nerves are the most radiation re sistant tissues and the pulpal endorgans actually arise in the Gasserian ganglion, well outside the field of radiation. Therefore the irradiated teeth may respond to pulp te sting but actually be nonvital due avascular necrosis of the pulpal tissues, and this would include the odontoblasts. When the pulp is examined histologically, it is avascular and exhibits the three-H tissue of radiation damage. With the death of the odontoblasts, the de ntine tubules dry out and the dentine component of the teeth shrinks, causing a w eakening in the dentinoenamel junction and subsequent undermining and fracturing or the thin enamel at the neck of the tooth. Marx 19 states that those teeth that receive mo re than 60 Gy are most at risk of developing radiation caries and even the best oral hygiene , dental care and fluoride carriers will not prevent all radiation caries. In patients who have had TRT + HBO (using present HBO protocols of a least 6 months post TRT), the author's recomme ndations for dental treatment are: 1. Where patients have poor oral hygien e and are judged unlikely to respond to conservative measures, then, at least all t eeth in the line of th e radiotherapy beam should be removed or a complete clearan ce of all teeth should be carried out. 1982. Where patients have a high standard of oral hygiene and are judged likely to respond to conservative measures, then the recommendations should include education in diet and dental caries aetiology, salivary stim ulants and vigorous oral hygiene measures. Where radiation caries co ntinues to occur despite conservative measures, then small cavities can be restor ed using standard a dhesive restorative materials. Where caries becomes extensive, then the patient's teeth should be treated by full crown coverage of teeth, as is done in conditions such as dentinogenesis imperfecta. Although the pulp and all its contents, incl uding the odontoblasts, are removed during endodontic therapy and the te eth do become discol oured and brittle, clinically the dentine does not seem to shrink when it is exposed to TRT. The caries pattern in endodontically treated teeth is also seen to pres ent clinically as conventional caries. It would seem reas onable that Endodontic treatment, carried out early after completion of TRT, may limit dentinal changes due the fibrous of the pulp and dehydration and theref ore teeth may be maintained by full crown coverage. Where at least 6 months have elapsed since completion of TRT, the radiation changes to the pulp and dehydration of the dentine, with subsequent undermining and fractioning of enamel, particularly around the gingival margins, will result in the bulk of the tooth structure reaching a st eady state of mass. Th e teeth can then be crowned, provided there is no pulp necrosis and subsequent periapical pathology. 3. The use of fluoride would seem to play lit tle part in the prev ention of radiation caries as it does not address the fundamental process seen in this pathological process. As stated previously, radiati on caries arises primarily through a shearing effect of the dentinoenamel junction at th e neck of the tooth as a result of the shrinkage of the dentine, w ith resultant undermining of the overlying enamel which then fractures off. Radiation caries is ther efore not primarily a chemical subsurface 199decalcification process but a physical shea ring separation of the two principal crystal structures that make up the bulk of tooth substance. 6.4 FUTURE DIRECTION FOR RESEARCH 6.4.1 FOLLOWUP STUDIES 1. A more in-depth analysis of the basic histological material is planned to be undertaken using immunohistoche mistry, since the presence of a number of the key biological markers may be detected in the paraffin-embedded slides. These will include:- i. PDGF (Platelet Derived Growth Factor) receptor protein I, ii. Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta1, iii. PDGF-beta, iv. Vascular endothelial gr owth factor (VEGF). 2. The same paraffin-embedded slide material will also be used to undertake apoptosis studies, the presence of nitric oxide and P53. 6.4.2 HUMAN TRIALS 1. Based on the evidence of this study and the increasing evidence in the literature of the place of Hyperoxia in wound healing, a study involving human subjects will be developed which will involve patients underg oing HBOT for four weeks, beginning one week after completion of TRT. This will initially involve follow up biopsies of both salivary gland and bone tissues , taken pre- and post- TRT. 2. Follow up studies in the recommendations for dental treatment of patients undergoing TRT need to be carried out comp aring the use of full crown coverage of teeth affected by TRT and those teet h not in the field of irradiation. 2003. A study will be developed to look at the difference in response of tooth crystal structure between teeth in the line if ir radiation and teeth that have undergone endodontic treatment. 6.4.3 USE OF HBO TO SENSITISE TUMOURS AND REDUCE COMPLICATIONS OF RADIOTHERAPY Radiation may damage cells in two basis ways: 1. Direct damage to DNA by causing a change in the molecular structure. 2. Indirect damage to DNA by producing interm ediary radiation products, such as the photons interacting with water to produce fr ee radicals, which then react with the DNA molecule. Although the free radica ls are relatively short-live d, they can interact with the DNA causing a detrimental effect, or, conver sely, can react innocently and revert to their former state. The likelihood of interac tion verses reversion can be modified by reaction with molecular oxygen, which would favour prolongi ng the life of a reactive species, or by reaction with sulfhydryl compounds, which w ill reduce the free radical life span by combining with them to return to innocuous substances. 75 The prolonging of reactive species in the presence of oxygen would expl ain the finding that TRT is more effective in the presence of HBOT. From the beginning, the literature on TR T has shown that HBO improves tumour oxygenation, and treatment with HBO during irradiation has been shown to improve the radiation response of many solid tum ours, thereby allowing a reduction in the amount of radiation required for treatment. 181,357,358 In 1978, the Medical Research Council Working Party of the United Kingdom coordinated randomised clinical trials to assess HBO as a sensitiser in radiothe rapy. They found that HBOT significantly improved both survival and local tumour c ontrol after radiotherapy for head-and-neck 201tumours and for advanced carcinoma of the cervix, but did not report on the complications associated with TRT. Recent literature359,.360 has also shown improved tumour response to TRT and chemotherapy under the influence of HBOT. Therefore a useful study would be to combine the TR T and HBO treatments by carrying out both treatments at one time. This could be done by administering the TRT to a patient who was contained in a one man HBOT chamber. These chambers have a glass lid and by using a multibeam TRT protocol the patient could receive a lower dose of TRT due to the HBOT sensitising the tumour and in addition the HBO would possibly reduce the side effects of the TRT as shown in th e study above. This would reduce the overall treatment time and the reduction in radiati on dose, combined with the HBOT would reduce the side effects of the TRT. 6.5 CONCLUSION It is now becoming increasingly apparent that hyperoxia also induces a distinct set of cellular responses. As HBOT has been show n to modify the expression of VEGF and PDGF receptors, it has been suggested by Davidson and Mustoe,226 and Hunt et al339 that hyperoxia may act via an oxygen sensing transduction pathway to impact on other important regulators of cell growth and metabolism. The experimental data mentioned above support the hypothesis that transient hyperoxia, when given as 20 intermittent daily HBOT, started one week after completion of TRT, functions as an intracellular signal tran sduction agent or modulator of gene function via more than one signa lling pathway in addition to supplying the critical element for cellular respiration; and reduces some of the side effects of radiotherapy. At this point in time two things are certai n. One is that oxygen supplied under hyperbaric conditions is more than nutrition for oxygen starved cells. The other 202is that HBOT does reduce some of the side effects of TRT when given one week after completion of the radiothera py. The implications of be ing able to prevent the complications of TRT, rather than treati ng them as is currently practiced, are far reaching. Prevention of the complications of TRT will go a long way to improving the quality of life of patients who undergo this form of cancer treatment. These patients will therefore not loose specialized tissues su ch as salivary gland and bone, and this will impact on their ability to retain th eir teeth and salivary gland function. The patients will then be able to be treated in a normal fashion by dentists and not have to undergo removal of all teeth as a preventive measure. In additi on, the implication of the continued growth of teeth in irradiated animals, when treated early with HBOT, as found in this study, suggests a protective m echanism which may be extrapolated to other tissues such as bone and muscle and will need fu rther investigation. Children receiving TRT, for conditions such as Rhabdomyosarcoma, may be cured by the treatment but are left with loss of continued growth of all tissues in the treatment area. Early treatment with HBOT, as found in this study with teeth, ma y well benefit these children with continued growth of the normal tissues in the treated area. Obviously much further investigation needs to be done in this area but this study has certainly indicated that treatment with HBO reduces the acute inflammatory damage caused by the TRT and thereby preservation of special ized tissues, which in turn, leads to a reduction in the long term compli cations associated with TRT. In summary, this experimental model has fu lfilled its prime object ive of demonstrating that HBOT is effective in reducing the long- term side effects of therapeutic radiation treatment in normal tissue, when 20 intermittent daily HBOT are started one week after the completion of the radiation treatment and statistically disproves the Null Hypothesis that there is no di fference in the incidence of postoperative complications or morbidity of TRT when HBOT is given a week after completion of TRT. 203 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.

Hyperbaric oxygen and malignancies: a potential ro le in radiotherapy, hyperbaric 1 DEFINITIONS USED IN RADIATION THERAPY Radiation: is the transfer of energy in the form of particles or waves. Irradiation - The act of irradiating or the conditi on of being irradiated. In medicine it is the therapy or treatmen t by exposure to radiation. Electromagnetic Radiation Electromagnetic radiation is divided into two types: gamma and roentgen radiation. They differ only in the way in which th ey are produced. Gamma rays are produced intranuclearly while roentgen rays are produ ced extranuclearly. In practice, this means that gamma rays used in radiation thera py are produced by the decay of radioactive isotopes and that almost all of the roentgen rays produced in radiat ion therapy are those made by electrical machines. Roentgen rays are now referred to as x-rays. The fundamental quantity necessary to describe the interaction of radiation with matter is the amount of energy absorb ed per unit mass. This quanti ty is called absorbed dose, and the rad is the most commonly used unit. In currently recomm ended nomenclature, absorbed dose is measured in joules per kilogram. A special name for one joule/kg is the Gray (1 Gray = 100 rad). The roentgen (R ) is a unit of x-rays or gamma rays based on the ability of radiation to ionize air. At the energies used in ra diation therapy, 1 R of x-ray or gamma ray results in a dose of so mewhat less than one rad (0.01 Gy) in soft tissue. The different ranges of electromagnetic radia tions used in clinical practice are: a) superficial radiation, using radiation from ap proximately 10 to 125KeV, 244b) orthovoltage radiation, using radiation from 125 to 400 KeV, c) supervoltage radiation for those energies above 400 KeV. kVp - kilovolt peak or kilovolt potential. Th e voltage (kVp) primarily determines the maximum X-ray energy produced but also infl uences the number of X-rays produced. Gy - Gray - The Standard International Unit of absorbed dose of ionising radiation equal to the energy in joules absorbed by one kilogram of irradiated material. The X-ray machine output is described in te rms of Entrance Skin Exposure (ESE) and is the amount of radiation delivered to the pa tient's skin at the poi nt of entry of the X- ray beam into the patient. The unit for ESE are Roentgens (R) (or C/kg air in SI units). The unit Roentgen is defined in terms of charge (Coulombs) created by ionizing radiation per unit mass (kg) of air (1 R =2.58 * 10 -4 C/kg air). The radiation exposure can also be measured at ot her locations and is the quant ity indicated by many radiation detectors such as Geiger-Muller meters . This unit recognizes Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen (R\u00f6ntgen), who invented (discove red) X-rays, and gave this technology to the world without personal prof it The unit Roentgen is only defined for air and can not be used to describe dose to tissue. Radiation dose is the energy (joules) imparted per unit mass of tissue and has the US units of rad (r adiation a bsorbed d ose). Patient exposures, particularly in Radi ation Oncology are described in units of radiation dose. There is an international (S I) unit for dose termed the Gray (Gy). The conversion between the units is: 100 rad = 1 Gy. The biological effectiveness of ra diations vary. The unit rem (r adiation e quivalent man, now person) is used to compare dose re ceived by different types of radiations (e.g. alpha particles) which ha ve a different capacity fo r causing harm than X-ray radiation. This unit is prope rly termed dose equivalent. The dose equivalent is the 245product of the dose times a quality factor. O ccupational radiation exposure is described in terms of dose equivalent. There is an international (SI) unit for dose equivalent termed the Sievert (Sv). The conversi on between the units is: 100 rem = 1 Sv. Electron volt: Commonly used unit of energy in atomic and nuclear physics. An electron volt is the kinetic energy gained by an electron or other simply charged particles when passing through a voltage differe nce of 1 Volt in vacuum. 1 eV is equal to the energy of 1.602 x 10-19 J. Derived greater unit: Kiloelectron volt (keV) = 1,000 USED (human erythrocyte catalase: PDB 1DGF, EC 1.11.1.6) is a common enzyme found in living organisms. Its functions include catalysing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water a nd oxygen. Catalase has one of the highest turnover rates for all enzymes; one molecule of catalase can convert 6 million molecules of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen each minute. Catalase is a tetramer of 4 polypeptide chains which are at least 500 amino acids in length. Within this tetramer there are 4 porphyrin haem (iron) groups which are what allows it to r eact with the hydrogen peroxide. Its optimum pH is in the alkaline range. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) include oxygen ions, fr ee radicals and peroxides both inorganic and organic. They are generally very small molecules and are highly reactive due to the presence of unpaired valence shell electrons. ROSs form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen but can damage cell membranes by causing oxidative stress. Cells are normally ab le to defend themselves against ROS damage through the use of the enzymes s uperoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase . 246The effects of ROS on cell metabolism have been well documented in a variety of species. These include not only roles in programmed cell death and apoptosis, but also positive effects such as the induction of host defence genes and mobilisation of ion transport systems. This is implicating them more frequently with roles in 'oxidative signalling'. NAD - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; a coenzyme occurring in most living cells and used as an oxidizing or reducing agent in various metabolic processes. NADH - The reduced form of NAD. Smad - These are proteins that are homologs of both the drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD) and the C. elegans protein SMA. The name is a combination of the two. During Drosophila research, it was found that a mutation in the gene, MAD , in the mother, repressed the gene , decapentaplegic in the embryo. The phrase \"Mothers against\" was added since mothers often form organizations opposing various issues eg. Mothers Ag ainst Drunk Driving or (MADD). 247APPENDIX 2 THE MARX PROTOCOL FOR ESTA BLISHED OSTEORADIONECROSIS Stage I: All patients are initially placed in Stage I except those with advanced disease. Initial trial of 30 HBOT sessions. Only use antibiotic if evidence of soft tissue infection. No surgery or debridement other than irrigation and removal of sequested, mobile bone fragments. After 30 HBOT sessions examine bone for re sponse. If the tissu e is assessed as responding, the softened bone is removed and the patient allowed to undergo an additional 10 sessions of HBOT. If the wound responds with complete he aling without further treatment the patient is termed a Stage I Responder. If the exposed bone shows no sign of re sponse after 30 sessi ons of HBOT the patient is termed a Stage I Nonres ponder and advanced to Stage II. Stage II: All patients who have not res ponded to the initial 30 treatments with significant improvement or resolution. Patients already have received 30 sessions of HBOT. Surgical removal of exposed bone - using saline cooled saw rather than a heat generating bur. 248 Following surgery the patients will comp lete the final 10 sessions of HBOT. If the patient heals without further bone exposure, the patient is termed a Stage II Responder. If the wound dehisces e xposing bone once again, the patient is termed a Stage II Nonresponder and is a dvanced to Stage II. Stage III: Patients with pathological fracture, oral/cutaneous fistula or radiographic evidence of full thicknes s bone loss usuall y go to a mandibular resection and reconstruction. Patients who have failed to respond to Stage I or II. Patients who initially present with an oroc utaneous fistula, pa thological fracture or radiographically evident osteolysis to the inferior mandibular border. To great a quantity of nonviable bone to respond to HBOT alone or combined with limited surgical debridement. Patient has already receiv ed 30 sessions of HBOT. The patient then undergoes transoral rese ction of the involv ed portion of the mandible and excision of any necrotic soft tissue. The patient then undergoes th e final 10 sessions of HBOT. Most patients undergo the bony reconstr uction of the jaw at three months. 249APPENDIX 3 LIST OF LEADERS IN THE FIELD OF HYPERBARIC MEDICINE AND WOUND HEALING WITH WHICH TH E AUTHOR PERSONALLY MET AND DISCUSSED THE PROPOSED THESIS. 1.

The secretory unit is the acinus, which is made of either se rous cells (serous acini) or mucous cells H & E prepar ations, serous cells can generally be distinguished from mucous ce lls by the deep staining of the cytoplasm of the serous cell in contrast to the empty or washed out appearance of the mucous cell - a characteristic feature due to loss of the st ored mucinogen granules from the cell during preparation. A second distinguishing feature re lates to nuclear shape. The nuclei of the mucous cells are typically flattened against the base of the cell, whereas the nuclei of the serous cells are rounded. 160 magnification: The submandibular glands contai n both serous humans the serous components predominate. The Intercalated Ducts are the initial ducts leading from the acinus. They are sm all and possess a flat tened to cuboidal epithelium and exhibit a distinct lumen. In tercalated ducts merge to form larger Striated Ducts. These ducts have an epithelium of low to tall columnar cells and, at high magnification, show basal striations. Striat ed ducts join to form Excretory Ducts. The Excretory Duct is characterized by a wi der lumen and taller columnar epithelium. As the excretory ducts increase in size, the epithelium becomes pseudostratified and finally stratified in the main excretory ducts. 400 magnification: The individual mucous cells e xhibit distinct boundaries. The nuclei are flattened (except for those that are sectioned tangentially). In contrast, the cytoplasm of the serous cells stains deep ly, and the nuclei are ovoid or round. Serous cells are found forming a cap known as a \"s erous demilune\" on the periphery on many of the mucous acini. The cells of the serous demilune secrete via channels between the 275mucous cells, thereby allowing the secretory product to reach the lumen of the acinus and mix with the mucous ciated with the ac inar epithelium are myoepithelial cells. They are located between the basal aspect of the secretory cells and the basal lamina. Myoepithelial cells are difficult to identify in H & E sections.
