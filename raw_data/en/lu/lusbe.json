How We Chose These Clinics as the Best Portland Naturopaths You're likely wondering how we choose the naturopaths found on this list. For starters, we only selected candidates that were properly licensed to practice naturopathy in Oregon. This helps us root out some potential fraudsters with little to no knowledge of naturopathy. Next, we look at the types of services and problems that naturopaths help solve. A good naturopath clinic will help cater to whatever problems you're experiencing, whether that's chronic pain or mental illness. We also appreciate naturopaths that merge modern medicine with more traditional wellness techniques. Covering both bases gives these professionals the best chance to treat whatever it is ailing you. Lastly, we make sure that naturopaths are affordable. Sadly, it's common for many insurance types not to accept naturopath services. So, since people often pay out of pocket, naturopaths need to price their services reasonably. These combined factors helped us decide that the five naturopaths on this list are the best in Portland. Are Naturopathic Doctors Licensed in Oregon? An individual will require a license to practice (or even attempt to practice) naturopathic medicine in the state of Oregon. That means that if any Portland naturopath you encounter doesn't have a license, you should avoid them. Moreover, a naturopath professional can only offer services related to naturopathic medicine. If they claim to practice anything without the proper licensure, it's illegal. Does Medicare Cover Naturopathic Doctors in Oregon? Despite the increasing popularity of naturopathic medicine in the United States, the healthcare system still needs to catch up. That's apparent in the lack of Medicare coverage for naturopathic doctors in Oregon. Sadly, Medicare only occasionally covers things like acupuncture, herbal treatments, nutritional therapies, and massage therapy. However, there is one silver lining. Medicare usually covers forms of osteopathic medicine. Because osteopathic doctors are licensed physicians, there's a good chance that your Medicare benefits will cover their services. What Is the Difference Between a Holistic Doctor and a Naturopathic Doctor? Many people confuse holistic doctors with naturopathic ones, but the two are quite distinct. Holistic doctors believe that individuals are made up of various interdependent parts. These parts include the body, mind, emotions, and spirit. These professionals think that when one part is out of order, it goes on to affect the other parts. As such, the secret to a healthy, holistic life is ensuring that all of these parts are healthy. Naturopathic doctors, on the other hand, function more similarly to medical professionals. They look at risk factors that you're experiencing, whether hereditary or lifestyle, and work with you to prevent potential diseases and conditions. They also treat certain illnesses with less invasive measures than traditional doctors. Can Naturopaths Write Prescriptions? Whether or not a naturopath can prescribe drugs ultimately depends on the state they're practicing. The good news is that in the form of Oregon, naturopathic doctors have been approved to offer a comprehensive list of pharmaceutical drugs if needed. However, it's important to note that naturopaths prefer more natural alternatives before turning to synthetic drugs. So if you want a quick prescription for your condition, we recommend seeing a traditional physician instead. What Is a Naturopath Good For? A Portland naturopath can be good for a variety of different conditions. Regardless of your struggle, it's worth consulting one of these professionals to see if they can help. That being said, there are loads of common conditions that naturopaths are often sought out for. Some of these conditions include: - Frequent or painful headaches - Obesity and nutritional-related conditions - Fertility challenges - Chronic fatigue syndrome - Digestive issues - Allergies - Chronic pain - Hormonal imbalance problems So if you struggle with any of these conditions, consider scheduling an appointment with one of the naturopaths on this list. Should I See a Naturopath or Nutritionist? Both naturopaths and nutritionists can help you with your diet and weight concerns. But which one should you see? And what are the differences? Generally speaking, both of these professionals have similar training but approach treatment slightly differently. Nutritionists specialize in analyzing diets and providing nutritional advice. Naturopaths specialize in diagnosing and treating certain types of conditions, including ones related to nutrition and obesity. As an example, let's say you want to lose some weight but have trouble. A nutritionist will analyze your diet and put you on a food plan to help. However, naturopaths will usually try to look for the underlying reason why you aren't losing weight. While nutritionists are better at complete diet analysis, naturopaths might be preferable for more holistic healing. What Do I Need to Know Before Seeing a Naturopath? You're likely quite curious about what to expect if it's your first time seeing a naturopath. It's important to note that every naturopath is different. However, most first visits tend to look the same. Your naturopath will want a better sense of your medical history and the current problems you might be facing. As such, you should expect a physical examination for your first visit. It would help if you also listed everything that you currently take, both synthetic medications and any natural supplements. Lastly, getting blood and urine tests done before the appointment can be a good idea. This will help the professional get a better sense of potential hormonal or immune system problems. What Kind of Medicine Do Naturopaths Use? As we mentioned, naturopaths in Oregon can prescribe a wide array of synthetic drugs. That being said, it's more common to see other forms of medicine and treatments used first. Some common ones include: - Nutritional diet plans - Essential oils - Supplements - Massage therapy - Exercise - Herbs - Acupuncture Treatment plans will vary depending on what type of condition you're trying to treat, so consult with your ND today. Why You Should Seek Out Naturopathy Services While modern medicine is a feat of human ingenuity, the medical industry can still be impartial. The last thing you need in your goal of a higher quality of life is to be treated like a number. Naturopathy blends several treatments with your individuality to create a practical package. You will receive the benefits of ancient treatments right alongside current medical advances.
