The present invention is further directed to CD 16 Binding Molecules that are capable of binding an epitope of human CD 16 and one or more epitope(s) of a Disease Antigen (\"DA\") (e.g., a \"CD16 x DA Binding Molecule\" ).

The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions that comprise such molecule(s). WO 2019/118266 2PCT/US2018/064204 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] The mammalian immune system serves as a defense against a variety of conditions, including, e.g., injury, infection and neoplasia. The efficiency with which humans and other mammals develop an immunological response to pathogens, foreign substances and cancer antigens rests on two characteristics: the exquisite specificity of the immune response for antigen recognition, and the immunological memory that allows for faster and more vigorous responses upon re-activation with the same antigen (Portoles, P. et al. (2009) \" The TCRJCD3 Complex: Opening the Gate to Successful Vaccinationf Current Pharmaceutical Design 15:3290-3300; Guy, C.S. et al. (2009) \"Organization of Proximal TCR:CD3 S.L. et al. (2015) Checkpoint Blockade: A Common Denominator Approach to Cancer Therapyf Cancer Cell 27:450-461). [0005] In healthy individuals, the immune system is in a quiescent state, inhibited by a repertoire of diverse inhibitory receptors and receptor ligands. Upon recognition of a cancer antigen, microbial pathogen, or an allergen, an array of activating receptors and receptor ligands are triggered to induce the activation of the immune system. Such activation leads to the activation of macrophages, Natural Killer (NK) cells and antigen- specific, cytotoxic, T-cells, and promotes the release of various cytokines, all of which act to counter the perceived threat to the health of the subject (Dong, C. et al. (2003) iiImmune Regulation by Novel Costimulatory Moleculesf Immunolog. Immunotherapyf Adv. Immunol. 90:297- 339). The immune system is capable of returning to its normal quiescent state when the countervailing inhibitory immune signals outweigh the activating immune signals. [0006] Thus, the disease state of cancer (and indeed the disease states of infectious diseases) may be considered to reflect a failure to adequately activate a subject 's immune system. Such failure may reflect an inadequate presentation of activating immune signals, or it may reflect an inadequate ability to alleviate inhibitory immune signals in the subject. In some instances, researchers have determined that cancer cells can co-opt the immune system to evade being detected by the immune system (Topalian, S.L. etal. (2015) iiImmune Checkpoint Blockade: A Common Denominator Cancer Therapyf Cancer Cell 27:450-461). WO 2019/118266 3PCT/US2018/064204 [0007] Among the receptors involved in the activation of the immune system are the Fc Receptors: CD 16, CD32 and CD64. These Fc receptors are found on the surfaces of multiple types of immune system cells (e.g., B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and mast cells). Such receptors have an \"extracellular \" portion (which is thus capable of ligating to an Fc Domain), a \"transmembrane \" portion (which extends through the cellular membrane), and a \"cytoplasmic \" portion (positioned inside the cell). Multiple types of Fc portion of IgG antibodies, thereby triggering the transduction of activating or inhibitory signals to the immune system. [0008] CD16 is a generic name for the activating Fc receptors, FcyRIIIA (CD16A) and FcyRIIIB (CD16B). These receptors bind the Fc portion of IgG antibodies, thereby triggering the release of cytokines. If such antibodies are bound to a Disease Antigen that is expressed on the surface of a cell (e.g., a cancer cell, pathogen-infected cell, etc.), then such release mediates the killing of the targeted cell. [0009] CD16A is expressed by Natural Killer (NK) cells and tissue macrophages that bind aggregated but not monomeric human IgG (Selvaraj, P. et al. (2004) iiFunctional Regulation Of Human Neutrophil Fc Gamma Receptors (U.S.A.) Miller, Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program. 2013:247-253; Youinou, al. (2002) iiPathogenic OfAnti-Fc Gamma Receptor IIIB (CD 16) Autoimmune Rev. 1(1-2):13-19; al. Targeting Cancer Cellsf Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30(4):507-511; Unkeless, J.C. et al. (1995) iiFunction Of Human Fc And Fe Gamma Semin. Immunol. [0010] The expression of CD16A by Natural Killer (NK) cells has particular relevance to the present invention, since such cells release cytokines when their CD 16 molecules bind to the Fc Domain of an antibody. Thus, when a natural antibody binds to a Disease Antigen of a target cell, its Fc Domain can be recognized by a CD16 molecule of a WO 2019/118266 4PCT/US2018/064204 Natural Killer cell, which then mediates the killing of the target cell. Since such killing is antibody-dependent, it is termed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC thus depends on a prior antibody response, and, as stated, requires the presence and participation of an FcyR-expressing effector cell (typically natural killer (NK) cells, but also macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils). CD16A signals ADCC through interactions with the CD protein of NK cells, and signals macrophage-mediated killing through interactions with macrophage FcyR chains. [0011] CD16A possesses two major polymorphic forms, F158 and V158, which differ by possessing a phenylalanine or a valine at residue 158 (shown as residue 160 of the extracellular domain of CD16A (Figure 7), which corresponds to residue 176 of the full- length protein (Wu, J. et al.

Although thought to be a decoy receptor, it can also transmit signals (Fernandes, M.J. (2005) iiSignaling Through CD 16b In Human Neutrophils Involves The Tec Family Of Tyrosine J. Leukoc.

In contrast, CD32B (FcyRIIB) is an inhibiting and Receptors And Their Polymorphic Blood. Gamma Receptors ,\" Immunol. Res. 29(1-3):219-230). [0015] The ability of the different FcyRs to mediate diametrically opposing functions reflects their structural differences, and in particular whether the FcyR possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (\"ITAM \") or an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based inhibitory motif (\"ITIM \"). The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the FcyR-mediated cellular responses. ITAM- containing FcyRs include FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIIA, and activate the immune system when bound to Fc Domains (e.g. , aggregated Fc Domains present in an immune complex). FcyRIIB is the only currently known natural ITIM-containing FcyR; it acts to dampen or inhibit the immune system when bound to aggregated Fc Domains. [0016] Although natural IgG antibodies directed to an epitope of a particular Disease Antigen possess Fc Domains that can interact with CD 16 molecules to activate a subject 's immune response, in the case of many diseases and many subjects, such immune system activation is not sufficient to provide an effective therapy for the disease. Thus, despite prior advances in identifying the molecules involved in mammalian immune responses, a need remains for improved therapies for treating cancers and infectious diseases. The CD 16-Binding Molecules of the present invention, and particularly, the CD16 x DA Binding Molecules of the present invention that comprise a CD 16 Binding Domain and a Binding Domain specific for a Disease Antigen expressed on a target cell are capable of co\u00ad localizing CD 16-expressing cells to the site(s) of cells expressing the Disease Antigen. Such co-localization enhances the ADCC-mediated killing of target cells by increasing the likelihood that an Fc portion of an antibody directed against an epitope of the Disease Antigen will bind to a CD 16-expressing effector cell and, via such Fc-CD 16 interaction, trigger immune system activation and the release of cytokines against the target cell. Thus, the present invention is directed to improving the activation of a subject 's immune response to a Disease antigen and other goals.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS: [0053] Figures 1A-1B provide a schematic of a representative covalently bonded diabody having two epitope-binding sites composed of two polypeptide chains, each having an E-coil or K-coil Heterodimer-Promoting Domain (alternative Heterodimer-Promoting Domains are provided below). A cysteine residue may be present in a linker (Figure 1A) and/or in the Heterodimer-Promoting Domain (Figure IB). VL and VH Domains that recognize the same epitope are shown using the same shading or fill pattern. The wavy line (VWWV) in this and all of the Figures providing schematic presentations of binding molecule domains represents one or more optional Heterodimer-Promoting Domains, that is/are preferably present. [0054] Figure 2 provides a schematic of a representative covalently bonded diabody molecule having two epitope-binding sites composed of two polypeptide chains, each having a CH2 and CH3 Domain, such that the associated chains form all or part of an Fc Region. VL and VH Domains that recognize the same epitope are shown using the same shading or fill pattern. [0055] Figures 3A-3E provide schematics showing representative covalently bonded tetravalent diabodies having four epitope-binding sites composed of two pairs of polypeptide chains (i.e., four polypeptide chains in all). One polypeptide chain of each pair possesses a CH2 and CH3 Domain, such that the associated chains form all or part of an Fc Region. VL and VH Domains that recognize the same epitope are shown using the same shading or fill pattern. The two pairs of polypeptide chains may be same. In such embodiments, wherein the two pairs of polypeptide chains are the same and the VL and VH Domains recognize different epitopes (as shown in Figures 3A-3B), the resulting molecule possesses four epitope-binding sites and is bispecific and bivalent with respect to each bound epitope. In such embodiments, wherein the VL and VH Domains recognize the same epitope (e.g., the same VL Domain CDRs and the same VH Domain CDRs are used on both chains) the resulting molecule possesses four epitope-binding sites and is monospecific and tetravalent with respect to a single epitope. Alternatively, the two pairs of polypeptides may be different. In such embodiments, wherein the two pairs of polypeptide chains are different and the VL and VH Domains of each pair of polypeptides recognize different epitopes (as WO 2019/118266 17PCT/US2018/064204 shown by the different shading and patterns in Figure 3C), the resulting molecule possesses four epitope-binding sites and is tetraspecific and monovalent with respect to each bound epitope. Figure 3A shows an Fc Region-containing diabody which contains peptide Heterodimer-Promoting Domain residue. Figure 3B Region-containing diabody, E-coil and Heterodimer-Promoting Domains comprising a cysteine residue and a linker (with an optional cysteine residue). Figure 3C, shows an Fc-Region-Containing diabody, which contains antibody CHl and CL domains. Figures 3D-3E illustrate how selection of the binding domains shown in Figure 3B can result in a CD16 X DA Binding Molecule having two binding sites specific for an epitope of CD 16 and two binding sites specific for an epitope of a DA. Figures 3D-3E illustrate non-limiting examples of how domains may be selected to yield CD16 x DA Binding Molecules having differing orientations (i.e., Figure 3D employs, a VL CD16 Domain as the VLl Domain of the Binding Molecule, a VH CD16 Domain as the VHl Domain of the Binding Molecule, a VL DA Domain as the VL2 Domain of the Binding Molecule, and a VH DA Domain as the VH2 Domain of the Binding Molecule. In contrast, Figure 3E employs, a VL DA Domain as the VLl Domain of the Binding Molecule, a VH DA Domain as the VHl Domain of the Binding Molecule, a VL CD 16 Domain as the VL2 Domain of the Binding Molecule, and a VH CD 16 Domain as the VH2 Domain of the Binding Molecule). As provided below, the VL/VH binding sites formed by the association of the polypeptide chains may be the same or different so as to permit tetravalent binding that is monospecific, bispecific, a representative covalently bonded diabody molecule having two epitope-binding sites composed of three polypeptide chains. Two of the polypeptide chains possess a CH2 and CH3 Domain, such that the associated chains form all or part of an Fc Region. The polypeptide chains comprising the VL and VH Domain further comprise a Heterodimer-Promoting Domain. VL and VH Domains that recognize the same epitope are shown using the same shading or fill pattern. [0057] Figures 5A-5D provide schematics of a representative covalently bonded Binding Molecule having four epitope-binding sites composed of five polypeptide chains. Figure 5A shows the general structure of such a CD16 X DA Binding Molecule.

Figure 5C shows the structure of an alternative CD16 X DA Binding Molecule in which the variable domains shown in Figure 5A have been selected to yield a resultant CD16 x DA Binding Molecule that possesses two non-diabody type binding domains specific for CD 16 and two diabody-type binding domains specific for HER2/neu. Figure 5D shows the structure of an alternative CD16 X DA Binding Molecule in which the variable domains shown in Figure 5A have been selected to yield a resultant CD16 x DA Binding Molecule that possesses two non-diabody type binding domains specific for an epitope of CD16, one diabody-type binding domains specific for an epitope of HER2/neu and a second diabody-type binding domain specific for an epitope of CD 16. Such CD 16 epitopes may be the same or different. As will be appreciated, by proper selection of the binding domains shown in Figure 5A, any three of the binding domains could have been selected to bind an epitope of CD 16. Likewise, any three of the binding domains could have been selected to bind an epitope of HER2/neu. As provided below, the VL/VH binding sites formed by the association of the polypeptide chains may be the same or different so as to permit tetravalent binding that is monospecific, bispecific, trispecific molecules having three epitope-binding sites.

Figure 6D illustrates schematically the domains of trivalent binding molecules comprising two diabody-type binding domains and a Fab-type binding domain having different domain orientations in WO 2019/118266 19PCT/US2018/064204 which the diabody-type binding domains are N-terminal or C-terminal to an Fc Region. The molecules in Figures 6A-6D comprise four chains. Figures 6E and 6F, respectively, illustrate schematically the domains of trivalent binding molecules comprising two diabody- type binding domains N-terminal to an Fc Region, and a Fab-type binding domain in which the light chain and heavy chain are linked via a polypeptide spacer, or an scFv-type binding domain. The trivalent binding molecules in Figures 6G and 6H, respectively, illustrate schematically the domains of trivalent binding molecules comprising two diabody-type binding domains C-terminal to an Fc Region, and a Fab-type binding domain in which the light chain and heavy chain are linked via a polypeptide spacer, or an scFv-type binding domain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0073] The present invention is directed to molecules (e.g., an antibody, a diabody, an scFv, an antibody, a TandAb, etc.) capable of binding an epitope of human CD16 (a \"CD16 Binding Molecule\" ). The present invention is further directed to CD 16 Binding Molecules that are capable of binding an epitope of human CD 16 and one or more epitope(s) of a Disease Antigen (\"DA\") (e.g., a \"CD16 x DA Binding Molecule\" ). The present invention is particularly directed to such CD16 X DA Binding Molecules that are antibodies, or that comprise an Epitope Binding Domain thereof, or are diabodies (including DART\u00ae diabodies), bispecific antibodies, TandAbs, other multispecific binding molecules (e.g., trivalent TRIDENT molecules), etc. The invention particularly concerns CD16 X DA WO 2019/118266 23PCT/US2018/064204 Binding Molecules that are capable of binding a Disease Antigen that is a Cancer Antigen or a Pathogen-Associated Antigen in addition to being able to bind CD 16. The invention particularly concerns the use of such CD16 and CD16 X DA Binding Molecules in the treatment of cancer and pathogen-associated diseases. The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions that comprise such molecule(s). I. Antibodies and Other Binding Molecules A. Antibodies [0074] The CD16 X DA Binding Molecules of the present invention may be antibodies, or be derivable from antibodies (e.g., by fragmentation, cleavage, etc. of antibody polypeptides, or from use of the amino acid sequences of antibody molecules or of polynucleotides (or their sequences) that encode such polynucleotides, etc.). [0075] Antibodies are immunoglobulin molecules capable of specific binding to a particular domain or moiety or conformation (an \"epitope \") of a molecule, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc. An epitope-containing molecule may have immunogenic activity, such that it elicits an antibody production response in an animal; such molecules are termed \"antigens. \" As used herein, the terms \"antibody \" and \"antibodies \" refer to monoclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, synthetic antibodies, (sdFv), intrabodies, and Epitope Binding Domains of any of the above. Such Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgGi, IgG 2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAi and IgA 2) or subclass. [0076] The term \"monoclonal antibody \" refers to a homogeneous antibody population wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding of an antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single epitope (or antigenic site). The term \"monoclonal antibody \" encompasses not only intact monoclonal antibodies and full-length monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof as Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, (Fv), single-chain (scFv), mutants thereof, antibody monoclonal antibodies, chimeric monoclonal antibodies, and WO 2019/118266 24PCT/US2018/064204 any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity and the ability to bind to an antigen. It is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant expression, transgenic animals, etc.). The term includes whole immunoglobulins as well as the fragments etc. described above under the definition of \"antibody. \" Methods of making monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. One method which may be employed is the method of Kohler, G. et al. (1975) \"Continuous Cultures OfFused Cells Secreting Antibody Of Predefined Specifwityf Nature 256:495-497 or a modification thereof. Typically, monoclonal antibodies are developed in mice, rats or rabbits. The antibodies are produced by immunizing an animal with an immunogenic amount of cells, cell extracts, or protein preparations that contain the desired epitope. The immunogen can be, but is not limited to, primary cells, cultured cell lines, cancerous cells, proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, or tissue. Cells used for immunization may be cultured for a period of time (e.g. , at least 24 hours) prior to their use as an immunogen. Cells may be used as immunogens by themselves or in combination with a non-denaturing adjuvant, such as Ribi (see, e.g. , Jennings, V.M. (1995) uReview of Selected Adjuvants Used in Antibody Productionf ILAR J. 37(3):119-125). In general, cells should be kept intact and preferably viable when used as immunogens. Intact cells may allow antigens to be better detected than ruptured cells by the immunized animal. Use of denaturing or harsh adjuvants, e.g. , Freund 's adjuvant, may rupture cells and therefore is discouraged. The immunogen may be administered multiple times at periodic intervals such as, bi weekly, or weekly, or may be administered in such a way as to maintain viability in the animal (e.g. , in a tissue recombinant). Alternatively, existing monoclonal antibodies and any other equivalent antibodies that are immunospecific for a desired pathogenic epitope can be sequenced and produced recombinantly by any means known in the art. In one embodiment, such an antibody is sequenced and the polynucleotide sequence is then cloned into a vector for expression or propagation. The sequence encoding the antibody of interest may be maintained in a vector in a host cell and the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use. The polynucleotide sequence of such antibodies may be used for genetic manipulation to generate the monospecific or multispecific (e.g. , bispecific, trispecific and tetraspecific) molecules of the invention as well as an affinity optimized, a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody, and/or a caninized antibody, to improve the affinity, or other characteristics of the antibody as detailed below. WO 2019/118266 25PCT/US2018/064204 [0077] Antibodies and the Binding Molecules of the present invention bind epitopes via their Binding Domains in an \"immunospecific \" manner. As used herein, a molecule is said to bind an epitope of another molecule in an immunospecific manner (or \"immunospecifically \") if it binds or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with that epitope relative to alternative epitopes. For example, an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a viral epitope is an antibody that binds this viral epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it immunospecifically binds to other viral epitopes or non-viral epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that immunospecifically binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind a second target. As such, \"immunospecific binding \" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means \"immunospecific \" binding. Natural antibodies are capable of binding to only one epitope species {i.e., they are \"monospecific \"), although they can immunospecifically bind multiple copies of that species (i.e., exhibiting \"bivalency \" or \"multivalency \"). Two molecules are said to be capable of binding one another in a \"physiospecific \" manner, if such binding exhibits the specificity with which receptors bind their respective ligands. [0078] The last few decades have seen a revival of interest in the therapeutic potential of antibodies, and antibodies have become one of the leading classes of biotechnology- derived drugs (Chan, C.E. et al. (2009) iiThe Use Of Antibodies In The Treatment Of Infectious Diseasesf Singapore Med. J. 50(7):663-666). Over 200 antibody-based drugs have been approved for use or are under development. 1. General Structural Attributes of Antibodies [0079] The basic structural unit of naturally occurring immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG) is a tetramer composed of two shorter \"Light Chains \" complexed with two longer \"Heavy Chains \" and is usually expressed as a glycoprotein of about 150,000 Da. Each chain is composed of an amino-terminal (\"N-terminal \") portion that comprises a \"Variable Domain \" and a carboxy-terminal (\"C-terminal \") portion that comprises at least one \"Constant Domain. \" An IgGLight Chain is composed of a single \"Light Chain Variable Domain \" (\"VL\") and a single \"Light Chain Constant Domain \" (\"CL\"). Thus, the structure of the light chains of an IgG molecule is n-VL-CL-c (where n and c represent, WO 2019/118266 26PCT/US2018/064204 respectively, the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the polypeptide). An IgG Heavy Chain is composed of a single \"Heavy Chain Variable Domain \" (\"VH\"), three \"Heavy Chain Constant Domains \" (\"CHI, \" \"CH2 \" and \"CH3 \"), and a \"Hinge \" Region (\"H\"), located between the CHl and CH2 Domains. Thus, the structure of an IgG heavy chain is n-VH- CHl-H-CH2-CH3-c (where n and c represent, respectively, the N-terminus and the C- terminus of the polypeptide). The ability of an intact, unmodified antibody (e.g., an IgG antibody) to bind an epitope of an antigen depends upon the presence and sequences of the Variable Domains. Unless specifically noted, the order of domains of the protein molecules described herein is in the \"N-terminal to C-terminal \" direction. (a) Constant Domains (i) Light Chain Constant Domain [0080] A preferred CL Domain is a human IgG CL Kappa Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human CL Kappa Domain is a human IgG CL Lambda Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human CL Lambda Domain CHl Domains [0082] The CHl Domains of the two Heavy Chains of an antibody complex with the antibody 's Light Chain 's \"CL\" constant region, and are attached to the Heavy Chains CH2 Domains via an intervening Hinge Domain. [0083] An exemplary CHl Domain is a human IgGl CHl Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgGl CHl Domain CHl Domain is a human IgG2 CHl Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgG2 CHl Domain exemplary CHl Domain is a human IgG3 CHl Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgG3 CHl Domain CHl Domain is a human IgG4 CHl Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgG4 CHl Domain Chain Hinge Regions [0087] One exemplary Hinge Domain is a human IgGl Hinge Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgGl Hinge Domain is (SEQ ID NO:7): EPKSCDKTHTCPPCP . [0088] Another exemplary Hinge Domain is a human IgG2 Hinge Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgG2 Hinge Domain is (SEQ ID NO:8): ERKCCVECPPCP . [0089] Another exemplary Hinge Domain is a human IgG3 Hinge Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgG2 Hinge Domain Domain is a human IgG4 Hinge Domain. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human IgG4 Hinge Domain is (SEQ ID NO: 10): ESKYGPPCPSCP. As described herein, an IgG4 Hinge Domain may comprise a stabilizing mutation such as the S228P substitution. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary S228P- stabilized human IgG4 Hinge Domain is (SEQ ID NO:ll): ESKYGPPCPPCP. (c) Heavy CH2 and CH3 Domains [0091] The CH2 and CH3 Domains of the two heavy chains interact to form the \"Fc Domain \" of IgG antibodies that is recognized by cellular Fc Receptors, including but not limited to Fc gamma Receptors (FcyRs). As used herein, the term \"Fc Region \" is used to define a C-terminal region of an IgG heavy chain. A portion of an Fc Region (including a portion that encompasses an entire Fc Region) is referred to herein as an \"Fc Domain. \" An Fc Region is said to be of a particular IgG isotype, class or subclass if its amino acid sequence is most homologous to that isotype relative to other IgG isotypes. In addition to WO 2019/118266 28PCT/US2018/064204 their known uses in diagnostics, antibodies have been shown to be useful as therapeutic agents. [0092] The amino acid sequence of the CH2-CH3 Domain of an exemplary human IgGl is (SEQ ID NO:12): 231 240 250 260 270 280 APELLGGPSV FLFPPKPKDT LMISRTPEVT CVWDVS HED 440 447 ALHNHYTQKS LSLSPGX as by the EU index as set forth in Kabat, wherein X is lysine (K) or is absent.

[0094] The amino acid sequence of the CH2-CH3 Domain of an exemplary human IgG3 is (SEQ ID NO:14): 231 240 250 260 LMISRTPEVT CVWDVS HED PEVQFKWYVD GVEVHNAKTK 440 447 ALHNRFTQKS LSLSPGX as by the EU index as set forth in Kabat, wherein X is lysine (K) or is absent. [0095] The amino acid sequence of the CH2-CH3 Domain of an exemplary human IgG4 is (SEQ ID NO:15): 231 240 250 260 270 280 APEFLGGPSV FLFPPKPKDT LMISRTPEVT 440 447 ALHNHYTQKS LSLSLGX as by the EU index as set forth in Kabat, wherein X is lysine (K) or is absent. [0096] Throughout the present specification, the numbering of the residues in the constant region of an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al, SEQUENCES of Proteins of Immunological Interest , 5th Ed. Public Health Service, NH 1, MD (1991) (\"Kabat \"), expressly incorporated herein by reference. The term \"EU index as in Kabat \" refers to the numbering of the constant domains of human IgGl EU antibody. Amino acids from the Variable Domains of the mature heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins are also designated by the position of an amino acid in the chain. Kabat described numerous amino acid sequences for antibodies, identified an amino acid consensus sequence for each subgroup, and assigned a residue number to each amino acid, and the CDRs are identified as defined by Kabat (it will be understood that CDR hI as defined by Chothia, C. & Lesk, A. M. ((1987) \"Canonical Structures For The Hypervariable Regions Of WO 2019/118266 30PCT/US2018/064204 Immunoglobulins ,\" J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917) begins five residues earlier). Rabat 's numbering scheme is extendible to antibodies not included in his compendium by aligning the antibody in question with one of the consensus sequences in Rabat by reference to conserved amino acids. This method for assigning residue numbers has become standard in the field and readily identifies amino acids at equivalent positions in different antibodies, including chimeric or humanized variants. For example, an amino acid at position 50 of a human antibody light chain occupies the equivalent position to an amino acid at position 50 of a mouse antibody light chain. [0097] Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of different positions within antibody constant regions (e.g. , Fc positions, including but not limited to positions 270, 272, 312, 315, 356, and 358 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Rabat), and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art can exist. Polymorphic forms of human immunoglobulins have been well-characterized. At present, 18 Gm allotypes are known: Glm (1, 2, 3, 17) or Glm (a, x, f, z), G2m (23) or G2m (n), G3m (5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16,21,24, 26, 27, 28) or G3m Human IgG Molecular Analysis Oxford, pp. 43-78 Genet.: 50, 199-211). It is specifically contemplated that the antibodies of the present invention may incorporate any allotype, isoallotype, or haplotype of any immunoglobulin gene, and are not limited to the allotype, isoallotype or haplotype of the sequences provided herein. Furthermore, in some expression systems the C-terminal amino acid residue (bolded above) of the CH3 Domain may be post-translationally removed. Accordingly, the C-terminal residue of the CH3 Domain is an optional amino acid residue in the CD16 X DA Binding Molecules of the invention. Specifically encompassed by the instant invention are CD16 x DA Binding Molecules lacking the C-terminal residue of the CH3 Domain. Also specifically encompassed by the instant invention are such constructs comprising the C- terminal lysine residue of the CH3 Domain. (d) Variable Domains [0098] The Variable Domains of an IgG molecule consist of three \"complementarity determining regions \" (\"CDRs \"), which contain the amino acid residues of the antibody that will be in contact with the epitope, as well as intervening non-CDR segments, referred to as \"framework regions \" (\"FRs\"), which, in general maintain the structure and determine WO 2019/118266 31PCT/US2018/064204 the positioning of the CDR loops so as to permit such contacting (although certain framework residues may also contact the epitope). Thus, the VL and VH Domains have the structure n-FRl-CDRl-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4-c. The amino acid sequences of the CDRs determine whether an antibody will be able to bind to a particular epitope. Interaction of an antibody light chain with an antibody heavy chain and, in particular, interaction of their VL and VH Domains, forms an epitope-binding site of the antibody. [0099] Polypeptides that are (or may serve as) the first, second and third CDR of the Light Chain of an antibody are herein respectively designated as: CDR lI Domain, CDR l2 Domain, and CDR l3 Domain. Similarly, polypeptides that are (or may serve as) the first, second and third CDR of the Heavy Chain of an antibody are herein respectively designated as: CDR hI Domain, CDR h2 Domain, and CDR h3 Domain. Thus, the terms lI Domain, Domain, CDR l3 Domain, CDR Domain, and CDR h3 Domain are directed to polypeptides that when incorporated into a protein cause that protein to be able to bind to a specific epitope regardless of whether such protein is an antibody having light and heavy chains or is a diabody or a single-chain binding molecule (e.g., an scFv, a BiTe, etc.), or is another type of protein. [00100] The term \"Epitope Binding Domain \" denotes a fragment or portion of a binding molecule (or a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of such a fragment or portion) that contributes to the ability of the binding molecule to immunospecifically bind to an epitope. An Epitope Binding Domain may contain a VL or VH Domain of an antibody, or any 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 of the CDR Domains of an antibody, or may contain all 6 of the CDR Domains of an antibody and, although capable of immunospecifically binding such epitope, may exhibit an immunospecificity, affinity or selectivity towards such epitope that differs from that of such antibody. An Epitope Binding Domain may contain only part of a CDR, namely the subset of CDR residues required for binding, termed the SDRs (Kim, J.H. et al. (2012) iiHumanization et al. (2010) \"Construction Of A Humanized Antibody To Hepatitis B Surface Antigen By Specificity-Determining Grafting - A New Approach To Antibody Humanization f Methods 36(1):25-34; Gonzales, N.R. et al. (2004) iiSDR Grafting Of A Murine Antibody Using Multiple Human 41:863-872). Preferably, however, an Epitope Binding Domain will contain all 6 of the CDR Domains of such antibody. An Epitope Binding Domain may be a single polypeptide chain (e.g., an scFv), or may comprise two or more polypeptide chains, which may each have an amino terminus and a carboxy terminus (e.g., a diabody, a Fab fragment, an Fab 2 fragment, etc.), and which may be covalently bonded to one another via a disulfide bond. 2. Humanization of Antibodies [00101] The invention also particularly encompasses Binding Molecules that comprise a VL or VH Domain of an antibody, and preferably both a VL and a VH Domain of an antibody. Preferably, such antibody is a humanized antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are typically prepared in non-human species, such as mouse or rabbit. The Variable and/or Constant Domains of such antibodies may be recognized as immunogens, thus provoking an immune response against them. Such molecules may however be \"humanized \" by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in order to render such antibodies more like antibodies produced by humans, thereby reducing or eliminating their immunogenicity. The term \"humanized \" antibody refers to a chimeric molecule, generally prepared using recombinant techniques, having an epitope-binding site of an immunoglobulin from a non\u00ad human species and a remaining immunoglobulin structure of the molecule that is based upon the structure and /or sequence of a human immunoglobulin. The polynucleotide sequence of the variable domains of such antibodies may be used for genetic manipulation to generate such derivatives and to improve the affinity, or other characteristics of such antibodies. Application of this approach to various antibodies has been reported by LoBuglio, A.F. et al. (1989) iiMouseZHuman Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody Kinetics Sato, K. 53:851-856. Riechmann, L. et (1988) iiReshaping Human Antibodies for Therapyf Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen, M. Activityf et al.

(1992) iiHumanization Of An Anti-pl85her2 Antibody For Human Cancer Therapy ,\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 89:4285-4289; and Co, M.S. et al. (1992) iiChimeric And Humanized Antibodies With Specificity For The CD33 Antigen, \" J. Immunol. 148:1149-1154. In some embodiments, humanized antibodies preserve all CDR sequences (for example, a humanized mouse antibody which contains all six CDRs from the mouse antibodies). In other embodiments, humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (one, two, three, four, five, and/or six) which differ in sequence relative to the original antibody. [00102] The general principle in humanizing an antibody involves retaining the basic sequence of the Epitope Binding Domain of the antibody, while swapping the non-human remainder of the antibody with human antibody sequences. There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody. These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains (2) designing the humanized antibody or caninized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use during the humanizing or canonizing process (3) the actual humanizing or caninizing methodologies/techniques and (4) the transfection and expression of the humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715; 5,866,692; and 6,331,415. [00103] A number of humanized antibody molecules comprising an Epitope Binding Domain derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described, including chimeric antibodies having rodent or modified rodent Variable Domain and their associated complementarity determining regions (CDRs) fused to human constant domains (see, for example, Winter et al. (1991) \"Man-made Antibodies ,\" Nature 349:293-299; Lobuglio et al. (1989) iiMouseHuman Chimeric Monoclonal Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 86:4220-4224 (1989), Shaw et Of A Mouse/Human Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody (17-1 Cancer Tumor-Associated Antigen, \" J. Immunol. 138:4534-4538, and Brown et al. (1987) iiTumor-Specific Genetically Engineered Murine/Human Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody ,\" Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583). Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human antibody WO 2019/118266 34PCT/US2018/064204 Constant Domain (see, for example, Riechmann, L. el al. (1988) \"Reshaping Human Antibodies for Therapyf Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen, M. et al. (1988) \"Reshaping Human Antibodies: Grafting An Antilysozyme Activity ,\" Science 239:1534-1536; and Jones etal. (1986) \"Replacing The Complementarity-Determining Regions In A Human Antibody With Those From A Mousef Nature 321:522-525). Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly veneered rodent framework regions. See, for example, European Patent Publication No. 519,596. These \"humanized \" molecules are designed to minimize unwanted immunological response towards rodent anti-human antibody molecules, which limits the duration and effectiveness of therapeutic applications of those moieties in human recipients. Other methods of humanizing antibodies that may also be utilized are disclosed by Daugherty et al. (1991) uPolymerase Chain Reaction Facilitates The Cloning, CDR-Grafting, And Rapid Expression Of A Murine Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against The CD18 Component OfLeukocyte Integrinsf Nucl. Acids Res. Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; and 5,866,692. The invention particularly encompasses binding molecules (including antibodies and diabodies) that comprise a VL and/or VH Domain of a \"humanized \" antibody. [00104] Notwithstanding such successes, the production of stable, functional heterodimeric, non-monospecific diabodies optimized for therapeutic use can be further improved by the careful consideration and placement of the domains employed in the polypeptide chains. The present invention is thus directed to the provision of specific polypeptides that are particularly designed to form, via covalent bonding, stable and therapeutically useful heterodimeric diabodies and heterodimeric Fc diabodies that are capable of simultaneously binding CD 16 and a Disease Antigen. B. Bispecific Antibodies [00105] As indicated above, natural antibodies are capable of binding to only one epitope species, although they can bind multiple copies of that species. The ability of an antibody to bind an epitope of an antigen depends upon the presence and amino acid sequence of the antibody 's VL and VH Domains. Interaction of an antibody 's Light Chain and Heavy Chain and, in particular, interaction of its VL and VH Domains forms one of the two Epitope Binding Domains of a natural antibody, such as an IgG. Natural antibodies are capable of binding only one epitope species {i.e., they are mono-specific), although they can bind multiple copies of that species (i.e., exhibiting bi-valency or multi-valency). WO 2019/118266 35PCT/US2018/064204 [00106] The functionality of antibodies can be enhanced by generating multispecific antibody-based molecules that can simultaneously bind two separate and distinct antigens (or different epitopes of the same antigen) and/or by generating antibody-based molecule having higher valency (i.e., more than two Binding Domains) for the same epitope and/or antigen. [00107] In order to provide molecules having greater capability than natural antibodies, a wide variety of recombinant bispecific antibody formats have been developed (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 2008/003116, WO 2009/132876, WO 2008/003103, WO 2007/146968, WO 2009/018386, WO 2012/009544, WO 2013/070565). Most of such approaches use linker peptides to fuse a further binding domain (e.g. an scFv, VL, VH, etc.) to, or within the antibody core (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM), or to fuse multiple antibody binding portions to one another (e.g. two Fab fragments or scFv). Alternative formats use linker peptides to fuse a binding protein (e.g., an scFv, VL, VH, etc.) to a dimerization domain such as the CH2-CH3 Domain or alternative polypeptides 2005/070966, WO 2006/1 07786A WO 2006/1076 17A, WO 2007/046893). Typically, such approaches involve compromises and trade-offs. For example, PCT Publication Nos. WO 2013/174873, WO 2011/133886 and WO 2010/136172 disclose that the use of linkers may cause problems in therapeutic settings, and teaches a trispecific antibody in which the CL and CHl Domains are switched from their respective natural positions and the VL and VH Domains have been diversified (WO 2008/027236; WO 2010/108127) to allow them to bind to more than one antigen. Thus, the molecules disclosed in these documents trade binding specificity for the ability to bind additional antigen species. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2013/163427 and WO 2013/119903 disclose modifying the CH2 Domain to contain a fusion protein adduct comprising a binding domain. The document notes that the CH2 Domain likely plays only a minimal role in mediating effector function. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2010/028797, WO20 10028796 and WO 2010/028795 disclose recombinant antibodies whose Fc Regions have been replaced with additional VL and VH Domains, so as to form trivalent binding molecules. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2003/025018 and W02003012069 disclose recombinant diabodies whose individual chains contain scFv domains. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2013/006544 discloses multi-valent Fab molecules that are synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and then subjected to proteolysis to yield heterodimeric structures. Thus, the molecules disclosed in these documents trade all or some of the capability of mediating effector function for the ability to bind additional WO 2019/118266 36PCT/US2018/064204 antigen species. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2014/022540, 2012/162583, WO 1998/002463, WO 1992/022583 and WO 1991/003493 disclose adding additional Binding Domains or functional groups to an antibody or an antibody portion (e.g., adding a diabody to the antibody 's light chain, or adding additional VL and VH Domains to the antibody 's light and heavy chains, or adding a heterologous fusion protein or chaining multiple Fab Domains to one another). Thus, the molecules disclosed in these documents trade native antibody structure for the ability to bind additional antigen species. C. Chimeric Antigen Receptors [00108] The binding molecules of the present invention may be Chimeric Antigen Receptors (\"CARs \") that comprise a single chain variable fragment (scFv) capable of binding CD 16 and a Disease Antigen. As indicated above, scFvs are made by linking Light and Heavy Chain Variable Domains together via a short linking peptide. First-generation CARs typically had the intracellular domain from the CD3 - chain, which is the primary transmitter of signals from endogenous TCRs. Second-generation CARs possessed additional intracellular signaling domains from various costimulatory protein receptors (e.g., CD28, 4IBB, ICOS, etc.) to the cytoplasmic tail of the CAR in order to provide additional signals to the T-cell. Third-generation CARs combine multiple signaling domains, such as CD3z-CD28-41BB or CD3z-CD28-OX40, in order to further augment potency etal. (2013) \"Targeting Receptor, \" Br. J.

Bispecific Diabodies [00110] The art has additionally noted the capability of producing diabodies that differ from natural antibodies in being capable of binding two or more different epitope species (i.e., exhibiting bispecificity or multispecificity in addition to bi-valency or multi-valency) (see, e.g., Holliger et al. (1993) iijDiabodies Small Bivalent And Bispecific Sci. Alt etal. (1999) FEBS Lett. 454(1-2):90-94; al. (2005) iiA Fully Human Recombinant IgG-Like Bispecific Antibody To Both The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor And The Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor For Enhanced Antitumor Activityf 280(20):19665-19672; WO Conjugation And Targeting Applicationsf Protein Eng Des Sel. 17(1):21-27; Wu, A. et al. (2001) iiMultimerization Of A Chimeric Anti-CD20 Single Chain Fv-Fv Fusion Protein Is Mediated Through Variable Domain Exchangef Protein Engineering 14(2):1025-1033; Asano et al. (2004) iiA Diabody For Cancer Immunotherapy And Its Functional Enhancement By Fusion Of Human Fc Domainf Abstract 3P-683, 13(8):583-588; Baeuerle, P.A. etal. T CancerRes. 69(12):4941-4944). WO 2019/118266 38PCT/US2018/064204 [00111] The design of a diabody is based on the structure of the single-chain Variable Domain fragment (scFv), in which Light and Heavy Chain Variable Domains are linked to one another using a short linking peptide. Bird etal. (1988) ^iSingle-ChainAntigen-Binding Proteins ,\" Science 242:423-426) describes example of linking peptides which bridge approximately 3.5 nm between the carboxy terminus of one Variable Domain and the amino terminus of the other Variable Domain. Linkers of other sequences have been designed and used (Bird et al. (1988) iiSingle-Chain Antigen-Binding Proteins ,\" Science 242:423-426). Linkers can in turn be modified for additional functions, such as attachment of drugs or attachment to solid supports. The single-chain variants can be produced either recombinantly or synthetically. For synthetic production of scFv, an automated synthesizer can be used. For recombinant production of scFv, a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes the scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukaryotic, such as yeast, plant, insect or mammalian cells, or prokaryotic, such as E. coli. Polynucleotides encoding the scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as ligation of polynucleotides. The resultant scFv can be isolated using standard protein purification techniques known in the art. [00112] The provision of non-monospecific \"diabodies \" provides a significant advantage over antibodies: the capacity to co-ligate and co-localize cells that express different epitopes. Bispecific diabodies thus have wide-ranging applications including therapy and immunodiagnosis. Bispecificity allows for great flexibility in the design and engineering of the diabody in various applications, providing enhanced avidity to multimeric antigens, the cross-linking of differing antigens, and directed targeting to specific cell types relying on the presence of both target antigens. Due to their bivalency, low dissociation rates and rapid clearance from the circulation (for diabodies of small size, at or below ~50 kDa), diabody molecules known in the art have also shown particular use in the field of tumor imaging (Fitzgerald et al. (1997) \"Improved Tumour Targeting By Disulphide Stabilized Diabodies Expressed In Pichia pastoris, \" Protein Eng. 10:1221- 1225). [00113] The ability to produce bispecific diabodies has led to their use (in \"trans \") to co-ligate two cells together, for example, by co-ligating receptors that are present on the surface of different cells (e.g., cross-linking cytotoxic T-cells to target cells, such as cancer cells or pathogen-infected cells, that express a Disease Antigen) (Staerz et al. (1985) WO 2019/118266 39PCT/US2018/064204 \"Hybrid Antibodies Can Target Sites For Attack By T Cells, \" Nature 314:628-631, and Holliger el al. (1996) \"Specific Killing Of Lymphoma Cells By Cytotoxic T-Cells Mediated By A Bispecific Diabody, \" Protein Eng. 9:299-305; Marvin et al. (2005) \"Recombinant Approaches To IgG-Like Bispecific Antibodies f Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 26:649-658; Sloan et al. (2015) \" Targeting HIV Reservoir in Infected CD4 T Cells by Dual-Affinity Re-targeting Molecules (DARTs) that Bind HIV Envelope can be used (in \"cis\") to co-ligate molecules, such as receptors, etc., that are present on the surface of the same cell. Co-ligation of different cells and/or receptors is useful to modulate effector functions and/or immune cell signaling. Multispecific molecules (e.g. , bispecific diabodies) comprising Epitope Binding Domains may be directed to a surface determinant of any immune cell such as CD2, CD3, CD8, CD 16, TCR, NKG2D, etc., which are expressed on T lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) cells, Antigen-Presenting Cells or other mononuclear cells, or to a surface determinant of a B cell, such as Dual Affinity Retargeting Molecules ToAchieve Optimal Redirected 117(17):4542-4551; Cheson, B.D. et Therapy Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomaf N. Engl. J. Med. 359(6):613-626; Castillo, Malignanciesf Exp. Hematol. 36(7):755-768). In particular, Epitope Binding Domains directed to a cell surface receptor that is present on immune effector cells, are useful in the generation of multispecific binding molecules capable of mediating redirected cell killing. [00114] In many studies, diabody binding to effector cell determinants, e.g., Fcy receptors (FcyR), was also found to activate the effector cell (Holliger etal. (1996) \"Specific Killing Of Lymphoma Cells By Cytotoxic T cells Mediated By A Bispecific \" ProteinEng. 9:299-305; Holliger etal. (1999) \"Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)-Specific T cell Activation In Colon Carcinoma Induced Anti-CD3 X Anti-CEA Bispecific 2010/080538; WO 2012/018687; WO 2012/162068). Normally, effector cell activation is triggered by the binding of an antigen-bound antibody to an effector cell via an Fc Domain - FcyR interaction; thus, in this regard, diabody molecules may exhibit Ig-Iike functionality independent of whether they comprise an Fc WO 2019/118266 40PCT/US2018/064204 Domain (e.g., as assayed in any effector function assay known in the art or exemplified herein (e.g., ADCC assay)). By cross-linking tumor and effector cells, the diabody not only brings the effector cell within the proximity of a tumor cell but leads to effective tumor killing (see e.g., Cao et al. (2003) \"Bispecific Antibody Conjugates In Therapeutics, \" Adv. Drug. Deliv. the of the above-described bispecific diabodies come at a salient cost. The formation of such non-mono-specific diabodies requires the successful assembly of two or more distinct and different polypeptides {i.e., such formation requires that the diabodies be formed through the heterodimerization of different polypeptide chain species). This fact is in contrast to mono-specific diabodies, which are formed through the homodimerization of identical polypeptide chains. Because at least two dissimilar polypeptides (i.e., two polypeptide species) must be provided in order to form a non-mono \u00ad specific diabody, and because homodimerization of such polypeptides leads to inactive molecules (Takemura, S. et al. (2000) \"Construction Of A Diabody (Small Recombinant Bispecific Antibody) Using A Refolding Systemf Protein Eng. 13(8):583-588), the production of such polypeptides must be accomplished in such a way as to prevent covalent bonding between polypeptides of the same species {i.e., so as to prevent homodimerization) (Takemura, S. et al. (2000) \"Construction Of A Diabody (Small Recombinant Bispecific Antibody) Using A Refolding Systemf Protein Eng. 13(8):583-588). The art has therefore taught the non-covalent association of such polypeptides (see, e.g, Olafsen Allows \" Prot. Des. Sel. 17:21-27; Asano et al. (2004) \"A Diabody For Cancer Immunotherapy And Its Functional Enhancement By Fusion Of Human Fc Domainf Abstract 3P-683, J. Biochem. 76(8):992; Takemura, S.

Chem. 280(20):19665-19672). [00116] However, the that bispecific diabodies composed of non- covalently associated polypeptides are unstable and readily dissociate into non-functional single polypeptide chain monomers (see, e.g., Lu, D. et al. (2005) \"A Fully Human WO 2019/118266 41PCT/US2018/064204 Recombinant IgG-Like Bispecific Antibody ToBoth The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor And The Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor For Enhanced Antitumor Activity f J. Biol. Chem. 280(20):19665-19672). [00117] In the face of this challenge, the art has succeeded in developing stable, covalently bonded heterodimeric non-mono-specific diabodies, termed DART\u00ae diabodies, see, e.g., Sloan, D.D. el al.

A. et al. (2011) \"Application Of Dual Affinity Retargeting Molecules To Achieve Optimal Redirected T cell Killing WO 2015/026892; and diabodies comprise two or more covalently complexed polypeptides and involve engineering one or more cysteine residues into each of the employed polypeptide species that permit disulfide bonds to form and thereby covalently bond one or more pairs of such polypeptide chains to one another. For WO 2019/118266 42PCT/US2018/064204 example, the addition of a cysteine residue to the C-terminus of such constructs has been shown to allow disulfide bonding between the involved polypeptide chains, stabilizing the resulting diabody without interfering with the diabody 's binding characteristics. [00118] The simplest DART\u00ae diabody comprises two polypeptide chains each comprising three Domains (Figures 1A-1B). The first polypeptide chain comprises: (i) a Domain that comprises a binding region of a light chain variable Domain of the a first immunoglobulin (VLl), (ii) a second Domain that comprises a binding region of a heavy chain variable Domain of a second immunoglobulin (VH2), and (iii) a third Domain that serves to promote heterodimerization (a \"Heterodimer-Promoting Domain \") with the second polypeptide chain and to covalently bond the first polypeptide to the second polypeptide chain of the diabody. The second polypeptide chain contains a complementary first Domain (a VL2 Domain), a complementary second Domain (a VHl Domain) and a third Domain that complexes with the third Domain of the first polypeptide chain in order to promote heterodimerization (a \"Heterodimer-Promoting Domain \") and covalent bonding with the first polypeptide chain. Such molecules are stable, potent and have the ability to simultaneously bind two or more antigens. In one embodiment, the third Domains of the first and second polypeptide chains each contain a cysteine (\"\u00a9\") residue, which serves to bind the polypeptides together via a disulfide bond. The third Domain of one or both of the polypeptide chains may additionally possess the sequence of a CH2-CH3 Domain, such that complexing of the diabody polypeptides forms an Fc Domain that is capable of binding to the Fc receptor of cells (such as B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and mast cells). Many variations of such molecules have been described (see, e.g., United States Patent Publication Nos. 2013-0295121; 2010-0174053; 2007-0004909; WO 2010/080538; WO 2006/113665) and are provided herein. Many variations of such molecules have been described (see, e.g., United States Patent Publication Nos. and are provided herein. WO 2019/118266 43PCT/US2018/064204 [00119] Alternative constructs are known in the art for applications where a bispecific or tetravalent molecule is desirable but an Fc is not required including, but not limited to, Bispecific T cell Engager molecules, also referred to as \"BiTE\u00ae antibodies \" (see, e. g; Pd Publication Nos: WO 1993/11161; and WO 2004/106381) and tetravalent tandem antibodies, also referred to as \"TandAbs\u00ae \" (see, e.g. United States Patent Publication No: 2011-0206672; European Patent Publication No. EP 2371866, and; Nos. WO 1999/057150, WO 2003/025018, and WO 2013/013700). BiTEs are formed from a single polypeptide chain comprising tandem linked scFvs, while TandAbs are formed by the homo-dimerization of two identical polypeptide chains, each possessing a VHl , VL2, VH2, and VL2 Domain. [00120] The present invention provides bispecific binding molecules that are capable of enhancing an immune response directed to the killing of a target cell (e.g., a cancer cell or a pathogen-infected cell, a pathogen, etc.) expressing a Disease Antigen. Such bispecific binding molecules are capable of binding a \"First Epitope \" and a \"Second Epitope, \" wherein one of such epitopes is an epitope of CD 16 and the other of such epitopes is an epitope of a Disease Antigen (\"DA\"). It is irrelevant whether a particular epitope is designated as the first vs. the Second Epitope; such notation having relevance only with respect to the presence and orientation of the domains of the polypeptide chains of the binding molecules of the present invention. Thus, the bispecific molecules of the present invention comprise \"VL cdi6\" / \"VH cdi6\" Domains that are capable of binding an epitope of CD 16, and \"VL da\" / \"VH da\" Domains that are capable of binding an epitope of a Disease Antigen. The instant invention particular encompasses bispecific diabodies, BiTEs, antibodies, and TandAbs produced using any of the methods provided herein. A. Diabodies Lacking Fc Domains [00121] In one embodiment, the CD 16 Binding Molecules of the present invention will be bispecific diabodies and will comprise domains capable of binding both a first and a Second Epitope, but will lack an Fc Domain, and thus will be unable to bind FcyR molecules via an Fc-FcyR interaction. Such molecules are, however, able to bind to CD 16 via the SDRs or CDRs of their CD16 Binding Domains. The absence of Fc domains thus serves to prevent the molecules from binding to non-CD 16 FcyRs, such as the inhibitory receptor CD32B. WO 2019/118266 44PCT/US2018/064204 [00122] The of such an embodiment of bispecific diabodies preferably comprises, in the N-terminal to direction: an N-terminus, the VL Domain of a monoclonal antibody capable of binding either the First or Second Epitope (i.e., either VL cdi6 or VL da), a first intervening spacer peptide (Linker 1), a VH Domain of a monoclonal antibody capable of binding the epitope of the Disease Antigen (if such first polypeptide chain contains VL cdi6) or a VH Domain of a monoclonal antibody capable of binding CD 16 (if such first polypeptide chain contains VL da), a second intervening spacer peptide (Linker 2) optionally containing a cysteine and a C-terminus (Figures 1A-1B). [00123] The second polypeptide chain of this comprises, N-terminal to an N-terminus, the VL Domain of a monoclonal antibody capable of binding the First or Second Epitope (i.e., VL cdi6 or VL da, and being the VL Domain not selected for inclusion in the first polypeptide chain of the diabody), an intervening spacer peptide (Linker 1), a VH Domain of a monoclonal antibody capable of binding either the First or Second Epitope (i.e., VH cdi6 or VH da, and being the VH Domain not selected for inclusion in the first polypeptide chain of the diabody), a second intervening spacer peptide (Linker 2) optionally containing a cysteine residue, a Domain and a C-terminus (Figures 1A-1B). The employed VL and VH Domains specific for a particular epitope are preferably obtained or derived from the same monoclonal antibody. However, such domains may be derived from different monoclonal antibodies provided that they associate to form a functional Binding Domain capable of immunospecifically binding such epitope. Such different antibodies are referred to herein as being \"corresponding \" antibodies. [00124] The VL Domain of the first polypeptide chain interacts with the VH Domain of the second polypeptide chain to form a first functional Epitope Binding Domain that is specific for one of the epitopes (e.g., the First Epitope). Likewise, the VL Domain of the second polypeptide chain interacts with the VH Domain of the first polypeptide chain in order to form a second functional Epitope Binding Domain that is specific for the other epitope (i.e., the Second Epitope). Thus, the selection of the VL and VH Domains of the first and second polypeptide chains is \"coordinated, \" such that the two polypeptide chains of the diabody collectively comprise VL and VH Domains capable of binding both the First WO 2019/118266 45PCT/US2018/064204 Epitope and the Second Epitope cdWVEI cdi6 and VL da/VH da). [00125] Most of the intervening spacer peptide (i.e., \"Linker 1,\" which separates such VL and VH Domains) is selected to substantially or completely prevent the VL and VH Domains of the polypeptide chain from binding one another (for example consisting of from O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 intervening linker amino acid residues). Thus, the VL and VH Domains of the first polypeptide chain are substantially or completely incapable of binding one another. Likewise, the VL and VH Domains of the second polypeptide chain are substantially or completely incapable of binding one another. A preferred intervening spacer peptide (Linker 1) has the sequence (SEQ ID NO:16): GGGSGGGG. [00126] The length and composition of the second intervening spacer peptide (\"Linker 2\") is selected based on the choice of one or more polypeptide domains that promote such dimerization (i.e., a \"Heterodimer-Promoting Domain \"). Typically, the second intervening spacer peptide (Linker 2) will comprise 3-20 amino acid residues. In particular, where the employed Heterodimer-Promoting Domain(s) do/does not comprise a cysteine residue a cysteine-containing intervening spacer peptide (Linker utilized. A cysteine-containing second intervening spacer peptide (Linker 2) will contain 1, 2, 3 or more cysteines. A preferred cysteine-containing spacer peptide (Linker 2) GGCGGG (SEQ ID NO: 17). Alternatively, Linker 2 does cysteine-containing Heterodimer-Promoting Domain, as described below is used. Optionally, both a cysteine-containing Linker 2 and a cysteine-containing Heterodimer- Promoting Domain are used. [00127] The Heterodimer-Promoting Domains be GVEPKS C (US2007/0004909). [00128] In a preferred embodiment, the Heterodimer-Promoting Domains will comprise tandemly repeated coil domains of opposing charge for example, an \"E-coil \" 2019/118266 EVAALEK), whose glutamate residues will form a negative charge at pH 7, or a \"K-coil \" Heterodimer-Promoting Domain (SEQ ID NO :30: KVAALKE-KVAALKE-KVAALKE- KVAALKE), whose lysine residues will form a positive charge at pH 7. The presence of such charged domains promotes association between the first and second polypeptides, and thus fosters heterodimer formation. Heterodimer-Promoting Domains that comprise modifications of the above-described E-coil and K-coil sequences so as to include one or more cysteine residues may be utilized. The presence of such cysteine residues permits the coil present on one polypeptide chain to become covalently bonded to a complementary coil present on another polypeptide chain, thereby covalently bonding the polypeptide chains to one another and increasing the stability of the diabody. Examples of such particularly preferred are Heterodimer-Promoting Domains include a Modified E-Coil having the amino acid sequence EVAACjSK-EVAALEK-EVAALEK-EVAALEK (SEQ ID NO:31), and a modified K-coil having -KVAALKE -KVAALKE - (SEQ ID NO:32). [00129] As disclosed in WO 2012/018687, in order to improve the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of diabodies, a diabody may be modified to contain a polypeptide portion of a serum-binding protein at one or more of the termini of the diabody. Most preferably, such polypeptide portion of a serum-binding protein will be installed at the C-terminus of a polypeptide chain of the diabody. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma and has a half-life of 19 days in humans. Albumin possesses several small molecule binding domains that permit it to non-covalently bind other proteins and thereby extend their serum half-lives. The Albumin-Binding Domain 3 (ABD3) of protein G of Streptococcus strain G148 consists of 46 amino acid residues forming a stable three-helix bundle and has broad albumin-binding specificity (Johansson, M.U. et al. (2002) \"Structure , Specificity, And Mode Of Interaction For Bacterial Albumin-Binding Modulef J Biol. Chem. 277(10):81 14-8120). Thus, a particularly preferred polypeptide portion of a serum-binding protein for improving the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of a diabody is the Albumin- Binding Domain (ABD) from streptococcal protein G, and more preferably, the Albumin- Binding Domain 3 (ABD3) of protein G of reference), \"deimmunized \" variants of SEQ ID NO:33 have the ability to attenuate or eliminate MHC class II binding. Based on combinational mutation results, the following combinations of substitutions are considered to be preferred substitutions for forming such and D79A or the modifications N66S, T70S and D79A. Variant preferred as such deimmunized ABD exhibit substantially wild-type binding while providing attenuated MHC class II binding. Thus, the first polypeptide chain of such a diabody having an ABD contains a third linker (Linker 3) preferably positioned C- terminally to the E-coil (or K-coil) Domain of such polypeptide chain so as to intervene between the E-coil (or K-coil) Domain and the ABD (which is preferably a deimmunized ABD). A preferred sequence for such Linker 3 is SEQ ID NO:18: GGGS. B. Diabodies Comprising Fc Domains [00131] embodiment relates to multi-specific diabodies (e.g, bispecific, trispecific, tetraspecific, etc.) that comprise an Fc Domain and that are capable of simultaneously binding an epitope of CD 16 and an epitope of a Disease Antigen. The Fc Domain of such molecules may be of any isotype (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4). The molecules may further comprise a CHl Domain and/or a Hinge Domain. When present, the CHl Domain and/or Hinge Domain may be of any isotype (e.g, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4), and is preferably of the same isotype as the desired Fc Domain. WO 2019/118266 48PCT/US2018/064204 [00132] The addition of an IgG CH2-CH3 Domain to one or both of the diabody polypeptide chains, such that the complexing of the diabody chains results in the formation of an Fc Domain, increases the biological half-life and/or alters the valency of the diabody. Such diabodies comprise, two or more polypeptide chains whose sequences permit the polypeptide chains to covalently bind each other to form a covalently associated diabody that is capable of simultaneously binding the First Epitope and the Second Epitope. Incorporating an IgG CH2-CH3 Domains onto both of a two-chain bispecific Fc (Figure 2). [00133] Alternatively, incorporating IgG CH2-CH3 Domains onto only one of the diabody polypeptides will permit a more complex four-chain bispecific containing diabody to 3C shows a representative four-chain diabody possessing the Constant Light (CL) Domain and the Constant Heavy CHl Domain, however fragments of such domains as well as other polypeptides may alternatively be employed (see, e.g., Figures 3A and 3B, United States Patent Publication Nos. 2013- 0295121; WO 2012/018687; WO 2010/080538). Thus, for example, in lieu of the CHl Domain, one may employ a peptide having the amino acid sequence GVEPKS C (SEQ ID NO:26), derived from the Hinge Domain of a human IgG, and in lieu of the CL Domain, one may employ the C-terminal 6 amino acids of the human kappa Light Chain, GFNRGEC (SEQ ID NO:27) or containing four-chain diabody is shown in Figure 3A. Alternatively, or in addition, one may employ a peptide comprising tandem coil domains of opposing charge such as the \"E-coil \" helical domains Figure 3B. [00134] Fc Domain-containing diabody molecules of the present invention may include additional intervening spacer peptides (Linkers), generally such Linkers will be incorporated between a Heterodimer-Promoting Domain (e.g., an E-coil or K-coil) and a CH2-CH3 Domain and/or between a CH2-CH3 Domain and a Variable Domain (i.e., VH WO 2019/118266 49PCT/US2018/064204 or VL). Typically, the additional Linkers will comprise 3-20 amino acid residues and may optionally contain all or a portion of an IgGHinge Domain (preferably a cysteine-containing portion of an IgGHinge Domain possessing 1, 2, 3 or more cysteine residues). Linkers that may be employed in the bispecific Fc Domain-containing diabody molecules be used in lieu of GGG or GGC for ease of cloning. Additionally, the amino acids GGG, or LEPKSS (SEQ ID NO:22) may be immediately followed by DKTHTCPPCP ID NO:40) to form molecules of the present invention may incorporate an IgG Hinge Domain in addition to or in place of a linker. Exemplary Hinge Domains include: E PKS CDKTHT C an IgG4 Hinge variant comprising a stabilizing S228P substitution (as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat) to reduce strand exchange. [00135] As provided in Figure 3A-3C, Fc Domain-containing diabodies of the invention may comprise four chains. The first and third polypeptide chains of such a diabody contain three domains: (i) a VLl -containing Domain, (ii) a VH2-containing Domain, (iii) a Heterodimer-Promoting Domain, and (iv) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence. The second and fourth polypeptide chains contain: (i) a VL2-containing Domain, (ii) a VHl -containing Domain, and (iii) a Heterodimer-Promoting Domain, where the Heterodimer-Promoting Domains promote the dimerization of the first/third polypeptide chains with the second/fourth polypeptide chains. The VL and/or VH Domains of the third and fourth polypeptide chains, and VL and/or VH Domains of the first and second polypeptide chains may be the same or different so as to permit tetravalent binding that is either mono-specific, bispecific or tetraspecific. The \"VL3 \" and \"VH3 \" denote WO 2019/118266 50PCT/US2018/064204 respectively, the Light Chain Variable Domain and Variable Heavy Chain Domain that bind a \"third \" epitope of such diabody. Similarly, the notation \"VL4 \" and \"VH4 \" denote respectively, the Light Chain Variable Domain and Variable Heavy Chain Domain that bind a \"fourth \" epitope of such diabody. The general structure of the polypeptide chains of a representative four-chain bispecific Fc Domain-containing diabodies of invention is provided in Table 1: Table 1 Bispecific2nd Chain NH2-VL2-VH I-HPD-COOH In a diabodies of the present invention are bispecific, tetravalent (i.e., possess four Epitope Binding Domains), Fc-containing diabodies that are composed of four polypeptide chains (Figures 3A-3C). The bispecific, tetravalent, Fc-containing diabodies of the invention comprise two First Epitope Binding Domains and two Second Epitope Binding Domains. [00137] In a further embodiment, the Fc Domain-containing diabodies of the present invention may comprise three polypeptide chains. The first polypeptide of such a diabody contains three domains: (i) a VLl -containing Domain, (ii) a VH2-containing Domain and (iii) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence. The second polypeptide of such a diabody contains: (i) a VL2-containing Domain, (ii) a VHl -containing Domain and (iii) a Domain that promotes heterodimerization and covalent bonding with the diabody 's first polypeptide chain. The third polypeptide of such a diabody comprises a CH2-CH3 sequence. Thus, the first and second polypeptide chains of such a diabody associate together to form a VL1/VH1 Epitope Binding Domain that is capable of binding either the First or Second Epitope, as well as a VL2/VH2 Epitope Binding Domain that is capable of binding the other of such epitopes. The first and second polypeptides are bonded to one another through a disulfide bond involving cysteine residues in their respective Third Domains. Notably, the first and WO 2019/118266 51PCT/US2018/064204 third polypeptide chains complex with one another to form an Fc Domain that is stabilized via a disulfide bond. Such bispecific diabodies have enhanced potency. Figures 4A and 4B structures of such diabodies. Such Fc Domain-containing diabodies may have either of two orientations (Table 2): Table 2 First Orientation3 rd Chain NH2-CH2-CH3 In a specific embodiment, diabodies of the present invention are bispecific, bivalent (i.e., possess two Epitope Binding Domains), Fc-containing diabodies that are composed of three total polypeptide chains (Figures 4A-4B). The bispecific, bivalent Fc- containing diabodies of the invention comprise one Epitope Binding Domain immunospecific for either the First or Second Epitope, as well as a VL2/VH2 Epitope Binding Domain that is capable of binding the other of such epitopes. [00139] In a further embodiment, the Fc Domain-containing diabodies may comprise a total of five polypeptide chains. In a particular embodiment, two of the five polypeptide chains have the same amino acid sequence. The first polypeptide chain of such a diabody contains: (i) a VHl -containing Domain, (ii) a CHl -containing Domain, and (iii) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence. The first polypeptide chain may be the Heavy Chain of an antibody that contains a VHl and a Heavy Chain constant region. The second and fifth polypeptide chains of such a diabody contain: (i) a VLl -containing Domain, and (ii) a CL- containing Domain. The second and/or fifth polypeptide chains of such a diabody may be Light Chains of an antibody that contains a VLl complementary to the VHl of the first/third polypeptide chain. The first, second and/or fifth polypeptide chains may be isolated from a naturally occurring antibody. Alternatively, they may be constructed recombinantly. The third polypeptide chain of such a diabody contains: (i) a VHl -containing Domain, (ii) a CHl -containing Domain, (iii) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence, (iv) a VL2- containing Domain, (v) a VH3-containing Domain and (vi) a Heterodimer-Promoting WO 2019/118266 52PCT/US2018/064204 Domain, where the Heterodimer-Promoting Domains promote the dimerization of the third chain with the fourth chain. The fourth polypeptide of such diabodies contains: (i) a VL3- containing Domain, (ii) a VH2-containing Domain and (iii) a Domain that promotes heterodimerization and covalent bonding with the diabody 's third polypeptide chain. [00140] Thus, the first and second, and the third and fifth, polypeptide chains of such diabodies associate together to form two VL1/VH1 Epitope Binding Domains capable of binding a First Epitope. The third and fourth polypeptide chains of such diabodies associate together to form a VL2/VH2 Epitope Binding Domain that is capable of binding a Second Epitope, as well as a VL3/VH3 Epitope Binding Domain that is capable of binding a Third Epitope. The first and third polypeptides are bonded to one another through a disulfide bond involving cysteine residues in their respective constant regions. Notably, the first and third polypeptide chains complex with one another to form an Fc Domain. Such multispecific diabodies have enhanced potency. Figure 5 illustrates the structure of such diabodies. It will be understood that the VL1/VH1, VL2/VH2, and VL3/VH3 Domains may be the same or different so as to permit binding that is mono-specific, bispecific or trispecific. [00141] The VL and VH Domains of the polypeptide chains are selected so as to form VL/VH Epitope Binding Domains specific for a desired epitope. The VL/VH Epitope Binding Domains formed by the association of the polypeptide chains may be the same or different so as to permit tetravalent binding that is mono-specific, bispecific, trispecific or tetraspecific. In particular, the VL and VH Domains maybe selected such that a multivalent diabody may comprise two Binding Domains for a First Epitope and two Binding Domains for a Second Epitope, or three Binding Domains for a First Epitope and one Binding Domain for a Second Epitope, or two Binding Domains for a First Epitope, one Binding Domain for a Second Epitope and one Binding Domain for a Third Epitope (as depicted in Figure 5). The general structure of the polypeptide chains of representative five-chain Fc Domain- containing diabodies of invention is provided in Table 3: WO 2019/118266 PCT/US2018/064204 53 Table 3 [00142] In a specific embodiment, diabodies of the present invention are bispecific, tetravalent (i.e., possess four Epitope Binding Domains), Fc-containing diabodies that are composed of five total polypeptide chains having two Epitope Binding Domains immunospecific for the First Epitope, and two Epitope Binding Domains specific for the Second Epitope. In another embodiment, the bispecific, tetravalent, Fc-containing diabodies of the invention comprise three Epitope Binding Domains immunospecific for the First Epitope and one Epitope Binding Domain specific for the Second Epitope. As provided above, the VL and VH Domains may be selected to permit trispecific binding. Accordingly, the invention also The two Epitope Binding Domains immunospecific for the First Epitope, one Epitope Binding Domain immunospecific for the Second Epitope, and one Epitope Binding Domain immunospecific for the Third Epitope. [00143] In traditional immune function, the interaction of antibody-antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses, ranging from effector functions such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, mast cell degranulation, and WO 2019/118266 54PCT/US2018/064204 phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All of these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc Domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. As discussed above, the diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of the three Fc enhancing) receptors; FcyRIIB (CD32B) is an inhibiting (i.e., immune system dampening) receptor. In addition, interaction with the neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) mediates the recycling of IgG molecules from the endosome to the cell surface and release into the blood. The amino acid sequence of exemplary wild-type ID 15) are presented above. [00144] Modification of the Fc Domain may lead to an altered phenotype, for example altered serum half-life, altered stability, altered susceptibility to cellular enzymes or altered effector function. It may therefore be desirable to modify an Fc Domain-containing binding molecule of the present invention with respect to effector function, for example, so as to enhance the effectiveness of such molecule in treating cancer. Reduction or elimination of Fc Domain-mediated effector function is desirable in certain cases, for example in the case of antibodies whose mechanism of action involves blocking or antagonism, but not killing of the cells bearing a target antigen. Increased effector function is generally desirable when directed to undesirable cells, such as tumor and foreign cells, where the FcyRs are expressed at low levels, for example, tumor-specific B cells with low levels of FcyRIIB (e.g., non- Hodgkin 's lymphoma, CLL, and Burkitt 's lymphoma). Molecules of the invention possessing such conferred or altered effector function activity are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of a disease, disorder or infection in which an enhanced efficacy of effector function activity is desired. [00145] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the Fc Domain of the Fc Domain- containing molecules of the present invention may be an engineered variant Fc Domain. Although the Fc Domain of the bispecific Fc Domain-containing molecules of the present invention may possess the ability to bind one or more Fc receptors (e.g., FcyR(s)), more preferably such variant Fc WO 2019/118266 55PCT/US2018/064204 binding exhibited by a wild-type Fc Domain), e.g, will have enhanced binding an activating receptor and/or will have substantially reduced or no ability to bind inhibitory receptor(s). Thus, the Fc Domain of the Fc Domain-containing molecules of the present invention may include some or all of the CH2 Domain and/or some or all of the CH3 Domain of a complete Fc Domain, or may comprise a variant CH2 and/or a variant CH3 sequence (that may include, for example, one or more insertions and/or one or more deletions with respect to the CH2 or CH3 domains of a complete Fc Domain). Such Fc Domains may comprise non- Fc polypeptide portions, or may comprise portions of non-naturally complete Fc Domains, or may comprise non-naturally occurring orientations of CH2 and/or CH3 Domains (such as, for example, two CH2 Domains or two CH3 Domains, or in the N-terminal to C-terminal direction, a CH3 Domain linked to a CH2 Domain, etc.). [00146] Fc Domain modifications identified as altering effector function are known in the art, including modifications that increase binding activating receptors (e.g. , FcyRIIA (CD16A) and reduce binding e.g., Stavenhagen, J.B. etal. (2007) iiFc Optimization Of Therapeutic Antibodies Enhances Their Ability To Kill Tumor Cells In Vitro And Controls Tumor Expansion In Vivo Via Low- Affinity Activating Fcgamma Receptorsf CancerRes. 57(18):8882-8890). Table 4 lists exemplary single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple substitutions (numbering (according to the EU index) and substitutions are relative to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 as presented above) of exemplary modification that increase binding activating receptors and/or reduce binding inhibitory receptors. Table 4 Variations of Preferred f numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat [00147] Exemplary variants of human IgGl Fc Domains with F243L, R292P, Y300L, V305I or P396L substitutions, wherein the numbering is that of the EU index as in Kabat. These amino acid substitutions may be present in a human IgGl Fc Domain in any combination. In one embodiment, the variant human IgGl Fc Domain contains a F243L, R292P and Y300L substitution. In another embodiment, the substitution. [00148] In certain embodiments, it is preferred for the Fc Domains of the Fc Domain- containing binding molecules of the present invention to exhibit decreased (or substantially no) binding FcyRIA (CD64), by the wild-type IgGl Fc Domain (SEQ ID NO: 12). In a specific embodiment, the Fc Domain-containing binding molecules of the present invention comprise an IgG Fc Domain that exhibits reduced antibody- dependent cell-mediated effector function. In a preferred embodiment, the CH2-CH3 Domains of such binding molecules include any 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the substitutions: L234A, L235A, D265A, N297Q, and N297G, wherein the numbering is that of the EU index as in Kabat. In another embodiment, the CH2-CH3 Domains contain WO 2019/118266 an an substitution, L234A and L235 A substitutions or a D265A substitution, as these mutations abolish FcR binding. Alternatively, a CH2-CH3 Domain of a naturally occurring Fc Domain that inherently exhibits decreased (or substantially no) binding FcyRIIIA (CD16a) and/or reduced effector function (relative to the binding and effector function exhibited by the wild-type IgGl Fc Domain (SEQ ID NO: 12)) is utilized. In a specific embodiment, the Fc Domain-containing binding molecules of the present invention comprise an IgG2 Fc Domain (SEQ ID NO: 13), ID NO:15). When an IgG4 Fc Domain is utilized, the instant invention also encompasses the introduction of a stabilizing mutation, such as the Hinge Region S228P substitution described above (see, e.g., SEQ ID NO: abolish effector function, circumstances in which effector function is desired, these substitutions would preferably not be employed. [00149] A preferred IgGl sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the Fc Domain- containing molecules of the present invention having reduced or abolished effector function will comprise or is absent. [0001] A second preferred IgGl sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the Fc Region-containing molecules of the present invention comprises an S442C substitution (shown underlined), so as to permit two CH3 domains to be covalently bonded to one another via a disulfide bond or to permit conjugation of a drug moiety. The amino acid sequence of such molecule is or is absent. [0002] A third preferred IgGl sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the Fc Region-containing molecules of the present invention comprises the L234A/L235A WO 2019/118266 58PCT/US2018/064204 substitutions (shown underlined) that reduce or abolish effector function and the S442C substitution (shown underlined) that permits two CH3 domains to be covalently bonded to one another via a disulfide bond or conjugation of a drug moiety. The amino acid sequence of such molecule is absent. [00150] The serum half-life of proteins comprising Fc Domains may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc Domain for FcRn. The term \"half-life \" as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of a molecule that is a measure of the mean survival time of the molecules following their administration. Half-life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate fifty percent (50%) of a known quantity of the molecule from a subject 's body (e.g., a human patient or other mammal) or a specific compartment thereof, for example, as measured in serum, i.e., circulating half-life, or in other tissues. In general, an increase in half-life results in an increase in mean residence time (MRT) in circulation for the molecule administered. [00151] In some embodiments, the Fc Domain-containing binding molecules of the present invention comprise a variant Fc Domain that comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc Domain, such that the molecule has an increased half-life (relative to such molecule if comprising a wild-type Fc Domain). In some embodiments, the Fc Domain-containing binding molecules of the present invention comprise a variant IgG Fc Domain that comprises a half-life extending amino acid substitution at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 238, 250, 252, 254, 256, 257, 256, 265, 272, 286, 288, 303, 305, 307, 308, 309, 311, 312, 317, 340, 356, 360, 362, 376, 378, 380, 382, 413, 424, 428, 433, 434, 435, and 436, wherein the numbering is that of the EU index as in Rabat. Numerous mutations capable of increasing the half-life of an Fc Domain-containing molecule are known in the art and include, for example M252Y, S254T, T256E, and combinations thereof. For example, see the mutations described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,277,375, 7,083,784; 7,217,797, 8,088,376; U.S. Publication Nos. 2002/0147311; 98/23289; WO 59PCT/US2018/064204 2009/058492; and WO 2010/033279, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. [00152] In some embodiments, the Fc Domain-containing binding molecules of the present invention exhibiting enhanced half-life possess a variant Fc Domain comprising substitutions at two or more of Fc Domain residues 250, 252, 254, 256, 257, 288, 307, 308, 309, 311, 378, 428, 433, 434, 435 and 436. In particular, two or more the numbering is that of the EU index as in Kabat. In a specific embodiment, such molecules may possess a variant IgG Fc Domain comprising the substitution: (A) M252 embodiment, an Fc Domain-containing CD16 X DA Binding Molecule of the present invention possesses a variant IgG Fc Region comprising any 1, 2, or 3 of the substitutions: M252Y, S254T and T256E. The invention further encompasses CD16 x DA Binding Molecules possessing variant Fc Regions comprising: (A) one or more mutations which alter effector function and/or FcyR; and (B) one or more mutations which extend serum half-life. [00154] An IgGl sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the Fc Domain- containing molecules of the present invention that provides an increased half-life (and that has a 10-fold increase in binding to both cynomolgus monkey and human FcRn) (DalF Acqua, W.F. et al. (2006) \"Properties of Human IgGls Engineered for Enhanced Binding to the Neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) ,\" J. Biol. or is absent. [00155] An alternative IgGl sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the Fc Domain-containing molecules of the present invention combining the reduced or abolished effector function provided by the substitutions L234A/L235A and the increased serum half- life provided by the substitutions M252Y/S254T/T256E or is absent. [00156] A further preferred IgGl sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the Fc Region-containing molecules of the present invention comprises the L234A/L235A substitutions (shown underlined) that reduce or abolish effector function and the M252Y, S254T and T256E substitutions (shown underlined), so as to extend the serum half-life and the S442C substitution (shown underlined), so as to permit two CH3 domains to be covalently bonded to one another via a disulfide bond or to permit conjugation of a drug moiety. The amino acid sequence of such molecule is is absent. [00157] For certain antibodies, diabodies and trivalent binding molecules that are desired to have Fc-Domain-containing polypeptide chains of differing amino acid sequence (e.g, whose Fc Domain-containing polypeptide chains are desired to not be identical), it is desirable to reduce or prevent homodimerization from occurring between the CH2-CH3 Domains of identical chains (e.g., two first polypeptide chains or between the CH2-CH3 Domains of two third polypeptide chains). The CH2 and/or CH3 Domains of such polypeptide chains need not be identical in sequence, and advantageously are modified to foster heterodimer complexing between the two polypeptide chains. For example, an amino WO 2019/118266 61PCT/US2018/064204 acid substitution (preferably a substitution with an amino acid comprising a bulky side group forming a \"knob \", e.g., tryptophan) can be introduced into the CH2 or CH3 Domain such that steric interference will prevent interaction with a similarly mutated domain and will obligate the mutated domain to pair with a domain into which a complementary, or accommodating mutation has been engineered, i.e., \"the hole \" (e.g. , a substitution with glycine). Such sets of mutations can be engineered into any pair of polypeptides comprising CH2-CH3 Domains that forms an Fc Domain to foster heterodimerization. Methods of protein engineering to favor heterodimerization over homodimerization are well-known in the art, in particular with respect to the engineering of immunoglobulin-like molecules, and are encompassed herein (see e.g., Ridgway etal. (1996) \"'Knobs-Into-Holes ' Engineering Of Antibody CH3 Domains Chain Heterodimerization, \" Protein 621, Atwell el al. (1997) \"Stable Heterodimers From Remodeling Hie Domain Interface Of A Homodimer Using A Phage Display Library, \" J. Mol. Biol. 270: 26-35, and Xie el al. (2005) \"A New Format Of Bispecifw Antibody: Highly Efficient Heterodimerization, Expression And Tumor Cell Lysis, \" J. Immunol. Methods 296:95-101; each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). [00158] A preferred knob is created by modifying an IgG Fc Domain to contain the modification T366W. A preferred hole is created by modifying an IgG Fc Domain to contain the modification T366S, and To aid in purifying the final bispecific heterodimeric Fc Domain-containing molecule, the Protein A Binding Domain of the hole-bearing CH2 and CH3 Domains of a polypeptide chain is preferably mutated by amino acid substitution at position 435 (H435R). Thus, the hole-bearing polypeptide chain homodimer will not bind protein A, whereas the bispecific heterodimer will retain its ability to bind protein A via the Protein A Binding Domain. In an alternative embodiment, the hole-bearing polypeptide chain may incorporate amino acid substitutions at positions 434 and 435 (N434A/N435K). [00159] A preferred IgGl amino acid sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of one Fc Domain-containing polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule of the present invention will have the \" sequence (K) or is absent. [00160] An alternative IgGl amino acid sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of one Fc Domain-containing polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule of the present invention having a M252Y/S254T/T256E substitution and a \"knob-bearing \" sequence or is absent. [00161] A preferred IgGl amino acid sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the other Fc Domain-containing polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule of the present invention having two polypeptide chains (or the third polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule having three, four, or five polypeptide chains) will have the \"hole-bearing \" or is absent. [00162] An alternative IgGl amino acid sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the other Fc Domain-containing polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule of the present invention having a M252Y/S254T/T256E substitution and a \"hole-bearing \" sequence (K) or is absent. [00163] As will be noted, the CH2-CH3 Domains of SEQ NO:51, NO:53, and SEQ ID NO:54 include a substitution at position 234 with alanine and 235 with alanine, and thus form an Fc Domain exhibit decreased (or no) the binding exhibited by the wild-type Fc Domain (SEQ ID NO: 12) The invention also encompasses such CH2-CH3 Domains, which comprise the WO 2019/118266 63PCT/US2018/064204 wild-type alanine residues, alternative and/or additional substitutions which modify effector function and/or FyR binding activity of the Fc Domain. The invention also encompasses such CH2-CH3 Domains, which further comprise one or more half-live extending amino acid substitutions. In particular, the invention encompasses such hole-bearing and such knob-bearing CH2-CH3 Domains which further comprise the M252Y/S254T/T256E. [00164] An IgG4 amino acid sequence for the CH2 and CH3 Domains of the one Fc Domain-containing polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule of the present invention has enhanced serum half-life (relative to IgGl CH2 and CH3 Domains) or is absent. [00165] A \"knob-bearing \" variant of such an IgG4 CH2-CH3 amino acid sequence has the amino acid or is absent. [00166] A \"hole-bearing \" variant of such an IgG4 CH2-CH3 amino acid sequence has the amino acid (K) or is absent. [00167] It is preferred that the first polypeptide chain will have a \"knob-bearing \" CH2- CH3 sequence, such as that of SEQ ID NO:51 or SEQ ID NO:52. However, as will be recognized, a \"hole-bearing \" CH2-CH3 Domain (e.g., SEQ ID NO:53 or SEQ ID NO:54) could be employed in the first polypeptide chain, in which case, a \"knob-bearing \" CH2- CH3 Domain (e.g., SEQ ID NO:51 or SEQ ID NO:52) would be employed in the second polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule of the present invention having WO 2019/118266 64PCT/US2018/064204 two polypeptide chains (or in the third polypeptide chain of an Fc Domain-containing molecule having three, four, or five polypeptide chains). [00168] In other embodiments, the invention encompasses Fc Domain-containing binding molecules comprising CH2 and/or CH3 Domains that have been engineered to favor heterodimerization over homodimerization using mutations known in the art, such as those disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 2007/110205; WO 2011/143545; WO 2012/058768; WO 2013/06867, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. III. Trivalent Binding Molecules Containing Fc Domains [00169] A further embodiment of the present invention relates to trivalent binding molecules comprising an Fc Domain capable of simultaneously binding a First Epitope, a Second Epitope and a Third Epitope, wherein at least one of such epitopes is not identical to another. Such trivalent binding molecules comprise three Epitope Binding Domains, two of which are Diabody-Type Binding Domains, which provide Binding Domain A and Binding Domain B, and one of which is a Fab-Type Binding Domain, or an scFv-Type Binding Domain, which provides Binding Domain C (see, e.g., Figures 6A-6H, PCT Publication Nos. WO 2015/184207 and WO 2015/184203). Such trivalent binding molecules thus comprise \"VL1 \" / \"VH1 \" domains that are capable of binding the First Epitope and \"VL2 \" / \"VH2 \" domains that are capable of binding the Second Epitope and \"VL3 \" and \"VH3 \" domains that are capable of binding the \"third \" epitope of such trivalent binding molecule. A \"Diabody-Type Binding Domain \" is the type of Epitope Binding Domain present in a diabody, as described above. Each of a \"Fab-Type Binding Domain \" and an \"scFv-Type Binding Domain \" are Epitope Binding Domains that are formed by the interaction of the VL Domain of an immunoglobulin Light Chain and a complementing VH Domain of an immunoglobulin Heavy Chain. Fab-Type Binding Domains differ from Diabody-Type Binding Domains in that the two polypeptide chains that form a Fab-Type Binding Domain comprise only a single Epitope Binding Domain, whereas the two polypeptide chains that form a Diabody-Type Binding Domain comprise at least two Epitope Binding Domains. Similarly, scFv-Type Binding Domains also differ from Diabody-Type Binding Domains in that they comprise only a single Epitope Binding Domain. Thus, as used herein Fab-Type, and scFv-Type Binding Domains are distinct from Diabody-Type Binding Domains. WO 2019/118266 65PCT/US2018/064204 [00170] Typically, the trivalent Binding Molecules of the present invention will comprise four different polypeptide chains (see Figures 6A-6B), however, the molecules may comprise fewer or greater numbers of polypeptide chains, for example by fusing such polypeptide chains to one another (e.g., via a peptide bond) or by dividing such polypeptide chains to form additional polypeptide chains, or by associating fewer or additional polypeptide chains via disulfide bonds. Figures 6E-6F illustrate this aspect of the present invention by schematically depicting such molecules having three polypeptide chains. As provided in Figures 6A-6H, the trivalent binding molecules of the present invention may have alternative orientations in which the Diabody-Type Binding Domains are N-terminal (Figures an Fc Domain. CH2 and CH3 Domains useful for the generation of trivalent binding molecules are provided above and include knob-bearing and hole-bearing domains. [00171] In certain embodiments, the first polypeptide chain of such trivalent binding molecules of the present invention contains: (i) a VLl -containing Domain, (ii) a VH2- containing Domain, (iii) a Heterodimer-Promoting Domain, and (iv) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence. The VLl and VL2 Domains are located N-terminal or C-terminal to the CH2-CH3-containing domain as presented in Table 4 (also see, Figures 6A and 6B). The second polypeptide chain of such embodiments contains: (i) a VL2-containing Domain, (ii) a VHl -containing Domain, and (iii) a Heterodimer-Promoting Domain. The third polypeptide chain of such embodiments contains: (i) a VH3-containing Domain, (ii) a CHl- containing Domain and (iii) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence. The third polypeptide chain may be the Heavy Chain of an antibody that contains a VH3 and a Heavy Chain constant region, or a polypeptide that contains such domains. The fourth polypeptide of such embodiments contains: (i) a VL3-containing Domain and (ii) a CL-containing Domain. The fourth polypeptide chains may be a Light Chain of an antibody that contains a VL3 complementary to the VH3 of the third polypeptide chain, or a polypeptide that contains such domains. The third or fourth polypeptide chains may be isolated from naturally occurring antibodies. Alternatively, they may be constructed recombinantly, synthetically or by other means. [00172] The Light Chain Variable Domain of the first and second polypeptide chains are separated from the Heavy Chain Variable Domains of such polypeptide chains by an intervening spacer peptide having a length that is too short to permit their VL1/VH2 (or WO 2019/118266 66PCT/US2018/064204 their VL2/VH1) domains to associate together to form an Epitope Binding Domain capable of binding either the First or Second Epitope. A preferred intervening spacer peptide (Linker 1) for this purpose has the sequence (SEQ ID NO:16): GGGSGGGG. Other Domains of the trivalent binding molecules may be separated by one or more intervening spacer peptides (Linkers), optionally comprising a cysteine residue. In particular, as provided above, such Linkers will typically be incorporated between Variable Domains (i.e., VH or VL) and peptide Heterodimer-Promoting Domains (e.g., an E-coil or K-coil) and between such peptide Heterodimer-Promoting Domains (e.g., an E-coil or K-coil) and CH2-CH3 Domains. Exemplary linkers useful for the generation of trivalent binding molecules are provided above and are also provided in PCT Application Nos: PCT/US15/33081; and PCT/US 15/33076. Thus, the first and second polypeptide chains of such trivalent binding molecules associate together to form a VL1/VH1 Binding Domain capable of binding a First Epitope, as well as a VL2/VH2 Binding Domain that is capable of binding a Second Epitope. The third and fourth polypeptide chains of such trivalent binding molecules associate together to form a VL3/VH3 Binding Domain that is capable of binding a Third Epitope. [00173] As described above, the trivalent binding molecules of the present invention may comprise three polypeptides. Trivalent binding molecules comprising three polypeptide chains may be obtained by linking the domains of the fourth polypeptide N- terminal to the VH3-containing Domain of the third polypeptide (e.g., using an intervening spacer peptide (Linker 4)). Alternatively, a third polypeptide chain of a trivalent binding molecule of the invention containing the following domains is utilized: (i) a VL3-containing Domain, (ii) a VH3-containing Domain, and (iii) a Domain containing a CH2-CH3 sequence, wherein the VL3 and VH3 are spaced apart from one another by an intervening spacer peptide that is sufficiently long (at least 9 or more amino acid residues) so as to allow the association of these domains to form an Epitope Binding Domain. One preferred intervening spacer peptide for this purpose has the sequence: GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO:41). [00174] It will be understood the VL1/VH1, VL2/VH2, and VL3/VH3 Domains of such trivalent binding molecules may be different so as to permit binding that is mono- specific, bispecific or trispecific. In particular, the VL and VH Domains may be selected such that a trivalent binding molecule comprises two Binding Domains for a First Epitope and one Binding Domains for a Second Epitope, or one Binding Domain for a First Epitope WO 2019/118266 67PCT/US2018/064204 and two Binding Domains for a Second Epitope, or one Binding Domain for a First Epitope, one Binding Domain for a Second Epitope and one Binding Domain for a Third Epitope. [00175] The general structure of the polypeptide chains of representative trivalent binding molecules of invention is provided in Figures 6A-6H and in Table 5: Table 5 Four Chain 1st Orientation2nd Chain NH2-VL2-VH1-HPD-COOH 1st Chain NH2-VL 1-VH2-HPD-CH2-CH3 Chain 2nd Orientation2nd 1st Chain 1-VH2-HPD-COOH 3 rd Chain NH2-VH3 -CH1-CH2-CH3-COOH 2nd Chain NH2-VL3-CL-COOH 1st Orientation2nd Chain -COOH Chain Domain [00176] As provided above, such trivalent binding molecules may comprise three, four, five, or more polypeptide chains. IV. Embodiments of the Invention [00177] As stated above, the present invention is directed to a CD16 x DA Binding Molecule (e.g., an antibody, a diabody, an scFv, an antibody, a TandAb, etc.) comprising a Binding Domain capable of binding an epitope of CD16 (i.e., a \"CD16-Binding Domain \") and a Binding Domain capable of binding an epitope of a Disease Antigen (i.e., a \"Disease Antigen-Binding Domain \"). The invention thus encompasses binding molecules comprising one or more of the VH and/or VL Domains of an antibody that binds to CD 16, or more preferably, the CDR h 1, CDR h2, and CDR h3, l 1, CDR l2 and CDR l3 portions of such Domains. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, such binding WO 2019/118266 68PCT/US2018/064204 molecules will additionally contain Binding Domains sufficient to permit such molecules to bind to epitopes of one, two, three or or more than three Disease Antigens. The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions that comprise such molecule(s). [00178] By possessing Binding Domains sufficient to immunospecifically bind CD 16 and a Disease Antigen, the molecules of the present invention have the ability to co-localize CD 16-expressing cells (and especially Natural Killer cells) to the site(s) of cells expressing the Disease Antigen so as to enhance the likelihood of ADCC-mediated killing of the target cell. As discussed above, such molecules may be bispecific, or may be capable of binding more than two epitopes. [00179] In one embodiment, such CD 16-binding molecules of the present invention will be mono-specific so as to possess the ability to bind to only a single epitope of CD 16 and only a single epitope of a Disease Antigen. [00180] Alternatively, such molecules may be multi-specific, i.e., capable of binding one, two, three or four total epitopes, which may be apportioned in any manner to bind one, two or three epitope(s) of CD 16 (which two or three CD 16 epitopes may be the same or different) and three, two or one epitope(s) of one or more Disease Antigen(s). [00181] Thus, where such molecules are capable of immunospecifically binding to only a single Disease Antigen, they may be capable of immunospecifically binding to only one CD 16 epitope and to one, two or three epitope(s) of the Disease Antigen (which two Disease Antigen epitopes may be the same or different, and which three epitopes may be the same, or may be different, or may be two epitopes that are the same and one epitope that is different), or they may be capable of immunospecifically binding to only two CD 16 epitopes (which two epitopes may be the same or different) and one or two epitope(s) of the Disease Antigen (which two Disease Antigen epitopes may be the same or different), or they may be capable of immunospecifically binding to three CD 16 epitopes (which three epitopes may be the same, or may be different or may be two epitopes that are the same and one epitope that is different) and 1 epitope of the Disease Antigen. [00182] Similarly, where such molecules are capable of immunospecifically binding to two different Disease Antigens (e.g., a First Disease Antigen and a Second Disease Antigen), they may be capable of immunospecifically binding to only one CD 16 epitope and to one or two epitope(s) of the First Disease Antigen (which two First Disease Antigen WO 2019/118266 69PCT/US2018/064204 epitopes may be the same or different) and two or one epitope(s) of the Second Disease Antigen (which two Second Disease Antigen epitopes may be the same or different), or they may be capable of immunospecifically binding to only two CD 16 epitopes (which two epitopes may be the same or different) and one epitope of the First Disease Antigen and one epitope of the Second Disease Antigen. [00183] Similarly, such molecules may be capable of immunospecifically binding to three different Disease Antigens (e.g., a First Disease Antigen, a Second Disease Antigen and a Third Disease Antigen) and only one CD 16 epitope. [00184] (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)Thus, for example, such molecules may bind: a single epitope of CD 16 and a single epitope of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; a single epitope of CD 16 and two epitopes of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell a single epitope of CD 16 and three epitopes of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; a single epitope of CD 16, one epitope of a First Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell, and one epitope of a Second Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; a single epitope of CD 16, two epitopes of a First Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell, and one epitope of a Second Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; two epitopes of CD 16 and a single epitope of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; two epitopes of CD 16 and two epitopes of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; two epitopes of CD 16 and one epitope of a First Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell and one epitope of a Second Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; three epitopes of CD 16 and one epitope of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface of the target cell; WO 2019/118266 70PCT/US2018/064204 in all cases in which binding is to more than one epitope of CD 16 or a Disease Antigen, such epitopes may be the same or may be different or may be the same as one such epitope and different from another such epitope. [00185] Table 6 illustrates possible combination binding specificities of exemplary molecules of the invention. Table 6 Number of Epitopes Recognized by Exei the Invention Possessing Two, Three or Capable of Mediating the Recmplary CD16 X DA Binding Molecules of Four Epitope Binding Domains That Are irected Killing of a Target Cell Total Number of Binding DomainsNumber of CD16 Epitope(s)Number of of Disease AntigenNumber of Epitopes of 3 rd Disease AntigenNumber of Epitopes of Non-CD 16 Cell Surface Molecule 2 1 1 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 0 0 3 1 1 0 0 1 3 1 2 0 0 0 3 2 1 0 0 0 4 1 1 1 0 1 4 1 1 1 1 0 4 1 2 0 0 1 4 1 2 1 0 0 4 2 1 1 0 0 4 2 1 0 0 1 [00186] By forming more complex molecules, one may obtain CD 16-binding molecules that are capable of binding one or more Disease Antigens and that possess more than four epitope binding domains. Thus, no limitation is placed on the nature of epitopes or additional epitopes that may be bound by the molecules of the present invention other than that such additional binding capability does not prevent the molecule or Binding Domain thereof that is capable of binding to an epitope of CD 16 from such binding and does not prevent the molecule or Binding Domain thereof that is capable of binding to an epitope of a Disease Antigen from such binding. Thus, the CD 16 Binding molecules of the present invention may possess Epitope Binding Domains alternative or additional Epitope Binding Domains. As an example, the invention contemplates a binding molecule that comprises a First Epitope Binding Domain capable of immunospecifically binding an epitope of CD 16 and a Second Epitope Binding Domain that is capable of immunospecifically binding an epitope of a Disease Antigen that is arrayed on the surface WO 2019/118266 71PCT/US2018/064204 of such target cell and a Third Epitope Binding Domain capable of immunospecifically binding a different cell surface molecule, such as a non-CD 16 cell surface molecule of a Natural Killer cell. V. Exemplary Binding Molecules [00187] The present invention is directed molecules (e.g., an antibody, a diabody, an scFv, an antibody, a TandAb, etc.) capable of binding human CD 16 by virtue of their possession of a CD 16 Binding Domain. The present invention is particularly directed to such CD-16 Binding Molecules that are CD16 x DA Binding Molecules. Listed below are exemplary antibodies that may be used to produce the binding molecules and combination therapy of the present invention. A. Exemplary Anti-Human CD16 Antibodies 1. CD16-M1 and CD16-M2 and Their Humanized and hCD16-M2 which are novel, high affinity anti-human CD 16 monoclonal antibodies that bind well to both the CD 16 158F allotype and the CD 16 158V allotype, and that bind CD 16 at a site that does not block CD16-IgG binding. Such antibodies are particularly preferred for the purposes of the present invention since they can be readily employed in a patient population irrespective of its 158F/158V CD16A polymorphisms. (a) Anti-Human CD16 Monoclonal Antibody CD16-M1 [00189] The amino acid sequence of the VH Domain of murine anti-human CDl 6 monoclonal antibody CD16-M1 (SEQ ID NO:64) the VL of murine anti-human CD 16 monoclonal antibody CD16-M1 (SEQ ID NO:65) monoclonal antibody CD16-M1 are shown in Table 7 Table 7 CDRs of Anti-Human CD16-Monoclonal Antibody anti-human CD 16 monoclonal antibody CD16-M1.

Exemplary Antibodies That Bind to the Cell Surface of Effector Cells [00208] The CD16 X DA Binding Molecules of the present invention, and particularly the trispecific CD16 X DA Binding Molecules of the present invention may comprise a binding site for a non-CD 16 cell surface molecule of an effector cell. As used herein, the term \"effector cell\" denotes a cell that directly or indirectly mediates the killing of target cells (e.g., foreign cells, infected cells or cancer cells). Examples of effector cells include helper T Cells, cytotoxic T Cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, plasma cells (antibody-secreting B cells), macrophages and granulocytes. Preferred cell surface molecules of such cells include CD2, CD3, CD8, CD 16, TCR, and the NKG2D receptor. Accordingly, molecules capable of immunospecifically binding an epitope of such molecules, or to other effector cell surface molecules may be used in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Exemplary antibodies, whose VH and VL Domains may be used to construct molecules capable of mediating the redirected killing of a target cell are provided below. 1. Exemplary Anti-NKG2D Antibodies [00209] A preferred non-CD 16 cell surface molecule of a Natural Killer effector cell is the NKG2D receptor. The NKG2D receptor is expressed on all human (and other mammalian) Natural Killer cells (Bauer, S. et al. (1999) iiActivation OfNK Cells And T Cells By NKG2D, A Receptor For Stress-Inducible MICAf Science 285(5428):727-729; Jamieson, AM. et al. (2002) iiThe Role Of The NKG2D Immunoreceptor In Immune Cell Activation And Natural Killingf Immunity 17(1):19-29) as well as on all CD8 + T cells (Groh, V. et al.

Such binding ligands, and particularly those which are not expressed on normal cells, include the histocompatibility 60 (H60) molecule, the product of the retinoic (RAE-1), 3:781-790; el al. (2005) iiAltered NKG2D Function In NK Cells Induced By Chronic Exposure To Altered NKG2D Ligand-Expressing Tumor Cellsf Blood 106:1711-1717). Molecules that specifically bind to the NKG2D Receptor include the anti-NKG2D antibodies \"KYK-1.0 \" and \"KYK-2.0 \" (Kwong, KY et al. (2008) \"Generation , Affinity Maturation, And Characterization Of A Human Anti-Human NKG2D Monoclonal Antibody With Dual Antagonistic And Agonistic Activity f J. Mol. Biol. 384:1143-1156).

VIIL Methods of Production [00445] The molecules of the present invention are most preferably produced through the recombinant expression of nucleic acid molecules that encode such polypeptides, as is well-known in the art. [00446] Polypeptides of the invention may be conveniently prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis (Merrifield, B. (1986) \"Solid Phase Synthesis Science 232(4748):341- Houghten, R.A. (1985) iiGeneral Method For The Rapid Solid-Phase Synthesis Of Large Numbers Of Peptides: Specificity Of Antigen-Antibody Interaction At The Level Of WO 2019/118266 147PCT/US2018/064204 Individual Amino Acids \" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 82(15):5131-5135; Ganesan, A. (2006) \"Solid-Phase Synthesis In The Twenty-First Century ,\" Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 6(1):3-10). [00447] Antibodies may be made recombinantly and expressed using any method known in the art. Antibodies may be made recombinantly by first isolating the antibodies made from host animals, obtaining the gene sequence, and using the gene sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in host cells (e.g, CHO cells). Another method that may be employed is to express the antibody sequence in plants (e.g. , tobacco) or transgenic milk. Suitable methods for expressing antibodies recombinantly in plants or milk have been disclosed (see, for example, Peeters etal. (2001) iiProduction Of Antibodies And Antibody Fragments In Plants f Vaccine 19:2756; Lonberg, N. etal. (1995) \" Human Antibodies From Transgenic Mice f Int. Rev. Immunol 13:65-93; and Pollock etal. (1999) iiTransgenic Milk As A Method For The Production Of Recombinant Antibodies ,\" J. Immunol. Methods 231:147-157). Suitable methods for making derivatives of antibodies, e.g. , humanized, single-chain, etc. are known in the art, and have been described above. In another alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly by phage display technology (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,565,332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743; 6,265,150; and Winter, G. et al. (1994) iiMaking Antibodies By Phage Display Technology ,\" Annu. Rev. Immunol. [00448] Vectors polynucleotides of interest (e.g. , polynucleotides encoding the polypeptide chains of the binding molecules of the present invention) can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including electroporation, transfection employing calcium lipofecti on; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell. [00449] Any host cell capable of overexpressing heterologous DNAs can be used for the purpose of expressing a polypeptide or protein of interest. Non-limiting examples of suitable mammalian host cells include but are not limited to COS, HeLa, and CHO cells. [00450] The invention includes polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence of a binding molecule of this invention. The polypeptides of this invention can be made by WO 2019/118266 148PCT/US2018/064204 procedures known in the art. The polypeptides can be produced by proteolytic or other degradation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods {i.e., single or fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical synthesis. Polypeptides of the antibodies, especially shorter polypeptides up to about 50 amino acids, are conveniently made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical synthesis are known in the art and are commercially available. [00451] The invention includes variants of the disclosed binding molecules, including functionally equivalent polypeptides that do not significantly affect the properties of such molecules as well as variants that have enhanced or decreased activity. Modification of polypeptides is routine practice in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Examples of modified polypeptides include polypeptides with conservative substitutions of amino acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of amino acids which do not significantly or deleteriously change the functional activity, or use of chemical analogs. Amino acid residues that can be conservatively substituted for one another include but are not polypeptides, as well as polypeptides with other post-translational modifications, such as, for example, glycosylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation. Preferably, the amino acid substitutions would be conservative, i.e., the substituted amino acid would possess similar chemical properties as that of the original amino acid. Such conservative substitutions are known in the art, and examples have been provided above. Amino acid modifications can range from changing or modifying one or more amino acids to complete redesign of a region, such as the Variable Domain. Changes in the Variable Domain can alter binding affinity and/or specificity. Other methods of modification include using coupling techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, enzymatic means, oxidative substitution and chelation. Modifications can be used, for example, for attachment of labels for immunoassay, such as the attachment of radioactive moieties for radioimmunoassay. Modified polypeptides are made using established procedures in the art and can be screened using standard assays known in the art. [00452] In one embodiment, a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises a Light Chain, a Heavy Chain or both a Light and Heavy Chain. In another embodiment, the fusion WO 2019/118266 149PCT/US2018/064204 polypeptide contains a heterologous immunoglobulin constant region. In another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide contains a VH and a VL Domain of an antibody produced from a publicly-deposited hybridoma. For purposes of this invention, an antibody fusion protein contains polypeptide domains that enable the protein to immunospecifically bind both CD 16 and a Disease Antigen, and which contains another amino acid sequence to which it is not attached in the native molecule, for example, a heterologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another region (e.g., a deimmunized albumin-binding domain, a Protein A recognition sequence, a peptide tag, etc.). [00453] The present invention particularly encompasses such binding molecules (e.g., antibodies, diabodies, trivalent binding molecules, etc.) conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic moiety. For diagnostic purposes, the binding molecules of the invention may be coupled to a detectable substance. Such binding molecules are useful for monitoring and/or prognosing the development or progression of a disease as part of a clinical testing procedure, such as determining the efficacy of a particular therapy. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, beta-galactosidase, etc.), prosthetic groups emitting metals, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the binding molecule or indirectly, through an intermediate (e.g, a linker) using techniques known in the art. [00454] For therapeutic purposes, the binding molecules of the invention may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, (e.g, a cytostatic or cytocidal agent), a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion, e.g, alpha-emitters. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells such as, for example, Pseudomonas exotoxin, Diptheria toxin, a botulinum toxin A through F, ricin abrin, saporin, and cytotoxic fragments of such agents. A therapeutic agent includes any agent having a therapeutic effect to prophylactically or therapeutically treat a disorder. Such therapeutic agents may be chemical therapeutic agents, protein or polypeptide therapeutic agents, and include therapeutic agents that possess a desired biological activity and/or modify a given biological response. Examples of therapeutic agents include alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, WO 2019/118266 150PCT/US2018/064204 anti-mitotic agents, hormone therapy agents, and antibodies useful for the treatment of cell proliferative disorders. The therapeutic moiety may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the binding molecule or indirectly, through an intermediate (e.g., a linker) using techniques known in the art. IX. Uses of the Binding Molecules of the Present Invention [00455] As discussed above, molecules capable of binding CD 16 and a Disease Antigen are capable of mediating the redirected cell killing of a target cell (i.e., a cancer cell, or a pathogen-infected cell) that expresses such Disease Antigen on its cell surface. Such molecules may be used for therapeutic purposes, for example in subjects with cancer or an infection. Thus, binding molecules of the present invention have the ability to treat any disease or condition associated with or characterized by the expression of a Disease Antigen, particularly a Cancer Antigen or a Pathogen-Associated Antigen, on the surface of such target cell. Thus, without limitation, the binding molecules of the present invention may be employed in the treatment of cancer, particularly a cancer characterized by the expression of a Cancer Antigen. The binding molecules of the present invention may be employed in the treatment of infection, particularly an infection characterized by the expression of a Pathogen-Associated Antigen. [00456] In particular, the present invention encompasses such methods wherein the molecule capable of binding CD 16 comprises an Epitope-Binding Domain of an antibody that is capable of binding CD16 and also comprises an Epitope-Binding Domain capable of binding a Disease Antigen (in particular a Cancer Antigen or a Pathogen-Associated Antigen) on the surface of a target cell so as to mediate the redirected killing of the target cell (for example, by mediating redirected cell killing (e.g., redirected [00457] In a specific embodiment, the molecule capable of binding CD 16 and the Disease Antigen is a bispecific antibody, or the binding portions thereof, (including an scFv), a BiTe, a TandAb, and a CAR. [00458] In a specific embodiment, the molecule capable of binding CD 16 and the Disease Antigen is a bispecific diabody. WO 2019/118266 151PCT/US2018/064204 [00459] In a specific embodiment, the molecule capable of binding CD 16 and the Disease Antigen is a trivalent binding molecule.

In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. [00462] Exemplary disorders that may be treated by various embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, proliferative disorders, cell proliferative disorders, and cancer (especially a cancer expressing a Cancer Antigen bound by a molecule capable of mediating redirected cell killing), pathogen-associated diseases (especially a chronic viral infection associated with expression of a Pathogen-Associated Antigen bound by a molecule capable of mediating redirected cell killing). In various embodiments, the invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount the binding molecules of the present invention. Such molecules are particularly useful for the prevention, inhibition, reduction of growth, or regression of primary tumors, and metastasis of tumors, and for reducing pathogen load, or eliminating pathogen-infected cells. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, such molecules may mediate effector function against target cells, promote the activation of the immune system against target cells, cross-link cell-surface antigens and/or WO 2019/118266 152PCT/US2018/064204 receptors on target cells and enhance apoptosis or negative growth regulatory signaling, or a combination thereof, resulting in clearance and/or reduction in the number of target cells.

The compositions of the invention include bulk drug compositions useful in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions (e.g, impure or non-sterile compositions) and pharmaceutical compositions (i.e., compositions that are suitable for administration to a subject or patient) that can be used in the preparation of unit dosage forms. Such compositions comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a molecule capable of binding CD 16 and also capable of binding to a Disease Antigen so as to be capable of mediating the redirected killing of a target cell (e.g, a cancer cell, a pathogen-infected cell, etc.), or a combination of such agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, compositions of the invention comprise a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of the binding molecules of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a preferred aspect, such compositions are substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side effects). [00467] Various formulations of such compositions may be used for administration. In addition to the pharmacologically active agent(s), the compositions of the present invention may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that are well-known in the art and are relatively inert substances that facilitate WO 2019/118266 156PCT/US2018/064204 administration of a pharmacologically effective substance or which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically for delivery to the site of action. For example, an excipient can give form or consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are not limited to stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration enhancers. [00468] In a specific embodiment, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable \" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U. S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term \"carrier \" refers to a diluent, adjuvant (e.g., Freund 's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Generally, the ingredients of compositions of the invention are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration. [00469] The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with a binding molecule of the present invention, alone or with such pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Additionally, one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. [00470] The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. A kit can comprise any of the binding molecules of the present invention. The kit can further WO 2019/118266 157PCT/US2018/064204 comprise one or more other prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer, in one or more containers. XL Methods of Administration [00471] The compositions of the present invention may be provided for the treatment, prophylaxis, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a CD16 X DA pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, such compositions are substantially purified (i.e., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side effects). In a specific embodiment, the subject is an animal, preferably a mammal such as non-primate (e.g., bovine, equine, feline, canine, rodent, etc.) or a primate (e.g., monkey such as, a cynomolgus monkey, human, etc.). In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a human. [00472] Methods of administering a CD16 X DA Binding Molecule or pharmaceutical composition of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, and oral routes). In a specific embodiment, the binding molecules of the present invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. [00473] The invention also provides that preparations of the binding molecules of the present invention are packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of the molecule. In one embodiment, such molecules are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted, e.g, with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably, the binding molecules of the present invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container. [00474] The lyophilized preparations of the binding molecules of the present invention should be stored at between 2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C in their original container and the molecules should WO 2019/118266 158PCT/US2018/064204 be administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, such molecules are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule, fusion protein, or conjugated molecule. Preferably, such binding molecules, when provided in liquid form, are supplied in a hermetically sealed container. [00475] The amount of such preparations of the invention that will be effective in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient 's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. [00476] As used herein, an \"effective amount \" of a pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results including, without limitation, clinical results such as decreasing symptoms resulting from the disease, attenuating a symptom of infection (e.g., viral load, fever, pain, sepsis, etc.) or a symptom of cancer (e.g., the proliferation, of cancer cells, tumor presence, tumor metastases, etc.), thereby increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease, enhancing the effect of another medication such as via targeting and/or internalization, delaying the progression of the disease, and/ or prolonging survival of individuals. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. [00477] An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient: to kill and/or reduce the proliferation of cancer cells, and/or to eliminate, reduce and/or delay the development of metastasis from a primary site of cancer; or to reduce the proliferation of (or the effect of) an infectious pathogen and to reduce and /or delay the development of thepathogen-mediated disease, either directly or indirectly. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or WO 2019/118266 159PCT/US2018/064204 pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an \"effective amount \" may be considered in the context of administering one or more chemotherapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of each component is within the skill of the art. [00478] For the binding molecules encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is preferably determined based upon the body weight (kg) of the recipient subject. For the binding molecules encompassed by the invention, the dosage administered to a patient is typically from about 0.01 pg/kg to about 30 mg/kg or more of the subject 's body weight. [00479] The dosage and frequency of administration of a binding molecule of the present invention may be reduced or altered by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the molecule by modifications such as, for example, lipidation. [00480] The dosage of a binding molecule of the invention administered to a patient may be calculated for use as a single agent therapy. Alternatively, the molecule may be used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.

EXAMPLES [00484] Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention unless specified. Example 1 Characterization of CD16 Binding Molecules [00485] As discussed above, a series of DART\u00ae Diabody CD16 x DA Binding Molecules were generated incorporating different murine, humanized, or optimized anti- CD16 binding domains and having a Binding Domain that is immunospecific for either: (1) the HER2/neu tumor antigen (Binding Domain from Trastuzumab), (2) a Binding Domain that is immunospecific for an HIV antigen (Binding Domain from A32 or 7B2), (3) the CD 19 B-cell antigen (Binding Domain from CD 19 mAb 1), or (4) a Binding Domain that is immunospecific for an RSV antigen (Binding Domain from Palivizumab) (Table 14). WO 2019/118266 h3G8 7B2 [00486] were with the two (DART-X, DART-Y and and DJ130c (Abeam, etc.) A ProteOn analysis was conducted to assess the binding of test articles to CD 16 molecules that had been immobilized on a chip. The CD 16 molecules were first incubated with 5 nM CD16-Fc (human IgG2) Fusion captured, followed by incubation with 10 nM of a first test article (test article 1), followed by an incubation with 10 nM of a second test article (test article 2). Binding was detected using anti-human Fc F(ab ')2 fragments. [00487] This CD16-M1, CD16-M2, LNKl 6 and 3G8 binding domains each bound different epitopes of CD 16. CD16-M2 was found to compete with antibody DJ130c for binding to CD16; DJ130c has been reported to bind CD16 at a site that is non-overlapping with CD16 's Fc binding site (Tamm, A. el al. (1996) iiThe Binding Epitopes Of Human CD 16 (Fe Gamma RIII) Monoclonal Antibodies. Implications For WO 2019/118266 Igg Human FcgammaRIIIB Receptor Involves CC And FG Loops Of The Membrane- Proximal Domain, \" Biol. 271(7):3659-3666). [00488] of CD16-M1, DJ130c and LNK16 to bind CD16A in presence of IgG was evaluated. It was found that IgG presence inhibited binding by NK16, but that IgG presence did not inhibit binding between CD 16 and CD16-M1 was not inhibited by the presence of IgG, whereas L. The 3G8 epitope has been reported to overlap with CD16 's Fc binding site (Tamm, A. etal. (1996) J. [00489] Increasing concentrations of human IgG (hlgG) descreased the binding of antibody LNK16 to CD16, thus indicating that the epitope recognized by LNK16 overlaps with CD16 's Fc binding site; in contrast, binding by the CD16 Binding domains of DJ130c or CD16-M1 was substantially unaffected, thus indicating that the CD 16 epitopes recognized by these molecules did not overlap with CD16 's Fc binding site (Figure 8). [00490] As discussed above, CD16A possesses two major allotypes, reflecting an 158F vs. 158V polymorphism. As shown in Table 15, CD16 Binding Domains of CD16-M1 and CD16-M2 were found to bind to both CD 16 allotypes with similar high affinity (approximately 3-25-fold better than h3G8, which has a 10-fold lower affinity to the CD16 158F allotype, relative to the CD 16 158V allotype. The binding domain of h3G8 was found to exhibit a fast off-rate. The analysis was conducted using a BIACORE\u00ae format in which the diabody molecules were captured on a goat (Fab ')2 anti-human Fc surface, and the human CD16A V/F molecules (labeled with Avitag) were passed over the captured diabodies (normalized; 1:1 binding fit).

The CD 16 molecules were immobilized via an anti- PentaHis antibody, followed by incubation incubation with the diabodies. The results of the CD16 binding studies are summarized in Table 16 (the CD16 Binding Domain of DART- Z derives from scFv 4-LS21, which is specific for CD16A).

Diabodies comprising hCD16-M2 (VHl) CD16 Binding Domains exhibited slightly better binding than diabodies comprising the hCD16-M2 (VH2) CD 16 Binding Domains (compare DART-D vs. DART-E). Example 2 Binding of DART-F and DART-G CD16 Binding Molecules to NK Cells, Neutrophils and T cells [00493] In order to demonstrate the ability of the CD 16 X DA Binding Molecules of the invention to bind CD 16, whole blood of donor subjects was incubated in the presence of CD 16-binding diabodies: DART-F and DART-G, an HIV x CD3 diabody (as a positive control for T-cell binding via its CD3 Binding Domain), an HIV X RSV diabody (as a negative control for all binding), and an h3G8 x RSV diabody comparator molecule. detect diabody binding and the cell surface. The labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry gated on NK cells. The co\u00ad staining results of the investigation for a first subject are shown in Figures 9A-9C, and indicate that DART-F (hCD16-Ml) had a higher affinity for CD16A on the surface of NK cells relative to DART-G (hCD16-M2), both of which had a higher affinity than the h3G8 WO 2019/118266 165PCT/US2018/064204 x RSV diabody comparator molecule In contrast, whereas the h3G8 x RSV diabody comparator molecule was able to bind to CD16B of neutrophils, DART-G had lower binding ability, and DART-F had essentially no binding ability (Figure 9B). As shown in Figure 9C, the CD 16 Binding Molecules were unable to bind to T cells. [00494] Similar binding was observed using whole blood of a second donor subject. Lymphocyte binding (CD16A F/V) and Neutrophil binding (CD16B, allotype as described using DART-F DART- G (hCD16-Ml), and the h3G8 X RSV diabody comparator. The results of the investigation are shown in Figures 10A-10B. As shown in Figure 10A, DART-F (hCD16-Ml) and DART-G (hCD16-Ml) both exhibited binding to CD16A-expressing cells of the gated lymphocyte population, with DART-F exhibiting greater binding; the h3G8 X RSV diabody comparator molecule exhibited much weaker binding. As shown in Figure 10B, DART-F failed to bind CD16B-expressing cells of the gated granulocyte population, in contrast to DART-G and the h3G8 x RSV diabody comparator molecule, which both exhibited binding. Example 3 CD16B Allotype Specificity of Anti-CD16 Binding Molecules CD16-M1 and CD16-M2 [00495] In order to demonstrate the ability of the CD 16 X DA Binding Molecules of the invention to distinguish glycosylation allotypes NAl and NA2 x RSV diabody comparator were incubated in the presence of whole blood and analyzed essentially as described above. The results show diabody staining of whole blood that had been gated on CD66b+ cells (i.e., neutrophils and eosinophils). Figures 1IA-IIB show the results of such an analysis, and indicate that the h3G8 x RSV diabody comparator exhibited strong binding to NAl and medium binding to NA2. In contrast, DART-F exhibited strong binding to NA2 and weak binding to NA1. Example 4 CD16B Allotype Specificity of CD 16 Binding Molecules CD16-M1 and CD16-M2 [00496] In order to further evaluate the ability of the CD 16 X DA Binding Molecules of the invention to bind leukocytes, the ability of CD 16 Binding Domains of CD16-M1 to bind NK cells and granulocytes from whole blood was assessed. DART-C was incubated WO 2019/118266 166PCT/US2018/064204 in the presence of whole blood leukocyte cells and analyzed essentially as described above. The results show diabody staining of whole blood that had been gated on NK cells (0.6% of leukocytres) or on granulocytes (49% of leukocytes). Figure 12 shows the results of such an analysis, and indicates that CD16-M1 preferentially binds to NK cells. Example 5 Binding of CD16 Binding Molecules to Human CD16, Cynomolgus Monkey CD16 and Murine CD16 [00497] Since the amino acid sequences of human CD 16, cynomolgus monkey CD 16 and murine CD 16 share varying degrees of homology (Figure 13; SEQ ID NOs:183, 184, and 185, respectively), the ability of CD16 X DA Binding Molecules possessing CD 16 Binding Domains of antibodies CD16-M1, CD16-M2 and 3G8 to bind human CD 16, cynomolgus monkey CD 16 and murine CD 16 was investigated. The analysis was conducted using a BIACORE\u00ae format in which the diabodies molecules were captured on a Her2-His-tag surface, and the CD16 molecules (IgG2-Fc fusion proteins, 25 and 100 nM) were passed over the captured diabodies (normalized; bivalent binding fit estimate). The results of the investigation are summarized in Table 17. Table 17 CD16 Binding 12 571 No Binding DART-D hCD16-M2 4 597 No Binding [00498] The CD 16 binding domain of h3G8 was found to be able to bind CD 16a of cynomolgus monkey with somewhat reduced affinity relative to its binding to human CD 16a. The CD16 binding domains of DART-C (hCD16-Ml) and DART-D (hCD16-M2) were found to have low affinity to cynomolgus monkey CD 16. None of the tested CD 16 binding molecules were found to be capable of binding to murine CD 16, commensurate with its lower homology to human CD 16. WO 2019/118266 167PCT/US2018/064204 Example 6 Evaluation of CD 16 Binding Molecule-Mediated Cytotoxicity of HER2/Neu-Positive Cells [00499] In order to demonstrate the ability of the CD 16 X DA Binding Molecules of the invention to mediate cell killing, the CD16 X HER2/neu Binding Molecules: DART-C (having an hCD16-Ml CD 16 Binding DART-D (having an hCD16-M2 CD 16 Binding Domain); DART-1 (having an h3G8 CD 16 Binding Domain); or a HER2/Neux RSV diabody (negative control) were separately incubated with target cancer cells expressing different levels of HER2/neu in the presence of Effector cells (either human PBMC (E:T = 30:1) or purified human NK cells (E:T = 2:1)) for 24 hours. The percentage cytotoxicity (i.e., redirected cell killing) was determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media by damaged cells essentially as described below. The results of this investigation are shown in Figures 14A-14E. Figure 14A shows the cytotoxicity exhibited against N87 NK cells 14B cells 14C shows the cytotoxicity of the NK cells of such PBMC preparation was not assessed. Figure 14D shows the cytotoxicity exhibited against N87 HER2/neu PBMCs; allotype of the cells of such PBMC preparation was 158F/158V. Figure 14E shows the cells of such PBMC preparation was 158F/158V. The results show that CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the hCD16-Ml CD 16 Binding Domain exhibited greater cytotoxicity against the HER2/neu- expressing cancer cells than CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the hCD16-M2 CD 16 Binding Domain, and that molecules comprising such CD 16 Binding Domains exhibited greater cytotoxicity than CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the h3G8 CD 16 Binding Domain. WO 2019/118266 168PCT/US2018/064204 Example 7 Evaluation of CD 16 Binding Molecule-Mediated Cytotoxicity of HIV-Infected Cells [00500] In order to further demonstrate the ability of the CD16 X DA Binding Molecules of the invention to mediate cell killing, the CD16 X HTV env Binding Molecules: DART-F (having 16 Domain); DART-G (having an hCD16-M2 CD Binding Domain); or DART-2 (a h3G8 x RSV diabody used as a negative control here)), were separately incubated with target 293HEK D371, which express HIV Env, in the presence of Effector cells (either human PBMC (E:T = 30:1) or purified human NK cells (E:T = 3:1) for 24 hours. The percentage cytotoxicity (i.e. redirected cell killing) was determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media by damaged cells using an LDH redirected cell killing assay essentially as described below. The results of this investigation are shown in Figures 15A-15C. Figure 15A shows the cytotoxicity exhibited against the 293HEK D371 target cells by PBMCs of a first donor; the CD16A allotype the NK cells of such PBMC preparation was 158F/158V. Figure 15B shows the cytotoxicity exhibited against the 293HEK D371 target cells by PBMCs of a second donor; the CD16A allotype of the NK cells of such PBMC preparation was 158F/158F. Figure 15C shows the cytotoxicity exhibited against the 293HEK MC NK allotype of the NK cells was 158F/158V. The results again showed that CD16 x DA Binding Molecules comprising the hCD16-Ml CD 16 Binding Domain exhibited greater cytotoxicity against the HIV env-espressing cells than CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the hCD16-M2 CD 16 Binding Domain. [00501] As indicated above, DART-F and DART-G are both Fc Domain-containing diabodies composed of three polypeptide chains. In order to demonstrate the ability of CD16 x DA Binding Molecules of the invention that lack Fc Domains to mediate cell killing, the CD 16 X HTV env Binding Molecules: DART-X (having an hCD16-Ml CD 16 DART-Y (having an hCD16-M2 CD 16 Binding Domain); DART-O (having an h3G8 CD Binding Domain); (a CD16 X RSV diabody having an hCD16-Ml CD 16 Binding Domain used as a negative control here), were separately incubated with target HEK/D371 cells, which WO 2019/118266 169PCT/US2018/064204 express the HIV env protein, in the presence of Effector cells (either Jurkat/CD16A 158F (Figure 16A) or 158V/NFAT-Luc cells (Figure 16B)). The percentage cytotoxicity (i.e. cell killing) was determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media by damaged cells using an LDH redirected cell killing assay essentially as described below. The results of this investigation are shown in Figures 16A-16B. [00502] Figures 16A-16B show that DART-X (having an hCD16-Ml CD 16 Binding Domain) exhibited a higher percentage cytotoxicity than DART-Y (having an hCD16-M2 CD 16 Binding Domain). DART-O (having an h3G8 CD 16 Binding Domain) was found to mediate a higher level of cytotoxicity than DART-Y, but this effect was dependent on the effector cells having a 158V allotype (Figure 16A vs. Figure 16B). In contrast, the cytotoxicity mediated by DART-X or DART-Y was independent of CD16A allotype (Figure 16A vs. Figure 16B). Example 8 Optimization of Binding to Non-Human Primate CD16 [00503] As noted above, hCD16-Ml was found to have low affinity to cynomolgus monkey CD 16 (cynoCD16). Random mutagenesis was used to introduce substitutions of hCD16-Ml. The mutants were screened to identify clones having enhanced binding to non-human primate CD 16 (e.g., cynoCD16) and that retained binding affinity binding to both alleles of human CD 16. A variant designated \"hCD16-MlA \" having a mutated CDR h3, and a variant designated \"hCD16-MlB \" having a mutated CDR l3 were selected for further analysis. In addition, a third variant combining the CDR h3 and CDR l3 mutations was generated and designated \"hCD16-MlAB. \" The amino acid sequence of the CDRs and VH and VL Domains have been provided above (see, e.g., Table 8). Exemplary CD16 x DA Binding Molecules incorporating the optimized anti-CD 16 binding domains: hCD16-MlA, hCD16-MlB, or hCD16-MlAB, and having an anti-HER2/neu Binding Domain were generated and designated DART-I, DART-J, and DART-K, respectively (see, Table 12 for summary and above for detailed description and full amino acid sequences). [00504] The ability of the exemplary CD16 X HER2/neu Binding Molecules comprising the optimized hCD16-MlA, hCD16-MlB, and hCD16-MlAB, to bind CD 16 expressed on the surface of human (Figure 17A), cynomolgus monkey (Figure 17B), and WO 2019/118266 170PCT/US2018/064204 rhesus (Figure 17C) NK cells was examined by flow cytometry. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated and incubated in the presence of CD 16-binding diabodies: DART-C a HER2/neu x (as negative control CD 16 binding); DART-3 (a CD16 x RSV diabody control having the having the parental hCD16-Ml VH VL domains); or the DART-1 (h3G8 X HER2/neu diabody) PE) to detect diabody binding and the cell surface. The labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry gated on NK cells. [00505] The co-staining results of the investigation are shown in Figures 17A-17C and indicate that the CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the optimized variants, particularly hCD16-MlAB (DART-K), exhibited improved affinity for non-human primate CD 16 (Figures 17B-17C), although molecules comprising hCD16-MlB (DART-J) and hCD16-MlAB (DART-K) exhibited some reduction in binding to human CD 16 (Figure 17A) in this assay. No binding was observed by the negative control. [00506] The ability of CD 16 X DA Binding Molecules having optimized hCD16- M1A, hCD16-MlB, and hCD16-MlAB binding domains, to mediate redirected cell killing of JIMT-I-Luc target cells with human PBMCs (huPBMCs) or cynomolgus monkey PBMC (cynoPBMCs) effector cells from several donors was evaluated using two different redirected cell killing assays. Representative data from these studies are presented in Figures 18A-18D and summarized in Table 18. In both assays, DART-C (having the parental hCD16-Ml VH and VL a cynoPBMCs (Figure 18C-18D) and JIMT- I-Luc target tumor cells at an E:T ration of 30:1 and the percentage cytotoxicity (i.e., cell killing) was determined. In one assay cell killing was determined by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media by damaged cells using an LDH redirected cell killing assay essentially as described below (Figures 18A and 18C)). In another assay cytotoxicity was determined by luminescence (LUM) assay measuring cellular luciferase activity of the target cells using a LUM redirected cell killing assay essentially as described below (Figures 18B and 18D). The EC50 values hourWO 2019/118266 PCT/US2018/064204 171 and 48 hour incubation is presented in Table 18. Table 18 24 hour Assay/LDH 48 hour [00507] These data show that, although the CD 16 x DA Binding Molecule comprising the CD16 binding domain of hCD16-Ml (DART-C) binds cynoCD16 with apparent low affinity, it is capable of mediating redirected cell killing. In addition, CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the optimized CD 16 binding domains hCD16-MlA (DART-I), hCD16-MlB (DART-J), or hCD16-MlAB (DART-K) exhibited improved cytotoxicity CynoPBMCs while exhibiting only a slight reduction in cytotoxicity with huPBMCs as compared to the same molecule comprising hCD16-Ml (DART-C). Example 9 CD16 x CD19 Binding Molecules [00508] In further studies, exemplary CD16 X DA Binding Molecules having an anti- CD19 Binding Domain and incorporating the anti-CD16 binding domain of hCD16-Ml, or the optimized anti-CD 16 binding domain of hCD16-MlB or hCD16-MlAB, were generated and designated DART-L, DART-M, and DART-N, respectively (see, Table 12 for summary and above for detailed description and full amino acid sequences). Three additional molecules were generated and designated DART-5 (comprising hCD16-Ml), DART-6 (comprising hCD16-MlA), and DART-7 (comprising hCD16-MlAB), in which the CD 19 Binding Domain was replaced with an anti-RSV binding domain (see, Table 12 for summary and above for detailed description), such exemplary CD16 X RSV Binding Molecules are used below as negative controls for CD 19 binding. [00509] The ability of: DART-L, as MGDOl 1; amino acid sequence found in WHO Drug Information, 2016, Proposed INN: List 116, 30(4):627-629) to mediate redirected cell killing of Raji-Luc target cells with human PBMCs (huPBMCs) effector cells (E:T = 30:1) was evaluated in the LDH and LUM cell killing assays essentially as described below. Representative data from these studies are presented in Figures 19A-19D. The results of the LDH assays show that after 24 hours (Figure 19A) and 48 hour (Figure 19B) incubations the CD16 X DA Binding Molecules exhibited similar cytotoxicity activity as MGDOl 1, with the CD16 X DA Binding Molecules comprising the optimized CD 16 binding domains hCD16-MlB (DART-M), or hCD16-MlAB (DART-N), exhibiting similar cytotoxicity with huPBMCs as compared to the same molecule comprising hCD16-Ml (DART-L). Similar results were observed after 24 hours (Figure 19C) and 48 hours (Figure 19D) in the LUM assays. Minimal cytotoxicity was observed for the control molecules lacking a CD 19 binding domain (DART-5, DART-6, and DART-7) in these studies. [00510] The exemplary CD16 X DA Binding Molecules DART-L, DART-M, DART-N (having a binding site for the B-cell antigen CD 19) and the negative controls: DART-5 and DART-6 (having a binding site for CD 16 and a binding site for RSV) were evaluated for their ability to mediate autologous B-cell depletion in vitro. Briefly, PMBCs isolated from human or cynomolgus monkey were incubated in supplemented medium in the presence of increasing concentrations DART-L, DART-M, DART-N and the control molecules lacking a CD 19 binding domain DART-5 and DART-6. B-cell levels were analyzed by flow cytometry (using CD3 for negative selection and CD20 as a B-cell marker; CD3/CD20 +) at 72 hours and 96 hours post incubation for huPBMCs (Figures 20A-20B, respectively) and at 72 hours and 144 hours post incubation for cynoPBMCs (Figures 20C- 20D, respectively). Representative data from these studies are presented in Figures 20A- 20D, and show that all the CD16 x DA Binding Molecules were able to deplete autologous B-cells from both huPBMCs (Figures 20A-20B) and cynoPBMCs (Figures 20C-20D). CD 16 x DA Binding Molecules comprising the optimized CD 16 binding domains hCD16- MlB (DART-M), or hCD16-MlAB (DART-N), mediated a larger reduction in B-cells, with both huPBMCs and cynoPBMCs as compared to the same molecule comprising hCD16-Ml (DART-L). However, higher concentrations were required to deplete B-cells from cynoPBMCs. This trend was observed for multiple PBMC donors. Minimal B-cell depletion was observed for the control molecules lacking a CD 19 binding domain (DART- 5 and DART-6) WO 2019/118266 173PCT/US2018/064204 redirected cell killing assay the CytoTox 96\u00ae Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega), or similar, that quantitatively measures LDH release essentially as described below. Target cells (e.g., tumor target cells) are resuspended at a density of 4 x IO5 cells/mL (or appropriate density to achieve the desired E:T ratio) in assay media 10% FBS, pen/strep) a viability of higher than 90% at assay initiation, and isolated purified effector cells (e.g., PBMC or NK cells purified from human or non-human primate (e.g, cynomolgus monkey) donor) suspended in the assay media at the appropriate density (e.g, 4 x IO5 cells/mL) to achieve an effector-to-target (E:T) cell ratio of 10:1, or 30:1 (or other desired E:T ratio) are used. An aliquot of target cell suspension (e.g, 50 pL, -20,000 cells), an aliquot of effector cell suspension (e.g, 100 pL, -200,000 cells for 10:1 E:T ratio), and an aliquot (e.g, 50 pL) of serially diluted test article (e.g, 5 fold, or 10 fold) are added to duplicate wells of a microtiter plate and incubated (37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2) for 24- 96 hours, or longer if desired. At the end of the incubation an aliquot of lysis solution (e.g, 30 pL) is added and the plates are incubated for -10 minutes to completely lyse the target cells. The plates are then centrifuged to pellet the cell debris (e.g, 212 x g for 5 minutes) and an aliquot (e.g, 40 pL) of supernatant of is transferred from each well of the assay plate to a flat-bottom ELISA plate and an aliquot (e.g, 40 pL) of LDH substrate solution is added to each well. Plates are incubated for 10-20 minutes at room temperature in the dark and an aliquot (e.g, 40 pL) of stop solution (Promega Cat # Gl83A) is added. The optical density is measured at 490 nm within 1 hour on a Victor2 Multilabel plate reader (Perkin Elmer # 1420-014), or similar. Specific cell lysis is calculated from optical density (OD) data using the following formula: Cytotoxicity maximal release and \"SR\" is spontaneous release.

Form PCT/ISA/2 10 (continuation of first sheet (2)) (January 2015) INTERNATIONAL SEARCH REPORT Information on patent family membersInternational application No. PCT/US 18/64204 -\"'-Continued from Box III: Lack of Unity of Invention-*\"- This application contains the following inventions or groups of inventions which are not so linked as to form a single general inventive concept under PCT Rule 13.1. In order for all inventions to be examined, the appropriate additional examination fees must be paid. Groups I+, Claims 1-3, 20-24 and SEQ ID NOs: 66-71 are directed toward bispecific antigen-binding molecules (antibodies) having binding affinity for epitopes of CD16 and a disease antigen wherein said antigen-binding molecules comprise heavy chain variable and light chain variable regions with CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 domains in both regions. The antibodies will be searched to the extent they encompass an anti-CD1 17 antibody encompassing SEQ ID NO: 72 (first exemplary VH), encompassing SEQ ID NO: 66 (first exemplary HCDR1); SEQ ID NO: 67 (first HCDR2); 68 (first HCDR3); 69 (first exemplary LCDR1); SEQ 70 (first exemplary LCDR2); and SEQ ID NO: 71 (first exemplary LCDR3). Applicant is invited to elect additional set(s) of antibody sequence(s), including, where applicable, heavy and light chain variable region sequence(s), with associated CDR sequence(s), with specified SEQ ID NO: for each, or with specified substitution(s) at specified site(s) of a SEQ ID NO:, such that the sequence of each elected species is fully specified (i.e. no optional or variable residues or substituents), to be searched. Additional set(s) of antibody sequence(s) will be searched upon the payment of additional fees. It is believed that claims 1-3 (each in-part), 20 (in-part) and 24 (in-part) encompass this first named invention and thus these claims will be searched without fee to the extent that they encompass SEQ ID NO: 72 (VL), SEQ SEQ ID NO: 71 (LCDR3). Applicants must specify the claims that encompass any additionally elected sequence(s). Applicants must further indicate, if applicable, the claims which encompass the first named invention, if different than what was indicated above for this group. Failure to clearly identify how any paid additional invention fees are to be applied to the \"+\" group(s) will result in only the first claimed invention to be searched/examined. An exemplary election would be SEQ ID NO: ID NO: 82 (LCDR3). No technical features are shared between the antibody sequences of Groups I+ and, accordingly, these groups lack unity a priori. Additionally, even if Groups I+ were considered to share the technical features of: a CD16 x Disease Antigen (CD16 x DA) Binding Molecule comprising a CD16 Binding Domain capable of binding an epitope of CD16 and also a Disease Antigen-Binding Domain capable of binding an epitope of a Disease Antigen, wherein said CD16 Binding Domain comprises one or more of: (A) a CDRH1 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (B) a CDRH2 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (C) a CDRH3 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (D) a CDRL1 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (E) a CDRL2 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; and (F) a CDRL3 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; and a CD16 Binding Molecule, that comprises: (A) a CDRH 1 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (B) a CDRH2 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (C) a CDRH3 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (D) a CDRL1 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; (E) a CDRL2 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; and (F) a CDRL3 Domain comprising a defined amino acid sequence; however, these shared technical features are previously disclosed by US 2016/0280795 A1 (WANG). Wang discloses a CD16 (antibody fragment specific for CD16; paragraph [0011]; claim 9) x Disease Antigen (antibody fragment specific for a tumor antigen; paragraph [0008], [0019)) (CD16 x DA) abstract; paragraph [0006]) comprising a CD16 Binding Domain (antibody fragment specific for CD16; paragraph [0011]; claim 9) capable of binding an epitope of CD16 (paragraph [0037]) and also a Disease Antigen-Binding Domain (antibody fragment specific for a tumor antigen; paragraph [0008], [0019]) capable of binding an epitope of a Disease Antigen (paragraph [0037]), wherein said CD16 Binding Domain (antibody fragment specific for CD16; paragraph [0011]; claim 9) comprises one or more of: (A) a CDRH1 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (B) a CDRH2 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (C) a CDRH3 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (D) a CDRL1 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (E) a CDRL2 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); and (F) a CDRL3 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); and a CD16 Binding Molecule (antibody fragment specific for CD16; paragraph [0011]; claim 9), that comprises: (A) a CDRH1 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (B) a CDRH2 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (C) a CDRH3 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (D) a CDRL1 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); (E) a CDRL2 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]); and (F) a CDRL3 Domain (paragraph [0040]) comprising a defined amino acid sequence (paragraphs [0062], [0077]). Since none of the special technical features of the Groups I+ inventions is found in more than one of the inventions, and since all of the shared technical features are previously disclosed by the Wang reference, unity of invention is lacking.
