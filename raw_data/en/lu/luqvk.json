It is referred to as Goa butter tree or kokum butter tree in English, Marathi, Punarpuli in Tulu, Murgal- masala in Tamil, etc. It mainly grows on the Western coasts of India but can also be found in the Eastern and North-Eastern states.1 It might be widely used for culinary purposes, for the picking of fish (called Colombo curing), for making drinks, for the manufacture of cosmetics, etc., but most importantly, it is used in Ayurveda for its wide range of potential uses.1,2 Nutritional composition Side Effects & More!](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/ayurveda-uses-benefits-side-effects-precautions-of-ber-fruit/) Other than loads of health benefits, Kokum may have a beneficial role in the food industry. I recently read in an article that it may be a perfect choice for colour extraction since it is a rich source of anthocyanin. [Dr. Siddharth Gupta, MD] Kokum has been used since ancient times due to potential properties like: The following may be the potential use of kokum for health. Kokum might help protect the liver; hence it might be used as a liver tonic.2 Kokum might help in the digestion of food. It may act as a natural antacid, and its preparations with yoghurt and salt may help with gastric ulceration and burning sensation.3 It may be helpful in the management of stools with blood and mucous content due to stomach infections (dysentery), watery stools (diarrhoea) and fissures due to hard stools (piles).3 Overall, kokum might be good for digestive health and gut-related problems and may help with the appetite.2 However, more studies are required. Kokum might be helpful for weight management as it might help reduce hunger and may help increase the expenditure of energy.1 It may also help in suppressing the production of fatty acids and might help in their conversion into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. All these mechanisms might aid in weight management, and juices made of kokum may be helpful for this purpose.2 It might help with better circulation of blood in the body and not allowing the accumulation of fat in the blood vessels.3 However, more research is required to ascertain these claims. Kokum butter might have potential moisturising properties. Therefore, it is widely used in the cosmetic industry for the preparation of soaps, lip balms, and body lotions.2 Traditionally, it has been used for dry skin. It is may also be helpful for soothing burns and cracked feet and for fissures of the lips, ulcers etc.1,2 However, more research is required to prove these facts.

When certain conventional antibiotics have side effects, one of the active components of kokum, Garcinol, may be used as an alternative. Its actions against bacteria like Staphylococcus, which is responsible for many known diseases, might have similar effects to traditional antibiotics used.3 Its potential use against gastric ulcers may also be attributed to its antimicrobial effect against Helicobacter pylori, which is the main causative agent.3 It may also be effective against fungal infections of the skin and mouth and parasitic worms in the stomach.2,3 However, more research is required in this field. Though there are studies that show the potential uses of kokum in various conditions, but these are insufficient and there is a need of further studies to establish the true extent of benefits of kokum on human health. Other than medicinal and therapeutic uses, Kokam has found its place in our delicacies as well. From my experience, Kokam is used in production industries in butter, wine, health beverages, pickles, curries, and pickles.

Do not discontinue or replace an ongoing treatment of modern medicine with an ayurvedic/herbal preparation without consulting a qualified doctor.
