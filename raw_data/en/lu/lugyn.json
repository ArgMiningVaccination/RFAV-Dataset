It may be performed by a doctor, a physical therapist, a nurse, or a psychologist\u2014 or achieved on its own with proper instruction from a trained professional. Although access to full-spectrum ultraviolet of natural sunlight is considered the best type of light therapy, it is not always practical for many to get outside. Light counselors also prescribe therapy with artificial lighting from lightboxes. The type of light therapy most widely practiced currently is known as white-light therapy. It allows you to sit near a special light box filled with high-intensity light bulbs, which can provide a full-spectrum or white illumination. This method of light therapy has been shown to be particularly useful in the diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), otherwise known as winter blues, a cause of anxiety which happens as the amount of sunlight reduces with seasonal changes. Several sleep disorders have also been shown to be successful. For SAD, clinicians usually recommend sitting 15 to 20 minutes in front of a lightbox with a strength of 10,000 lux (lux is the global light module, one lumen per square meter). The illumination is about 15 times stronger than normal home and workplace lighting. You can also undergo light therapy by adding full-spectrum lamps instead of incandescent or fluorescent space lighting. Nonetheless, this approach is less successful for depressive disorders because it appears to respond better to extreme rather than dissipated illumination. Several common forms of light therapy are: Colored-Light Therapy Another form of light therapy utilizes colored floodlights and small light rays that bathe the body with different shades of color (usually red, but also green, black, violet, and sometimes other colors), sometimes in flickering patterns. Advocates say that different colors of light affect the body by modifying the brain's neurochemical output. While more work needs to be done in this field to demonstrate the efficacy of treatment, several early studies were encouraging. In a preliminary study in Headache, patients with migraine headaches are handled with goggles that alternately lit the right and left (closed) eyes with the red light. Of the 50 attacks, 49 were helped, and 36 ended. In another preliminary study, 50 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees are subjected to red light. Those who underwent red light therapy indicated that their discomfort was significantly reduced relative to the placebo light therapy community (in which the same device was used but not exposed to the person, there was no light emitted). Cold Laser Therapy Often known as mild or low-level laser therapy, this form of light therapy relies on low-intensity laser light rays in a single area of the body. Treatment is believed to cause a sequence of enzymatic reactions and bioelectric activities that activate the natural healing cycle at the cellular level. Fans claim that cold laser therapy is effective for alleviating pain, reducing inflammation, and helping to heal wounds, but there has been no scientific evidence of this RED LIGHT THERAPY Red light therapy, also recognized as photobiomodulation or low-level laser therapy (LLLT), has increasingly become a standard type of treatment for a variety of conditions in the areas of neurology, physiotherapy, and dermatology. More specifically, the use of red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) managed to reach through the skin of a person has shown considerable possibilities for cell growth, tissue repair, and pain management. It is also active in improving the health of the joints and muscles; in increasing the side effects of cancer treatment; and in adding to the symptoms of aging and hair loss. For fact, LLLT can be used to treat depression, improve your mood and help you feel less stressed. Light therapy is one of the earliest therapeutic modalities known. Sun therapy was first used by Romans, and solar therapy was also studied by ancient Greeks, Chinese, and Indians. There is no doubt that light has biological effects: in reality, the body needs light to be safe. Clinical studies are now investigating how various wavelengths of light affect the body at the cellular level, the diseases that can be successfully treated by light therapy, and the optimum circumstances required to receive the effects of light-based care. LED is a light-emitting diode. This operates by transmitting infrared lights (causing heat) of various wavelengths / spectrums that have different skin-care benefits. The illumination of amber activates collagen and elastin. Red light is most widely used to promote movement. White light penetrates most and tends to close down and reduce inflammation. Blue light is destroying microbes. Systems relay light waves deep into the skin through LED therapy to induce natural intracellular responses. Depending on the light, the skin may respond differently. When[ color] red, your skin will respond by developing, expanding, and improving cellular structure. Red light is also believed to have an impact on oil glands to reduce cytokines that cause inflammations and play an important role in chronic acne. In the case of blue light, different wavelengths promote the development of oxygen radicals that destroy acne bacteria, all without affecting the body, What Is Red Light Therapy? Red light therapy (RLT) is a common medical procedure that uses low-level red light rays to address skin problems such as lines, bruises, or chronic injuries, among other factors.
