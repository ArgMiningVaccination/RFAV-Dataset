It is most developed in secondary care, where the influence of theNHS litigation authority has produced specific and detailed guidance. 1However, there is little decided on how it should be introduced into general practice. The National PatientSafety Authority (NPSA) and the Royal College of General Practitioner are to hold a jointconference to explore the issue. The model used for secondary care trusts would bebureaucratic to introduce at practice level and proscriptive for practices if introduced byPrimary Care Organisations. Doing the best for patients is key to why we became doctors.How can this initiative be made relevant to the problems faced by GPs? General practice does not have the reporting and control systems of secondary care. Putting them in place would protect the registered doctor and codify practice, but would it help thepatient? Similarly, detailed review after individual incidents can produce beneficial changeor overly bureaucratic protocols. Knowing what is expected and having rules for what to docertainly helps in some situations. Depending on the detail of the solution, harm can be done.The Audit Commission recently suggested that control was the reason for the retentionproblems in the public sector. 2It is known that increasing control over professionals reduces involvement and increases burnout.3 General practitioners are custodians of the medical record and are responsible for prescribing.Any potential problems are the responsibility of the GP who writes the prescription. Thereare real risks of inappropriate co-prescribing with warfarin, selecting the wrong dose ofmethotrexate or mixing up proprietary and generic drugs. Problems also arise frominteractions between medicines appropriately requested from two or more specialties. Theserequests often arise outside the practice from specialist doctors and nurses who do not takeresponsibility for the final prescribing decision. Risk is transferred to the GP. The registered doctor carries an additional responsibility for those who work in the practice. This was appropriate in the days of small practices when only the GP saw the patient andprovided services personally. Things are more difficult in large practices, where the GP ismanagerially and professionally responsible for the actions of others. In general practicethere is clear accountability for error \u2014 enquiries in other branches of medicine often seemto conclude that the problem was communication, because no one person was responsible.GP practices cannot do this. This responsibility encourages the GP principal to make sure thatthe system works. There are both considerable benefits (mostly for the system and thepatient) and costs (mostly for the practitioner). This is perhaps part of the reason why generalpractice has been effective in reducing risk for the NHS. Risk management traditionally describes risk to the patient. However, there are also risks to individuals within the system. Medical errors can be professionally and personally damaging,to GPs, salaried doctors, nursing and support staff. Unfortunately, it is now a commonexperience to have to console a damaged colleague after an error. In time, a change to adefensive culture or loss of staff will affect the functioning of the system. Risks are faced by GPs every working day. I chose prescribing above but analysing investigations or referrals or telephone consultations or follow-up of smear results or ... ad infinitum , would be equally apposite in our complex system in these complex times. There is a need for a comprehensive approach to risk management that understands the effect proposedsolutions have on individual doctors and the whole system. GPs have accepted theresponsibility inherent in holding the prescribing record and in acting as a gatekeeper tosecondary care. Risks will increase if GPs become unwilling or unable to coordinate care. Thiscrucial role must be recognised, valued and supported. It is appropriate to look at generalpractice as a whole to understand how the existing system and expected changes affect risk topatients. This can then be used to judge each prospective solution or design new approaches. Andrew Spooner References 1. NHS Litigation Authority. Risk Pooling Scheme for Trusts: Phase 2 Assessment Tool .

The afternoon workshop is being organised by the Institute of Rural Health (IRH) at itsbase at Gregynog, near Newtown on 9 July,with support from the New OpportunitiesFund and the National Public Health Servicein Powys. As the second most common cancer in men and the third most common in women, lungcancer is the biggest cancer killer in the UK.About 38 000 new cases of lung cancer arediagnosed in the UK each year and anaverage of 94 people die every day.Prevention, management and targets relatingto lung cancer have changed during the pastfew years, and this workshop is aimed atbringing health professionals up to date. Speakers at the workshop include Jemma Edmonds, smoking cessation co-ordinatorfor Dyfed and Powys, who will address theissue of smoking cessation in rural areas;and Tim Cooper, cancer services manager atthe Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, who willoutline changes in cancer services and theimplications for General Practice. New treatments and lung cancer survival rates will be covered by Dr Seamus Linnane,of Llandough Hospital, Penarth, while TrishLangdon, clinical nurse specialist at theRoyal Shrewsbury Hospital, will refer toaftercare for lung cancer and Eirian Thomas,community McMillan nurse for ShropshirePrimary Care Trust, will speak aboutpalliative care in the community. The main aim of the New Opportunity Fund project is to raise awareness of the signs andsymptoms of male-specific cancer in thecommunity. Mortality from lung cancer hasdropped at a slower rate in Powys then therest of Wales, and the county has the highestincidence and mortality in males and has thesecond highest incidence for women. It ismost common in men and women agedbetween 65 and 75 years of age.

Born in Szepesofalu (then in Hungary, now in Slovakia), she lost her place to studymedicine in Budapest when she was arrestedand spent four days in prison for illegalyouthful political activities. She secured aplace at Prague instead, but was preventedfrom qualifying by the Nazi occupation in1938. She returned to Budapest to marryJulian, a professional journalist, andtogether with their two children theysurvived war and Russian occupation. Sheattended the Medical Faculty of BudapestUniversity from 1945 to 1947 andeventually qualified as a DM. In 1949 sheaccompanied her husband when he wasposted to Stockholm as Hungarian EnvoyExtraordinary to Sweden, Norway andDenmark \u2014 an attempt by the increasinglyStalinist Budapest government to avoid hiscriticisms. After receiving a warning thatthere was trouble to be expected on theirrecall to Hungary, when the call came thefollowing year they changed trains inCopenhagen, took the boat to Harwich, andsought asylum in the UK. The ambassadorwhom Julian had assisted, however, wentback to Budapest \u2014 and then he had to fleefollowing the failure of the Hungarianuprising in 1956. After qualifying again in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1955, she entered generalpractice in the West of Scotland, beforeappointment to a single-handed practice inStepney in east London in 1964. Later, sheestablished a successful teaching partner-ship practice at Cable Street, her promisednew premises turning out to be a Portakabin.Having declared that she would never visitHungary as long as the Iron Curtainremained, the fall of the Berlin Wall inspiredher to drive alone to Budapest in her oldV olvo, to see friends and scenes of herchildhood. She and Julian eventually retiredto live in a cottage at Roydon, near Diss, inNorfolk, where she continued to assistneighbouring practices until her final illnessclaimed her on 2 January 2003. All who spoke at the celebration recalled her infectious enthusiasm and joie de vivre . The College was honoured to have her on itsCouncil. She was in every way a great lady,and a credit to the profession of generalpractice.

New York: UNDP, 2001. 7. World Health Organization.Country Profile: DRC. Geneva: WHO, 2002.OF16 admissions into the clinic yesterday, the doctor tells us, fivechildren had lost one or both parents. This is but one example of the grim realityfacing millions living in today's war-tornDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC), acountry in the grip of a devastating warspanning decades, in which death andviolence is endemic. We meet eight-year-old Zarie, now the only one of her family left to take care of hermalnourished baby sister. The baby liesasleep, tied onto her back, as she awaits herturn in the feeding queue. Five otherchildren have also arrived at the clinic todaywith their sick mother, who is suffering fromdeep grenade wounds to both her legs. Thefamily fled fighting in their village, andspent days and nights in the forest too scaredto return and seek medical help. Their fatherwas killed outright as the first bombsdropped on their house. Stories of suchhuman tragedy are commonplace in theDRC; everyone is affected. Populations living in eastern parts of the country, witnesses to ongoing heavy fightingbetween armies, rebel factions, and proxymilitia, are particularly affected. 1Physical assaults, torture, sexual abuse, theft, anddestruction of property occur withfrightening regularity. 2Thousands live in a state of perpetual terror and motion. This year, violence has once again escalated around the town of Bunia, Ituri province,near the Ugandan border, following thewithdrawal of Ugandan forces. In May,more than 100 000 residents fled in fear ofmilitia wielding machetes, spears, andguns. 3Massacres and indiscriminate killings were carried out with total impunity. Thecorpses of men, women, and children layrotting in Bunia's streets, with aid agenciesunable to move securely throughout much ofthe area to respond to the mounting healthand humanitarian needs. Forty thousandpeople arrived in neighbouring Beni after atwo-week journey by foot through the forest,while tens of thousands remain as yetunaccounted for. The likelihood of a majormassacre taking place in Bunia in the nearfuture is increasing; the killing continuesthroughout Ituri at this time. After repeatedcalls for the presence of an internationalpeace-keeping force, with a mandate to stopthe ongoing violence, a rapid-reaction forceof French-led UN troops was deployed inJune. However, its work is currently restric-ted to Bunia, initially for three months. In 2001, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF)carried out a survey to assess the population's exposure to violence in westernand central DRC. In Basankusu, 2a cease- fire zone occupied by the military, it wasfound that, between 1998 and 2000, 85% ofhouseholds had a family member who hadexperienced violence; nearly 90% had beenobliged to flee or were displaced during thattime (see Table 1). Existing health services have long since been unable to respond to the escalatingneeds. Infectious and diarrhoeal illnesses,malaria, and malnutrition \u2014 a pattern ofdisease typical in such emergencies 4\u2014 remain common causes of death throughoutthe country at this time, both in and out ofareas of direct fighting. The DRC now ranks179 out of 191 countries surveyed by theWorld Health Organization, 5and remains one of the world's least developedcountries. 6 Years of mismanagement and corruptionhave left health services throughout thecountry in crisis. Violence and populationdisplacement on a massive scale compoundsthe situation further still. The withdrawal ofmultilateral and bilateral aid initiatives since1992 has left the health system in the solehands of non-governmental organisationsand independent groups. The WHOestimates that up to 75% of the populationmay have no access to formal health care. 7 The result is high mortality and chronic illhealth throughout the country. MSF has been providing medical assistance in the DRC since 1981. Activities includesupervising and training health staff,vaccinations, antenatal care, epidemio-logical surveillance, and water andsanitation improvement. MSF is working ata grass roots level to ensure continuousprovision of drug supplies into the regions inwhich it works. The destruction of roads andbridges has severely damaged tradenetworks throughout the interior of theDRC, and thus health centres throughout thecountry lack basic supplies. Where they doexist, a shortage of paper money in a countrywhose economy has totally collapsed meansthat few have any means of buying them.More than two-thirds of people inBasankusu, for example, reported notseeking consultation when they fell illbecause they had no money to pay fordoctors or medicines. 2 Perpetual insecurity hinders the initiation oflong-term health initiatives. A sustainableapproach remains out of the question in acountry with neither centralised control norIn some villages the people are living in the most basic conditionsand extremely emaciated people arefound, locally they are called the'living skeletons'. This boy is 18years old and is suffering fromsevere malnutrition. Photo: Frida Lagerholm/MSF a functioning economy. Instead, acute needs must be addressed with the urgency theyhave long since required. In Bunia, MSF iscurrently carrying out 15 to 20 surgicalinterventions a day, mainly for injuries fromgunshots or machete wounds, and up to 120medical consultations. Monitoring of the100 000 displaced people living in twocamps in Bunia is ongoing, with measuresbeing put in place to contain a possiblecholera outbreak. No access to thethousands who fled to forest areas aroundBunia, and who are cut off from foodsupplies and health care, is possible at thistime. In other areas, public authorities sent to maintain law and order abuse civilians withimpunity as well, presenting as great a threatto the civilian population as the previousmilitary groups. The MSF team in Yahuma,in Oriental Province, has recently witnessedsuch abuses. Aside from general looting,villagers are used as 'slaves' by the newlyestablished police force. Resistance has ledto physical retribution and indefinitedetention. In other more stable parts of the country, infectious disease control and treatment area priority. Death among children isparticularly high throughout the DRC; acollapsed health service means that manyare left unprotected from vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles andtuberculosis. Francine, who presented at theMSF clinic this morning, is one ofthousands affected. Skeleton thin, she lies inthe examining room groaning and coughingin acute pain as the doctor checks herabdomen. She has not been to a clinicbefore, she explains, because she had no The British Journal of General Practice, July 2003 581money to pay. The doctor's diagnosis isadvanced disseminated tuberculosis, fromwhich she will almost certainly die. A crueland unjust end for a child of 12 years. In recent months, the health and humanitarian situation in the DRC has gonefrom bad to catastrophic. Continuedviolence and displacement means thatthousands cannot be reached with vitalhumanitarian assistance. Internationalorganisations, falling over each other in Iraqat this time, are notably absent in thisforgotten corner of the globe, despiteobvious and acute needs. Westerngovernments, who have long since brushedthis crisis under the carpet, must stopdeclaring the situation too tangled toresolve, and act to provide a massiveincrease in assistance countrywide. Initiatives that will guarantee the security and protection of the civilian population,and allow improved access of humanitarianaid into areas in and around Bunia, shouldbe encouraged and initiated by theinternational community and local leaders. Itis crucial that humanitarian organisations areallowed free and independent access toassess the scale of unmet need at this time. This brutal conflict remains, without doubt, one of today's greatest internationalhumanitarian emergencies. Withoutimmediate assistance, the cycle of humanmisery will continue unabated and the healthof the population decline further still.

What grounds (ifany) are there for referring this woman? A local pharmacist's computer threw up 24 potential interactions. Our St Helens OldPrincipals Group identified nine possiblereasons, based on her medication, forconsidering involving the medical coroner.The current judicial coroner ordered a postmortem, which led to death being recordedas due to bronchial pneumonia,hypertension, and coronary heart disease. The Shipman Inquiry's discussion paper, published in October 2002, suggestsobliging doctors and others to report deathsto a new medical coroner when there isreason to suspect that medical error mayhave contributed. Is it not salutary to reviewsome recent deaths and ask whether anyerrors were ever made in the care of thosepatients? Our experience of auditing deathsin a confidential small group of GPs for 12years has been that 'errors' are all toocommon, particularly when viewed throughthe distorting lens of hindsight. We thinkmost deaths will need to be investigated. And the woman? Myra Hindley, whose inquest was widely reported in the pressrecently.Table 1.

Butnever, ever, do we discuss what treatmentcosts. As a consequence it is impossible for patients or relatives to judge whether theNHS is delivering good value. It would bequite easy to remedy this; some years agoRoy Lilley suggested that everyonereceiving elective care should be sent a lettersetting out what the costs of their care hadbeen. (Dear Mrs Archer, We hope you arerecovering from your recent operation. Youmay like to know that the bill for thisamounted to \u00a32243 and has been paid in fullby the UK taxpayer. Yours, etc., BorchesterPCT). Similarly, it would be straightforward for a practice to display their prescribing costseach month in the waiting room, or forPrimary Care Trusts to include briefsummaries of average costs in theprospectuses that by law they are required topost to every household each year.Outpatient clinics could routinely post theaverage cost of attendance, the number ofDNAs, and the cost of typical procedures byspecialty. If patients knew that NHS services for a family of four cost around \u00a36000 a year, itwould help them judge whether the healthservice was really delivering value formoney. Taboos are always there for a reason, however. When I suggested to my practicethat we offer a simple leaflet about the costsof care to patients, together with a briefquestionnaire asking whether they wantedsuch information, they refused. Giving suchinformation would require ethical approval,as it was research; and was perhaps unethicalanyway, since some patients would not wantto know. While both opinions have some validity, the real point is that mentioning money brings tothe surface all the contradictions that we feelas agents of both state and individual. Whichmaster are we really serving? Yet hiding these dilemmas is disingenuous. In all other healthcare systems there is talkabout the costs of services \u2014 why not inours? Patients are not stupid, of course. They know that the NHS does not have unlimitedresources and often say, 'I know there'sworse off than me ...' In this they arePostcards 1 ... Money \u2014 the last taboo Why is it that we never, ever, talk about money with patients? recognising that they do not have unlimitedcall on the NHS resources, that their personalcare is contingent on the resources madeavailable by all of us. This risk-sharingmechanism constitutes the unspokengenerosity that lies at the heart of the NHS\u2014 you get multiple sclerosis and I share thecosts of your care forever. My child getsleukaemia and you pick up the tab. The risk-sharing covers almost everyone in societyand contributes massively to the socialcapital and cohesiveness of the UK \u2014 evenif its importance to society as a wholeremains largely implicit and opaque. But in the past few years, attitudes to the NHS have changed enormously. If in its firsthalf-century the service was profoundlyloved, warts and all, it is now seen as simplynot good enough. Generosity and goodwillare being replaced by fears that the NHS isdoomed to be second rate. NHS funding isincreasing rapidly, but it is entirely possiblethat, despite doing all the right things, theNHS \u2014 and the government \u2014 will still befound wanting. If, as a society, we are to make rational decisions about what sort of health servicewe want, the fundamental nature of thecontract underlying the NHS needs to bewidely understood by voters. This meanstalking about money with patients. But routinely explaining the costs of care is not the only way to develop the kind ofcitizen-centred health policy that wedesperately need if we are to regainlegitimacy with the public. Citizens needgood access to up-to-date information fromother citizens about their local services.Patient forums (and perhaps PALS) shouldrun electronic discussion lists for all majortreatment areas on behalf of their local Trust.Patients referred for cholecystectomy, forexample, would receive instructions abouthow to join the e-discussion for the relevantservice at the time of their appointment.Discussion groups would provide citizenswith up-to-date details from patients withrecent experience of the service, and wouldbe a place to share advice and experienceswith others locally. Feedback to the Trustwould strengthen the standing and validity ofviews expressed by patient forums.Hospitals could also run routine web-basedquestionnaires: at discharge every patientwould get both a paper questionnaire aboutthe quality of service, and the web addresswhere the same questionnaire could be filledin, together with relevant list servers. Suchinformation would be an invaluable indicatorfor managers and clinicians and move theNHS some way to routine grounding thatsales figures provide in the commercialworld. Ownership is a key word of the NHS. ButWhat course are we steering? To grey sludge and doom,or to sunlit uplands? Or both?W e begin a series of articles that lookforward ... Paul Hodgkin Alec LoganThe British Journal of General Practice, July 2003 583what if we made ownership real? In discussing the new practice-based contract,most GPs assume that this is synonymouswith a partnership-based contract, and thatpartners will go on ruling the roost. In fact,practice-based contracts offer the possibilityof a whole range of new legal entitiesthrough which to provide primary care.Practices could choose to really makeownership real and, like the proposedFoundation Hospitals, set up companieslimited by guarantee in which patients couldbuy a \u00a31 share entitling them to vote aboutspecified aspects of the practice. A recentproposal from the Centre for Policy Studiessuggested that organisations somewhatsimilar to this could also become owners ofthe property from which the practiceoperated. Lack of capital has long been a problem for the NHS, and one of the appeals of PFI is tofind new ways outside direct Treasurycontrol through which to raise capital. Butwhat would a mutual model of raising capitallook like? In the United States it iscommonplace for communities to raisecapital bonds to rebuild schools and otherfacilities. These are financed through avariety of local taxes approved via localreferenda and paid back over an agreednumber of years. It would be quite possible to raise capital for the health service in this way. To avoidincreasing inequities, any local bond wouldneed to cover populations that included bothrich and deprived areas, but this in turn couldreinforce the identity of the wholecommunity. Once raised, the 6% return oncapital currently paid by the NHS to theTreasury would be recycled to the localcommunity for further investment in publicservices. The tension between giving citizens the chance to raise money for local services andthe inequities of a 'postcode lottery' for carewould, of course, remain. However, betterhealth services would then be clearly linkedto higher local taxes, increasing bothtransparency and democracy. These measures go far beyond the important but limited moves for 'user involvement',and take the interests of citizens as central tohow the NHS is structured, owned and run.They create the cultural and legal apparatusby which citizens \u2014 as opposed tomanagers, clinicians or politicians \u2014 beginto feel that the NHS is their own again. Andthey build new mechanisms through whichthe tensions and paradoxes of providinghealth care can be articulated locally by thenon-professional citizenry. Paul Hodgkinroger neighbour behind the lines On caringSTANDING for election, like knowing one is to be hanged in a fortnight, concentrates the mind wonderfully. The nomination form for the 2003-2006 RCGP Presidency calledfor a manifesto, a summary of one's ambitions for the College, in not more than 100 words. Given that I've taken nearly 15 000 words so far in these columns sounding offabout what I think is good and bad about general practice, the College and the politicalcontext in which we live, breathe, and have our struggling, a mere hundred should havebeen easy. But actually it wasn't. 'Cut the crap', the form seemed to be saying. 'Ditch thefunny stuff. Tell us what you really believe'. So I tried; and rediscovered that saying what you're for is harder than saying what you're against. And telling it straight is harder than telling it funny. 'The President's job is to givea lead on values', I wrote, after much agonising. 'Mine are uncompromisingly those of theconsulting room, where individual doctors bring knowledge, resources, insight, experience,and commitment to the service of individual patients. The challenge for the College and theNHS is to preserve consulting-room values in the face of short-term political expedientsand the over-regulation of professional judgement'. Yesterday I learned the result of the ballot. I am to be your next President, succeeding Dame Lesley Southgate, who has achieved great things as a personal doctor, an academic,and an arbiter of high-quality practice. Two four-letter words about sum up my immediatereaction, the first being, 'Gulp!' Huge is the honour, and huge the responsibility. And hugeare the opportunities to secure for personal doctoring the recognition it deserves as theembodiment of all that is good, and sound, and worthy, and thoughtful, and cost-effectivein delivering care to the nation's unwell \u2014 who are, after all, the friends and neighboursand relations of us all. Then today I remembered that I need to get my copy together for the July Back Pages. And dammit, the urge to be up front about what I believe is still with me. But how to do it?Nothing more undermines the sense of humour than the prospect of having to put one'sperformance where one's mouth is. And (as any columnist will tell you) principles thatcannot be expressed are hardly worth having. I think it all hinges on this word 'care'. What a complex and two-faced word 'care' has become. In Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four the Ministry of Love was in fact the agency for imposing repression. Similarly, care \u2014 atleast when the word is bandied around by those state agencies charged with loweringvoters' expectations \u2014 is all too often the smiling face of indifference. In disgracefullymany official documents, bunging the word 'care' into titles and text is calculated to press apositive response button, much as claiming to have hit your head is the way to fast-trackyour sprained ankle through A&E, or professing green sputum guarantees you antibioticsfor a cold. Of course patients deserve to receive good, focused, evidence-informed clinical care \u2014 the better the better. If quality agendas and targets and new Contracts will achieve this, morestrength to their bony little elbows. But I think patients want to be more than the recipientsof formalised care bestowed upon them by a state machine desperate to be perceived ascompetent: I think they want to be cared for. More importantly (and least quantifiably),patients want to be cared about \u2014 cared about by the doctors who care for them. There is arisk in the latest attempts to redefine good practice that pursuit of the abstract noun 'care'could come to substitute for the active verb 'to care'. The equating of caring with carecould invalidate the balance sheet where the value of general practice is determined. In Peter Shaffer's 1973 play Equus , there's a moment in which Martin Dysart, a child psychiatrist close to burnout, is confiding in his magistrate friend, Hesther. 'Of course', shesays ironically, 'I feel totally fit to be a magistrate all the time'. And he replies, 'No, youdon't \u2014 but then that's you feeling unworthy to fill a job. I feel the job is unworthy to fillme'. How dangerous it would be if the 'Dysart doubt' were to become widespread ingeneral practice. What a tragedy, if a rising generation of GPs were to find that professionallife in a target-driven culture that sets too high a premium on slavish delivery of formulaiccare proved insufficiently worthy of their intelligence and devotion. For everyone's sake, primary care, and our College in particular, must continue to champion the primacy of caring. Cum scientia calculatio ? I don't think so.584 The British Journal of General Practice, July 2003 essayITtook us some time to find a new partner for an innovative market town practice inan attractive part of South West Scotland. There are similar problems in the rest of thecountry, from the Western Isles to innerLondon, where it is estimated that fivehundred more GPs will be required by nextyear. Twenty years ago there were concernsabout medical unemployment, with novacancies in the West of Scotland for onethird of those being vocationally trained 1in the area. In 1944 the Goodenough Committee wisely refused to forecast doctor numbers, beyondsaying there would an increase with theintroduction of the NHS. Medical studentintake at that time was about 2000 a yearand in the 1950s there was competition forjobs. As a result, the Willink Committeerecommended a reduction of medicalstudent intake to 1760 a year. The effect ofthis was seen in the 1960s when the shortageof doctors was met by an influx of thosetrained overseas. The pendulum then swungback again with the Todd Report in 1968,which recommended increasing the medicalstudent intake to 4500 a year. 2 The problem of estimating future needs fordoctors has been hampered by inadequateinformation 3and by the fact that it takes nine years to train a general practitioner, bywhich time many things will have changedin terms of demography, medical advances,and health service politics. These difficultieswere highlighted by a Government report in1978 on 'Doctor manpower 1975-2000',which offered three guesses for thenecessary increase in doctor numbers by theyear 2000, ranging from 11% to 52%. Atthat time there were about 66 000 doctorsworking in the NHS and of those about18 000 had qualified overseas, the majorityfrom the Indian sub-continent. Thisrepresented one-third of hospital doctors andone-fifth of general practitioners. Thenumber of overseas doctors granted fullregistration has since fallen, 4against a backdrop of increasing numbers of doctorsfrom the European Union coming to work inBritain. The other side of the coin is the number of British medical graduates who haveemmigrated, but these numbers have beendecreasing since the 1970s when thegovernments of America, Canada, Australiaand New Zealand began restricting entry,owing to concerns about surplus doctors.There were similar problems on thecontinent where the number of doctors inFrance had doubled between the years 1960and 1976, and in Spain they had quadrupledin the previous decade. Compared withother European countries in the 1970s,Britain had the fewest medical students perhead of population in Europe, with Belgium,for instance, having six times the number ofstudents and twice the number of doctors. Inshort, all western European countries wereexperiencing substantial medicalunemployment and steps were taken to cutmedical student intake. At the time thegrowth of medical education was aworldwide phenomena, with the number ofmedical schools in the world having doubledin the previous decade. In 1982, the number of unemployed doctors had increased to 1500 and the BritishMedical Association was recommending acut in the student intake to avoid substantialmedical unemployment by the turn of thecentury. In 1989, the BMA estimated athreefold increase in the number of doctorsbetween the years 1950 and 1987 in theEuropean Community, amid concerns aboutthe resources available to keep this numberworking. Between 1980 and 1990 the totalnumber of general practitioners in the UKincreased by 17%. By the 1990s, measureswere being taken to reduce the medicalstudent intake in all European countriesowing to unemployment, and there wereconcerns in the UK that the numbers ofgeneral practitioners were outstrippingpopulation growth. However, the MedicalManpower Standing Advisory Committee,set up in 1991, recommended a 5.7%increase in medical student intake in theUK, 5although health economists, such as Alan Maynard, were claiming that thiswould lead to doctor surpluses in the early21st century. By the late 1990s there was increasing evidence of problems in recruitment andretention for general practice. Some of thiswas put down to pressures from the newcontract, with more part-time working and adecline in morale leading to earlierretirement, which had been made easier bychanges in pension regulations. In additionoverseas doctors were retiring and not beingreplaced, especially in inner-city areas. As aresult, the third report of the Medical Workfor Standing Advisory Committee in 1997recommended an increase of about 1000 ayear in medical school intake (20%increase) to meet growing demand andreduce reliance on doctors trained overseas. 6 In the Trent region, where there used to beup to 100 applicants for each post, thereReferences 1.

In the 1960s, manymedical schools admitted a quota of about10% female students, whereas now, withequal opportunities, over half of all medicalstudents are women, as are registrars ingeneral practice. This places an emphasis onmore flexible working patterns with jobsharing and part-time work. By the mid-1990s one-third of women generalpractitioners were working part-time. In response to these problems, medical education in the United Kingdom iscurrently expanding, with five new medicalschools due to be open by 2005 when 6873medical students will start. This is a 31%increase from the year 2000 and a 58%increase from 1995. However, the number ofapplicants is not rising at the same rate andif numbers stay the same there would be aselection ratio in 2005 of 1.18, which meanssupply barely meeting demand. 8Another problem is that the proportion of medicalgraduates deciding not to go into clinicalpractice appears to be rising, while at thesame time general practice is decreasing as acareer choice, with only 20% of newlyqualified doctors intending to enter generalpractice in 1996, compared with 40% to50% in the 1970s and 1980s. 9A similar decline in family medicine as a careerchoice has been noted in America. Even if the supply of medical graduates increases in the next few years there is animmediate problem, with the number ofunfilled GP vacancies last year havingdoubled and over a hundred remainingempty for more than a year. There iscurrently a 3.4% vacancy rate in Englandand Wales with the number of applicationsfor GP vacancies halving in the past twoyears. In Scotland the number of GPvacancies has doubled with the number offull-time equivalent GPs having fallen forthe first time. More than one-third of GPs inScotland are female and 20% of theworkforce now work part-time. More than aquarter of GPs in Scotland are over 50 andthe majority are considering earlyretirement. This is at a time of increasingdemand with consultations in the year 2000in Scotland passing one million, an increaseof 17% from the previous year. The NHSplan has a target of 2000 new GPs by Marchnext year, but it is difficult to see where allthese doctors will come from. The term 'personpower planning' is more appropriate than 'manpower planning' whenover half the potential workforce arewomen. This is not just a case of politicalcorrectness, but rather of attitudes towardsworking careers. Priority needs to be givento flexibility for part-time work and job-sharing. 10with career breaks for family and other reasons, not just for women but alsofor men. In particular, there needs to be arecognition of the problem of joint careers,particularly in rural areas. A majordisincentive for the majority of potentialapplicants to rural practice, who are mainlyfemale, is that there are no jobs for theirpartners or spouses, unlike in urban areas. Over the past generation medical manpower planning has been like some lumbering oiltanker nine years in length, tossed about in asea of change, both political, medical anddemographic. The ship has veered one waytowards increasing numbers of medicalstudents in the 1950s, and then back tocutting down in the 1960s and 70s amidfears of unemployment, and now back againto expansion because of the lack of doctors. Personpower planning needs to be able to adapt more quickly to unpredictable seachanges on its voyage. This could be doneby shortening the length of the ship to fiveyears, by making clinical medicine apostgraduate training as in North America.This could follow a basic degree in healthsciences from which students could choose anumber of health-related careers, of whichclinical medicine need only be one. Anotheradvantage is that students would be olderand more able to make informed choicesabout careers. School leavers are at an agewhen girls are more likely to perform betterthan boys, both academically and in terms ofpresentation. Starting clinical medicine laterafter a basic health sciences degree, wouldgive young people more time to have aclearer idea of where they want to go interms of careers and family commitments.A shorter training period for an older agegroup with more flexible careers would domuch to make personpower planning areality in the Health Service, rather than aseries of expedient lurches from onedirection to another.

Rhona MacDonald Editor, BMJ Careersdear john ... 1digest 586 The British Journal of General Practice, July 2003Annals of Family Medicine A new US family practice journal ITmight be thought that 2003 is not the best time to launch a new academic primarycare journal, particularly from a base in North America. According to the editor of theLancet , 'Many primary care doctors will find more of relevance to their working life in thepages of personal finance magazines than intheir own medical journals'. 1The deputy editor of the BMJ thinks that 'specialist journals look like they're on the way out',2 while primary care in the US is alsoundergoing a period of introspection and self-examination about its role and functions in the21st century. 3 Set against the changing world of medicalpublishing and ill-disguised antipathy of somegeneral medical journals to primary careresearch, 4a new specialist primary care journal has been launched \u2014 Annals of Family Medicine (www.annfammed.org). Are the editors and publishers of this new journallikely to succeed, given the considerableuncertainty with regard to academicbiomedical publishing in general, and theworries about the direction of primary careresearch in particular? On reviewing the first edition, my feeling is that the editors have done a good job ofconvincing me that high-quality primary carejournals do have a future. Annals of Family Medicine has been endorsed by all of the key educational and research organisations inNorth America. However, it is not theseendorsements, nor indeed the appearance ofthe printed version (which I feel has a slightly'dated' look) that has impressed me. The firstedition is notable because it presents wellwritten and well conducted primary careresearch, albeit within a North Americancontext. In the first edition, there are five original research papers with a significant breadth interms of clinical and research relevance. Anobservational study showing that single-disease focus is not a sustainable or effectivestrategy when managing chronic disease inthe community, appreciation andunderstanding of co-morbidity being the key;a qualitative study which successfully outlinesthe barriers to self-care; two randomisedcontrolled trials \u2014 evaluation of a decisionaid for prostate cancer screening and a trialexamining alternative management strategiesfor maintaining glycaemic control in type 2diabetes; and a cohort study examining thefactors associated with the low caesareansection rate in Native American women.There is also a methodology paper thatproposes a risk-adjustment framework formeasuring primary care performance. Anaccompanying editorial has contextualisedsome of the original research papers and themethodology paper in terms of the currentchallenges to family doctors in NorthAmerica. All articles are well presented, clear,and balanced. In terms of the format, the print version is accompanied by an electronic web-basedpublication that is free to all. The websiteinterface is supported by Stanford UniversityLibraries' Highwire Press, so the format willbe familiar to visitors to the BMJ website. Downloading of PDF files is easilyaccomplished and references can be readilyplaced on reference management software.The editors intend that Annals of Family Medicine be used to support a 'learning community of those who generate and useinformation about health and generalist healthcare'. To this end they have explicitlypromoted discussion through an innovationcalled TRACK (Topical Response to theAnnals Community of Knowledge).Comment on original papers and an opendiscussion forum is being facilitated by thesedevelopments. The editors of Annals of Family Medicine have clearly done their homework in terms ofmaking their journal accessible to readers.Changes in online publishing have beengreatest in the correspondence pages ofmedical journals; the BMJ publishes less than 10% of its 'rapid responses' in the printpublication; 2while over half of all online sessions end with a full-text download.2 Annals of Family Medicine also has a section given over to essays or reflections byclinicians, patients, families, and others. Inthis edition, an article written jointly by afamily doctor and a patient, on the experienceof dealing with a diagnosis of metastatic lungcancer, made for informative and illuminatingreading. Though many journal editors feel that we are only at the starting point in the technologicalrevolution, changes in medical publishinghave not been as substantial as first thought. 2 Nonetheless, there is little doubt that medicalpublishing is an increasingly competitiveenvironment and that the pendulum of powerand influence is swinging away from journalsback towards researchers and readers. Withthese developments in mind, Annals of Family Medicine have done an impressive job with their first edition. As a reader and researcher Iwill be very happy to support this new journaland have added the URL to my bookmarks.I'd urge you to do the same. Tom FaheyReferences 1. Horton R.

This image is one of manywhich pepper Dead Cities with an extraordinary power to 'see' the datacontained in Davis' thoroughly researchedcollection. Another is the solitary illegal Mexican immigrant selling bags of overripe oranges,for two dollars a bag, all day on a street in a'city' of Vernon, which has a permanentpopulation of 90 and a daily migrantpopulation of 48 000. Contained within thecity of LA, Vernon is a collection of low-rent factories where frozen Chinese food isprepared in buildings next to toxic wasteincinerators. Then there is the 'Hollywood Sinkhole', a collapsed LA subway excavation in themiddle of a busy street. Despitebreathtaking cost overruns, the LA subwayproject soldiers on, boring holes under landin the most active tectonic faults inmainland America. He describes the work of photographers who have made the ruined land at nucleartest sights and abandoned biologicalweapons centres testimonials to whatmankind leaves in its wake. Phillip K Dick,famous for his post-apocalyptic novels,couldn't, in his darkest moments, conjureplaces that Davis has found in the AmericanWest, particularly in its cities. In the preface, The Flames of New York, Davis uses the HG Wells 1908 book The War in the Air , which presages the destruction of a large city, as an entrance tothe effects of 11 September on thesubsequent 'globalisation of fear'. Therange of references that Davis brings to theessay is truly remarkable. He seesconnections between writers and events thatleave the reader amazed. Davis is a good scientist, observing things others of us might overlook, and links hisobservations to social history andeconomics. For example, he drives aroundthe test grounds in Utah where, duringWorld War II, army engineers constructedGerman and Japanese housing on which totest incendiary weapons in preparation forthe future firestorms of Tokyo and Dresden.Science, it seems, is as essential for massmurder as it is for saving lives. Davis has the ability to write with passion about the interaction of extra-terrestrialbodies, such as meteors and asteroids, withplate tectonic theory and the origins of theEarth. Although we take both asteroidextinctions and movement along fault linesfor granted these days, Davis points out itwas less than 50 years ago that we kneweither theory. In the title essay, he describes,from fictional writings and from therealities of bombed out London and Berlinin the 1940s, the strange incursion ofprevious exotic species of plant and animalsinto the burned and battered landscapes ofurban blight. His essay ends with a searingdescription of the planned 'urban renewal'of the South Bronx in New York throughfire, racist housing, and neglect to becomethe urban wasteland favored symbolicallyby both conservative and progressive USpoliticians, as either evidence ofgovernment failure or a call for governmentsolutions. In either case, little has changed. Some of the essays in Dead Cities focus in too much detail on the arcane politics andmoney in urban California, but, throughout,Davis presents ferociously eruditeexpositions of the abuse that humans haveperpetrated both on each other and on thedelicate ecology of the AmericanSouthwest. He writes with an eye to the absurd as well. Not many social historians would see thebeginnings of the 1960s revolution in ateenage riot about drag racing rights in SanDiego. He gets us to see the duck-tailed,leather-coated James Dean wannabes as theanti-establishment stirrings that swept thecountry. He spins the urban youth riots thatstarted Southern California into an urbanrebellion of working class youth thatbecame the black and Chicano riots of themid-1960s and on into the riots of the early1990s. The truth is, I have always said, and mostly believe, that things in the US start inCalifornia and move inexorably east \u2014 areason to keep that state in your rear viewmirror. And for that reason alone, we should keep our eye on what Mike Davis is writing thesedays.

The whole surrounding area was taken over by theNazis, and the Protectorate \u2014 Bohemia,Moravia \u2014 was not viable. In March 1939the Nazis marched in. I lost my job in the hospital, unpaid as it was anyway. I came to England because of myYouth Hostel connection. I had been toYouth Hostels in Belgium and Holland in1935 and there got to know a Scottishmedical student, Louis Finlay, who arrivedwith his friend Jack Watson, an Australian ofScottish descent who wore a kilt. I had keptin touch with Louis ever since. When Munich happened, he wrote to me and said, 'If there's anything I can do, I will'. Hisfather, Professor Adam Fife-Finlay, wasProfessor of Theology, in Aberdeen. He wasone of the 'Wee Frees'. He offered the sumof \u00a31000, which must be at least \u00a340 000nowadays, to guarantee a transit visa for me.And then he got a friend who had never evenheard of us, another professor at Aberdeencalled Cruickshank, to do the same for mybrother. I had to go to Prague for my visa. A very nice lady at the Embassy told me that my brotherwas lower down on the list; she would puthim next to me, which would in turn helpme. We had to go through a tremendous round of applications to the Nazi authorities forpermission to emigrate. They had to comeand look at our books, to search for anysubversive literature. We had to pay forevery handkerchief we took out of thecountry; my parents had to payReichsfluchtsteuer . 'Reich' is self-evident, 'Flucht' is flight, and 'teuer' is a tax. A taxfor fleeing the Reich! We already had had tosurrender to the Nazis any watches, rings,jewels of any description, and wireless sets. And then I had to get a permit to leave. Perhaps rashly, I went to the local Gestapo\u2014 it was a nice hot summer's day, I hadshorts on, and I was sunburned, and hadblond hair and blue eyes, and I said, 'I'mJewish and I have the opportunity toemigrate, what is your advice?' He said \u2014 he was quite a nice chap from the Gestapo, in riding boots as they always had\u2014 he said, 'Well, my advice to you is to goas soon as possible.' I had to queue everymorning at four o'clock at an office \u2014fortunately it was summer \u2014 to get a signedpermit to emigrate. And then one Saturday morning, there was a Reichs German there, who I think just foreffect, shouted, 'You come and trouble mehere on Saturday! Here it is.' And there wasthe permit. I believe it had been there all thetime. And I think the shouting was just toFreddy Morgan went to medicalschool in Bohemia in 1930.

My brother and I had shorts, and a rucksack, and tenmarks in our pockets. And my parents, inorder to support the German economy, hadto buy our tickets on the Hamburg-AmericaHAPAC Line and we had to go on a Germanship. It was an emotional scene at the station.I suppose I just took it in my stride. Mybrother, who had more foresight and morefeeling \u2014 he was also a doctor \u2014 started tocry and said, 'We are never, never going tosee our parents again'. We never did seethem again. We travelled by train from Brno, through Bohemia and came to the German frontier ofthe Protectorate where they had customsofficers. He looked at my passport, whichhad a big J for Jude \u2014 Jew \u2014 and he looked at me and said, ' Nicht ein Jude \u2014 you are not Jewish'. And I said, 'Yes I am'. But hejust shrugged his shoulders and let us go on.We went from the Hook of Holland toHarwich by ship, on a lovely, very calm dayacross the Channel. Then we stayed with a friend of Louis Finlay's, Miss Simmons. Louis Finlay hadbeen appointed to take charge of a largeEmergency Medical Service sector,completely by mistake. He was acomparatively junior doctor, and they hadmixed him up with a very well-knownconsultant, who was apparently on the highseas somewhere.

The CO had a duodenal ulcer and he was bleeding, so wehad to watch over him at night, but mostly itwas dressings. When Britain saw the imminent danger in 1941 my qualification was suddenly,mysteriously, recognised, and I entered theWartime Medical Reserve. I worked at theRoyal Devon and Exeter Hospital, andafterwards at the EMS Hospital inExminster, near Exeter, a very large mentalhospital where half the mental patients hadbeen set to one side to make way for air-raidcasualties and patients from the armedservices. In those days I had a bicycle,which, I believe, had cost eight shillings. Mythen girlfiend (now my wife) bought it forme. I used to cycle down to Dawlish Warren,and swim in raging seas between tree trunksand iron stakes, which were placed on thebeach to stop troop-landing aircraft. Andthat was, to my simple mind, wonderfullyexhilarating after working hard all day in thehospital. At night, again and again, we could hear the bombers \u2014 the German engines wereunsynchronised. I remember I was having abath, and the Nazis dropped a bomb whichkilled some of our services patients. I got outof the bath and went straight to the operatingtheatre. I had nothing on except my dressinggown. The nurses were highly amused, andmade me a sort of loincloth, and we operatedall night. I became very restless there, because I felt I must do more. So I volunteered for theNavy, because I loved the sea, and the Navyrefused me because I was not of Britishdescent. Similarly, the Air Force said no.Then I volunteered for the Army, and theArmy had me straight away. After basictraining, we were sent on a special course intropical medicine. I was friends with anotherofficer named Bushell, who was ex-StMary's. We used to go running throughLondon every morning before the lectures,along the Thames from Millbank acrossLambeth Bridge to Lambeth. Then I wasposted the Second Battalion of the King'sShropshire Light Infantry in Dorset, which Ithoroughly enjoyed. Dorset was beautiful,and particularly lovely in spring, with itslong barrows and short barrows, and \u2014 I'mrather romantic \u2014 we did route marches atnight in this magical setting. At the time I thought ... Well, my name was going to be published in the official gazette.It's an unusual name, a German name \u2014Morgenbesser \u2014 so while I hoped myparents were still alive, I thought it might besafer for them if I changed it. It wasshortened to Morgan, and it has stuck eversince. I might very easily go back toMorgenbesser, eventually. I did not knowthat my parents were by then dead. Freddy Morgan Stefan Cembrowiczmoney to pay, but they very kindly closednot just one eye, but both eyes, and we couldjust go and meet all of these very eminentpeople. They were very good to us and veryindulgent, and we were able to sit in andlisten and try to learn about Britishmedicine. It was a a great education to seeBritish medicine at its best. We joined up with the Pioneer Corps as privates in 1940, because in those days theBMA was very strict and would not allowdoctors with foreign degrees to practise. Avery small number of highly qualifiedGerman and Austrian physicians wereallowed to take examinations and had theright to practise, but my brother and I werenot in this league. But we were delighted tobe in North Devon, and to do lots ofmarching and rifle drill. We were digging upgolf courses to defend against troop-landingaircraft and gliders. It was a gorgeoussummer, called the Hitlerwetter \u2014 perfect weather for Hitler's tanks to roll acrossFrance. I volunteered for guard duties, andin the daytime I went swimming in the sea atWestward Ho! I was sitting in the NAAFI canteen, having a cup of tea, and the manager said, 'What doyou think is going to happen next?' TheNazis had just broken through to Abbevilleon the Channel coast, and encircled theBritish army. And I said, 'Well, it's veryserious'. 'Ah', he said. And it stuck in mymemory ... I can see him now. He said, 'Youknow what we are going to do?' That was inMay, going on June 1940, when the Britisharmy, defeated, and weaponless, werestreaming back, by the grace of God, fromDunkirk. He said, 'Now, we are going toinvade the Continent.' And I was delighted to hear it, because I felt that British public \u2014 bless them \u2014 in theircomplete ignorance and lack of education,were marvellous to behold. The fortitudeand knowledge and courage of Churchill,combined with the ignorance of the generalpopulation and their stalwart determination\u2014 'We are British, they can't do anything tous' \u2014 that combination was invincible.They had only a shred of the education ofthe German working class, and of the wholeEuropean community, which was so certainthat Hitler was going to win, and of courseto any sane person on the Continent itseemed to utterly inexorable. Well, Britainwould have been done for, but for thefortitude of the British population, andChurchill. The Pioneer Corps (the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps) was an exhilaratingexperience, with interesting group of people.Some were highly educated; others werefrom the poor parts of Berlin and Vienna.We had fellow soldiers from the Berlin andVienna Philharmonic Orchestras \u2014 allprivates together \u2014 marching, digging, anddrilling.

It counts special administrators tomeasure waiting targets. It counts ITconsultants and directors of partnerships,clinical governance leads, and prescribingadvisers. It does not measure the health of itsworkers, the quality of their education or thejoy in their work, or the anger in theirfrustration.

One of the ways we canstimulate research is through recognisingexcellent articles, and this is the basis for theRCGP/Boots The Chemists Research Paperof the Year award. The RCGP and Boots are now entering the seventh year of this prestigious event, andthe number and calibre of potentialrecipients reflects the exponential growth ofUK-based primary care research. Theauthors must include a contributor who isactively involved in clinical generalpractice, and the panel base their decision onthe following: \u007f how original is the research (new angles on the field, different methods); \u007f how applicable it is(implications for clinical practice in primary care); \u007f what contribution will the paper make to the standing of general practice and academic profile thereof (quality and robustness); and \u007f overall presentation (coherence, communication). The panel that selects the award winner reflects the current state of primary careresearch: multidisciplinary, service andacademic practitioners, researchers withdifferent interests, and preferred approaches.It is inclusive in its approach: papers can benominated by any individual including theauthors, and the leading journals whereprimary care research is presented arereviewed to check for possible nominations.The sponsors take no role in the selectionprocedure, and it is a tribute to Boots'reputation for integrity that almost allThe RCGP and Boots The Chemist Research Paper of the Year 200 nominees accept their paper being submittedfor the award. The award itself is associatedboth with an academic event (the annualResearch Seminar of the RCGP), and with aformal dinner \u2014 where year on year thetopic of conversation has been the value ofencouraging and extending high calibreprimary care research, and where the fruitsof many such labours can be celebrated. This year, 22 papers published in 2002 were given detailed consideration by the panel.They came from eight different journals,included authors from more than 20different disciplines, and covered topicssuch as mobile phone texting to supportingyoung adult asthma sufferers, randomisedcontrolled trials of service developments,and the cultural changes required to supportclinical governance. The final decision wasnot easy, as there were many excellentpapers; among which there is one deservingspecial mention \u2014 a single-authored articleby a service GP, which shows that importantresearch can still be done by non-academicsin clinical settings. The overall winner was an impeccably presented epidemiological study, authoredby an international team whose UK base isin the Department of General Practice andPrimary Care at St George's HospitalMedical School. Its lengthy title,'Application of Framingham risk estimatesto ethnic minorities in UK and implicationsfor primary prevention of heart disease ingeneral practice: a cross-sectionalpopulation-based study', reflects a complexand labour intensive study involving therecruitment and screening of 1577 patientsaged 40 to 59 years from three differentethnic backgrounds. The authors say little ofthe challenges involved in securing thislevel of participation in a communitysample, especially from some potentially'hard to reach' groups, but this was oneaspect that particularly impressed the panel.In this era of guideline-driven medicine, it isessential that our research reflects thediversity of UK population, and this teamThe Contenders ... \u007f Grant C, Nicholas R, Moore L, Salisbury C.

We're returning to a favourite haunt on the westcoast of Scotland in a fortnight. It's 31 years since our first visit. We havestood at the top of every hill there bar two\u2014 and both involve a long trek in and asteep haul up. We need to loosen our limbs.The Mendips, Quantocks and Cotswoldsdon't have the height but in places theyhave the steepness, and we have to do ourbest with the material we've got. It'sreminded us that there is no season tocompare with the few weeks that cover latespring and early summer. Topical issues and editorial whim may mean you read this column in late summer.Yes, there is the wonder of hazy sun overwaving ripe harvests on rolling hills. Or inautumn: russet woodland dripping after adownpour. It may even be winter, and lowbright sun on hoarfrost takes some beating.But spring-summer \u2014 late May in thesouth but more into early June farther north\u2014 never disappoints. Even if the weather isfoul the countryside is beautiful because,colour in the hedgerows or not, green isbeauty. The human eye distinguishes more shades of green than of any other colour. Colourisn't real, of course. Where one colour ofthe rainbow shades into the next is anarbitrary distinction, and certainly theboundary between green and blue \u2014 thedomain encroached upon by both colours,which we call turquoise \u2014 has led to manydisagreements in our house. I've heardevolutionarily-based arguments thatdistinguishing greens is important forknowing what is good to eat. Well perhaps.But such arguments are rarely more thanspeculation because the experiment can'tbe run again, and who will be there longenough to observe? Driving to work the other morning it was windy and unpleasant. But each tree, in thewind, partly wet and partly dry, sportedhalf a dozen shades of green. Later in theyear, they will dull; there won't be thecontrasts. Summer is a more uniformseason. We'll return from Scotland, flushed with the triumph of those two last hills (or,beaten back by the weather, planning thenext assault). We'll vow to walk eachweekend but probably won't. Having anobjective, and knowing it's the spring, arepowerful forces. You'll have to guess where our heaven is. The sun sets in the jaws of the loch at10.25 pm on midsummer's day. We'll walkout after dinner and sit on a slab ofLewisian gneiss to watch it. And the NHSwill be a world away. Nev.W.Goodman@bris.ac.ukare also to be celebrated for their systematic attempt to do what befits all academics: thatis, challenge assumptions \u2014 in this case,that the previous coronary heart disease riskestimates would hold for people fromdifferent genetic populations. The key conclusions of the paper are that the Framingham risk estimates of CHDunderestimate the risks of cerebrovasculardisease in south Asians and Africans, andimplies a need for different thresholds forintervention, also showing their increasedoverall risks if hypertension is undertreated.The paper therefore clearly shows thepotential racism of assuming that 'one sizefits all' in cardiovascular andcerebrovascular risk assessment. Thequestion is original, the findings applicable,and the methods and analysis of highquality. In particular, the complex statisticaldata are appropriate to the questions asked,and concisely presented, with suitabletextual guidance for the non-expert reader.The paper is intellectually heavyweight, oneof the kind which makes MRCGPcandidates groan, and certainly not one toflick through for entertainment value. ThePanel were again impressed by the ability ofthe authors, who avoided patronising thereaders by 'dumbing down' the details of thestudy while elucidating clear and concisemessages for practice. Those who return to this article because of its success in gaining the award may besurprised that the authors acknowledgemany questions that this study does notanswer. It is a sobering fact that even suchan extensive study in an ongoingprogramme of work can only produce a veryfew robust conclusions for clinical care, andboth government and research funders needto understand that work of this calibre is notcheap. While outputs from excellentprimary care research teams are increasingacross the UK, there has been a relative'plateauing' in overall funding available forthis kind of applied research. This couldprevent such studies being replicated indifferent populations, reduce their ability toarrive at definitive practice guidelines, andthus 'widen inequalities in management ofhypertension and prevention ofcardiovascular disease'. 1 In conclusion, the panel congratulates theauthors on this excellent study, and the BMJ , on once again being the publisher of theResearch Paper of the Year. Thanks are dueto Boots for their continued support andsponsorship, and thanks to all those whohelped with the nominations and the award.We also want to acknowledge the efforts ofthe whole primary care research communityfor their efforts: knowledge which is hardwon, on which the progress of our disciplineand the health of patients relies. Amanda Howe592 The British Journal of General Practice, July 2003jill thistlethwaite our contributorsCleaning out my closetWHYdid you decide to study medicine? As a discriminating question to help choose between applicants for medical school, this certainly has its faults. The routineanswer is, of course, to help people. But once embedded as an undergraduate the truth soon emerges: money, prestige, job security, and somewhere down the list, jobsatisfaction. I decided, at the rather late age of 17, to try for medical school because I wanted to work abroad. At that time I had only been to France. It was an era when Mancunian estate kidswere not introduced to skiing trips as toddlers, or taken on the grand tour as teenagers.While my father had reached Australia on an aircraft carrier at the end of the Second WorldWar, my mother has never had a passport. I had some grandiose vision of working in thejungle and, yes, helping people get better. There was a certain amount of altruism involvedbut most of all I wanted to be somewhere else. A wonderful elective in India reinforced the wanderlust; though I was na\u00efve enough to think that a sixth-year English medical student was entangled in the same poverty trap asmost of the people I met there. So look at me now: I have worked in London, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall and Yorkshire. (I have travelled, but only for pleasure.) And a midlife crisis has made me realise that if Idon't go now, I never will. At this age though, working abroad is no longer attractivewithout a full salary and pension package. I am also old enough to realise that mostexpatriate doctors do not make huge differences to the health of nations. They mayaccomplish the same one-to-one effect that they have back home, though communication iscertainly a problem. The job satisfaction is mainly derived from exciting new experiencesand the warm weather rather than the Mother Teresa effect. I haven't got a job yet but I'm looking. However the impetus to move has awoken in me a desire to unclutter my life and 'clean out my closet', in the words of the infamous whiterapper Eminem. What an amazing amount of flotsam you gather while living in the samehouse for 16 years; hoarding junk like we hold onto medical records, just in case there is alaw suit or sudden need for mid-1980s copies of the BMJ . But even though I have the motivation to chuck it all out, throwing things away is a difficult business. To start with there are books. Books I have read and will probably never open again but whose titles I like to see on my shelves. At least they can go to Oxfam, though only one ortwo at a time, as I desensitise myself slowly to their loss. As for medical books: when doessuch a thing become a historical artefact rather than an out-of-date text? I have found things I thought lost forever (my original GMC registration certificate, since replaced) and photographs I wish I hadn't unearthed (did I really have such short hair?).There are certificates from half-marathons that I haven't looked at for over a decade, whichsuddenly become precious as proof that I could once run 13 miles in 90 minutes. Then there are clothes. I read recently that we spend hundreds of pounds each year on garments we never wear. I have ample proof of that. But there are also items I haven't wornfor a few years that I am certain I might possibly want to in a few more. I will stomp aboutonce again in those high heels when the inflammation in my first metatarso-phalangealjoints settles down. My husband has threatened that if and when we do move and it involves an aeroplane, we are only going to take the free 20 kg of luggage each. Ask yourself ... would you agree to that?
