Big Night Entertainment Group 617-338-4343 | [bneg.com](http://bneg.com) Big Night Big Heart is a charitable foundation created by New England hospitality company Big Night Entertainment Group. Owner Ed Kane explains how they partner with qualified charitable organizations to transform local communities through volunteering, fundraising events, and donations. How does your expertise as a hospitality company guide your giving? We love giving back to our local communities and helping our neighbors in any way we can. For example, the [St. Francis House](https://stfrancishouse.org/), which is a nonprofit, nonsectarian, daytime shelter, is located directly next to our Caf\u00e9, Restaurant & Bar Explorateur on Boston Common. We thought it would be a great idea to give our guests the chance to get involved by having the opportunity to donate to their cause and in exchange, they received a heart to put their names on throughout the month of February. Most recently, we featured a \"Pink Lady\" cocktail at all of our venues and donated $1 from every drink sold to the [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) in honor of the fight against breast cancer. How do your employees get involved? Our employees love getting involved, and there are many avenues they can take to do so at BNEG. Whether it's donating their time to volunteer or coming up with a special to feature in-house that will benefit a foundation of their choice, we love supporting causes they are passionate about. One of our favorite events to participate in is the Annual Best Buddies event. Everyone gets involved\u2014from waitstaff to ownership. What event is BNEG most proud of? [Adopt-a-Family](https://www.readingma.gov/elder-and-human-services/pages/adopt-a-family-holiday-program) is a local charity we contribute to annually around Christmas. Our employees raise funds and ownership matches or exceeds the total donations from employees to give to local families every year. Last year, we were able to provide a family with a new bedroom set, a living room set, a room full of toys, and rent for three months. They were struggling with medical bills due to a family member fighting cancer, so we wanted to do everything we could to help. We adopted a total of eight families last year. Connelly Partners 617-521-5400 | [connellypartners.com/about](http://connellypartners.com/about) From paying off employees' student loans to teaching high school students the basics of marketing, Connelly Partners is rethinking what corporate giving looks like. The president of the advertising agency, Steve Connelly, discusses why it's important to help the people around you, beyond just signing a check. What volunteer work does Connelly Partners participate in? We give creatively based on differences we can make in our immediate world. One of our tent-pole programs supports our South End community by inviting more students of color into the world of marketing, while another key program helps our staff pay down their student loans. How are you working with students at Cathedral High? [Cathedral High School (CHS)](https://cathedralhighschool.net/) is across the street from our office, and it's a school of talented and hardworking kids. We saw a chance to introduce them to advertising, to invite more students of color into our business, and to let them see a career path they might not have ever noticed. With the help of CHS headmaster Oscar Santos, two years ago we started teaching an introduction to marketing course at the school, which provides industry fundamentals and real-world experience. We also produce content, hire students as interns, and are helping launch a makerspace at the school. The students enjoy being connected to our agency. What is Gradifi and how has it helped your employees? We saw that our young employees were under enormous pressure from their student loan balances, so we decided to support our workforce and help to pay down their student loan balances through [Gradifi](https://www.gradifi.com/), a student loan pay-down program. Connelly Partners gives each employee an initial $1,000 and an additional $100 per month. What makes Connelly unique in the way it supports the community? We choose to give of ourselves, our talent, and our resources in ways that create real change. As an agency, we truly care about people, so we feel fulfilled by not just giving but by doing.

How does Eastern Bank give back to its community, and what types of charity organizations does Eastern partner with? Our community strategy includes not only our philanthropy, but also employee volunteerism, advocacy, business practices, and community leadership. This year alone, Eastern has donated more than $2 million to community-based organizations working on the advancement of women and girls, and held 200 employee volunteer events.

Now in its 30th year, this [annual celebration](https://www.easternbank.com/socialjustice) recognizes community advocates who share our commitment to making our communities a better place to work and live. We focused our community service, philanthropy, and advocacy this year on advancing women, so our 2018 event will recognize people and organizations addressing a wide range of issues that disproportionately impact women and girls, such as pay equity, self-esteem, healthcare, and more. How does Eastern's mission as a company tie into its philanthropic mission? Philanthropists founded our company in Salem to provide people with equal access to a safe place to save and borrow money. That idea remains at the core of our corporate social responsibility mission today, knowing that a community bank like Eastern can only be as strong as the communities we serve. For Eastern, being a business leader is about more than financial achievement. It's about identifying with our community, bringing people together to address issues we all face, and advocating for change. Join us for good. Godfrey Hotel Boston 617-804-2000 | [godfreyhotelboston.com](http://godfreyhotelboston.com) A storied hotel in the heart of the city, Godfrey Hotel Boston is driven to give back to the local communities that make up their workforce. Paul Sauceda, director of sales and marketing, shares how they're helping the neighborhood and the region through a caringly selected array of charitable organizations. How does the Godfrey Hotel Boston determine which nonprofits to support? Our first criteria is that they're local. We start with our downtown neighborhood then spread out from there. Beyond location, we focus on organizations that reflect the values of our hotel and the diversity of our staff. We have employees of many different nationalities, ethnicities, and ages, and we believe we have a responsibility to support the communities on which we rely. How do you encourage employees to volunteer in the community? Luckily, our employees want to volunteer. What Godfrey is able to do is facilitate opportunities, such as volunteering at a shelter or food bank. The hotel also compensates employees for the time they are volunteering. What are some contributions of which you are particularly proud? We're proud to support Chinese community organizations, such as the [Wang YMCA](https://ymcaboston.org/wang) and the [Kwong Kow Chinese School After School Program](http://www.kwongkowschool.org/), with more than $100,000 in cash donations. We also support several LGBT organizations, such as the [Boston Pride Committee](http://www.bostonpride.org/committee/) and the [LGBT Asylum Task Force](http://www.lgbtasylum.org/), a small organization that provides basic needs such as housing, clothing, and food to refugees from countries where being an LGBT person may be a death sentence. What other organizations have you contributed to? Since opening in early 2016, the Godfrey has donated approximately $520,000 in cash and in-kind donations to organizations including the [Boston Asian Youth Essential Service](http://www.bostonasianyes.org/), Youth Ready for Work Program, and [Bridge Over Troubled Waters](https://www.bridgeotw.org/), a remarkable organization that provides a wide array of services to homeless youth. KIND Healthy Snacks KIND believes in making nutritious and delicious snacks. They also believe in celebrating and inspiring kindness. Marketing Manager Matt McWilliams shares how Bostonians can get involved in the company's mission to build healthier and kinder communities. What is the KIND Movement? The KIND Movement is KIND's mission to make the world a little kinder. It has been a part of the company's DNA since 2004. KIND was founded as a \"not-only-for-profit\" company; our business aims to be both economically sustainable and socially impactful. For our founder, Daniel Lubetzky, the movement is personal. His dad survived the Holocaust due to the kindness of strangers, including a German soldier who gave him food when he was starving. This showed Daniel that small acts of kindness can change the world. Our team shares this belief and looks to recognize and celebrate the kindness of Bostonians every chance we get. How can the city get involved in the movement? Bostonians help spread the KIND Movement by celebrating everyday acts of kindness with a #kindawesome card. Each card has a special code, which the recipient can enter online to receive a complimentary KIND bar, along with another card to pay it forward. People spot kind acts on the T all the time! What can educators do to encourage kindness among students? The KIND Foundation's signature initiative is [Empatico](https://empatico.org/), a free video conferencing tool that connects students worldwide. From Ghana to Vietnam to the United States, teachers are committed to sparking empathy in their students. In Massachusetts, 31 elementary school teachers have registered\u2014we'd love to see that number go up! Why is it so important to give back to others? When people are overcome with emotion from a simple act, it reminds you that you never know what people are going through and the power that a small, kind gesture can have.

LAZ Parking 617-426-0604 | [lazparking.com](http://lazparking.com) Founded in 1981 with a single valet location, LAZ Parking has grown to become the second largest parking company in America. Regional Vice President Brian Haley discusses the accomplishments of the company's foundation and their commitment to employees, clients, and the local community. What inspired you to create the LAZ Parking Charitable Foundation? We have always been very involved with charities near and dear to us. In 2010, we created the [LAZ Parking Charitable Foundation](https://www.lazparking.com/our-company/about/charitable-foundation) to contribute time and financial resources to charitable organizations that make a positive difference in people's lives. The creation of the foundation also allowed us to align our regional offices to focus on a primary charity for fundraising and volunteer activities to give our 12,100 employees the opportunity to give back to their communities in a significant way. How do you choose the charitable organizations you support? Our national sponsorship is determined by a selection process with input from each regional office. We reach out to all employees, and they are offered the ability to submit an application for a charity to be considered for our national fundraising efforts. In addition, the local offices have the ability to donate a portion of funds raised to sponsor other charities that are important to that region. For example, we have been supporting the [Special Olympics](https://give.specialolympics.org/page/contribute/gt18-state?state=ma&source=ISadwords&subsource=Massachusetts&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8_PfBRC3ARIsAOzJ2uoqhxd3-XAyGEXbdPJWCTNeV0JHHyCL4T8ypkQ5Lr9UexLiwKHAYcEaAsZdEALw_wcB) nationally for more than 10 years, and this selection came from one of our employees whose son is a Special Olympics athlete. How does giving back to the Boston community tie back to the goals of your company? LAZ Parking has a strong people culture. We are very passionate about supporting our team, clients, and the community. Since starting the foundation, our employees are more connected to giving back. They come to us with different charities they feel can use our support, which allows us to live out our company values. The connections we make volunteering are very powerful and help build teamwork and camaraderie. Life is Good 603-594-6100 | [lifeisgood.com/foundation](http://lifeisgood.com/foundation) The original positive lifestyle brand Life is Good has supported kids in need from the start. Founders Bert and John Jacobs created the [Life is Good Kids Foundation](https://content.lifeisgood.com/kidsfoundation/) in 2010. The foundation's Chief Playmaker Steve Gross shares how its Playmaker Program helps more than 1 million kids heal from trauma each year. How does Life is Good and The Life is Good Kids Foundation model work? Life is Good is a positive lifestyle brand that inspires people to choose optimism to improve their lives and the lives of others. This mission inspires the work of The Life is Good Kids Foundation, which spreads the power of optimism to help kids heal. The Life is Good company donates 10 percent of their annual net profits to the foundation, which covers about 25 percent of the foundation's operating budget.

How does the foundation support teachers, nurses, and childcare professionals, and why does it focus on these groups? Working with children who have been affected by poverty, violence, and severe illness is hard work. The toll it can take on caregivers can negatively impact their lives and work. We support teachers, nurses, and childcare professionals with training and tools to ensure they can be their most optimistic selves. How has the foundation boosted company spirit? Knowing that every touch point of our business is an opportunity to help children gives great meaning to even the smallest business task. Knowing that we help grow the good in the lives of children fuels us every day. What is the proudest accomplishment of the foundation? We're proud to have supported more than 10,000 childcare professionals who together serve more than one million of our nation's most vulnerable children. Neiman Marcus 617-536-3660 | [neimanmarcus.com](http://neimanmarcus.com) With the season of giving upon us, Neiman Marcus is more focused than ever on empowering children through the gift of art. Vice President and General Manager Daniel Kramer shares how the [Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/c/nm-heart-of-nm-cat48600747) brings meaningful art experiences to communities in need. Why did you choose to focus on youth arts through the Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation? As one of the few retailers in the world with its own corporate art collection, art is deeply woven throughout the fabric of Neiman Marcus' heritage, brand, and culture. Engagement with the arts, especially for youth, impacts educational success, which then pays it forward throughout the community. Research shows that students who receive an arts-infused curriculum tend to matriculate and graduate at higher rates, score higher on the SAT, and become more creative problem solvers and engaged civic leaders. The foundation is dedicated to supporting the next generation of artists. What local charities do you partner with and why? Our co-founder Herbert Marcus always said, \"It is not enough to take from the communities in which we operate; we must also give back.\" It has always been an integral part of our core values to support our local communities, and this remains a guiding principal today. We've partnered with the [Boys & Girls Club of Boston](https://www.bgcb.org/), [Music Drives Us](https://www.musicdrivesus.org/), [Lovelane](https://lovelane.org/), and [Artists for Humanity](http://afhboston.org/), and support hundreds of arts organizations locally through silent auction donations. What goals have you set for 2019? We're furthering our philanthropic tradition by pledging support to the [Boys & Girls Clubs of America Youth Arts Education](https://www.bgca.org/programs/the-arts) programs, serving 4.3 million kids and teens across 4,300 clubs nationwide. Neiman Marcus has pledged $750,000 over three years to both local and national programs that bring meaningful art experiences to communities in need. As in years past, a portion of every 2018 Fantasy Gift in our Holiday Book is donated to the Heart of Neiman Marcus Foundation. Newton-Wellesley Hospital 617-243-6000 | [nwh.org](http://nwh.org) Newton-Wellesley Hospital is working to address unmet healthcare needs of vulnerable populations through their [Collaborative for Healthy Families and Communities (CHF&C)](https://www.nwh.org/classes-and-resources/community-education/welcome). Director of Community Benefits and Volunteer Services Lauren Lele gives insight on the program's success. What benefits does the CHF&C provide to the community? The collaborative provides rehabilitation clinics, health fairs, and screenings for skin cancer and the flu, and we host events such as Think Pink for breast cancer awareness, as well as career nights for high school students. We offer community education sessions addressing post-partum depression, youth mental health, concussion awareness, and much more. We also collaborate with many other agencies to organize activities and ensure that together we are effectively supporting and responding to community needs, such as the distribution of Narcan. What impact has the CHF&C had on young people in the area? We support the hiring of youth through the [Waltham Partnership for Youth Internship](https://www.walthampartnershipforyouth.org/current-initiatives.html) program so they can learn about careers in healthcare, and we funded the Youth Interpreters program, which offers students job training, career development, and paid employment. These efforts are designed to address social determinants such as housing and food insecurity that often lead to physical and mental health challenges. We provide free meals to disadvantaged youth during the summer months through the Summer Meals program for students. How does the CHF&C relate to Newton-Wellesley's mission statement? Our founding more than 135 years ago was in response to the need for medical care in our community. As a mission-driven organization, helping those in need is a big part of who we are and why we exist. If you ask our employees why they got into healthcare, one of the most frequent responses is, \"because I wanted to help people.\" We also realize that everyone needing care might not be able to get to the hospital, so it's important for us to bring care directly to our community.

[The Primark Sustainable Cotton Programme](http://cottonconnect.org/portfolio-posts/primark-sustainable-cotton-case-study/) trains small-holder farmers in sustainable farming methods. It includes independent cotton farmers in India, and we have recently expanded it to Pakistan. So far, more than 26,000 farmers have received or are receiving training through the program. Farmers are taught by CottonConnect on the best farming techniques for their land, including seed selection, sowing, picking, and more. What other ways does the program help communities? We've partnered with agriculture experts, CottonConnect, and the [Self-Employed Women's Association](http://www.sewa.org/) to train female farmers in making sustainable, higher-quality cotton. This helps us move toward 100 percent sustainable cotton in our supply chain, while the farmers are able to contribute to their families and communities. What goals are you hoping to achieve through your partnership with UNICEF? Our work with [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/) is two-pronged: emergency response operations and education.

Local nonprofit [Homes For Our Troops](https://www.hfotusa.org/) builds specially adapted custom homes nationwide for severely injured post-9/11 veterans, enabling them to focus on rebuilding their lives. Our awareness campaign for Homes For Our Troops began with the 2018 Kentucky Derby. Generating significant local and national media attention, we helped raise nearly $80,000 in direct donations. We also hosted veterans at each of the Triple Crown races, which was a wonderful way to connect with these amazing individuals. How does Sentient Jet give back through event sponsorship?

The Sentient Flight Card is often part of a larger package that may feature one of our partners, such as a VIP Aspen ski weekend. Why is it important to you to support local charities? We are committed to offering a \"more thoughtful way to fly\" and our dedication to the Boston community is a significant piece of this brand promise.
