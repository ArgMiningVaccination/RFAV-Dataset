Nutrition for health can lower levels of LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol and decrease the risk of heart disease. Nutrition for health can increase HDL, or \"good\" cholesterol, protecting against heart disease. Nutrition for health may be combined with lifestyle changes that include exercise and stress reduction. Nutrition for health plans often include diets high in soluble fiber (carrots, Brussels sprouts, citrus fruits, oats, lentils, barley) and have been shown to reduce total cholesterol levels. Although allopathic medications can lower cholesterol, side effects may include headaches, rashes, muscle damage, digestive disorders, liver damage, and dizziness. Nutrition for health can reduce arterial wall buildup, improve blood flow and widen arteries. Nutrition for health may also include Chinese herbal formulas, which have anti-hypertensive and vasodilatation effects on peripheral blood vessels. Chinese herbal formulas in nutrition for health programs can tonify qi, increase cardiac output, enhance immune system abilities, treat angina, tonify blood, and reduce blood pressure. Traditional Chinese Medicine defines a healthy lifestyle as one that includes a balanced nutrition for health practice. Nutrition for health Chinese food therapy categorizes six food groups: spices and herbs, vegetables, grains, fruit, meats, and dairy. Appropriate nutrition for health combines acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine to achieve an optimal health state. Based on the principles of yin and yang and five element theory, each nutrition for health food is characterized by its energies, therapeutic actions and flavors. Related to yin/yang, nutrition for health food properties are further divided into four energies (cold, cool, hot, warm). The four energies of nutrition for health foods should be balanced in the diet. Nutrition for health food intake should correspond to the related organ systems that require strengthening. Nutrition for health should be tailored to individual constitution to preserve health and treat illness.
