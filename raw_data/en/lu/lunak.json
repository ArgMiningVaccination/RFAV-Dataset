These trends are triggered by changes in people's lifestyles and by socio-demographic factors, but they also influence and shape people, creating new habits and needs among consumers. Global drivers are the first highly influential element. These are external forces which have great potential to change the dynamics of business. They involve long-term issues such as aging populations and urbanization, as well as immediate triggers such as political events, natural disasters and pandemics. Intertwined with these events are those searching to address human needs or the so called basic human needs that arise from these Global Drivers, like authenticity, health and well-being and the desire of making a positive impact. Finally, we have innovations, which we could say are more of the same, in the example of the pandemic, it could be masks and hand sanitizers, novelties. These are normally related to new developments still in the embryonic stage, like possible vaccines. These two types of innovations do not tackle true consumer expectations and emerging trends. But the so called \"Sweet spot\" does... Faced with so much unsubstantiated, unqualified, and speculative information, how can we as the personal care industry differentiate the signal (a meaningful information which can lead into a trend) from the noise (random fluctuation that does not contain meaningful data)? At DSM, we consider a number of sources such as the most influential communication vehicles in the sector, academic content, research and forums, among others to have a broad perspective. For a trend to be part of the framework, it needs to also be seen emerging in other industries, e.g. Food & Beverage, Travel, and Fashion industry. Once this is the case, we then classify it as signal and not a noise. Innovations have a much higher chance to hit the sweet spot when they are inspired by selected trends observed in diverse situations. We have a framework that's dynamic and constantly updated, and it builds the fundament of our research to develop personal care ingredients that enable our customers to offer products of true value to their consumers. Based on our latest research, we have identified five major beauty trend territories, all influenced by lifestyle factors. 5 trend territories are brought to life through 17 different expressions, which require solution and calls for a comprehensive package of [skin](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/formulations/facial-skin-care.html), [hair](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/formulations/hair-care.html) and [sun care formulations ](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/formulations/sun-care.html)to address a specific area of priorities, values or needs. With this framework in mind, we are able to anticipate new manifestations that help us to develop new ingredients, solutions, and concepts ahead of the market and hit the sweet spot! At any time, new consumer needs and expectations can arise. AT DSM Personal Care & Aroma Ingredients the focus is to provide the industry with personal care ingredients capable of accompanying these developments in a consistent and meaningful way.
