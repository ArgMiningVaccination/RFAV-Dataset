It is almost always the first test pe rformed for the identification of bacteria. The primary stain of this method is Crystal Violet, whi ch can be sometimes substituted with equally effective Methylene Blue. The microorganisms that r etain the crystal violet-iodine complex appear purple brown under microscopic examination. Stained microorganisms are classified as gram positive, while the unstained are classified a s gram negative. While there is a wide range of staining methods ava ilable, the procedures for those are similar to that of Gram's stain. By using appropriate dyes, different parts of the cell structure such as capsules, flagella, granules or spores can be stain ed. Staining techniques visualize components that are too difficult to see under an ordinary lig ht microscope either because of lack of color contrast between background and object being examin ed or because of the limited power of the light microscope. In addition, these techniques are useful in the detection or absence of cell components. This simple differentiation technique r anks among the most important diagnostic tools in biological science. Gram's Method uses retained crystal violet dye duri ng solvent treatment to amplify the difference in the microbial cell wall. The cell wal ls for gram-positive microorganisms have a higher lipid content than gram-negative cells. Firs t, crystal violet ions penetrate the cell wall of both types of cells. Then, iodine is added to form a complex that makes the dye difficult to remove, in a step referred to as \"fixing\" the dye. Following iodine, the cells are treated with decolorizer, a mixture of ethanol and acetone, whic h dissolves the lipid layer from the gram- negative cells, and dehydrating the thicker gram-po sitive cell wall. As a result, the stain leaches from gram-negative cells and is sealed in gram-posi tive cells. With expedient removal of the decolorizer, cells will remain stained. The additio n of a safranin counterstain to dye the gram- negative cells with a pink color for easier observa tion under a microscope. Thus, gram-positive cells will be stained purple and gram-negative cell s will be stained pink.

Similarly, dissolve 1 g of ammonium oxalate in 100 ml of water to make an oxalate stock solution. The working solution is obtained by mixing 1 ml of the crystal violet stock solution with 10 ml of water and 40 ml of the oxalate stock solut ion. Store the working solution in a drop bottle. Methylene Blue Solution: Dissolve 1 g of methylene blue, 90% dye content, in 100 ml of ethanol, this is solution A. Mix 0.03 g of KOH in 300 ml of water, this is solut ion B. Mixing solutions A and B yields the working solutio n. Gram Iodine Solution: Dissolve 1 g of iodine, 2 g of potassium iodide and 3 g of sodium bicarbonate in 300 ml of water. Gram Decolorizer Solution: Mix equal volumes of 95% ethanol and acetone.

Working solution is obtained by diluting one part o f the stock solution with five parts of water. Method Prepare a Slide Smear 1. Transfer a drop of the suspended culture to be exam ined on a slide with an inoculation loop. If the culture is to be taken from a petri di sh or a slant culture tube, first add a drop of water on the slide and aseptically transfer a minute amount of a colony from the petri dish. Note: Note that only a very small amount of culture is needed; a visual detection of the culture on an inoculation loop already indicates that too m uch is taken. 2. Spread the culture with an inoculation loop, creati ng an even thin film over a circle of 1.5 cm in diameter (approximately dime sized). Thus , a typical slide can simultaneously accommodate 3 to 4 small smears if more than one cu lture is to be examined. 3. Hold the slide with a cloth pin. Air-dry the cultur e and fix it or over a gentle flame while moving the slide in a circular fashion to avoid loc alized overheating. Note: The applied heat helps the cell adhesion on t he glass slide to make possible the subsequent rinsing of the smear with water without a significant loss of the culture. Heat can be applied to facilitate drying the smear, however, ring patterns can form if heating is not uniform (e.g. taking the slide in and out of the fl ame). Gram Staining 1. Add about 5 drops of crystal violet stain over the fixed culture. Let stand for 60 seconds. Note that a clothes pin is used to hold the slide d uring the staining procedure to avoid staining one's hand. 2. Pour off the stain and gently rinse the excess stai n with a stream of dH 2O. Note: The objective of this step is to wash off the stain, not the fixed culture. 3. Add about 5 drops of the iodine solution on the sme ar, enough to cover the fixed culture. Let stand for 30 seconds.

Pour off the iodine solution and rinse the slides w ith running water. Shake off excess water from the surface. 5. Add a few drops of decolorizer so the solution tric kles down the slide. Rinse it off with water after 5 seconds. Stop when the solvent is no longer colored as it flows over the slide. Note: Leaving the decolorizer on for longer than 5 s econds will cause excess decolorization in the gram-positive cells, and proper staining will n ot occur. 6. Counterstain with 5 drops of the Safranin solution for 20 seconds. 7. Wash off the red Safranin solution with water. Blot with bibulous paper to remove any excess water. Alternatively, the slide may be shake n to remove most of the water and air-dried. 8. Liberally wash off any spilled stain immediately wi th water to avoid leaving permanent marks on the sink, lab bench or glassware. 9. Examine the finished slide under a microscope.
