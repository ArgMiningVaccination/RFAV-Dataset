Historically, crystals have been seen as a type of medicine, with ideas borrowed from ancient forms of Paganism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Today, crystals are once again becoming popular not just for their beauty but for their healing properties, too. When it comes to energetic healing, each crystal has a specific purpose. Some are said to be helpful in romantic matters, and some are used to manifest money, while others keep a space free of anger. All crystals heal us in some way, but which are the best for healing body, mind, and soul? Here are the top 10 healing crystals you should consider. 1. Clear Quartz We'll start off with clear quartz, because it is the \"master\" crystal of healing. It helps to clear the mind and balance the energy of the body, while aiding the immune system. The world and our bodies will always try to heal themselves when we allow them to - you will have seen how nature takes back abandoned places, and studies have seen how our bodies start to repair themselves as soon as we stop smoking a cigarette. When we keep crystals close in our day-to-day lives, we connect to the planet's healing energy. This is amplified when we wear these crystals. [Clear quartz aids memory and concentration](https://www.myfaireden.com/clear-quartz-meaning), so can be particularly useful during pregnancy and menopause. 2. Turquoise Turquoise is a stone considered to be one of the best for healing, since many consider it an energetic bridge between heaven and earth that can help balance our emotions. Also, Turquoise is a lucky charm, and when given as a gift it can heighten healing properties. Turquoise can also benefit the respiratory and immune system, so it's perfect to wear on a necklace, as well as other jewelry pieces. Turquoise Mala Tassel Necklace With Quartz Pendant 3. Rose Quartz This crystal is also extremely popular. Rose quartz is a commonly-used meditation stone as it speaks directly to the heart chakra. It heals emotional wounds, deepen a sense of self-love and awaken the innate compassion that lies within us all. Rose quartz has maternal energies and is recommended by those who have lost their own mother to help them recover emotionally from the loss. It's also a common practice among believers to place rose quartz stones on the stomach during pregnancy, as it can strengthen the bond between parent and child. Rose Quartz Beaded Bracelet With Raw Crystal Quartz 4. Amethyst This purple stone is particularly spiritual and is a way of connecting to the third eye. The organ most closely related to the third eye chakra is the pituitary gland, which controls many of our mental and hormonal functions. When the third-eye isn't functioning currently, we can experience headaches, insomnia, burnout, hormone imbalance and associated symptoms. Amethyst can help balance all of this, and many have felt it even reduced these symptoms. Amethyst Mala Tassel Necklace With Raw Stone Pendant 5. Bloodstone Not only does this healing crystal have a striking appearance of dark green with red specs (hence the name), it's also said to cleanse the blood by drawing away negative energy. It helps maintain a sense of drive, enthusiasm, and motivation, so it can be helpful if you've hit a mental block. Bloodstone Bracelet (6mm) 6. Ruby This is another well-known crystal, although it's usually revered for its red hue and association with opulence and glamor. Wearing or carrying a ruby on your person is said to initiate the sensual pleasures of life. It is often associated with lust, sexuality, and powerful energy. It stimulates the Base Chakra, which is said to increase vitality and chi, in other words, balanced energy. 7. Citrine This stone encourages optimism, friendliness and light, while also increasing mindful qualities, such as concentration, gratitude and creativity. Its energy certainly matches its golden-yellow color, and its name comes from the French word \"citron,\" meaning lemon. It is seen as an energizing crystal, and can be helpful to someone who feels creatively exhausted. 8. Sapphire Unsurprisingly, this bright blue crystal relates to divinity, royalty and insight. It can bring about prosperity and joy, while opening up the mind to success and perceptiveness. In ancient times, sapphire lost its luster if worn by an impious person. A talisman wore it to preserve chastity, discover fraud and protect the wearer from treachery. 9. Tiger's Eye This stone can be extremely powerful in alleviating self-doubt, anxiety and fear. Tiger eye can help to activate the solar plexus chakra, the energy center associated with willpower and motivation. It's often referred to as the \"Shapeshifter\" and is said to have stabilizing energy that can create positive mental shifts. Tiger Eye Leather Wrap Bracelet 10. Jasper Known as the \"Supreme Nurturer,\" this stone mirrors the hues and lines of nature itself, with markings resembling a night sky, poppy fields and mountains. Worn by shamans, priests and kings, the [jasper stone](https://www.myfaireden.com/the-healing-and-grounding-powers-of-jasper-stones) was considered a powerful protection stone both here on earth and in the spiritual realm. Ocean Jasper Leather Wrap Bracelet Each stone carries its own healing properties, and many other crystals can be used to achieve positive things in life. Crystals should be used alongside a genuine willingness to welcome positivity, success and happiness into your life. If you're new to using crystals, it's also a good idea to regularly cleanse your crystals, especially if they, like Amethyst, draw in negative energy. "}
