All RightS ReSeRveD.For Jayne Dystel in memory of her brother, John Jay Dystel. John Jay Dystel (1946-2003) John Jay Dystel typified individuals who live with multiple sclerosis: diagnosed in the prime of his life, John's promising law career was curtailed by the ravages of this disease. Yet, he remained a cheerful and hopeful man who, with his family, recognized the essential role that basic and clinical research play in discovering answers to ms. oscar and marion Dystel, John's parents, established the John Dystel multiple sclerosis research fund at the National multiple sclerosis society as a means of supporting research that will fulfill everyone's hope that stopping ms progression, restoring lost function, and ending ms forever will soon be possible; and the John Dystel multiple sclerosis fellowships that are designed for registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who are interested in receiving advanced training in ms care. All these efforts contribute to creating a world free of multiple sclerosis. 1 Multiple SCleRoSiS: o veRview 5 CliniCAl CouRSeS/typeS of MS 7 DiA gnoSiS 12 BASiC neuRologiCAl exAMinA tion 22 SyMptoMA tology 29 liStcontentstable of nuRSing hAnDBook 11No. multiple sclerosis: overview multiple sclerosis (ms) is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that affects the central nervous system (cNs). the etiology of ms remains unknown. the most widely accepted hypothesis is that it is an autoimmune disease induced by a virus or other infectious agent in a genetically- susceptible individual. 2 nAtionAl MS SoCietythe myelin sheath surrounding certain nerve fibers becomes damaged (demyelination), interrupting the conduction of nerve impulses and causing a wide variety of symptoms. axonal loss and tissue atrophy also occur within the brain and spinal cord. the many sites where myelin is lost appear as hardened sclerotic areas (also called scars, plaques, lesions) \u2014 giving the disease its name. multiple sclerosis literally means many scars. Tables 1A and 1B show the pathophysiologic basis of ms. Table 1A describes the normal functioning of the central nervous system; Table 1B describes what occurs as a result of the disease process. tABle 1A \u2014 pA thophySiologiC B ASiS of MS whA t iS noRMAl? Anatomy and physiology the nervous system is composed of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system. the neuron (also called nerve cell) is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. it consists of a cell body (perikaryon) and its processes: the axon (which conducts impulses away from cell body) and dendrites (which conduct impulses toward the cell body). myelin, produced by a specific type of cell called an oligodendrocyte, is a fatty material that insulates nerves, acting like the covering of an electrical wire to allow the nerve to transmit its impulses rapidly and smoothly. it is the speed and efficiency with which these impulses are conducted that permits coordinated movements that are performed with little conscious effort. the immune System the immune system is a network of special cells and organs that function to prevent pathogens (\"foreign invaders\") \u2014 bacteria, viruses, other micro-organisms \u2014 from infecting the body. its crucial function is to distinguish \"self\" from \"non-self.\" these abilities are innate or adaptive. nuRSing hAnDBook 3innate immunity \u2014 includes skin, tears, and mucus, which bar the entry of pathogens into the body. it mainly relies on macrophages that destroy the invading pathogens (antigens). adaptive immunity \u2014 targets antigens that evade or overwhelm innate immunity. the key players go after only specific pathogens, able to recognize them if they attack the body repeatedly. n t-cells \u2014 further grouped by function: helper t (th) cells \u2014 th1 and th2 normally regulate each other with chemical messenger cells called cytokines. killer or cytotoxic t cells suppressor t cells n b-cells \u2014 make antibodies (or immunoglobulins) against specific pathogens of t cells. antibodies block the pathogens before they enter cells and mark them for destruction. Blood-brain barrier the blood-brain barrier (bbb) is an immunologic barrier that maintains the integrity of the cNs. tABle 1B whA t iS ABnoRMAl? (whA t hAppenS in MS?) Altered physiologyms appears to involve an immune-mediated inflammatory process in the cNs. in the majority view, ms is thought to involve misguided activity by th1 cells and is immune-dysregulation. infection is often hypothesized to be an ms trigger (\"molecular mimicry\") specifically through an unfortunate resemblance between a pathogen and a host antigen. a breakdown occurs in the blood-brain barrier, allowing immunologically active cells in the blood to enter the brain and cause patchy damage to myelin. the oligodendrocyte and myelin appear to be injured in ms. Damage to myelin (demyelination) can lead to an injury to the axon. consequently, plaques or lesions form along the myelin sheath resulting in interference with nerve conduction, causing a short-circuiting and disruption of electrical transmission. 4 nAtionAl MS SoCietywhen myelin is damaged, messages between the brain and other parts of the body are interrupted. the resulting symptoms vary widely and include blurred vision, weak limbs, tingling sensations, unsteadiness and fatigue, bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, mood and cognitive changes, among others. for some people, ms is characterized by periods of relapse and remission while for others it has a progressive pattern. some degree of remyelination occurs naturally in ms, although it is generally very slow. this remyelination explains some of the recovery of function that occurs during remission. the remyelinated axons may appear to be functioning normally, as the symptoms have cleared, but electrophysiological measurements (evoked potential studies) often show that conduction is slower than normal. p erhaps more important in the long- term is the amount of damage that occurs to the axons. axons that are damaged or destroyed do not repair themselves, which is thought to explain the permanent disability that occurs in many people with ms. key fACtS ABout MS n over 2.1 million people around the world have ms. n the estimated prevalence in the united states is more than 400,000. n the incidence rate in the united states is 10,000 new cases per year. n the risk of developing ms in the general population is 1 in 750. n ms is not directly inherited although genetic susceptibility plays a part in its development; the risk in a person with a close relative who has ms increases from 1 in 750 to 1 in 40; the risk for an identical twin is approximately 1 in 25-30. n the disease is more common in women than men with a ratio of 2-3 :1. n people are most commonly diagnosed between 20 and 50 years of age; ninety percent of those diagnosed are between the ages of 16 and 60. ms has been known to make its first appearance in early childhood or after age 60. n ms occurs in most ethnic groups, including african-americans, asians and hispanic/latinos, but is more common in caucasians of Northern european ancestry. n the incidence of ms increases in countries further from the equator. in the northern hemisphere, a diminishing north-south gradient has been well described. in the southern hemisphere, the reverse has been reported. n studies have indicated that where in the world one lives earily in life influences the risk of developing ms. epidemiologic data from migration studies suggest that some factor \u2014 most likely infectious \u2014 encountered before puberty probably triggers the disease. n people who are born in an area of the world with a high risk of ms, and move to an area of lower risk before age 15, acquire the risk level of their new home. n ms is not contagious. n there is a 66% decrease in relapse rate during pregnancy and a 20-40% increased risk of relapse for up to 6 months postpartum. n lifespan is not significantly affected for most people with ms. nuRSing hAnDBook 52No. clinical courses/ types of ms the course of ms is unpredictable. some people are minimally affected by the disease while others experience severe, progressive disability; the majority of people fit between these two extremes. the following table shows the standardized terminology used to describe the clinical courses of ms.6 nAtionAl MS SoCietytABle 2: DiSeASe CouRSeS type DeSCRiption relapsing-remitting ms (rrms) characterized by exacerbations (relapses or attacks) followed by partial or complete recovery periods (remission), and no disease progression between exacerbations. 85% of people begin with this course. primary-progressive ms (ppms) characterized by slowly worsening neurologic function from the beginning \u2014 with no distinct relapses or remissions. 10% of people begin with this course. secondary-progressive ms (spms)characterized by an initial period of relapsing-remitting ms followed by a steadily worsening disease course with or without occasional exacerbations, minor recoveries, or plateaus. 50% of people with RRMS will convert to SPMS within 10 years. progressive-relapsing ms (prms)characterized by a steadily worsening disease from the onset, with occasional, acute relapses, with or without recovery. in contrast to rrms , the periods between relapses are characterized by continuing disease progression. Occurs in fewer than 5% of cases. \"Benign MS\" after many years, it may be evident that some patients have had a very long mild course that can be considered benign. benign ms represents about 10% of cases, but it can only be recognized retrospectively \u2014 after approximately 20 years have passed. RelApSe/exACeRBA tion relapses are also referred to as exacerbations, attacks, or flare-ups. a relapse is defined as the appearance of a new neurologic abnormality or a subacute worsening of an existing ms symptom(s), which is present for at least 24 hours in the absence of a metabolic etiology (e.g. fever or infection) and is separated from a previous exacerbation by at least one month. pSeuDo-exACeRBA tion a pseudo-exacerbation is unrelated to new disease activity. it results from some other trigger, such as a fever, infection, pain, or heat that can temporarily aggravate ms problems. once the triggering event is past (e.g. the body temperature returns to normal) the symptoms subside as well. p seudoexacerbations can last a few minutes or hours (e.g., following overheating due to exercise or hot weather) or a few days (e.g., because of fever related to an infection). ReMiSSion a remission does not necessarily mean that all the symptoms of ms disappear, but rather that a person with ms has some degree of improvement as the inflammatory episode subsides; in other words, recovery may be partial or complete. nuRSing hAnDBook 73No. Diagnosis the diagnostic criteria for ms have been evolving for over 50 years. a t this time, no single test is available to identify or rule out ms. the diagnosis of ms is a clinical one, requiring evidence of dissemination in time and space. in other words, there must be objective evidence of two episodes of demyelination in the cNs that are separated in time (by at least one month) and in space (as evidenced by areas of inflammation or damage in separate areas of the cNs). in addition, other conditions that mimic ms, such as infectious, metabolic and vascular illnesses must be ruled out.8 nAtionAl MS SoCietythe following ARe uSeD in the DiA gnoStiC woRk-up n medical history \u2014 overall view of the individual's health picture n Neurologic examination (See Chapter 4) n laboratory t ests: magnetic resonance imaging, evoked potentials, lumbar puncture MeDiCAl hiStoRy a careful history is taken to identify past and present symptoms that may be caused by ms. a medical history can include the following questions: Describe your current symptoms, what do they feel like and where on the body do they occur? how long have you had these symptoms? have they ever gone away? how do you manage your symptoms? Do you remember any episodes of unusual changes or symptoms that appeared for awhile and then disappeared? Do you have other medical issues? what is your family history of illness? where did you grow up and where have you traveled to in your lifetime? lABoRA toRy teStS Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRi) mri is the tool that currently offers the most sensitive non-invasive way of imaging the brain, spinal cord, or other areas of the body. it facilitates an early diagnosis and is exquisitely sensitive for detecting new inflammatory lesions. it does not use radiation, making it safe for repeated use. the mri markers of acute inflammation are gadolinium-enhancing lesions, or new and enlarging t2 lesions. gadolinium normally does not enter in the brain unless there is blood vessel leakage (a break in the blood-brain barrier) as seen with tumors, abscesses, or active ms lesions. it should be remembered, however, that approximately 5% of patients with clinically definite ms do not show lesions on brain mri at the time of diagnosis, and the absence of demyelination on mri does not rule out ms. mri findings can support the diagnosis of ms in a patient with appropriate and clinical findings, at the exclusion of alternative diagnoses. evoked p otential (ep) ep tests measure the electrical activity of the brain in response to stimulation of specific sensory nerve pathways. like the mri, this test is noninvasive and virtually painless. the 3 types of ep commonly used are: visual evoked potentials (Vep \u2014 eyes are stimulated by looking at a pattern such as a checkerboard with bright lights); brainstem auditory evoked potentials (baep \u2014 using earphones, hearing is stimulated by listening to a clicking tone); and sensory evoked potentials (sep \u2014 nerves of arms and legs are stimulated by a mild electrical pulse). the current diagnostic criteria for ms consider only Vep findings. Vep s are used to identify impaired transmission along the optic nerve pathways, which is a fairly common early finding in ms \u2014 even in someone who has never been aware of any visual symptoms. this test is not specific for ms. other conditions can produce abnormal results. the information the tests provide needs to be considered along with other laboratory and clinical information before a diagnosis of ms can be made. nuRSing hAnDBook 9lumbar puncture (lp) in an lp (also known as a spinal tap), the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) \u2014 the fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain \u2014 is collected for analysis using a hollow needle to penetrate the spinal canal at the level of l3-4 or l4-5 vertebrae. in performing this test, the physician is looking for (1) elevations in igg (immunoglobulin g, a protein fraction of gamma globulin), and other proteins that are indicative of some abnormality in the immune system or blood brain barrier; (2) the presence of a specific igg clusters that appear in the spinal fluid as oligoclonal bands; and (3)an igg index that shows whether abnormal immunoglobulins are produced in the spinal fluid area or in the blood outside the nervous system. None of these is specific for ms, making a lumbar puncture primarily useful for confirming the diagnosis of ms when there is uncertainty about other causes such as vascular disease. spinal fluid may also be normal in a minority of people diagnosed with ms. Diagnosis incorporating McDonald Criteria the \"mcDonald criteria\" (named after Dr. w . ian mcDonald) were first presented in 2001 by the international panel on the Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. the intent was to present a diagnostic scheme that could be used by the practicing neurologist to better and more reliably diagnose ms. the criteria were revised in 2005, and again in 2010 to simplify and streamline the diagnostic process, while maintaining adequate sensitivity and specificity. the mcDonald criteria have been generally adopted by the ms community around the world. (See Tables 3A and 3B). \"Clinically-isolated Syndrome \" a clinically-isolated syndrome (cis) is a single clinical event that is suggestive of demyelination (e.g. an attack of optic neuritis in one eye, or an episode of numbness on one side, transverse myelitis, or brain stem insult) that is unaccompanied by any other clinical signs or symptoms. individuals who experience a clinically isolated syndrome may or may not go on to develop ms. the challenge for the physician is to determine the likelihood that a person experiencing this type of demyelinating event is subsequently going to develop ms. studies have shown that when the cis is accompanied by mri-detected brain lesions that are consistent with those seen in ms, there is a high risk of a second neurologic event, and therefore a diagnosis of clinically definite ms, within several years. individuals who experience cis with no evidence of mri-detected lesions are at lower risk for developing ms over the same time period. 10 nAtionAl MS SoCietytABle 3A \u2014 2010 ReviSeD MCDonAlD MS DiA gnoStiC CRiteRiA1 Diagnosis of ms requires demonstration of dissemination of lesions in space (Dis) and time (Dit)* and elimination of other possible diagnoses.

New patients in the office or hospital merit a comprehensive health history. however, in many situations, a more flexible, focused, or problem-oriented interview may be appropriate. nuRSing hAnDBook 13the following is an outline of what to include when taking a patient history and performing the physical exam. it should be viewed not as a rigid structure but a general guideline. once a diagnosis is made, additional neurologic testing specific for a diagnosis of ms may be used to document disability. SpeCifiC AReAS to Be teSteD n mental status n cranial Nerves n motor function n sensory function n reflex function n gait/coordination Ment Al St AtuS perform the mental status examination throughout the patient interaction. interview a family member or friend if you have any concerns about the patient's responses. n level of alertness \u2014 is the patient alert, attentive, lethargic, or unresponsive? n language fluency \u2014 note content, rate of speech. is it comprehensible? comprehension \u2014 test ability to follow simple and/or more complex commands. repetition \u2014 ask the patient to repeat phrases or sentences. Naming \u2014 test ability to name items (e.g. paper, pencil). reading \u2014 test ability to follow a written command. writing \u2014 test ability to write an original sentence and to write a sentence from dictation.14 nAtionAl MS SoCietyn memory recent \u2014 orientation to time, place, person. remote \u2014 e.g. birthdays, anniversaries, names and ages of children recall \u2014 ask the patient to memorize three unrelated words (e.g. baseball, horse, purple), distract him/her for 5 minutes (usually by performing other parts of the examination), then ask the patient to recall the list. n calculation \u2014 ask some straightforward computation problems (5+8-3); word problems (e.g., \"how many quarters in $3.75?\"). n construction \u2014 ask the patient to draw a clock, including all the numbers, and to place the hands at 4:10. ask the patient to draw a cube; for patients who have trouble doing so, draw a cube and ask them to copy it. n abstraction \u2014 ask the patient to explain similarities (\"what do an apple and an orange have in common?\"; \"... a bicycle and an airplane?\") and differences (\"what's the difference between a radio and a television?\"; \"... a river and a lake?\") Many patients resist formal mental status testing. It can be omitted unless there is a specific need or, when necessary, defer formal testing until the rest of the examination is done. Some examiners would approximate the level of performance of a patient and then ask a screening question that he/ she thinks may be a little too tough. If the patient gets the correct answer, the easier questions can be skipped. If the patient doesn't get the correct answer, one can gradually reduce the difficulty of the questions until a right level of performance is reached. When reporting the mental status examination, certain findings can only be interpreted by knowing a patient's ability to perform other more fundamental tasks. As an example, difficulty with simple calculations may have some localizing significance in a patient who is otherwise cognitively intact, but not in a patient who is unable to answer any questions because of impaired language function or a depressed level of consciousness. This ambiguity is avoided by reporting the level of alertness first, then language function, and then memory. When reporting the results of mental status testing, it is most informative to convey patients' actual responses, rather than interpretations such as \"mildly normal\" or \"slightly concrete.\" When interpreting performance on mental status testing, keep in mind that patient background will influence performance. There is no reliable way to correct for this. Some tests are affected more than others. The ability to copy a sequence of repetitive hand movements is relatively independent of education. In contrast, interpretation of proverbs is dependent upon cultural and educational background. All of the categories used to describe mental status are convenient simplifications, but they do not necessarily reflect the way in which the brain functions. CRAniAl neRveS See Table 4. nuRSing hAnDBook 15tABle 4: CRAniAl neRveS CRAniAl neRve pRoCeDuRe cN i (olfactory) test ability to identify familiar aromatic odors, one naris at a time with eyes closed. Do not use pungent stimulant. cN ii (optic) acuity \u2014 ask patient to read the lowest possible line on the snellen's chart or e chart. obtain best corrected acuity (e.g. with glasses or pinhole).Visual field \u2014 use a 3-4mm red stimulus. funduscopic examination \u2014 examine optic disc using an ophthalmoscope. inspect the clarity of the disc outline, and observe for the presence or absence of venous pulsations. the background of the fundus is either yellow or pink, depending on race. observe the color of the disc (e.g. salmon, pink, pale). Each eye must be tested separately. cN iii (oculomotor), cN iV (t rochlear), patient's eyelids for ptosis. inspect pupil's size for equality and their direct and consensual response to light and accommodation. test extraocular movement. observe for nystagmus (involuntary back-and-forth or cyclical movements of the eyes). ask the patient to avoid any movement of the head but to continue watching your finger as you slowly move it to the patient's right and left side, upward, downward. cN V (t rigeminal) palpate jaw muscles for tone and strength when patient clenches teeth. have patient open mouth to see if jaw deviates from midline. lightly touch the patient's right forehead once, and then repeat on the opposite side. ask the patient if the two stimuli felt the same. repeat this procedure on the cheek and on the chin. in some circumstances, the testing should be repeated applying light pressure with a sterile pin. corneal reflex is tested by having the patient look to the far left, then touching the patient's right cornea with a fine wisp of cotton (introduced from the patient's right, outside the field of vision) and observing the reflexive blink that occurs in each eye. 16 nAtionAl MS SoCietyCRAniAl neRve pRoCeDuRe cN Vii (facial) inspect face for muscle atrophy and tremor. have the patient close his or her eyes tightly. observe whether the lashes are buried equally on the two sides and whether you can open either eye manually. have the patient look up and wrinkle the forehead; note for symmetry. have the patient smile, and observe whether one side of the face is activated more quickly or more completely than the other. observe for flattening of the naso-labial fold. check the palpebral fissures for symmetry (wider on side of facial weakness). test ability to identify sweet and salty tastes on each side of tongue. taste should be tested with tongue held outside of the mouth. Certain areas on the tongue are more receptive to specific flavors: tip (sweet), sides (salt, sour), back (bitter). cN Viii (a coustic) for a bedside examination, it usually suffices to perform a quick hearing assessment by holding your fingers a few inches away from the patient's ear and rubbing them together softly. Weber test \u2014 place base of vibrating tuning fork on midline vertex of head to test for lateralization. Rinne test \u2014 place base of vibrating tuning fork against mastoid bone to compare air and bone conduction. cN iX (glossopharyngeal) test gag reflex and ability to swallow. test ability to identify sour and bitter tastes. cN X (Vagus) touch posterior wall of pharynx with tongue depressor while observing palate, pharyngeal muscles, uvula. ask patient to say \"ahh\". observe the palate and uvula \u2014 do they rise in midline? Note for any curtain sign (uvula moves toward the normal side). observe for swallowing difficulty. nuRSing hAnDBook 17CRAniAl neRve pRoCeDuRe cN Xi (spinal a ccessory) have the patient turn the head all the way to the left. place your hand on the left side of the chin and ask the patient to resist you as you try turning the head back to the right. p alpate the right sternocleidomastoid muscle with your other hand at the same time. repeat this maneuver in the other direction to test the left sternocleidomastoid. to test shoulder elevation, ask the patient to shrug the shoulders while you resist the movement with your hands. cN Xii (hypoglossal) inspect tongue for fasciculation/involuntary contraction or twitching. Deviations are toward affected side. inspect tongue movement toward nose and chin.test tongue strength with index finger when tongue is pressed against cheek.evaluate quality of lingual speech sounds (l, t, d, n). MotoR funCtion n assess muscle bulk, inspect muscle contours, and note any atrophy. Note any spasticity, rigidity, flaccidity. Tone is qualitatively assessed by asking the patient to relax and let you manipulate the limbs passively. It is sometimes difficult to perform this on some patients. They may be distracted by engaging them in unrelated conversation or ask them to let their limbs go limp. n assess for involuntary movements (e.g. clonus, myoclonic jerks). observe location, quality, rate, rhythm. n strength testing (see Table 5) \u2014 in the upper extremities, test shoulder abduction, elbow extension, elbow flexion, wrist extension, wrist flexion, finger extension, finger flexion, and finger abduction. in the lower extremities, test hip flexion, hip extension, knee flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, and ankle plantar flexion. if some of these muscles are weak or if the patient complains of focal weakness, additional testing may be necessary to determine if the weakness is in the distribution of a specific nerve or nerve root. 18 nAtionAl MS SoCietyFor each movement, place the limb near the middle of its range, and then ask the patient to resist you as you try to move the limb from that position. As an example, in testing shoulder abduction, the patient's arms should be horizontal, forming a letter T with the body, and the patient should try to maintain that position while you press down on both arms at a point between the shoulders and the elbows. When possible, place one hand above the joint being examined to stabilize the joint, and exert pressure with your other hand just below the joint, to isolate the specific movement you are trying to test. Look for a pattern in any detectable weakness. It may suggest a lower motor neuron lesion affecting a peripheral nerve or nerve root. Weakness of one side of body suggests an upper motor neuron lesion. A polyneuropathy causes symmetric distal weakness, and a myopathy usually causes proximal weakness. Monoparesis refers to weakness of a single limb. Hemiparesis is weakness of one side of the body. Paraparesis is weakness of both lower extremities. Quadriparesis is weakness of all four limbs. Monoplegia, hemiplegia, paraplegia, and quadriplegia are analogous terms that refer to complete or nearly complete paralysis of the involved limbs. tABle 5: gRADing MuSCle StRength gRADe DeSCRiption 0 No muscular contraction detected 1 a detectable contraction 2 active movement with gravity eliminated 3 active movement against gravity 4 active movement against gravity and some resistance 5 active movement against full resistance. Add \"-\" or \"+\" to indicate the finding (e.g. \"3-\" may indicate muscle strength moving poorly against gravity, \"3+\"indicate muscle strength moves well against gravity. n finger-to-nose testing \u2014 ask the patient to use the tip of his or her right index finger to touch the tip of your index finger, then the tip of his or her nose, then your finger again, and so forth. hold your finger so that it is near the extreme of the patient's reach, and move it to several different positions during the testing. repeat the test using the patient's left arm. observe for accuracy and tremor. n heel-to-shin testing \u2014 have the patient lie supine, place the right heel on the left knee, and then move the heel down the shin to the ankle. repeat using the left heel on the right shin. again, observe for accuracy and tremor. nuRSing hAnDBook 19n pronator drift \u2014 have the patient stretch out the arms so that they are level and fully extended with the palms facing straight up, and then close the eyes. w atch for 5 to 10 seconds to see if either arm tends to pronate (so that the palm turns inward) and drift downward. n rapid alternating movements \u2014 have the patient alternately pronate and supinate the right hand against a stable surface (e.g. a table, the patient's own thigh or left hand) as rapidly as possible; repeat for the left hand. observe speed, accuracy, and rhythm. impaired ability to perform this task is referred to as dysdiadochokinesis. there is clumsiness and irregular movements in cerebellar disease. also, have patient tap middle finger on distal interphalangeal joint. loss of speed and dexterity reflects upper motor neuron dysfunction. SenSoRy this involves testing first the primary sensory modalities (e.g. light touch, pain and temperature, vibration, joint position sense) and then the discriminative sensory functions (e.g. stereosognosis, graphesthesia, point localization, two point discrimination, and extinction). the former test the integrity of the afferent sensory pathways, whereas the latter test the ability of sensory and association cortices to analyze and interpret sensory input. Ask patient to close eyes before sensory testing begins. Use minimal stimulation initially, and then increase gradually until patient becomes aware. Test contralateral areas, asking patient to compare perceived sensations side to side. n superficial touch \u2014 lightly touch skin with cotton wisp or your fingertips. n superficial pain \u2014 alternating sharp and smooth edge of broken tongue blade or point and hub of sterile needle, touch skin in unpredictable pattern. ask patient to identify sensation (sharp or dull) and where it is felt. n temperature \u2014 alternately roll test tubes of hot or cold water against skin in an unpredictable pattern (a tuning fork can also serve for cold stimulation). ask patient to indicate hot or cold and where it is felt. n Vibration \u2014 place stem of vibrating tuning fork (e.g. 128-hz) against several bony prominences (e.g. toes). ask patient if they feel the vibration and when it stops. n Joint position sense \u2014 hold joint to be tested (great toe or finger) by lateral aspects in neutral position, then raise or lower digit, and ask patient which way it is moved. return to neutral position before moving in another direction. repeat at both feet. n stereosognosis \u2014 hand patient familiar objects (e.g. key, coin) and ask patient to identify. n extinction phenomenon \u2014 simultaneously touch cheek, hand, or other area on each side of the body and ask patient the number of stimuli and locations. n graphesthesia \u2014 with blunt pen or applicator stick, draw letter or number on palm of patient's hand, and ask patient to identify it. repeat with different figure on other hand. n two-point discrimination (to test cortical sensory functions) \u2014 using 2 stimuli, alternately touch patient's skin with one or both points simultaneously at various locations. find distance at which patient can no longer distinguish 2 points. 20 nAtionAl MS SoCietyReflexeS (see table 6) n tendon reflexes \u2014 the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, knee (patellar), and ankle (a chilles) reflexes are the ones commonly tested. the joint under consideration should be at about 90 degrees and fully relaxed. it is often helpful to cradle the joint in your own arm to support it. with your other arm, hold the end of the hammer and let the head of the hammer drop like a pendulum so that it strikes the tendon: biceps (c5, c6) \u2014 just anterior to the elbow. \u2014 just posterior to the elbow. brachioradialis (c5, c6) \u2014 about a few centimeters above the wrist on the radial aspect of the forearm. knee (l2, l3, l4) \u2014 just below the patella. ankle (s1) \u2014 just behind the ankle. Relaxation is critical during the reflex examination. Tendon reflexes are difficult to elicit when patients tense the muscles being tested. It is helpful to distract patients by engaging them in conversation while testing their reflexes and to put a slight tension on the muscle being tested. When a patient has reflexes that are difficult to elicit, you can amplify them by using reinforcement procedures: Ask the patient to clench his or her teeth or (when testing lower extremity reflexes) to hook together the flexed fingers of both hands and pull. This is also known as the Jendrassik maneuver. Clonus is a rhythmic series of muscle contractions induced by stretching the tendon. It most commonly occurs at the ankle, where it is typically elicited by suddenly dorsiflexing the patient's foot and maintaining light upward pressure on sole. When reflexes are brisk, it is difficult to detect slight asymmetry. For the most sensitive comparison, it is best to reduce the stimulus until it is just barely above threshold for eliciting the reflex. Such subtle distinctions are most readily made by testing the reflex on one side immediately after testing the corre- sponding reflex on the other side, rather than testing all reflexes in one limb before testing the contralateral limb. Another technique to heighten sensitivity to subtle reflex asymmetry is to place a finger on the patient's tendon and strike the finger rather than striking the tendon directly. This allows one to feel the tendon contraction. n plantar response (l5, s1) \u2014 using a blunt, narrow surface (e.g., broken tongue blade, a wooden q tip, key), stroke the sole of the patient's foot on the lateral edge, starting near the heel and proceeding along the lateral edge almost to the base of the little toe, then curve the path medially just proximal to the base of the other toes. this should take the form of a smooth \"J\" stroke. the normal response is for all the toes to flex (a \"flexor plantar response\"). when there is damage to the central nervous system motor pathways, an abnormal reflex occurs: the great toe extends (dorsiflexes) and the other toes may fan out. this is called an extensor plantar response; it is also known as a babinski sign. Comparison between reflexes in one part of the body and another is much more important than the absolute reflex grade. The most important comparison is between corresponding reflexes on the right and left, where even subtle asymmetry may be significant. nuRSing hAnDBook 21tABle 6: gRADing ReflexeS 1+ absent gAit/CooRDinA tion n observe the patient's casual gait, preferably with the patient unaware of being observed. have the patient walk away, turn, and come back, walk on toes, then on heels, walk heel-to-toe (tandem) as if walking on a tightrope, hop in place on each foot. Note if the patient is unsteady with any of these maneuvers or if there is any asymmetry. also note for scissoring or circumduction or foot drop. upper or lower motor neuron weakness, cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonism, and loss of position sense may all affect performance. Note the arm swing for symmetry. Note the base \u2014 is it too wide (cerebellar dysfunction) or too narrow (parkinsonism). n romberg test (a sensory test of stance) \u2014 ask patient to stand with feet together and eyes open, then closed for 20-30 seconds. mild sway may occur. (stand close by to prevent falls). loss of balance that appears only when eyes are closed is a positive romberg test, suggesting poor position sense. n timed 25 foot walk (t25fw) \u2014 a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on time. it is also a component of the multiple sclerosis functional composite (msfc). the patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. the time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. the task can be immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. p atients may use assistive devices when doing this task. StAnDARD SCAleS foR DiSABility in MS Neurological impairment and disability, both at diagnosis and over the course of the disease, can be quantified by the kurtzke expanded Disability status scale (eDss). this is a standard scale (0 =normal and 10=death due to ms) used to rate the degree of ms related neurological disability. however this scale is heavily weighted toward ambulation and may not provide a true picture of the patient's functional status. it takes significant time to complete and therefore is primarily used during research studies. another measure that is used to evaluate disability is the multiple sclerosis functional composite (msfc), which consists of the p aced auditory serial addition t est (pasat), 9 hole p eg test, and the t25fw . these scores can be compared individually over time. though developed for research purposes, items within the msfc may be useful to document a patient's condition. 22 nAtionAl MS SoCiety5No. symptomatology given the varied nature and distribution of pathologic lesions in ms, it is expected that the disease will cause a variety of clinical deficits or combination of deficits. to manage ms effectively, the disease process should be modified to the extent possible; symptoms of the disease should be managed to allow better function and safety; and the person with the disease should be given the psychosocial support needed to improve his or her quality of life. nuRSing hAnDBook 23SyMptoMS in MS MA y Be DiviDeD into the following: n primary symptoms \u2014 those that are caused directly by demyelination within the brain and spinal cord (e.g. weakness, gait disturbance, visual loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction). n secondary symptoms \u2014 those that are indirectly caused by the disease (e.g., skin breakdown caused by immobility). n tertiary symptoms \u2014 those related to the psychosocial impact of the disease (e.g. emotional, vocational or marital problems). n Neurological impairment leads to disability \u2014 difficulty with activities of daily living, and handicap \u2014 impacting one's position in the community and at work. fAtigue fatigue is the most common symptom of ms (reported by 80-90% of patients) \u2014 and one of the primary reasons why people with ms leave the workforce. several types of fatigue can occur, including: n fatigue caused by sleep disturbances, which can be primary or secondary to other ms symptoms such as bladder problems, spasticity, or pain. n a \"short-circuiting\" type of fatigue that results from demyelination in the nerves going to the upper and lower extremities. p eople with this type of fatigue experience increased weakness during prolonged activity, which resolves with rest. n fatigue resulting from depression. n fatigue or sleepiness that occurs as a side effect of medications. n cognitive fatigue that occurs during tasks requiring sustained attention, even in the absence of physical fatigue. n ms fatigue \u2014 or \"lassitude\" \u2014 which is unique to this disease. it is an abrupt, often overwhelming tiredness that can come on at any time, regardless of time of day or amount of sleep or rest. lassitude, which can be worsened by heat and humidity, is subjectively described as a lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual of caretaker to interfere with usual or desired activities. n management \u2014 the management of fatigue includes exercise, energy management strategies, energy conserving devices such as mobility aids and other tools, cooling strategies, and prompt attention to the other contributing factors listed above. ms lassitude responds well to certain types of medication. (See \"Pharmacotherapeutics\"). viSuAl DiStuRBAnCeS the optic nerve, which is an out-pocketing of the brain, is highly myelinated and thus very prone to demyelination and inflammation. this can result in an acute overall loss of vision. n optic Neuritis \u2014 subacute loss or disturbance in vision and possibly pain behind affected eye, caused by inflammation or demyelination of optic nerve, most often temporary, with complete or partial recovery. n management \u2014 optic Neuritis typically resolves spontaneously. corticosteroids may be prescribed if a patient's vision is too impaired or if pain is too severe.24 nAtionAl MS SoCietyn marcus-gunn pupil (also called apD \u2014 afferent pupillary Defect) \u2014 pupillary dilation is paradoxically seen when a light is moved from the unaffected to the affected side. n Nystagmus \u2014 rhythmic jerkiness or bounce in one or both eyes. n Diplopia \u2014 double vision, or the simultaneous awareness of two images of the same object that results from a failure of the two eyes to work in a coordinated fashion. covering one eye will erase one of the images. n oscillopsia \u2014 a visual disturbance in which objects appear to be jumping or bouncing. n uthoff's phenomenon \u2014 an unusual symptom characterized by decrease in vision associated with exercise, probably due to an increase in body heat, which affects nerve conduction. Vision returns when the person stops exercising and cools down. MotoR SyMptoMS involvement of the pyramidal tracts, either in the spinal cord or higher in the cNs, produces weakness typical of an upper motor neuron lesion. n spasticity \u2014 an increase in muscle tone that can interfere with normal movement of the affected limb, caused by dysregulation of nerve impulses in the spinal cord. management: - rehabilitation with physical therapist and/or occupational therapist. - balance, stretching and coordination exercises. - medication management. (See Chapter 7). n contractures \u2014 abnormal, sometimes permanent flexion/limitation (bending) of a joint that can occur if range of motion is limited by spasticity, weakness or lack of use of a limb. management: - rehabilitative physical and/or occupational therapy program (stretching and range of motion exercises) - medications: o oral medications: (e.g. Baclofen. See \"Pharmacotherapeutics\"). o intrathecal baclofen pump (itb) type a or b. o botulinum t oxin t ype a or b injections \u2014 disrupts activity at the neuromuscular junction. o intrathecal phenol \u2014 causes denervation of sensory and motor nerve fibers in surrounding areas (phenol nerve block). n foot drop \u2014 plantar flexion of the foot as seen with weakness of the dorsiflexor of the foot. management: - orthotics \u2014 use of ankle-foot orthosis (afo) for foot drop, or functional electrical stimulation (fes) device such as w alk aide and Ness l300. nuRSing hAnDBook 25n Dysmetria \u2014 a disturbance of coordination, caused by lesions in the cerebellum. a tendency to over- or underestimate the extent of motion needed to place an arm or leg in a certain position as, for example, in overreaching for an object. n Dysphonia \u2014 disorders of voice quality (including poor pitch control, hoarseness, breathiness, and hypernasality) caused by spasticity, weakness, and discoordination of muscles in the mouth and throat. n Dysarthria \u2014 poorly articulated speech resulting from dysfunction of the muscles controlling speech, usually caused by damage to the central or peripheral nervous system. the content and meaning of the spoken words remain normal. n hyperreflexia \u2014 increased action of the reflexes. n myoclonus \u2014 rapid, shock-like muscle jerks that move a joint, may involve limbs or trunk. SenSoRy SyMptoMS n l'hermitte's sign \u2014 abnormal \"electrical\" sensation down the back or limbs, elicited by flexing of the neck, bringing the head forward. n Dysesthesia \u2014 burning sensation caused by abnormalities in the sensory pathways in the brain and spinal cord. n Numbness/tingling \u2014 occurs when the nerves that transmit sensation do not conduct information properly, so that one is unable to fully appreciate sensations from that area. n cold feet \u2014 results from short-circuiting in the autonomic nervous system interconnections that control the diameter of blood vessels. this does not signify a significant circulatory problem. BRAinSteM SyMptoMS n internuclear ophthalmoplegia (iNo) \u2014 disconjugate abnormalities of eye movement. a dducting eye may not cross the midline, abducting eye shows nystagmus. n tic Douloureux/t rigeminal Neuralgia \u2014 a stabbing or shock-like pain at the face, often moving centrifugally away from the snout area which can be aggravated by wind, chewing, talking, or brushing teeth. n management: medication management (e.g. t egretol, Neurontin. See \"Pharmacotherapeutics\"). surgical - rhizotomy \u2014 surgical resection of a nerve root to relieve pain or reduce spasticity. n spinning, Dizziness and Vertigo \u2014 sensation of \"spinning\", which, when severe, may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, resulting from an irritation of the brain stem structures that help to maintain balance. n facial myokymia/hemifacial spasms \u2014 twitching of isolated segments of muscle.26 nAtionAl MS SoCietyCeReBellAR involveMent n tremor \u2014 involuntary, relatively rhythmic movement of the arms, legs, head or trunk. n intention tremor \u2014 a relatively slow, oscillating (back and forth) movement of a limb engaged in purposeful movement, often with pre-terminal enhancement. n titubation \u2014 a form of tremor, resulting from demyelination in the cerebellum that manifests itself primarily in the head, neck and trunk, with involuntary head movement. n ataxia \u2014 inability to perform coordinated muscle movements. n management \u2014 management of cerebellar symptoms is primarily rehabilitative. medication may be useful for tremor in some individuals. BlADDeR D ySfunCtion for normal urination to occur, the detrusor or bladder muscle must contract to expel urine at the same time that the internal and external sphincters are relaxed to allow the urine to pass freely out of the body. urinary incontinence related to neurogenic bladder dysfunction is caused by one of two problems: n failure to store \u2014 caused by detrusor hyperreflexia resulting in urgency, urinary frequency, urge incontinence. n failure to empty \u2014 caused by acontractile bladder and detrusor areflexia, hyporeflexia with poorly sustained contractions resulting to urinary retention, urinary tract infection and overflow incontinence. n Detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia (DesD) \u2014 lack of coordination between muscle groups resulting in urgency, frequency, urge incontinence, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, dysuria and/or decreased flow. bladder contraction may occur with a tightly closed sphincter. n management \u2014 management includes the following strategies, depending on the type of dysfunction: behavioral therapy \u2014 timed voiding, dietary modification, avoiding caffeinated beverages intermittent catheterization medication management (e.g. anticholinergics, alpha blockers, botulinum toxin. See Chapter 7). surgical - suprapubic t ube/cathether \u2014 indwelling catheter placed directly into the bladder through the abdomen, above the pubic bone. can be temporary or permanent. - cystoplasty \u2014 enlargement of bladder to increase capacity and to lower bladder pressure. may provide opening to abdomen for ease of intermittent catheterization. - urostomy-opening in the abdominal wall through which urine leaves the body into a collection device, bypassing the bladder. - sphincterotomy (permanent) or stent placement (potentially reversible) \u2014 procedure used in males with detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (combined storage and emptying dysfunction). nuRSing hAnDBook 27Bowel D ySfunCtion n constipation \u2014 infrequent or difficult elimination of stool; less than two bowel movements per week. management: - Dietary modification \u2014 increase amount of fiber in diet, increase fluid intake. - establishing a bowel program (e.g. regular defecation on schedule). - use of fiber supplements. - medications \u2014 stool softeners, laxatives, enemas, suppositories (See Chapter 7). n incontinence \u2014 uninhibited bowel elimination can result due to loss of or diminished sphincter control or hyperreflexic bowel. managing bowel symptoms is often the result of trial and error. a structured daily plan for bowel management can lead to more predictable bowel habits. n it is important to remember that the goal of any bowel management program is for a patient to move his or her bowels comfortably in an appropriate setting and at a minimum of 2-3 times per week. it can take months to be successful in developing a regular bowel pattern. SexuAl D ySfunCtion a chronic illness such as ms may have tremendous impact on sexuality. sexual dysfunction in ms may include decreased or absent sexual drive, decreased blood flow and muscle tone, impaired sensation, erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory problems or difficulty achieving orgasm. symptoms such as spasticity, bowel and bladder problems, pain, cognition issues, psychological issues and fatigue can contribute to sexual problems. communication is critical to achieving a positive, enjoyable sexual relationship. management strategies include exploring alternative pleasurable activities and areas of sensation on the body; i.e. lubricants, sexual aids such as vibrators or other sex toys, medication to treat erectile dysfunction like Viagra and levitra. (See Chapter 7, Table 9). DepReSSion/eMotionAl iSSueS n Depression \u2014 more than 50% of ms patients will experience a major depressive episode some time during the course of their disease. suicide is seven times as common in ms than in general population. management: - psychosocial interventions by psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker - medication management (e.g. antidepressant agents \u2014 tca, ssri. See Chapter 7). n pseudobulbar affect (pba) \u2014 uncontrolled episodes of laughing or crying that are unrelated to mood or circumstances. pba is direct result of demyelination in the brain, probably in the limbic system, and can be treated with Nuedexta (dextromethorphan and quinidine) \u2014 a drug approved for this use in 2010. 28 nAtionAl MS SoCietyCognitive iMp AiRMent/higheR CoRtiCAl funCtion cognitive impairment may be one of the most feared symptoms of ms. it can change the personality and, in the extreme, lead to total functional dependence. approximately 50-60% of people experience some degree of impairment. n short-term memory dysfunction, slowed information processing, executive dysfunction with difficulty planning and prioritizing, multi-tasking and organizing, and impaired judgement, problems with usual-spatial skills. the multiple sclerosis Neuropsychological screening questionnaire (msNq) is a simple tool that can be used in the clinical setting as a preliminary screen for cognitive impairment. once a cognitive deficit is identified, the nurse can assess the patient's daily routine and design strategies to help the patient and family cope with the disability. for those patients with mild impairment, simple strategies such as reminder notebooks and detailed lists of tasks to be performed may address the problem sufficiently. those with more advanced decline may require referral for formal cognitive training by a neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, or speech and language pathologist. nuRSing hAnDBook 296No. pharmacotherapeutics as a primary source of information for patients and families affected by ms, nurses are in an optimal position to provide education about medications.

B-Cell a type of lymphocyte (white blood cell) manufactured in the bone marrow that makes antibodies. BABinSki Reflex a neurologic sign in ms in which stroking the outside sole of the foot with a pointed object causes an upward (extensor) movement of the big toe rather than the normal (flexor) bunching and downward movement of the toes. BlooD-BRAin BARRieR a semipermeable cell layer around blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that prevents large molecules, immune cells, and potentially damaging substances and disease-causing organisms (e.g. viruses) from passing out of the blood stream into the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). a break in the blood-brain barrier may underlie the disease process in ms.
