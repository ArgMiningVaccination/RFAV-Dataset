Cryptosporidiosis is an important parasite cau sing severe diseases in the immunodeficient people especially AIDS patients. Cryptosporidiosis has been also reported as a c om- mon serious primary cause of outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn calves. The aim of this study was to confirm t hat P23 was an immunogenic antigen in domestic isolates of C. parvum . Methods: We isolated cryptosporidial oocysts from the naturally infected calves. The oocysts were then purified and characterized as C. parvum by nested PCR. To obtain the recombinant P23 protei n, we isolated the mRNA from oocyst of C. parvum , and synthesized the cDNA. The cDNA was then d using specific primers Results: Sequencing sequences in GenBank. strand P23-cDNA was then cloned in pGEX-5X-2 expressio n vector and P23-recombinant protein was prepared. W est- ern blot analysis of recombinant P23 showed that it c ould be recognized by the positive C. parvum serum. Furthermore, serum from immunized goat with the recombinant P23 pr otein also recognized a protein band with approximat ely 23 kDa in lysates prepared from the oocytes. Conclusion: Since P23 is an immunodominant surface glycoprotein expressed in the early phase of infection and the immunogenic epitopes are found in its residual chain of amino acid sequence, the recombinant P23 could be r ecom- mended as a favorable candidate for vaccination agai nst C. parvum infection. Keywords : Cryptosporidium parvum, Expression vector pGEX-5X-2, recombinant protein P23, PC R, RT-PCR, West- ern blot, Dot Blot Introduction ryptosporidium parvum is a widely distributed coccidian parasite that causes enteric disease in humans and animals; it has been reported as a common serious primary cause of outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn and young calves (1).These animals are mostly infected with C. parvum between day 4 and the third week of age (2).The main clinical signs in newborn ruminants are depression, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, re- tarded growth during the first weeks of life and eventually high mortality rate which re- sulting significant economic losses (3,4). Since immunoglobulins cannot be transmitted through placenta, transmission of C. parvum - specific antibodies through the colostrum is very important for the protection of the new- borns (5, 6). It is believed that the antigens CP15/P60 and P23 are able to protect the new borne ruminants against cryptosporidiosis and therefore they were recommended as suitable tools for the immunization (7-9). The aim of this study was to confirm that P23 is an immunogenic antigen in domestic iso- lates of C. parvum and to produce the recom- binant P23 and evaluate the potential effect of this protein in the immunization. C Corresponding author : srahbari@ut.ac.ir www.SID.irArchive of SIDEbrahimzadeh et al: Recombinant Cryptosporidium parvu m 2 Material and Methods Collection of C. parvum oocysts and experi- mental infection During 2007, oocysts of C. parvum from naturally infected calves in Tehran Province were collected and purified as described by Lorenzo et al (10). To confirm that the col- lected oocysts belong to Cryptosporidium spp., DNA was extracted from oocysts using DNA extraction kit (MBST, Tehran, Iran) and amplified using two primers (F1 and R1) de- rived from 18S rRNA gene of Cryptosporid- ium spp. (Table 1). The PCR product was amplified with C. parvum -specific primers F2 and common primer R1 either directly or after isolation and purification from the agarose gel using DNA isolation from agarose gel kit (MBST). After characterization, were inocu- lated orally in a 1-day old C. parvum seronegative calf. C. parvum oocysts were then obtained from the feces of the experimentally infected calf during 5 to 11 days post inoculation. The isolated oocysts were treated in 10% sodium hypochlorite and subsequently washed three times in distilled water and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Sera before and after inoculations were collected from the calf, stored at 20\u00b0C and used as negative and positive controls. P23-cDNA cloning Total RNA was isolated from oocyst by RNA isolation kit (MBST). One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. For cDNA synthesis, 2 \u00b5l M-MULV enzyme (40 \u00b5M, Roche), 1 oligo \u00b5l (20 \u00b5m, Gibco buffer in an end vol- ume of 25 \u00b5l were used. The cDNA synthesis was performed at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The amplification of cDNA was performed using primers derived from the nucleotide sequence at the position 16 to 39 (F3) and from 340 to 357 (R2) of P23 mRNA sequences (Table 1). The nucleotide sequences of Bam HI restric- tion site were added to the 5 ends of primers (Table 1). After sequencing of RT-PCR prod- uct, P23 strand cDNA site site) of dephos- phorylated pGEX-5X-2 using rapid ligation kit (Roche, Germany). The re- combinant P23 cDNA-pGEX-5X-2 was then transferred to the competent Escherichia coli BL21. The E. coli clones were separately grown and the plasmids were isolated using Plasmid Isolation Kit (MBST, Iran). The pres- ence of insert DNA in primers F4 and R3 (F4 and R3 were derived from the flanking region of multicloning site in vector) and the direction of P23 cDNA in vector DNA was determined using primers F3 and R3 (Table 1). Addition- ally, the nucleotide sequences of the insert cDNA was determined and compared to the known sequences in GenBank. Preparation of positive serum against C. parvum Serum from a new borne uninfected calf was collected as a negative control. The calf was then inoculated orally with 5 \u00d7 10 6 C. parvum oocysts. After three weeks, serum was col- lected and used as a positive control. To ob- tain, serum against recombinant P23, goat was inoculated recombinant P23. 120 \u00b5g recombi- nant P23 protein in 500 \u00b5l PBS was mixed thoroughly with 500 \u00b5l complete Freund`s adjuvant. The prepared emulsion was then inoculated s.c. to the goat. Three weeks after the first immunization, 60 \u00b5g protein in 500 \u00b5l PBS mixed with 500 \u00b5l incomplete Freund`s adjuvant was inoculated s.c. to the goat and one week later, serum was collected from the goat and used as a positive control. Serum from naturally infected calves was also used as positive control. SDS-PAGE , Western blot and DOT blot C. parvum oocysts were lysed in PBS/PMSF (1 mM) buffer by and sonication (amplitude 70%, 0.5 cycles, Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Germany). The debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. Supernatant was collected and used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot- 500 microliters 2009, pp.1-7 3 transfected E. coli was incubated in 10 ml LB medium containing 1 mM IPTG and 10 \u00b5l ampicillin (100 mg/ml) for 3 h under shaking condition. Recombinant P23 protein was then extracted using Microspin GST purification Module kit and Factor Xa (Amersham, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, the fusion protein was first bound to the carrier placed in the Microspin GST- column and the cell debris and other unde- sired contaminants were then washed from the column using PBS buffer. Finally, the P23 protein was cut from the GST using factor Xa and collected in a sterile tube. The oocyst lys- ate, the P23-GST fusion protein, and recombi- nant P23 were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue solution (0.1 g Coomassie brilliant blue in 50% H 2O/40% methanol/10% acetic acid) or transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane using Semi-Dry trans-Blot (BioRad, USA). To determine the immunogenic bands, free binding sites on the membrane were first blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS buffer (20 mM Tris base and 0.15 M NaCl in H 2O) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, the membrane was incu- bated in a positive serum (1:200 dilution) ob- tained from serum collected from infected calf with C. parvum and with positive serum against recombinant P23 protein obtained from immunized goat, for 1 h at room temperature (RT). The membrane was then washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min at RT. Horserad- ish-conjugated rabbit anti-bovine Ig (Dako, Denmark) (1:1,000) were added to the washed membrane and incubated for 1 h at RT. After incubation, the membrane was washed three times as described above. The positive reac- tion was developed using DAB (Sigma, USA) as substrate under visual observation within 5 min. In all experiments, serum from new- born calf before first feeding with colostrum was used as negative serum control. Opti- mized serum (1:200) was then se- test sera. Dot blot analysis of re-combinant P23 with positive serum against C. parvum was performed (11). Results The genomic DNA from oocysts was first amplified with the primer pair (F1/R1) spe- cific for cryptospordial agents, resulting in an expected PCR product of 412 bp in length. The amplificate was then amplified with the primer pair (F2/R1) specific for C. parvum re- sulting in the expected PCR product of 354 bp in length. Therefore, the purified oocytes from naturally infected calf were character- ized as C. parvum . To obtain sufficient mate- rial for the SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis, a total volume of 200 \u00b5l of oocytes in a concentration of the 5 x 10 7/ml oocysts were collected from experimentally infected calf. SDS-PAGE analysis of lysate from puri- fied oocysts showed beside other protein bands, a protein band with the approximately 23 kDa (Fig 4A). The western blot analysis revealed that the 23 kDa protein band was also recognized with the serum collected from C. parvum infected calf and the serum from immunized goat with the recombinant P23 protein (Fig 2B and Fig. 3). To obtain the recombinant P23 protein, we isolated the mRNA from oocyst of C. parvum and amplified the cDNA of P23 gene by re- verse transcriptase PCR. The amplificate with 342 bp in length (Fig.1A) was then se- quenced. The Sequencing of the showed 100% the GenBank (Fig.1B). The double strand P23-cDNA was then cloned in pGEX-5X-2 expression vector and the recombinant plasmid was transfected in E. coli . Induction of transfected E.coli revealed GST-P23 fusion protein from which P23 could be isolated (Fig 4B). Dot blot analysis of recombinant P23 with positive serum against C. parvum showed positive reaction (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis of recombi- nant P23 showed it could be recognized by the positive C. parvum serum (Fig. 2B). cDNA with F3 and R2 primers.

The role of humoral immu- nity in development of resistance is not known, although specific antibody against C. parvum , has been demonstrated in the sera of infected normal and immunodeficient indi- viduals. It is known that the immunized cattle can protect calves through colostrum (8). The protective immunity could be achieved using different antigens such as whole oocyst anti- gens (12), P23 (13), rC7(8) and CP15/60 (14). Since P23 involved in the infection process, it is almost expressed in early and late stages of infection and conserved on diverse C. parvum isolates and also can induce protective immu- nity (8,13,15), thus it could be considered as a suitable candidate for protection. The analysis of the P23-PCR product revealed a 100% homology to the p23 mRNAs published in GenBank. This sequence similarity suggests that the P23 protein may belongs to the con- served proteins of all C. parvum world wide. Western blot analysis of induced P23-pGEX- 5X-2 transfected E. coli BL2 compared to the induced pGEX-5X-2 transfected E. coli BL2 showed that the fusion protein GST-P23 as well as purified recombinant P23 could be detected with the Cryptosporidium parvum positive serum (Fig.2B). It is very important to use the pure P23 for further analysis, since C. parvum positive serum can also react with GST, which may be expressed by so many parasites infecting calves. It can be concluded that this protein is an important antigen that stimulates host immunoresponses, resulting in a specific antibody production under natural infection. There are a lot of works, which confirm the use of recombinant proteins as vaccines against causative agents of human and animal diseases. Perrymann used recombinant P23 for the immunizing of the pregnant cattle to protect the calves against cryptosporidiosis with immune bovine colostrums (8). Taka-shima have also emphasized the C. parvum P23 as a potential vaccine for prevention(16). Shayan showed that recombinant C. parvum P23 was an important target to screen the se- rum of pregnant dams for detection of crypto- sporidium specific antibody and in their calf sera. They revealed that 67% newborn calves was negative in antibody screening test sera(11). Therefore, we concluded that colostrums en- riched with polyclonal specific antibody, could be the substitute solution to achieve a sufficient protection of calf against crypto- sporidiosis.
