Not Applicable It is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the [SF424 (R&R) Application Guide](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=12000),except where instructed to do otherwise (in this FOA or in a Notice from [NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts ](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/)). Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in [Section IV](#_Section_IV._Application_1). When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions. Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is issuing this FOA in response to the declared public health emergency issued by the Secretary, HHS, for the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This FOA provides an expedited funding mechanism to support Phase III of the [Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics - Underserved Populations](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-up) (RADx\u00ae-UP) initiative. These two-year, community-engaged research projects will focus on (1) the urgent need for social, ethical, and behavioral implications (SEBI) research to understand and reduce barriers to COVID-19 testing, as well as COVID-19 disparities that arise from barriers to testing among underserved and vulnerable populations, and (2) psychological and communication science interventions to improve uptake of testing and vaccination. Successful applications will pose novel and adaptable scientific questions to address disparities in access and uptake of COVID-19 tests using social and behavioral approaches. The Office of the Director (OD) is issuing this FOA to address the objectives described below. Key Definitions This FOA is applicable to those populations that are underserved as well as populations that are COVID-19 vulnerable due to medical, geographic, and social factors, as defined below (referred to as \"underserved and vulnerable\" elsewhere in this FOA): Underserved: NIH-designated populations with health disparities and/or other groups known to experience barriers to accessing needed health care services or have inadequate health care coverage. A full description can be found at [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/). COVID-19 medically and/or socially vulnerable populations: Residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities; community-dwelling older adults; individuals with intellectual, developmental, sensory, or physical disabilities, cognitive impairment or dementia, or communication disorders; homeless populations; individuals involved with the criminal or juvenile justice systems (incarcerated or under community supervision); individuals with medical comorbidities known to increase risk of severe COVID-19, including heart failure and related cardiovascular conditions, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, obesity, HIV/AIDS; pregnant and post-partum women; children and adolescents; individuals living in congregate housing such as shelters or residential treatment facilities; individuals in overcrowded housing; individuals with substance use disorders or serious mental illness; migrant and immigrant populations; residents of tribal lands or reservations; communities exposed to high rates of air pollution or other toxic exposures; and rural and remote communities. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Testing (also referred to as \"rapid testing\" or \"rapid diagnostic testing\" below): Rapid tests are molecular or antigen tests used to [diagnose](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics-euas) infection performed at or near the place where a specimen is collected, usually outside of a laboratory setting. In the context of COVID-19, these tests are diagnostic tests that provide results to patients within minutes. They might be used to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections in various settings, including at home, community health clinics, schools, the workplace, or other locations where the rapid determination of SARS-CoV-2 infection status could lead to the reduction of COVID-19 cases in the community. Point-of-Care Testing: Medical testing done at or near the point of care that involves performing a diagnostic test. For the purposes of this FOA it will be understood that the term \"rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing\" refers to the use of FDA Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) or Approved or Cleared tests for the specific, on-label purpose for which they were developed and authorized/approved/cleared. Background The Office of the Director (OD) is requesting applications for cooperative agreements (U01s) addressing the objectives described below. Projects supported via this FOA will be part of the [RADx\u00ae-UP initiative](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-up), for which the overarching goals are to understand and address COVID-19 morbidity and mortality disparities for those underserved and vulnerable populations that are disproportionately affected by, have the highest infection rates of, and/or are most at risk for adverse outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic. This opportunity will support SEBI research to understand and address barriers to COVID-19 testing, independently or in combination with vaccination and/or other mitigation strategies, among underserved and vulnerable populations. SEBI research projects should consider and address the complex and intersecting social, ethical, behavioral, communication, structural, environmental, historical, and policy-related barriers that lead to disparities in access to and uptake of COVID-19 testing in underserved and vulnerable populations. Even with the availability of vaccines and booster vaccinations, testing for the SARS CoV-2 virus will remain a critical aspect of pandemic control. It is also important to understand whether and how the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, and therapeutics affects the need for, and propensity to seek testing in both symptomatic and asymptomatic testing programs. Phase III projects should focus challenges to COVID-19 test access and uptake, including rapid tests that are diagnostic, performed at or near the place where a specimen is collected, generally outside of a laboratory setting and provide results within minutes. The influences of cultural beliefs, expectations, distrust, and communication preferences and strategies on willingness to complete testing, prior to and after gatherings in settings such as homes, public health departments, healthcare systems, universities, K-12 schools, early childcare settings, the workplace, concerts, sporting, religious or cultural events, and other social venues are also of interest. The RADx\u00ae-UP initiative is focused on testing-related scientific inquiries, although vaccination and other public health mitigation strategies may be examined as secondary aims and/or outcomes. FOA Goals Successful SEBI research projects will address the evolving challenges of the pandemic with a focus on understanding and addressing barriers to COVID-19 testing in underserved and vulnerable populations, as well as the secondary impacts of testing mandates combined with other mitigation measures. Psychological and communication science interventions to improve uptake of testing and vaccination are also of interest. Applications should inform the distribution, accessibility, acceptability, and use of COVID-19 testing resources, including, but not limited to, rapid tests administered in multiple settings, including outside of healthcare contexts (e.g., within homes, schools, and workplaces). Addressing the roles of interpersonal and structural racism and discrimination and other factors that may contribute to observed disparities is also important. Research is needed to examine institutional decisions, practices, and biases that can be modified to recognize and better meet communities' preferences and goals related to COVID-19 testing. These SEBI projects will build upon the work of [RADx-UP](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-up); the Community Engagement Alliance ( [CEAL](https://covid19community.nih.gov/)) Against COVID-19 Disparities; the Social, Behavioral, and Economic ( [SBE](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/social-behavioral-and-economic-sbe-research-covid-19-vulnerable-and-health-disparity)) Research on COVID-19 in Vulnerable and Health Disparity Populations Consortium initiative; and other NIH-supported COVID-19 focused projects. Successful applications will draw from initial research by funded RADx\u00ae-UP [projects](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs#radx-up) to optimize and implement testing, vaccination, and mitigation adherence programs and study the implementation of these programs in close partnership with state and local public health testing programs. This opportunity will complement the projects supported under a companion RADx\u00ae-UP funding opportunity ( [RFA-OD-22-006](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-22-006.html)) that will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of rapid testing strategies in multiple settings and community contexts. Key research questions include: Research Objectives: Research topics of interest focused on underserved and vulnerable populations include, but are not limited to, the following areas: Projects Administering COVID-19 Testing Applications to this SEBI FOA are not required to administer COVID-19 testing. However, any NIH SEBI project funded study that includes collection and/or testing of human biological specimens, either for diagnostic or research only purposes, must include the effective use of tests that are FDA approved/cleared or with emergency used authorization (EUA). \"Effective use\" indicates tests must be used for the specific, on-label purpose for which they were developed and authorized/approved/cleared (e.g., including serial administration of tests if part of the recommended approach) by the FDA. The term \"test\" covers any tests, laboratory procedures/process, measurements, or other applications, as well as those reagents, instruments, kits/devices, and systems used in the procedure, for the collection, preparation, and examination of human biological specimens. If testing is administered as a part of the study, projects should include verified testing as a study outcome (e.g., COVID-19 test completion measured objectively versus self-report). Please note that applications to this FOA whose primary aim is to conduct or administer COVID-19 testing and return results will be deemed non-responsive. Applicants interested in a project focused primarily on COVID-19 test implementation rather than SEBI barriers should consider applying to [RFA-OD-22-006](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-OD-22-006.html). Key project considerations are listed below: Design, Analysis, and Sample Size for Studies: RADx\u00ae-UP Phase III projects must demonstrate relevance of the scientific questions to COVID-19 testing among underserved and vulnerable populations. Projects should utilize rigorous research designs (e.g., randomized controlled trials, stepped wedge designs, multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) designs, pragmatic clinical trials, interrupted time series, dynamic wait list design, hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs, sequential multiple assignment trial (SMART) designs, and adaptive designs). Group and individual randomization may not be feasible in nor acceptable to participants in some community-engaged interventions among populations who experience health disparities or express research distrust. Applicants should use methods that are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. Projects must describe research strategies that will reflect the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Projects must also demonstrate the ability to recruit and retain an adequate number of participants within the specified target populations and include sample size and power calculations. Additional Requirements Testing: Data Collection, Sharing, and Coordination: Research Plan: Applications nonresponsive to terms of this FOA will not be considered.The following types of projects would generally not be appropriate and may be deemed non-responsive: Investigators planning to submit an application in response to this FOA are strongly encouraged to contact and discuss their proposed research/aims with Program staff listed on this FOA well in advance of the application receipt date to better determine appropriateness and interest. Applications are invited from investigators representing a wide range of disciplines, including but not limited to ethics, health disparities research, demography, health policy, health communication and communication science, implementation science, clinical care, home and community-based services, infectious disease, community-based participatory research, policy studies, public health, epidemiology, bioinformatics and health information sciences, and behavioral and social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, social work, anthropology, nursing, political science, economics, communication science). NIBIB Statement of Interest The NIBIB supports technology development and translation of new or redesigned medical technologies that can have a significant impact on healthcare access and health outcomes for health disparate populations. NIBIB funding of clinical trials will be in accordance with [NOT-EB-21-005](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-eb-21-005.html) \"NIBIB Guidance for Support of Clinical Trial Applications\".

Applications submitted to this emergency FOA will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by objective review that will be conducted by the Center for Scientific Review. For this particular announcement, note the following: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Overall Impact Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)?

A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official. Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/part_ii_subpart_b.htm) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159), including of note, but not limited to: If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions. Should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html) HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205and 2 CFR Part 200.206 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies. The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an \"assistance\" mechanism (rather than an \"acquisition\" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below. The Principal Investigator(s) will have the primary responsibility for: NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below: NIH will assign a Program Official (see below) and Project Scientist(s) to the award. The Project Scientist(s) will have substantial scientific involvement during the conduct of this activity, through technical assistance, advice, and coordination. The Project Scientists(s) will: Additionally, the NIH program official will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice. The Program Official will: Areas of Joint Responsibility include: Dispute Resolution: Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. It will have three members: a designee of the RADx\u00ae-UP consortium member chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual awardee. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the awardee's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16. 3. Reporting When multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.4.1_reporting.htm) The NIH Office of the Director plans to make awards using funds provided in the emergency supplemental appropriations for COVID-19 and coronavirus research: \"American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Public Law 117-2\". Funds awarded using appropriations provided by the \"American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Public Law 117-2\" will be issued in unique subaccounts in the HHS Payment Management System and will require separate financial reporting from any other funds awarded. Interim Reports In addition to the annual RPPR, recipients are required to submit an interim progress report every six months outlining key milestones that have been met. Recipients are also required to deposit data to the [CDCC](https://radx-up.org/) at regular intervals per established RADx-UP intervals. A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.6_closeout.htm). NIH FOAs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 45 CFR Part 75.301 and 2 CFR Part 200.301. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
