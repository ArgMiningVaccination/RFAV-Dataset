Rice, MS, RPh, CHESMind-body interventions utilize the mind's capacity to affect the body and its physiological responses. They thereby influence health. The response to stress(the \"fight or flight\" reaction) may be automatic, but recovery toward relaxedparameters (\"the relaxation response\") can be learned through self-regulationand the regular use of mind-body interventions. Many of these interventionsoriginate from Eastern healing practices. Western science has found some ofthem to be helpful as adjunct modalities in the treatment of disease, and theiruse is increasing. Mind-body medicine focuses on the communication between mind andbody and the powerful ways in whichemotional, mental, social, and spiritu-al factors can directly affect health.Western, or allopathic, medicine tendsto consider the scientific, or medical,model of medicine superior to mind-body therapies. It often has negatedthe fact that one's mind has any affecton the body. But in the last genera-tion, with the meeting of Eastern andWestern healing practices, we havecome to accept and understand thatmind and body are powerfully related. Between 1990 and 1997, the num- ber of patients using alternative prac-tices increased from 36 to 46%. 1 Quality clinical research has grownsteadily since 1970. The NationalCenter for Complementary andAlternative Medicine (NCCAM),founded in 1998 as part of theNational Institutes of Health, is now avital organization for disseminatinginformation and providing fundingoptions for complementary or alterna-tive medical research. Mind-body interventions include relaxation, imagery, biofeedback,meditation, hypnosis, tai chi, yoga,and others. They often help patientsexperience healing for their illnesses innew and different ways. A mind-body modality we often experience, many times unbeknownstto us, is the placebo response. It hap-pens even without our planning or effort. In scientific studies, it has beenshown to interfere with clinical out-comes. It is often looked upon as puz-zling or confusing and unfortunatelyhas thereby been undervalued. 2A positive placebo response typicallyimproves a patient's trust and hopefor an affirmative outcome. Mind-body therapies regard as essential an approach that acknowl-edges each person's capacity for self-knowledge and self-care. It empha-sizes the person's openness to partici-pate and his or her desire to succeed.It often has been said that mind-bodymedicine views illness not as an obsta-cle but as an opportunity for personalgrowth and transformation. Further training of medical health professionals is needed to improveunderstanding of the benefits of themind-body therapies. Likewise, practi-tioners of spirituality and mind-bodyinterventions need to be more appre-ciative of the successes that the scien-tific practice of medicine has madeavailable. Together, they can helpaugment clinical outcomes wheneverpossible. Dean Ornish, MD, a cardiologist and founder of the PreventiveMedicine Research Institute inSausalito, Calif., has done just that.He showed that comprehensivelifestyle changes (low-fat vegetariandiet, smoking cessation, stress-man-214 Diabetes Spectrum Volume 14, Number 4, 2001agement training, and moderate exer- cise) for patients with heart diseasecan actually reverse coronary heartdisease. 3 Table 1 lists many of the mind- body therapies and offers a briefdescription of their potential physio-logical benefits. How do these therapies work? What is the trigger? In many, if notall, methodologies, the basic dynamicfeature is the \"relaxation response.\"Herbert Benson, MD, of the Mind-Body Institute at 4coined the phrase \"relax- ation response\" after carrying outresearch on the effects of meditationin collaboration with national andinternational scholars. The relaxationresponse is a state in which the bodyslows down and heart rate, bloodpressure, and breathing slow down,facilitating the uptake of oxygen. The body achieves a sleep-like rest (analtered state of consciousness) in abrief period of time. Conversely, the stress response, or the \"fight or flight\" response, includesincreased levels of heart rate, breath-ing, blood pressure, blood glucose,and stress hormones. Excess stress-induced levels of adrenaline or corti-sol may damage the blood vessels andalso compromise the immune sys-tem. 5,6 Keeping excess stress hormones in check with relaxation may help stabi-lize glucose levels and at the sametime provide some protection for theheart. 3These are both very important issues for people with diabetes. Mind-body therapies work for some people, but they may not workfor everyone. Remember, we are deal-ing with two interdependent variables here, mind and body, which then haveto interact with all the other bodilyfunctions. It is not easy to design research methodologies that produce signifi-cant outcomes in such challenging sit-uations. Grant opportunities havebeen few compared to those availablefor drug research, reflecting the limit-ed profit potential of complementaryand alternative medicine research. Theremainder of this article describessome of the therapies that have beenresearched and published in peer-reviewed journals. As expected, thereare a variety of studies both with andwithout positive results regardingtheir effect on diabetes. Relaxation and Biofeedback-Assisted Relaxation Techniques Feelings of stress raise blood glucoselevels in people with diabetes. This isbecause of an increased productionof stress hormones, 7which reduces insulin action. In addition, patientsunder perceived stress may find thatcaring for their diabetes is less of apriority, leading to poor glycemiccontrol, which further exacerbates thesituation. It is therefore important for dia- betes health professionals to be awareof and to check with their patientsabout how stress may be affectingtheir lives. Health care professionalscan then offer advice specific to theirpatients' situation. Perhaps someadditional lifestyle changes could berecommended for stress reduction. Asnoted earlier, decreasing stress reac-tions may lead to better glucose con-trol and improvement in immune sys-tem function. Glucose management. With in- creased glycemic control, there isalways a risk for hypoglycemia. Whenin a relaxed state, the body metabo-lizes carbohydrate more efficiently,thereby lowering blood glucoselevels. 8,9Patients with type 1 diabetes may potentially develop hypoglycemiafollowing relaxation. 9,10Therefore, such patients should be told of thepossibility for low blood glucose lev-els after relaxation and instructed topromptly treat it as directed by theirhealth care professional. In published, peer-reviewed re- search studies featuring diabetes andblood glucose, the most commonalternative treatment is relaxationtraining or biofeedback-assisted relax-ation training.

O verview of Mind-Body Interventions Modality Description and potential physiological benefits Relaxation A state of altered consciousness, a slowing of breath and heart rate. Meditation A process of training one's mind to be attentive, to focus in a nonanalytical way, an attempt to refrain from rumi-nation, 4as in relaxation. Hypnosis The induction of trance states by therapeutic suggestion, a state of altered consciousness. Facilitates behavior andlifestyle changes, overcoming addictions. Imagery The formation of images in perception, thought, feeling, memory, and fantasy, all in the absence of sensory stim-ulants (seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting). Mayimprove immune function, speed surgical recovery. Visualization Active imagery to influence attitude, behavior, or physi- ological responses. Even faint intentional imagery ofthought activates the brain to release neurotransmittersto the corresponding neural and hormonal pathways. Autogenic Training Relaxation and self-hypnosis using a specific, tested sequence of wording. Aromatherapy Stimulation of the sense of smell to encourage relax- ation, well-being, or other physiological benefits. Biofeedback Adjustment of thinking processes and regulation of physiological functions with feedback from monitoringinstruments. Helps to control blood pressure, muscletension, heart rate, brain waves, and skin temperature. Psychotherapy Treatments ranging from simple listening to combina- tions of medication, counseling, and discussion, usingbehavioral/emotive approaches. Support Groups Group interventions that promote bonding and belong- ing, being understood, self-expression, learning, stressrelief, and longevity. Decreases anxiety and isolation. 35 Dance and Exercise Movement to improve self-esteem, facilitate attention, express anger, and develop a more positive body image. Yoga A system of developing discipline to achieve body pos- tures, control breathing, and reduce stress and stresshormones, thereby boosting the immune system. Music and Art Pursuits that help in developmental disabilities and are effective as an analgesic or relaxant.215 Diabetes Spectrum Volume 14, Number 4, 2001From Research to Practice /Complementary & Integrative Medicine trolled studies using biofeedback- assisted relaxation training with type1 diabetic patients showed significant-ly lower average blood glucose levelsin experimental groups or at post-testin the instance of case studies. 11-13 These differences could not beexplained by increased insulin doses. 11 It is suggested that stress managementbe considered as an adjunct to themedical management of people withtype 1 diabetes. In studies of patients with type 2 diabetes, no significant lowering ofglycemic levels were observed at post-test. 14,15However, with relaxation training, patients may have experi-enced other benefits, such as increasedself-management abilities, improvedsense of well-being, increased copingskills, lowered incidence of depres-sion, and less perceived stress. Somestudies have not been designed to pro-vide statistically significant results formore than one or two variables. Depression. Depression is a fre- quent comorbidity of chronic illnessand diabetes. 16People with diabetes who suffer from depression or anxietystruggle more to control their bloodglucose levels, even if they are taughtbiofeedback and relaxation tech-niques. A small, controlled study fol-lowed 18 insulin-dependent diabeticpatients with depression. 17Four weeks after the treatment ended, researchersfound little difference in the dailyblood glucose measurements betweenpatients who were taught to practicerelaxation at home and those whowere not. Depressed patients oftenhave difficulty executing the self-careactivities associated with diabetes. Theadditional demands of a relaxationtreatment plan may have been similar-ly difficult to follow. Blood circulation and healing. The autonomic nervous system is com-posed of the sympathetic branch(active in response to stress), and theparasympathetic branch (active duringrelaxation and digestion). Relaxation,or self-regulation of the sympatheticnervous system activity, can be accom-plished in various ways includinghand- and foot-warming. In a generalway, this may be thought of as quiet-ing the emotions. When relaxing, the sympathetic nervous system tone is lessened.Muscles relax\u2014not only the largeones, but also the musculature sur-rounding the capillary blood vessels.This relaxation allows a reduction inblood pressure and improved perfu-sion to the peripheral blood vessels, thereby increasing blood flow to theextremities. 18With the improved blood flow comes increased oxygena-tion and nutrition of the tissues. In the studies of Rice et al., 19,20 this hypothesis was proven valid. A within-subjects design study of 40 peoplewith diabetes 19demonstrated that sub- jects responded positively to thermalbiofeedback-assisted relaxation byincreasing peripheral vasodilation.This increased blood flow by an aver-age change score of 22.5% (blood vol-ume pulse [BVP] measured with pho-toplethysmography). Change scoreswere expressed as a percentage of theoptimal change score, the optimalvalue used was 98.6 /H11034Fahrenheit. The average increased toe temperaturechange score was 31.4%, ( P< 0.001). A multi-center, controlled clinical trial of patients with chronic non-healing foot ulcers 20produced signifi- cant results in healing. Of participantsin the experimental group who weretaught thermal biofeedback-assistedrelaxation (increased blood flow tothe feet), 14 out of the 16 ulcers, or87.5%, healed. In the control group,7 out of 16 ulcers, 43.75%, healed(P< Diabetic periph- eral neuropathy sensorynerves in the feet with pain and, later,with loss of feeling. The additionaloxygenation and available nutrients tothe tissues following the effects ofrelaxation provide improved sensoryfunction in the nerve fibers that corre-spond to touch. 20This was shown by measuring the Current PerceptionThreshold (CPT) levels by electricalstimulation of the great toe. Thechange in CPT levels pre- to post-intervention indicated a significantdifference between the experimentaland control groups. A significantimprovement (increased sensation inthe feet) was noted in the large myeli-nated nerve fiber functioning in theexperimental groups, which usedbiofeedback-assisted relaxation, com-pared to the control groups who didnot (P< 0.02). In another study by Fiero et al., 21it was suggested that diabetic neuropa-thy might interfere with the ability toself-regulate peripheral temperatureand that assessing neuropathic statusmay be important before prescribingthermal biofeedback. On the other hand, in mind-body therapies, \"think-ing of warmth\" may surpass or bemore accurate than \"feeling warmth.\" The beneficial effects of thermal biofeedback-assisted relaxation several addi-tional vascular disorders, includinghypertension, 22migraine,23and Raynaud's syndrome.24 Claudication. This is a disease process involving inadequate periph-eral blood flow. Thermal biofeedbackhas been tested as a therapy toimprove vascular flow and walkingtolerance in patients with peripheralvascular disease. 25Improvements were seen in ankle-brachial index, walkingdistance, walking and stairclimbing. Thermal biofeedback pro-vided an improved vascular andambulatory function for a diabeticpatient with claudication. 25 Another case study of a patient with diabetes reported that attacks ofintermittent claudication were reducedto zero after 12 sessions of thermalbiofeedback. The patient's daily walk-ing distance increased by about a mileover the course of the treatment. 26 Thus, it appears that thermal biofeed-back and autogenic training are poten-tially promising therapies for peoplewith diabetes and peripheral vasculardisease. Hypnosis This modality has been used to helppeople with eating disorders and thosein need of assistance with smokingcessation and other lifestyle changes. 27 Adolescents with type 1 diabetes havebeen reported to have a nonadherencerate of ~20% to andother self-care behaviors. 28In a hyp- nosis study,28six adolescents served as their own controls, and no changeswere made in insulin, diet, or exercisefor 6 months. Then hypnosis, admin-istered individually, was added withall of the 6months. Posttreatment tests showedthat HbA average fastingblood glucose (FBG) dropped from426 to 149 mg/dl. Yoga In yoga, people with diabetes mayhave found an important \"new\" toolthat is thousands of years old.Research has shown Hatha yoga(physical movements and postures)and meditation to be excellent exam-ples of the mind-body connection at216 Diabetes Spectrum Volume 14, Number 4, 2001work. Yoga may provide real benefits in stabilizing blood glucose.29If done properly, yoga also counts as an aero-bic exercise. Jain and associates 30studied the response patterns of people with type2 diabetes to yoga therapy. Theirstudy showed 70% of participants tohave a fair to good response to yogatherapy. After 40 days of yoga, therewas a significant reduction in hyper-glycemia measured by FBG and oralglucose tolerance test. It has been sug-gested that yoga, a simple and eco-nomical therapy, might be considereda beneficial adjunctive and self-admin-istered therapy to medical treatment. Regular practice is the most important variable with all these mind-body thera-pies. They are all inherently noninvasive,inexpensive, and safe. Furthermore,many studies have noted that patientsusing them experience secondary bene-fits, such as an increased ability to copewith daily stressors, adherence to pre-scribed treatments, increased ambulation,and positive outlook on life. 13,31-34 Strategies for Including Mind-BodyTherapiesEducational interventions are differentfrom drug therapy and other medicalinterventions in that patients mustaccept a much greater personal respon-sibility for the conduct and success ofthese treatments. Most of the mind-body therapies involve patient educa-tion, supervised practice, and regularpractice at home. Both educator and patient are the beneficiaries of the lifestyle changesand positive attitudes resulting fromthe mind-body interventions. In addi-tion to providing the education andteaching the techniques, the thera-pist/educators serve as mentors andhuman connections to the modality,providing hope and encouragementfor patients. Instruction and super-vised practice of mind-body skills canbe conducted individually or in groupsettings, which can provide thestrength of community. 35 Diabetes educators and other health care professionals have been atthe forefront of including provenmind-body therapies in their practices.Continuing education courses and cer-tifications in mind-body interventionsare available for health care profes-sionals who want to become familiarwith mind-body skills and learn howto instruct patients in these therapies.Table 2 offers a list of resources forreference and training. Practitioners and providers who want to incorporate mind-bodyinterventions may need to educatetheir hospital and clinic administra-tors about these therapies. Theyneed to see and be convinced bypositive results when mind-bodytherapies are used in clinical appli-cations. These therapies could bemade available to their patients.Mindfulness meditation 36as a form of stress management therapy hasmade inroads in many health sys-tems.For insurance companies, covering mind-body therapies can be financiallybeneficial because these therapies arecost-effective, nonpharmacological,noninvasive, and safe. Naparstek 37 and Rice et al.20have shown how relaxation and imagery have increasedhealing in clinical application.Educated clients become more preven-tion-oriented and stay healthier.
