A lithotherapy session with us might just be what you need to restore balance to the flow of energy through your meridian energy channels. Here's what you should know about the history of lithotherapy and the use of stones for functional medicine. What is Lithotherapy? Lithotherapy is the practice of using crystals and stones as a method of healing therapy. Evidence of the use of stones to heal can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece and Rome. During the Middle Ages, minerals and gemstones played a significant role in medicine and were frequently used and prescribed by physicians. It is believed that each stone was thought to possess different curative properties and could aid in everything from pregnancy and childbirth to indigestion and animal bites. Today, lithotherapy is considered a form of functional medicine and is more commonly referred to as crystal healing. We provide patients with highly personalized, non-invasive lithotherapy sessions where the energy and color of stones are used to remove energy blockages in order to restore balance to the body's meridian energy channels. What Are the Benefits of Lithotherapy? Lithotherapy is beneficial for healing many types of energy blockages in your body. Although no scientific evidence currently exists to support the benefits of crystal healing, there is evidence to support positive placebo effects in practitioners. Depending on the types of minerals and crystals used, lithotherapy session may also help to: - Reduce stress and decrease anxiety levels - Promoting emotional wellbeing - Improve sleep - Enhance intuition - Increase red blood cell count - Increase confidence There are hundreds of minerals and crystals that can be used in a single lithotherapy session. Popular stones used in lithotherapy include quartz, malachite, amethyst, citrine, lapis lazuli, obsidian, rose quartz, turquoise, tourmaline, and tiger's eye. What to Expect During a Lithotherapy Session Each lithotherapy session is highly individualized and will differ not just from one patient to the next, but among practitioners as well. Some may ask you to select crystals you are naturally attracted to, indicating that your body is intuitively connected to its healing needs. Recommend ways of using lithotherapy include: - Guided meditation holding crystals or having them placed on your body's blocked energy points - Sleeping with crystals under your pillow to absorb their healing properties - Using crystal-infused foods and beauty products For more information about our lithotherapy sessions, contact Panhandle Counseling and Health Center "}
