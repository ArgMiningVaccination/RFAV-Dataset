The controls will allow practices to order 50 doses per week (5 packs) initially. We will be monitoring the situation on a daily basis and as soon as we are in receipt of sufficient quantities of vaccine we will lift the restriction. Further updates will be published In Vaccine Update and on the ImmForm news item. Shelf life of Fluenz Tetra Fluenz Tetra is a live attenuated vaccine and as such has a very short shelf life. Please bear this in mind when ordering. You may place an order every week but should not order more than you will need for the following week or two. This is to minimise vaccine wastage due to the vaccine passing its expiry date before it can be administered to patients (unused vaccine cannot be returned). Subsequent deliveries of vaccine will have later expiry dates.2 Vaccine update: Issue 219, September 2014 Vaccine update subscriptions: Click here Vaccine ordering and supply enquiries: vaccinesupply@phe.gov.ukVaccines available PHE has centrally procured flu vaccine for those children who are included in this year's phase of the programme and those children aged from six months to less than 18 years old in clinical risk groups.
