Among fatalities from the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) were the Chief of the Department, First Deputy Commissioner , Chief of Special Operations, and one of the Department's Chaplains. TheWorldTradeCenterdisasterrepresentsthelargestlossoffirefighters inasingle inci- dent in the United States since 1947, when 27 firefighters perished in fires and explosions aboard two Texas City ships. Accordi ng to Harold Schaitberger, presi dent of the International Associ ation of Fire Fighters, ''This was the darkest day in the history of the firefighters of the world. It will change every one of our lives forever .'' The men and women of America's fire service who responded to these attacks have brought honor upon themselves and the entire fire service community through their heroic actions and commitme nt to duty. For those that made the supreme sacrifice in the course of their actions, may their souls rest in peace. This report is dedicated to the familie s of all firefighters who have died while on duty. Through the lessons learned from their passi ng, it is hoped t hat future lives will be saved. vii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study of firefighter fatalities would not have been possible without the cooperation and assistance of many members of the fire service throughout the United States. Addition - ally, the staffs of the Nationa l Fallen Firefighte rs' Founda tion cer's program, and Nationa l Fire Protection Association (NFPA) provide d data and othe r information that were invaluable in the preparation of this report. We thank them for their contributions to this project. TriData Corporation conducted this analysis under contract EME-2000-DO-0396 for FEMA , USFA. viii EXECUTI VE SUMMARY Each year in the United States and its protectorates, approxima tely 100 firefighters are killed while on duty and tens of thousands are injured. Although the number of firefighter fatalities has steadily decreased over the past 20 years, the incidence of firefighter fatalities per 100,000 incidents has actually risen over the last 5 years, with 1999 having the highest rate of firefighter fatalities per 100,000 incidents since 1978. Introduction and Objectives In the last decade, several high-profile incidents involving firefighter fatalities have brought national attention to the issue of firefighter mortality in the United States. While the attention fromthenationa lmediahasbeenfleeting, theawareness ofthecontinued high level of fatalities has changed the fabric of the fire service and prompte d many organizations and fire departments to initiate programs to protect firefighters. This analysis sought to identify trends in mortality and examine relationships among data elements. To this end, data were collect ed on firefighter fatalities between 1990 and 2000. (For further information, see the \"Met hodology\" section or the Appendix.) Using this analysis, better targeted prevention strategies can be developed in keeping with the USFA's goal to reduce firefighter deaths 25 percent by 2005. In contrast to the annual USFA fire- fighter fatality reports, this analysis allowe d for compa risons over time to determine any changes in firefighte r mortality, with a depth of scrutiny not pr esent in earlier analyses. Ultima tely, some forces and circumsta nces that lead to firefighter fatalities are simply beyond human control. However , through resear ch, study, training, improved operations, development useofstaffing,andother itshould be possible to signif icantly reduce the numbe r of firefighte rs killed each year. Findings Nature ofFatalInjury \u2014Theleadingnatureoffatalinjuriestofirefightersisheart attack (44 percent ); traum a, including internal and head injuries, is the second leading type of fatal injury at27percent. Asphyxia andburns combined account for20percent offatalities. More firefighters die from trauma than from asphyxiation and burns combined. Firefighters under the age of 35 are more likely to be killed by traumatic injuries1 than they are to die of medical causes (e.g., heart attack, stroke). After age 35, the proportion of deaths duetotraumatic injuries decreases, andtheproportion ofdeaths duetomedical causes rises steadily. 1Traumatic injury means a wound or the condition of the body caused by external force, including injuries inflicted by bullets, explosives, sharp instrument s, blunt objects or other phys ical blows, chemi cals, electric- ity, climatic conditions, infectio us diseases, radiation, and bacteria, but excluding stress and strain [Ref. 1]. 1 Age\u2014Appr oxima tely 60 percent of firefighte r fatalities were over the age of 40 when theywerekilled,andone-thirdwereover50.Nationa lly,firefighte rsovertheageof40com- prise 46 percent of the fire servi ce, with those over 50 accounting for only 16 percent of fire- fighters. Although older firefighters posse ss a wealth of invaluable knowledge and experi - ence, they are killed while on duty at a rate dispr oportionate to their representation in the fire service. Also, these older firefighters tend to be affiliated with volunteer agencies. About 40 percent ofvolunteer firefighters areover theageof50,compared toonly25percent ofcareer firefighters. Affiliation\u2014 The majority of firefighter fatalities (57 percent) were members of local or municipal volunteer fire agenci es (including combination depart ments, which are com- prised of both career and volunteer personnel). Full-time career personnel account for 33 percent of firefighte r fatalities; they compr ise only approxima tely 26 percent of the Ame ri- canfireservice. Numerically morevolunteer firefighters arekilled thancareer personnel, yet career personnel representation inthefireservice. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Fatalitie s\u2014In many fire departments, EMS calls account for between 50 and 80 percent of emergency call volume. These incidents result in only 3 percent of firefighter fatalities. Trauma (internal/head) accounts for the deaths of 50 percent of firefighters who were involved in EMS operations at the time of their fatal injury; another 38 percent involved in EMS operations died from heart attacks. Type of Duty\u2014 Of those firefighte rs killed while en route to an incident, 85 percent were volunte ers. For firefighte rs killed performing in-station dutie s, 69 percent were career per- sonnel; the majority of those deaths were the result of heart attacks. These variations can be attributed to differences between career and volunteer agenci es. General ly, unless they are on a call or other fire department business, career personnel are required to be in the fire sta- tion for the duration of their shift, which is generally between 10 and 24 hours long. As a result, volunteers are more likely than career firefighters to die while responding. Motor Vehicle Collisions (MVCs) \u2014Since 1984, MVCs have accounted for between 20 and 25 percent of firefighter fatalities annua lly. One quarter of firefighters who died in MVCs werekilledinprivate/personallyowne dvehicles(POVs) .Following POVs, theappa- ratus most often involved in fatal collisions were tankers, engines/pumpers, and airplanes. More firefighters are killed in tanker collisions than in engine s and ladders combine d. About 27percent offatalities killed inMVCs wereejected from atthetime of the collision; only 21 percent of firefighte rs were reportedly wearing their seatbelts prior to the collision. Most volunteer departments donotrequire personnel tostand byinthefirestation; mem - bers are allowed to respond directly to incide nts from their homes or workplaces, often in theirPOVs. Asaresult,volunte ersaremorelikelythancareerfirefighte rstobekilledinPOV collisions. Moreover , they are more likely to be involved in collisions involving tankers, which are predominantly used in rural areas without hydrants or other readily available sources of water. Such areas are almost exclusively protected by volunteer fire depart ments. 2 Training\u2014 In the last decade, approximately 6 percen t of firefighter fatalities occurred during training activities, a larger proportion than in the previous decade. Over time, the leading typeoftraining activity resulting infatalities hasremained physical fitness, followed by equipme nt/apparatus drills and live fire exercises. Multiple Firefighter Fatality Incidents\u2014Between 1990 and 2000, 8 percent of fatal incidents involved the death of more than one firefighter; these incidents accounted for 18 percent of firefighter fatalitie s. About 14 percent of firefight ers were killed in incidents that resulted in the deaths of two or three firefight ers. Incidents involving the death of more than four firefighters are rare, and accounted for only 3 percent of fatalities. These findings repre - sent an increase from an earlier USFA study that found that between 1982 and 1991, only 4 percent of incidents involved the death of more than one firefighter; those incidents accounted for 13 percent of firefighter fatalities. Appr oxima tely 90 percent of firefighte rs ies.Incontrast,only 37percentofthose killedinsingle- circumstances thatleadtothedeaths offirefighters aresimply beyond human con- trol. Generally, howe ver, most firefighte r fatalities are the result of a chain of events, whic h, if detected early, has the potential be broken and prevent many, or even most, fatalities. Prevention strategies discussed include increased emphasis on physical fitness, dietary changes, behavior modificati on, changes in operational strategies and tactics, and more stringent adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs). Resources areavailablefrom avarietyoffederal ,state,local, andprivate agencies. Infor - mation and contacts are included for specific programs designed for fire departments that experience a firefighte r fatality and the firefighter's surviving family. 3 INTRODUCTI ON The deaths of firefighters profoundly affect not only the families they leave behind, but alsothecommunitie sinwhichtheylived,thefirefighterswithwhom theyserved,andthefire service as a whole . Each year in the United States and its protectorates, approxima tely 100 firefighters are killed while on duty and tens of thousands are injured. As depicted in Figure 1, the incidence of firefighter fatalities has trended downwa rd (38 percent) over the past 25 years, from a high of 171 in 1978 to a low of 77 in 1992. 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 157 171 125 138 135 126 113 119 127 120 131 136 117 107 108 77 81 105 102 98 99 93 112 103 Sample size: 2,800 Sour ce: USFA. Figure 1. Trend in Firefighte r Fatalitie s (1977-2000) The number of firefighter fatalities annually differs slightly depending on the criteria used to define an on-duty fatality. It is possible that a firefighter fatality could be declared eligible as an on-duty death some years after the firefighte r's injur y. As a result, it is not uncommon tofindfluctuations offrom onetofivefatalities annually ,depending onthemeth- odology used to compile the report. In the last decade, several high-profile incidents involving firefighter fatalities have brought national attention to the issue of firefighter mortality in the United States (e.g., six firefighters killed in Worcester , Massachuse tts, in 1999 and 14 killed at Storm King Moun - tain, C olorado, in 1994). Also, the events of 9/11 have dramatically highlighted the heroic activitie s of the Unite d States' fire service community . A growing awareness of the contin - ued level of fatalities has changed the fabric of the fire service and prompte d many fire departments and fire service organizations to initia te programs to protect firefighters. Fire departments throughout the country are adjusting their tactics to promote firefighter safety and reduce firefighter deaths and injuries. One such adjustme nt is the standbyout- sideofastructureandaredeploye dimme diatelytoinitiatearescueattemptafterafirefighte r calls help or is declared missing.) Also to reduce firefighte r mortality, organizations such as the Internationa l Association ofFireFighters (IAFF), International Associa tionofFireChiefs (IAFC), National Volunteer Fatalitie s 5 Fire Council (NVFC), and the United States Fire Administr ation (USFA) have begun to developadditiona lprogramsornewinitia tivesintendedtopromote firefighterhealth,safety, and well being. Similarly , efforts are underway to develop training programs to teach fire- fighters how to rescue themselves and their fellow firefighters in the event they become trapped or disor iented in a fire. Ultimately , through research, study, training, improved operations, development of new technologies, the appropriate use of staffing, and other factors, it should be possible to sub- stantially reduce the number of firefighters killed each year. Goals and Objectives This analysis sought to identify trends in mortality , examine relationships among data elements, and aid in targeting prevent ion strategies for the USFA's goal to reduce firefighter deaths 25 percent by the year 2005 [Ref. 2]. In contrast to the annual USFA firefighter fatality reports, this analysis allowed for com- parisons over time to determine any changes in firefighte r mortality, with a depth of scrutiny not present in earl ier analyses. Exam ples of questions explored included: S Given the increase in emergency medical servi ces (EMS ) call volume over the past 20 years, has the numbe r of firefighte r fatalities associated with EMS calls also increased? S Has the introduction of technologies such as PASS devices and integrated PASS/ SCBA affected the trends in firefighter deaths? Examples of relationships in the data explor ed in this analysis include changes to death rates (or the magnitude of deaths) due to enha ncem ents such as Self-Contained Breathing Apparat us (SCBA) or Personal Alert Safety System (PASS). The analysis also consi dered patterns in the deaths of career vs. volunteer firefighters and the relationship among age and gender and the cause of firefighter deaths. The report includes a \"Resources\" section for fire depart ment reference in the event of a firefighter fatality and for firefighters' surviving spouses and children. These benefits are available through federal, state, local, and private sources, including labor organizations. The goal is to provide the fire service with resources for developing a plan to deal with on- duty fatalities as well as an understanding of what is available and where to turn for help fol- lowing the death of a firefighter. Future Analy ses\u2014Analysis provides abroad perspective onhis- torical trends in firefighter fatalities; howe ver, there are some areas where the data are not currently available to perform quality analyses. For example, in 1999 the Occupational Safety and Health Administr ation (OSHA) revised its standard on respiratory protection injuries and deaths. 6 As the database is expanded and updated, it should become possible to more clearly determine the effects of these changes and trends in the fire service. These issues will be addressed by f uture USFA publications. 7 METHODOLOGY Data Sources The report is based on data from a number of sources. The primary sources are USFA files from the National Fire Data Center (NFDC ), the National Fallen Firefighters' Founda - the Public Safety Officer's Benefit (PSOB) program. The NFDC describes the nation's fire problem , proposes possible solutions and national priorities, monitors resulting programs, andprovides information tothepublic andfireorga- nizations. The NFDC files contain detailed lists of firefighter fatalities, individua l files on some fatalities, andannual reports with summary dataforfirefighter fatalities inagiven year. Although theNFDC filesareextensive, theyarenotcomplete; notallfirefighter fatalities are enumerated and files contain varying levels of information. In particular, information on firefighter fatalities intheearly partofthe1990s issparse; thelevel ofdetail of the decade. TheNFFFcollectsdataonfirefighte rfatalitiestodetermine ifthefatalitymeetsthecrite- ria for inclusion on the Nationa l Fallen Firefighte r's Memorial at the Nationa l Emergency Training Center (NETC) in Emmitsbur g, Maryland. Eligible firefighters include those who meet PSOB guidelines (whether or not the firefighter's next of kin complete the application process) or deaths from injuries, heart attacks, or illnesses directly attributa ble to a specific emer gency incident or training activity . Private firefighters such as those in industrial bri- gades are included, provide d the deaths meet certain standards. Some types of fatalities are excluded (e.g., deaths attributable to suicid e, alcohol, or substance abuse). These excluded cases account for a very small fraction of firefighter fatalities.2 Files maintained by the PSOB program provi ded significant source of informa - tiononfirefighte rfatalities.ThePSOB programisadministe redbytheDepartmentofJustic e and provides a monetary benefit to the survi vors of a public safety officer who dies while on duty. Public safety officers are defined as career (full time) or volunte er (part time) firefight- ers, law enforcem ent officers, and emergency medical workers. To qualify for benefi ts, the circumstances surrounding the death must be traumatic in nature (e.g., smoke inhalation, structural collapse, motor vehicle collisi on,gunshot wound). Deaths thatarenontraumatic in nature (e.g., heart attacks, strokes) do not generally qualify for the PSOB benefit. To process aclaim,PSOB requirestheofficer'ssurviving family andemploye rtosubmit certifieddocu- ments supporting their applicati on. Required documents that were collected for this report include adetailed description ofthecircumst ances surrounding theofficer's ehensive for traumatic firefighter fatalities; howe ver, contain extremely limited information regardi ng nontraumatic fatalities. 2Thes e eligibility requirements were determined at a meeting on June 18, 1997, which included repres enta- tivesfrom themajorfireserviceorganizationswhounani mous lyagreed 1997. 9 Summaries ofeach fatal incident from 1994-2000 were considered intheanalysis. How - ever, given their collective length, they were not included in the text of the report. Rather , they will be made available on the Internet by the USFA at http://www .usfa.fema.gov . Othe r sources of data included trade journals, news reports, fatality investigations by the Nationa lInstitute forOccupationa lSafetyandHealth(NIOSH),journalarticles,andInternet sites. ,relational fire- fighter fatality database. The database compr ises seven tables. For further information, see the Appendix. Inclusion Criteria Firefighter fatalities whose injuries occurred between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2000, in the 50 states, District of Columbia , or U.S. protectorat es were included in the database and the analysis. The following definitions delineate who qualifies as a firefighter and w hat constitute s an on-duty fatality. Who Is a Firefighter? For the purpose of this study, the term firefighte r covers all members of organized fire departments in all states, the Distr ict of Columbia , and the territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Commonwe alth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Included are career and volunteer firefighters; full-time public safety officers acting as fire- fighters; state, territory , and federal governme nt fire service personnel, including wildland firefighters and the milita ry; and privately employe d firefighte rs, including employe es of contract fire departments and trained members of industrial fire brigades, whether full time orparttime. Italsoincludes contract personnel working asfirefighters orassigned toworkin direct support of fire service organizations. The study includes not only local and municipa l firefighters, but also seasonal and full- time employe es of the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of IndianAffairs,theBureauofFishandWildlif e,theNationa lParkService,andstatewildla nd agencies.Thedefinition alsoincludesprisoninmatesserving onfirefighting crews,firefight- ers employed by other governmental agencies such as the Department of Energy, military personnel performing assigned fire suppression activities, and civilian firefighters working at milita ry insta llations. What Constitute s an On-Duty Fatality? On-duty fatalities include any injury or illness sustained while on duty that proves fatal. Theterm onduty refers toinvolvement inoperations atthescene ofanemergency ,whether it is a fire or nonfire incident; being en route to or returning from an incident; performing other officially assigned duties suchastraining, maintenance,public education, inspection, inves - tigations, court testimony , and fundraising; and being on call, under orders, or on standby duty, except at the individual's home or place of business. 10 These fatalities mayoccur onthefireground, intraining, while responding toorreturning from alarms, or while performing other duties that support fire service operations. A fatality may be caused directly by accident or injury, or it may be attributed to an occupat ional- related fatal illness. A common example of a fatal illness incurred on duty is a heart attack. Fatalities attribute d to occupationa l illnesses also include a communic able disease con- tracted while onduty thatproved fatal,wherethedisease could beattributed toadocumented occupational exposure. Accidents that claim the lives of on-duty firefighters are also included in the analysis, whether or not they are directly related to emergency incidents. Injuries and illnesses are included where death is considerably delayed after the original incident. When the incident and the death occur in different years, the analysis counts the fatality as having occurred in the year that the incident occurred. It is difficult to identify an occupationa l illness as a causal factor in particular firefighter fatalities because of the limitations in the ability to track the exposure of firefighters to toxic hazards, the often delayed long-term effects of such exposures, and the exposures firefight - ers may recei ve whi le off duty. Comple This analysisisbasedonascomple teacensus ofon-duty firefighte rfatalitiesascould be constructed for the 1990s. With any census, there will likely be an undercount. Despite sig- nificant research, it is not possi ble to claim with 100 percent assurance that all eligible fire- fighters are included in the analysis. In some cases, firefighte rs killed while on duty are not reported totheUSFAnordotheir survivors applyforPSOBbenefi ts.These cases areconsid- ered to be rare, so the potential undercount shoul d be minuscule. Thus, this census should be consi dered as complete as possi ble. Adjustment s for Unknowns Some desired information was either unavailable or reported as \"unknown\" on the reports associated with each fatality . To compensate for this problem, the report cites \"adjusted percentages\" or percentage of valid responses or entries. The unknown items are assumed tobeinthesame proportion asthose withknown characteristics. This methodology is used by the USFA and other analysis organizations analyzing fire data. Tables and graphs note both the sample size of the valid entries and the \"unknown\" or unavailable entries. 11 FINDINGS This section presents a statistical summary of the principal analyses undertaken in this study . Aggregate data are presented for most data elements; where possible , the information is presented graphically for clarity . Since this study sought to identify trends over time, mul\u00ad tiyear data are also presented. In some instances, compa risons to previous firefighter fatality studie s by the USFA and Nationa l Fire Protection Association (NFPA) are included. Trend in Firefighter Fatalities The incidence of firefighter fatalities has declined signif icantly over a long-term period, as shown in Figure 2. The number of fatalitie s annually has fluctuated from a high of 171 in 1978 toalowof77in1992; overall, since 1977, firefighter fatalities have trended downward 38 percent. 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 157 171 125 138 135 126 113 119 127 120 131 136 117 107 108 77 81 105 102 98 99 93 112 103 Sample size: 2,800 Source: USFA. Figure 2. Firefighte r Fatalitie s (1977-2000) During the 11-year study period, 1,085 firefight ers lost their lives while on duty. (As dis\u00ad cussed on page 4, this number differs slightly depending on the source of the data and the criteria used to define an on-duty fatality.) Despite the overall decline in firefighte r fatalities since 1977 and a sharp decline in firefighter fatalities between 1991 and 1992, the incidence of on-duty firefighter fatalities has trended upward 7 percent since 1990. Type of Incident Figur e 3 illustr ates the types of incidents that results in firefighter fatalities during the study period.

By sharp constrast, the trend in fire incidence declined 15 percent over the study period [Ref. 3]. Affiliation of Firefighter Fatalities and Type of Agency Figur e 5 illustr ates the distribution of firefighte r fatalities by affiliation.

Further , career departments protect more of the U.S. population than do volunteer agenci es (59 percent vs. 41 percent ), which also affects the volume and types of calls to which personnel respond [Ref. 4].

Emergenc y vs. Non-Emergency Duty (1990-2000) Training\u2014 Since 1990, approximately 6 percent of firefighter fatalities occurred during training activities, a larger propor tion than in the previous decade.4 Over time, the leading type of training activity resulting in fatalitie s has remained physical fitness, followed by apparatus/equipme nt drills and live-fire exercises. During training activitie s, the leading nature of fatal injury is heart attack (54 percent), followed by trauma (31 percent). Figure 15 groups training fatalities by type of training activity . The high incidence of deaths during physical oflive-fireexercises Motor Vehicle Collisions Since 1984, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) have accounted forbetween 20and25per\u00ad cent of firefighter fatalities annually [Ref. 7]. During the study period, MVCs accounted for 22 percent of firefighte r fatalities. One quarter of firefighters who died in MVCs were killed in private/personally owned vehicles (POVs) (Figure 16). Following POVs, the apparatus most often involved in fatal collisions were tankers, engines/pumpers, and airplanes.

Most volunteer departments do not require personnel to stand by in the fire station. Rather , members are allowed to respond direc tly to incidents from their homes or work - places, often in their POVs. As a result, volunteers are more likely than career firefighters to be killed in POV collisions. Moreover , they are more likely to be involved in collisions involving tankers, which are predominantly used in rural areas without hydrants or other readi ly available sources of water. Such areas are almost exclusively protected by volunteer fire departments. Tankers that are overloaded or whose tanks lack proper baffling can be unstable, making them more difficult to control. The shifting of water in the tank, even at low speeds, can dra\u00ad matically affect the ability of the apparatus operator to control the vehicle. Water weighs approximately 8.4 pounds per gallon. An average tanker holds between 2,000 and 3,000 gal\u00ad lons of water , which adds between 16,800 and 22 30 25,200 pounds to the weight of vehicle. The inci\u00ad dence of tanker collisions is an area that merits further investigation. Figure 17 shows the locations of firefighters in the vehicle prior to the fatal collision.

The leading cause, overexertion/str ain, is consiste nt with the high incidence of deaths from heart attacks (dis\u00ad cussed later in this chapter) and accounts for nearly half of firefighter deaths. Other leading causes of firefighter injuries are being trappe d, caught, or lost in a structure; fire apparatus collisions; and being struck by an object (e.g., vehicle, apparatus, falling debris in a struc\u00ad ture).

Imme diate Cause of Fatal Injury (1990-2000) These are only the imme diate causes of injury; there is almost always a chain of events that leads to fatalities. For example , the reason a firefighter gets trapped and dies may be because of a lack of adequat e situational awareness by the incident commander, a danger \u00ad ously weakened structure that went undetect ed, the lack of a way to find the trapped fire\u00ad fighter quickly enough, ashiftinwind conditions onawildland fire,orpoor judgment onrisk taking. The leading nature of fatal injuries to firefighters is heart attack (44 percent ), as shown in Figure 19. Trauma, including internal and head injuries, is the second leading type of fatal injury at27percent. Asphyxia andburns combined account for20percent offatalities. Thus, more firefighters die from trauma than from asphyxiation and burns combined. 23 Cardiac Arrest/Heart Attack Trauma Asph yxiation Burns/Asph ysiation Burns Electric Shock Drowning Stroke/CVA Other Medical Other Cardiac Gunshot 43.9 27.0 11.3 4.5 3.9 1.8 1.8 1.3 1.3 0.8 0.8 Sample size: 1,085 Valid entries: 1,075 Invalid entries: 10 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 Percent Figure 19.

Fixed Property Use of Incide nt Where Injury Occurre d (1990-2000) Of those firefighte rs killed while en route to an incident (179 cases), 85 percent were volunte ers. Howe ver, for firefighte rs killed performing in-station dutie s, 69 percent were career personnel; the majority of those deaths were the result of heart attacks. These varia \u00ad tions can be attributed to differences between career and volunteer agenci es. General ly, unless they are on a call or other fire departme nt business, career personnel are required to be in the fire station for the duration of their shift, which is generally between 10 and 24 hours long. Volunteers, on the other hand, are not usually required to stand by at the station, so they canrespond from theirhomes orplaces ofwork. Asaresult, career personnel aremore likely than volunte ers to die in a fire station. For other property types, the ratio of volunte er to career firefighter fatalities is approxi\u00ad mately equal. As would be expected, wildland, contract, and inmate firefighters who are killed a re outdoors (including those in aerial missions).

Other leading causes of fatal fires include electrical distribution, natural, and open flame. For civilian fire casual- ties, the leading causes of fatal fires are sm oking, arson, and heating [Ref. 8]. Expla nations forthedifferencesincauseassociatedwithfirefightervs.civilia nfirefatal- ities are varied. For example, in arson fires, the use of accelerants contributes to rapid fire spread and growt h and can lead to a fire that causes substantial structural damage in a short amount of time. Moreover , since they may not be detected and reported for some time after being set, arson fires may have the opportunity to advance more than other types of fires before the arrival of the fire department.

The relationship between fire cause and the incidence of firefighte r fatalities is an area that merits further research. Geographical Distribution of Firefighter Fatalities Generally,firefighte rfatalitiesareassociatedwiththestatewheretheiragencyislocated. Table 5 illustr ates the incidence of firefighte r fatalities by state and compa res the incidence of fatalities per capita by the state of the firefighte r's affiliation versus the state where he or she was actually injured. This difference is particularly notable for Colorado where 14 wild- land firefighters were killed in 1994. However , of those 14, most were affiliated with agen\u00ad cies based in other states, includi ng Oregon, South Carolina, and Idaho. Figur e 26 gr aphically illustr ates the incidence of firefighte r fatalities nationa lly. Figure 27 illustrates the firefighter fatalities involved in MVC, and structural unteer, or wildland firefighters per capita. Firefighte r fatalities in structural incidents are more common in the densely populated East; firefighter fatalities in wildland incidents pre- domina ntly occur in the West. MVC fatalities have no de fined pattern. Volunteer firefighter fatalities are fairly well distributed throughout the Midwest and eastern Unite d States. A simila r distribution is seen in career firefighter fatalities. As would be expected, wildland firefighter fatalities (including contract employe es and prisoners) are mostly concent rated in the western states. Large population states generally have more fatalities than those with smaller popula \u00ad tions. However though Califor niaandTexashave higher pop\u00ad ulations. In fact, Texas and New York have comparable average populations, yet New York has more than twice as many fatalities as Texas. Also surprising is that the state with the 29 Table 5.

Map of Firefight er Fatalities, by State of Affiliat ion (1990-2000) highest per capita rate (per 10 million population) of firefighter fatalities is Vermont. Given Vermont's relatively low population, however , even one firefighter fatality would result in a rateof17firefighter fatalities per10million popul ation. Assuch, Vermont's seemingly high rate of firefighter fatalities is not conclusive. Rather, it is possible that the rate is abnormally high due to the analytic metric being used. Using comparisons based on other data (e.g., the population of firefighters in Vermont and the composition of the state's fire service) could resultinaverydifferentrate.Thestatewiththelowestrateoffirefighte rfatalitiesper10mil- lion population is Minnesota. Again, however , the limitations of this analytic metric make it difficulttodetermine thevalidity ofthisestima te.Further study isnecessary toovercome the issues created by the use of population data. To explor e some of the reasons for the differences in the patterns of firefighte r fatalities by state, the tables in this section compa re the experience of firefighter fatalities in various states throughout thecountry .Theexperiences ofvarious states arehighlighted todetermine possible reasons for their dissimila r experiences with regard to firefighter fatalities. How- ever, much additiona l work is required to definitive ly determine the reasons for the different patterns associated with firefighter fatalities by state. The states compared in this section were chosen for their geographic location, popula \u00ad tion, andclimate.Minnesota,Wisconsin, andMichiganareviewedasasingle entity tobring their total population in line with the compari son group. These states have similar climates and are all located in the upper Midwest. The hypothesis being that since population alone does not explain variances between states, other factors must exert varyi ng degrees of influ\u00ad ence. These factors include climate, housing stock, life/safety codes, age of firefighters, types of fires to which the fire department responds, and distribution of personnel (career an example, although there are clearly substantial climatic differences from one state to another , whether there is a correlation between weather patterns (e.g., pre\u00ad cipitation, temperature,humidity ,etc.)andfirefighte rfatalitiesisnotreadilyapparent.Also, although stricter codes and building regulati ons can substantially affect the types of fires a state experi ences (since these codes are usual ly enforced at the local level), their impact on the experience of an entire state is not known. Type of Incident Although structure fires are generally the leading type of incident associated with fire- fighter fatalities, this is not the case in California where wildla nd/br ush fires are the leading incident type (Table 6). Simila rly, wildla nd/br ush fires play a more significant role in fire\u00ad fighter fatalities inTexasandFlorida. Also,EMScalls areresponsible foralargerproportion of firefighter fatalities in Florida than elsewhere. Currently, it is not possible to fully explain these differences. Anecdot ally, the difference between structure and wildland fires can be explained by climate and fire experience; it is logic al that California and Florida experience wildland fires more often than New Y ork. More over, fire department s in Florida generally experience a higher proportio n of EMS calls than do departments elsewhere in the country , which may explain why such calls account for a higher proportion of firefighter fatalities. These are theori es that requi re additional resear ch and data collection/analysis in order to be proved. Affiliation of Personne l As shown in this report, the experiences of career and volunte er firefighter fatalities dif\u00ad fer. As expected, there are variations in the affiliation of firefighte r fatalities by state (Table 7). Only two states, California and Florida, have a higher proportion of career firefighter fatalitiesthanvolunte er.Again,itisnotpossible todetermine thereasonsforthesevariances without additional research. One could argue that the experience of firefighter fatalities is simila rtothecomposition ofthestate'sfireservice,butthereiscurrentlynomethodtoprove thistheory without future analyses thatinclude dataonthedistribution offireservice person - nel by state. Nature of Fatal Injury As shown in Table 8, the nature of fatal injury by state also differs by state. California experiences a particularly low rate of fatalities due to cardiac arrest. In part, this may be because only 4 percent of the state's firefight er fatalities are over the age of 60 (compared to about 14 percent of firefighter fatalities gener ally). The higher proportion of wildland fire- fighters is also consiste nt with a highe r ratio of deaths due to traumatic injuries. On the other hand, for the MN/WI/MI group, 15 percent of firefighter fatalities are over the age of 60, and that group of states experiences a much higher ratio of deaths due to cardiac arrest.

Based on data collected for this study, Table 9 specifically highlights the pattern of firefighter fatalities in Pennsylvania and Florida. Although these states have simi\u00ad lar populations (14,460,152 and 12,081,349 respectivel \u00ad tions, factors other than population must affect the incidence of firefighter fatalities. Table 9.

S Although cardiac arrest is the leading nature of fatal injury in both states, it affects a higher percentage of firefir ghters in Pennsylvania. This may correspond to the older age of Pennsylvania firefighters. S Signif icantly more fire polic e officers die in Pennsylvania than i n Florida. S Significantly more firefighters in Florida are killed while involved in an EMS inci\u00ad dent. More Pennsylvania firefighters are killed responding to incidents than Florida firefighters. 36 S The distribution of career and Volunteer personnel are reversed in the two states. In Pennsylva nia,threeoutoffourfatalitiesarevolunte ers;inFlorida,threeofeveryfour fatalitiesarecareerfirefighters.Thisdifferencecouldbeanindicationofafactorthat affects the total numbe r of firefighte r fatalities in Pennsylva nia, or it may reflect a larger statewide volunt eer firefighter population. S Theleading monthforfirefighter fatalities inFlorida isAugust, followed bySeptem \u00ad ber and July. This is consistent with the prevalence of fatalitie s involving wildland incidents, which occur predomina ntly during the summe r in Florida. The leading month for firefighter fatalities in Pennsyl vania is January , followed by August and December . The higher incidence of winter fires is consistent with the climate in Pennsylvania, where homes must be heated during the colder months. (Heating fires are a leading cause of firefighter fatalities in Pennsylva nia.) Although onecould speculate thatthecompositio of incidents in Florida and Pennsylva nia are simila r to the distribution of firefighte r fatalities, this is not guaranteed. Instead, due to the relatively small sample of fire- fighter fatalities, one or two anoma\u00ad lous events could significantly alter the data. To fully address the reasons for the variations discussed in this sec\u00ad tion, additional research, data, and analyses are required. Some of the causal factors that may be of interest are shown in the adjacent box and may e candidate factors for further research and analyses. (In part, the National Fire Department Census, a project of the USFA, will generate some of these data.) By determining key factors responsible for firefighter fatalities in any state, specific pre\u00ad vention programs could be devel \u00ad oped to specifically address and cor\u00ad rect identified problems or trends.

Number of Fire Departments in State Size of Fire Department Multiple Firefighter Fatality Incidents The death of a firefighter has profound effects on the fire service and community as a whol e; when more than one firefighter dies in an incident, those effects are magnified. Over- all, during the study period, 8 percent of fatal incidents involved the death of more than one firefighter; these incidents accounted for 18 percent of firefighter fatalities. This represents an increase from an earlier USFA study, which found that between 1982 and 1991, only 4 37 percent of incidents involved the death of more than one firefighter; those incidents accounted for 13 percent of firefighter fatalities [Ref. 9]. Table 10 shows the distribution of firefighte r fatalities by the numbe r of firefighte rs killed per incident. The majority of firefighter s are killed in incidents that involve the death of only one firefighter (82 percent). Approxima tely 14 percent of firefighte thatresult inthedeaths oftwoorthreefirefighters. Incide ntsinvolving thedeath of more than four firefighters are rare, and account for only 3 percent of fatalities. Table 10.

Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus Depletion Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are designed to provide firefighters with air while they are operating in dangerous envir onments. How quickly firefighters deplete an SCBA's air supply depends on the size of the cylinder used, the effort they exert, and their level of physical fitness. During extremely physically demanding activities, a firefighter could deplete an SCBA in as little as 10-15 minutes (when using a 30-minute air cylinder). In16percentoffatalitiesduringthestudy period(178cases)firefighte rswerereportedly wearing an SCBA at the time of their injury; 30 percent had offatalities, theairsupply waseither notdepleted or that information was unavailable. Personal Alert Safety System Device Activation Personal Alert Safety Syste m (PASS) devices were originally developed in the early 1980s. They are usually clipped to the harness of a firefighter's SCBA and are designed to emit a loud signal if a firefighter becomes trappe d or incapacitated while operating on a fire- ground. A pre-alert signal goes off 10 seconds before the alert signal and can be disabled by the firefighter's moving; if the device has not sensed motion in 30 seconds or the device is manually activated, the alert signal is emitte d. Inthe89cases during thestudy period where afirefighter wasreportedly wearing aPASS device at the time of their fatal injury, the device activated only 9 percent of the time. In 44 percent of incidents the device reportedly was worn but did not activate; in the remainder of incidents, it is unknown whether or not the device activated. The effects of PASS devices on firefighter mortality are not yet clear. In its investigation of incidents involving firefighter fatalities, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has found multiple occasions where firefighters either failed to wear or activate their PASS devices prior to enterin g a structure [Ref. 10]. To combat this trend, SCBA manufact urers are incorporat ing PASS devices into their SCBA systems. Such devices are turned on automatically when the air cylinder is opened. As with standalone PASSdevices,integrat edPASSdeviceswillalertifitdoes notsense motion. There isnoway to disable the device while the SCBA system is pressuri zed. (There is a reset button in the event that the device activates accidentally.) It will be interesting to see how these new technologies affect firefighter mortality in the future. Revisiting this topic in 5-10 years could show significant change in the use and activation of PASS devices. Wildland Firefighters Wildland firefighting are often promine ntly featured in the media due to several high- profile incidents involving wildland firefight er fatalities and the intense wildfire season in 2000. Table 12 compares the nature of fatal injury for wildland firefighters vs. non-wildland firefighters. Wildland firefighters are far more likely to be killed by traumatic injuries than are non-wildland firefighters. Conversely , they are significantly less likely to die of a heart 39 attack for a variety of reasons including that wildland firefighting agencies typically have extremely high standards of physical fitness. Wildland firefighters also tend to be younger than non-wildland firefighters; nearly 70 percent of part-time wildland firefighters are under the age of 30.

However , through research, study, training, improved operations, develop year.Moreover ,firefighter fatalities are generally the result of a chain of events, which, if detected early, may be broken to prevent many, or even most, fatalities. This chapter addresses prevention strategies for the fire service. Given their persistent nature, four speci fic topics are discussed in detail: pre-existing conditions, training, fire- ground, and motor vehicle collisions. Further information on the prevention of firefighter fatalities can be found on the USFA website at http://www .usfa.fema.gov . To enhance the overall safety of all members of the fire service, personnel should take care to adhere to standard operating procedures and maintain their personal health and fit\u00ad ness. This includes maintaining proper hydra tion on the fireground and wearing seatbelts at all times while operating or riding apparatus (or POVs) . Moreover, at a highe r level in the chain of events, strong public educat ion program s can prevent emergency incidents from happening in the first place; were the inciden t prevented, the risks would be mitigated. Pre-Existing Conditions Previous existing medical condi tions that affect the health and safety of firefighters include underlying medical diseas es and the state of physical fitness of the firefighter at the timeofhisorherdeath.Thesedeathsaredifferentfromotheron-dutydeathsinthattheinjury may not have occurred or been fatal to that individual under the same conditions in the absence of the pre-existing c ondition. Firefighter Physical Fitness\u2014 In involved in rescue, fire suppression, EMS , hazardous materials operations, special opera \u00ad tions, and related activitie s. The standard requires fire departments to establish a \"health-re\u00ad lated fitness program that enables members to develop and maintain a level of health and fitness to safely perform their assigned functions.\" Departments must appoint a health and fitness coordinator (HFC) to coordinate the program and perform periodic fitness assess \u00ad ments to determine an individual's exercise needs. A 2001 study at the Applied Exercise Science Laboratory at Texas A&M University invest igated firefighters' risk of suffering a heart attack. The study followed 74 firefighters ages 20-60 years old over a 6-year period and concluded that firefighters have long periods of stress -free activity during the day, and when the call for help comes, there is a \"sudden, intense energy demand required, and if they are not in adequate physical condition, the results can be deadly\" [Ref. 12]. A 1996 study performed by the Montgomery (AL) Fire Department in cooperation with The Human Performance Laboratory at Auburn University found that added weight and 41 body fat affected performance of firefighters on the firegr ound. The research showed that there was a direct relationship between added body weight and decreased physical perfor \u00ad mance. Additionally ,asbody weight increased, efficiency decreased andfatigue setinfaster. Today, the Montgomery Fire Department monito rs firefighters' height, weight, and body fat composition at various points throughout their careers [Ref. 13]. Many fire departments are implementing mandatory physical fitness programs. The Oklahoma City Fire Department imple mented a mandatory, on-the-job exercise program. These firefighters are required to exercise for 1\u00bd hours on each 24-hour shift. Officials with the Oklahoma City Fire Department hope that by implementing the workout program, fire- fighters will live longer and avoid heart attacks. Firefighters meet with a physician at the beginning oftheprogram andarethenassigne dtoaphysical wellness coordinator .Thecoor- dinator runs through a series of exercises to see what shape the firefighter is in and then, basedontheresults ofthetests,createsanaerobicandweightlif tingregime n.Firefightersare reevaluatedevery6months. Officialswiththedepartmenthavenotedthattheoverallfitness of the department ha with the imple mentation of the program [Ref. 14]. A variety of comme rcial fitness programs are widely available. Such programs include strength building, endurance, and flexibility exercises as well as tips on nutritional habits. Programs like step aerobics and Tae-Bo are becoming popular in fire departments across the country . These programs incorporate fun into cardiovascular exercise, motivating partici \u00ad pants to continue with the workout regimen. Wher e possible, fire departments should incor- porate r'sdaily schedule. Thisshould tion with fitness experts, physicians, and nutritioni sts to ensure that firefighters get in shape in a safe, healthy m anner . The IAFF, Internationa l Association of Fire Chiefs (ICHIEFS), and 10 pairs of local unions andtheirmunic ipalitiesjoinedtogethertoformtheFireServiceJoint LaborManage- ment Wellness-F itness Task Force. The task force created the Fire Service Joint Labor Man\u00ad agement Wellness-Fitness Initiative in an attempt to build a stronger and healthier fire ser\u00ad vice. The initiative is a fitness program that includes physical, physiological, and psychological components. The program comes complete with a physical fitness and well\u00ad ness program package that includes a manual and a video. It is hoped that all departments affiliated with the IAFF will imple ment the program [Ref. 15]. While it might appear that most physical fitnes s programs are targeted to career depart \u00ad ments, many volunteer departme nts are encouraging their members to be more health con\u00ad scious. To facilitate this, some departments have built weight rooms with state-of-the-art fit\u00ad ness equipment for use by their members. For departments that cannot afford expensive equipment, other options include soliciting donations of used exercise equipment. Other depart ments have approached commercial gyms or local recreat ion centers and formed agreem ents grant ing members free or reduced -price membershi ps. Some depart ments have hired fitness consulta nts who meet with members on a regular basis to develop individual and depart ment-wide fitness program s. Candidate Physical Agility Test\u2014One way to prevent firefighters from having poor fit- nesshabits istorecruit andhirefirefighters withgood fitness alstoserveasfirefightersmayreducefirefighte rfatalitiesfromheartattacksandothermedi- 42 cal conditions; physically fit individuals may also be at less of a risk of incurring traumatic injuries. However, a fair standard must be applie d to all applic ants. The members of the Fire Service Joint Labor Management Wellness-Fitne ss Task Force developed the candidate physical agility test (CPAT) to establish a nondiscriminating, fit\u00ad ness-based test for hiring firefighte rs. The CPAT is administe red along with other recruiting and mentoring practices. The CPAT was designed for the recruitme nt process for career departments, but it can also be applie d dur ing recruitme nt of volunte er firefighters. When practical, departments should have EMS personnel and equipment standing by during the actual test should any candidate suffer a medical problem or injury . The CPAT is comprised of eight events in which the candidate must wear a 50-pound weighted belt.(Abeltisused asopposed to enced firefighters seeking employment.) The eight event s include: S Stair climb\u2014climbing s tairs with a 25-pound simulated hose pack S Ladder raise and extension\u2014placing and raising a ground ladder to the desired floor or window S Hose drag\u2014stretching and advancin g hoselines, charged and unchar ged S Equipment carry\u2014removing and carryin g equipment from fire apparatus to fire- ground S Forcible entry\u2014penetrating a locked door, breaching a wall S Search\u2014crawling through dark areas to search for victims S Rescue drag\u2014victim removal from a fire building S Ceiling pull\u2014pulling a ceiling t o check for and locate fire extension. By incorporating the CPAT program into the recruiting and hiring process, fire depart\u00ad ments increase the chance they will build a membership that is physically fit and able to ful\u00ad fill the demanding dutie s of firefighte rs.

Heart Attacks\u2014 Heart attacks are the leading cause of firefighter fatalities. The physical , they must carry heavy equipment through intense heat while wearing heavy gear. Due to the physical demands of firefighting, firefighters must maintain a high level of physical fitness. The medical term for heart attack is myocardi al infarct ion [Ref. 16]. A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle itself\u2014the myocardium\u2014is severely reduced or stopped. This occurs when one of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle is blocked. The blockage is often from the buildup of plaque (deposits of fat-like substances) known as atherosclerosis, combined with arteriosclerosis (the progres \u00ad sive hardening and thickening of the arteries) . During exercise or excitement, the narrowed coronary arteries caused byarteriosclero siscannot increase theblood supply enough tomeet 43 the increased oxygen demand of the heart muscle. The plaque can eventually tear or rupture, triggering a blood clot to form that blocks the artery and leads to a heart attack. If the blood supply is cut off severely or for a long time, muscle cells suffer irreversible injury and die. Disability or death can result, depending on how much of the heart muscle is damaged. At autopsy , a substantial number of firefighter fatalities were found to have severe coro\u00ad nary arteriosclerosis. Family members reported that many had been diagnosed with hyper - tension or diabetes prior to their deaths. Many factors affect a person's risk of suffering a heart attack. Some risk factors are outside of an individual's control such as increasing age, gender (male), and heredi ty (including race). Other risk factors, however , can be controlled or modified through diet, exercise, and persona l choice. Modifiable risk factors include use oftobacco, highcholesterol, highblood pressure (hypertension), physical inactivity ,obesity , and diabetes. The following are examples of ways fire depart ments can encourage their members to impr ove their health and lower their risk. In a significant number of cases, no signs or symptoms precede heart attacks. In such cases, patients fallvictim tosudden cardiac death (alsocalled sudden death). Sudden cardiac death is the result of an abrupt loss of heart function. Victims of sudden cardiac death may or may not have a previ ous medical history of heart disease. All heart diseases can lead to car\u00ad diac arrest or sudden cardiac death. Many cardi ac arrests occur when electrical impulses in the heart become rapid (ventricular tachycardia) or chaotic (ventricular fibrillation). These cardi ac arrhyt hmias cause the heart to stop. Cardiac arrest can lead to brain death, and ulti\u00ad mately clinical death, if not treated within 4 to 6 minute s. The definitive treatment for these lethal arrhythmia s is rapid defibrillation.

Firehouse Magazine's website (http://www .firehouse.com/fitness/ )has a page dedicated to fitness and well being. The page offers a variety of workouts aimed to helpfirefighterswithsuchthings asstrengthtraining, flexibility training, andcardiova scular conditioning, and i t provides information o n the latest trends in health and fitness. Diet\u2014Meals that are high in fat, cholesterol, sodium, and calories can contribute to or exacerbat ehealthprobl emssuchasheart diseaseanddiabetes.Maintainingahealthydietcan mitiga te these health issue s and reduce firefighte rs' risk. Smoking\u2014 Smokers have twice the risk of dying from heart disease than nonsmokers [Ref. 17]. Smoking reduces lung capacity and narrows blood vessels, damaging lungs and reducing the amount of oxygen available during strenuous activities, including firefighting. Smoking also causes chronic and potentially fatal lung diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema. Smoking-related diseases and heart attacks are prevent able. In the years after a smoker quits, their risk of dying from a heart attack decreases markedly. Fifteen years after quitting, an ex-smoker faces the same risks as someone who has never smoked [Ref. 17]. Also, their risk of lung disease, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension all decrease. Although these lifestyle changes directly affect the firefighte r's individua l health, they also benefit the departmentasawhole,ashealthierfirefighte rsmaybelesslikelytobeinjuredorkilledwhile on duty. 44 The most effective way to prevent smoking-related disease is to maintain a smoke-free environm ent, which can be accom plished in several ways. Some fire depart ments have banned personnel from smoking while on duty; others have attempted to ban firefighters from smoking both on a nd of f duty. Asanalternative,some departmentshaveofferedtopayforsmoking cessation programs to help their firefighters quit smoking. These programs include the use of nicotine gums, patches, medications, various isusually lessobjectionable tofirefighters ing them to quit. Promoting a smoking cessa tion program can be cost effective to a fire department. By promoting such a program, fire departments make an investment in their future thatmaycostadown payment fortheprogr amitself, butshould theoretically lower the cost of future m edical care f or that firefighter and for the depart ment. Alcohol\u2014 In a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion, nearl y 52 percent of Americans over the age of 12 had consumed an alcoholic beverage in the month prior to the survey [Ref. 18]. Many peopl e, including firefighters, occasi onally consum e alcoholic beverages. However , the adverse effects of excessive alcohol consumption can be deadl y. Alcohol also affects the heart and, in high amounts, can produce irregular heartbeats. Over time, a rapid or irregular heartbeat can lead to hypertension, heart failure, stroke, or other complications [Ref. 16]. Excessive alcohol consumption also causes pancreatitis, problems. Forfurther information, contact theNational Institute on Alcohol and Alcoholism (http://www .niaaa.nih.gov ) or Alcoholic's Anonymous Assist ance Programs (EAPs) \u2014Both career and volunteer firefighters can benefit from the assistance of EAPs, which are programs organized to provide counseling, support, and other services. Some larger fire departments have their own EAPs; smaller agenci es (of all types) might consi der contracting for EAP services or participating in a local government's EAP. Training Sevenpercent offirefightersdeathsoccur duringtrainingexerci seseach year.Toprevent these fatalities, departments must approach training with safety as the leading priority. Physical Fitne ss\u2014The majority of deaths during training occur while the firefighte r is engaged in physical fitness activities. The paradox in this situation is that firefighters must engage in physical activities to perform their duties effectively . To prevent deaths related to physical fitness, firefighters should engage in such activities only after being evaluated by a physician. With the help of the medical commun ity plus certified physical trainers, lower impact exercise programs can be developed that improve the firefighte r's level of fitness but pose a lower risk of causing injury or death. 45 Training Exercises\u2014Training exercises should include didactic as well as classroom sessions to prepare firefighters for the scenari os to be used in the pract ical exerci se. Practical training sessions should be conducted in accord ance with departmental SOPs; applicable federal, state, andlocallaws; andindustry standards. Only those personnel whoarequalified should beallowed todirectly participate intraining activities. Personnel thatlackthetraining or qualifications to participate should be encouraged to assume support functions. Allowing unqualified personnel toparticipat eintraining oractual incidents could expose afiredepart - ment to serious liability in the event of an injur y or fatality. Since thepurpose ofpractical training istofamiliarize personnel withtheconditions they will face in an actual incident, full protective equipme nt, including SCBA, PASS devices, and accountability systems should be used where appropriate. In particular , live-fire fatalities occur on the scenes of actual emergencies and tend to occur astheresult offlashovers, structural collapses, andfalls. Oneofthehighest priorities a department should strive for and reinforce is familiarity with basic firefighting skills and self-rescue techniques. Familiar ity with these techniques can reduce the likelihood that fire- fighters will be come lost in a structure and require rescue. IncidentCommand System(ICS)\u2014TheICSisthemodeltoolforthecommand, control, and coordination of resources and personnel at the scene of emergencies. It was designed to facilitate operations and efficient mitiga tion at the scene of an emergency, regardless of its magnitude, location, duration, or nature. The ICS is designed to allow for an incident com\u00ad mander (IC) to be identified regardless of that individual's rank. The system allows for the progressive transfer ofcommand from lower ranki ngindividuals tohigher ranking individu - als as necessary . Under the ICS, the IC designates sector commanders to assume responsibility for partic \u00ad ular aspects of an emergency response. The IC determines the overall strategic objective for theincident; thesector commanders areresponsib lefordeveloping tactical plans ofaction to achieve that strategic goal. Examples of sectors include command, EMS, triage, rescue, logistic s, transpor tation, finance, and safety. For the safety sector, at a minimum, the IC should designate a safety officer who has the authority to alter, suspend, or terminate any activity at the scene if he or she determine s those actions to be immine ntly unsafe [Ref. 20]. Freelancing occurs when firefighters or companies deviate from their assigned duties. What makesfreelancingsodangerous isthattheICmaygiveorders toanother company that endangers the freelancers, or the freelancer s may operate in a manner that endangers other firefighters. Training in ICS and operations may mitiga te the occurrence of freelancing. Many fire departments currently imple ment an ICS for working incidents. This practice should continue; those departments that do not currently use an ICS should consider devel \u00ad oping one that suits their needs. Accountability \u2014As part of his or her responsibilities, the IC needs to know the approxi \u00ad mate location of companies and personnel opera ting at the incident. While sector command - 46 ers accomplish part of this through regular repor ts to the IC, a structured Personnel Account - ability System is also a necessity . Some Personnel Accountability Systems use technology , such as barcoding, to track the assignments of personnel and apparatu s. Other Personnel Accountability Systems are simpler , and use plastic tags or dry-erase boards to manually track activitie s on the scene. Closely related to Personnel Accountability Systems are PASS devices. As discussed previously , these devices are designed to emit a loud tone in the event that a firefighte r becomes incapacitated or otherwise unable to move while operating at an incident. When activated, these devices can help search and rescue teams locate a downed firefighter quick\u00ad ly. In particular , if the team knows where the firefighter or company was assigned to operate, the sound of an activated PASS may lead them to the downed firefighter(s). NFPA 1982: Standar d on Personal Alert Safety Systems [Ref. 21] specifies the requirements for PASS devices. Fire departments should make sure that PASS devices used comply with NFPA 1982. In conjunction with a formal Personnel Accountability System, many departments also incorporate Personnel Accountability Reports (PARs) into their SOPs for emer gency opera \u00ad tions. PARs are generally conduc ted over the radio and require each company or firefighter to verbally check in with the IC at regularly scheduled intervals. Often, the dispa tch center will advise the IC at certain points during the incident (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour) to perform an accountability check. Once it is deter mined that a firefighter or company is not accounted for,theICcanshiftresources from suppression ormitigation tosearch andrescue. It is crucial that personne l are familiar with the particul ar Personnel Accountability Sys\u00ad tem and PASS devices used by their department s. This requires ongoing training and coop\u00ad eration across jurisdictions where mutual aid response is common. siveoperations when nolifehazards arepresent. Whilesome crucial in reducing the numbe r of future firefighte r fatalities. This does not mean that all aggressive interior firefighting should stop. Rather , ICs should be aware that in instances where the layout of a structure cannot be ascer tained with certainty or there are hazardous substances present, an exterior attack should be considered, unless there are confirmed vic\u00ad tims trapped in the structure. Firefighters have been killed searching for victims who have already exited a building or were never there in the first place. Two-In/Two-Out\u2014Ac cording to the Occupationa l Safety and Health Administr ation (OSHA) policy (29 CFR 1910-134) for interior structural firefighting, firefighters must be indirectcontactwithatleastoneotherfirefighter.Directcontactincludes beingabletomain- tain verbal or visua l contact with other firefighte rs inside an area imme diately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) at all times. Additiona lly, OSHA requires that a team of at least two properly equipped and trained firefighters be present outside of the IDLH area before any teams enter the structure. For further information, see and Deployment of Fire Suppr ession Operations, Emergency Medical Operations, and Special Operations to the Public by 47 Career Fire Depart ments and NFPA 1720: Standar d on Volunteer Fire Service Deployment recommend that at least two trained firefighters be assigned to an RIT. Although initial RITs often consist of only two firefighters (to comply with the two-out of Two-In/Two-Out), fire- fighter rescue requires many trained hands, especially if multiple firefighters are in distress at the same time. RITs should stand by on the fireground and be deployed immediately when interior fire- fighters find themselves in imminent danger (e.g., they are unable to escape and continued presence in the current environment may lead to serious injury or death). Such teams should be equipped, at a minimum, with an extra SCBA, rope, forcible entry tools, a hosel ine (from anengine notsupplying theprimary attack lines),and,ifpossible, athermal imaging camera. As soon as a \"Mayday\" is transmitted, command should acknowledge the transmission and immediately deploy the RIT. Other units operating on the scene should be switched to an alternate tactical channel to allow for direct communic ation with the missing firefighter(s). For further information on the development of RITs, contact the USFA. Self-Rescue\u2014Firefighters who find themselves in immine nt danger and are unable to wait for a RIT rescue may be able to escape from a structure using some crude but effective escape techniques. These techniques must be practiced, like any other techniques, but since they are often performed from an elevated level, fall protection and qualified instructors must be employed. Some examples of persona l escape taught by various agencies and departments in the fire service include charged hose line slide, rappel with a personal escape rope, andwallbreach. Theseareonlysometechniques being taught, notallofwhichareuni\u00ad versal ly accept ed as \"best pract ices.\" Salvage and Overhaul\u2014 Salvage and overhaul operations begin during the extinguish \u00ad ment of a fire and continue after the fire has been knocked down. Though there might not be anyfireinthebuilding during salvage andoverh ised by fire spread, smoke, and water . Firefighters and the safety officer should bealerttorecognize when theintegrity ofthestructure iscompromised. Areas being salvaged often are still smoky and usually are filled with toxic fire byproducts of or gases notignited during thefire.According toastudy published byresearchers attheUniver - sity of Arizona Colle ge of Public Health, firefighters not wearing respiratory protection dur\u00ad ing salvage and overhaul were significantly more prone to lung injury than those that did wear such protection [Ref. 22]. Therefore, firefighters must be in full personal protective equipme nt (PPE) , including SCBA, at all time s while performing salvage and ove rhaul. Motor Vehicle Collisions Firefighter fatalities as a result of MVCs are an ongoing problem and accounted for 22 percent of the total number of firefighter fatalities from 1990-2000. Driver Training\u2014 Driver familia rity with fire apparatus facilitates comfort and control overthevehicle. Butdriver familiarity must alsobesupplemented withaformal driver train- ing program that educates the driver a bout obstacles, hazards, and roadway types. 48 In addition to licensing requirements at the state level, many fire departments require drivers to successfully comple te an emergency vehicles operator's course (EVOC) and departmental checkout program s prior to driving apparatus. EVOC involves both didactic and practical exercises to teach firefighters how to drive in emergency response situations. The course addresses topics such as high-speed driving, evasive maneuvering, and skid con\u00ad trol. Departmental checkout program s familiarize drivers with the particular vehicles they will be operating on a regular basis. This progr am should involve driving on the different types of roadways in the department's first-due area. This might include in-town driving, out-of-town (rural) driving, highway driving, and off-road driving. If a department protects an area with dense traffic, the driver shoul d train on maneuvering through, in, and around heavy traffic. The use of seatbelts should be stressed. Driver training programs can be measured by the duration of time spent performing driver training, distance driven during drive r training, or a combination of both. Throughout the program, the driver trainer must be unbiased in his/her evaluation of the driver trainee. Driver training, like all skills, should be practi ced on a regular basis. In particular , tanker drivers should practice maneuvering the appara tus with the tank at various fullness levels. It is crucial that operators train regularly on the operation of tankers to prevent fatal errors while responding to incidents. Fire departments should consult NFPA 1002: Fire Departme nt Vehicle Driver/Ope 23] when developing or modi fying its driver training pro- gram. This standard addresse s the knowledge and skills needed to operate and maintain fire department vehicles. Dispatch andResponse Criteria\u2014 andavailable resources. Responding with multiple apparatus to an incident may bring a lot of equipme nt to the scene, but not all of it may be necessary . Response guidelines should be established according to the nature and type of incident and the personnel needed to mitigate that incident. In some instances, a single -unitresponse maybeappropriate rather thansending anentire first-alarm assignment. Additionally , fire departments must consid er whether an emergency response (using lights and sirens) to every incident is warrant ed. Many depart ments have shifted to emer- gency responses onlyforlife-threatening orpoten tially life-threatening emergency incidents and not for routine responses for non-life-threat ening incidents. Emergency vehicles travel \u00ad ing with emer gency warning lights and sirens activated have a significantly higher risk of being i nvolved i n a motor vehicle collision [ Ref. 24]. Intersections\u2014 The majority of MVCs occur at intersections; drivers should approach intersections with extreme caution, coming to a comple te stop before entering the intersec\u00ad tion [Ref. 25]. The driver should proceed through the intersection only when he/she is posi\u00ad tive that the intersection is clear and that all opposing traffic has come to a complete stop. Some departments have prohib ited their fire apparat us from entering intersections on a red light. These department s require their drivers to wait until a green light appears before pro\u00ad ceeding through it. 49 Some departments are using modern technology to minimize the delay caused by red lights. These departments are installing equipme nt that provide s the right-of-way for emer\u00ad gency vehicles at signalized intersections. Using high-energy infrared technology , the mounted device remotely toggles traffic lights from red to green. Departments that use these require their drivers to wait until their light turns green before proceeding. If the light does not turn green within a specified period of time, it means that anothe r fire apparatus is approaching from a different direction. Such technology facilitate s maneuvering through intersections more safely , helping to reduce the number of collisions involving fire appara \u00ad tus. Seatbelt s\u2014As noted earlier, the majority of firefighters killed in MVCs were not wear\u00ad ing seatbelts. Numerous studies have proven that wearing lap and shoulder belts reduce the risk of fatal or serious injury in a collision. When responding to emer gency calls, drivers must do so with safety as their number one priority. The apparatus driver and unit officer should make sure that everyone aboard the appara tus is wearing their seatbelt before moving thevehicle.AccordingtotheNationa lHighwa yTrafficSafetyAdministr ation, 49states,the Distr ict of Columbia , and a numbe r of American territories have enacted seatbelt laws. Although some states have exemptions for public safety agencies, the fact remains that seat- belts save lives, whether one is riding in a POV or a piece of fire apparatus. Privately Owned Vehicles\u2014Some departments operate on an on-call system where members respond to the fire station or fire scene in their POV. More firefighters are killed each yearwhile responding toemer gency calls intheir POVs thananyother vehicle. Insome cases, personnel may break traffic laws like exceeding posted speed limits or rolling through stop signs while trying to get to an emergency. Not all states allow emergency lights on POVs; rather, some allow firefighters to use \"courtesy lights.\" Other vehicles are not legally requiredtoyieldtheright-of-waytovehicleswithcourtesylights andvehiclesoutfittedwith such equipment are required to obey all traffic laws. Firefighters should check with the appropria te agencies to determine what types of lights, if any, are permitte d in their state. Where emergency or courtesy lights are permitte d, firefighters must be vigilant about operatin g their POVs in a safe, responsible manner , regardless of the nature of the emer gency to which they are responding. 50 RESOURCES The deaths of firefighters have far reachi ng effects. It is very important that fire depart \u00ad ments have a written plan in the event of the on-duty death of a firefighter. The NFFF has many resources to help departments, chief officers, and surviving family and friends. These include stress counseling, partic ipation intheNational Fallen Firefighters' Memorial Week\u00ad end, and financial planning. Fire service members should also take stock of their personal finances to ensure that their families will be adequately supported in the event of their untimely death. Moreover , they should draft a will that includes their wishes for funeral/me \u00ad morial services (e.g., a service funeral with apparatus or a private, family memorial). Many local churches, religious organizations, and charities (including the Red Cross) makethemselvesavailabletofamilie sandfiredepartmentsintheaftermathofafatality.The IAFF and its local chapters sponsor various programs for the families of deceased firefight \u00ad ers and often coordi nate the memorial service/funeral for the deceased. Volunteer firefight\u00ad ers' associations coordinate simila r programs for their members. Many larger fire departments have their own counselors on staff to assist families after the death of a firefighter . Departments without these resources may consider edepartment.Mentalhealthclin- ics,hospita ls,andprivatementalhealthprofessionals arealsovaluable resources forhelping familie s and firefighters cope with their loss.
