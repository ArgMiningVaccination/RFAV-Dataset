They provide essential nourishment to your body and can support specific functions.* Maca root is one such plant.* This superfood has been grown and used in some parts of the world for centuries and is slowly gaining popularity all over. In this article, we'll introduce you to the origins of Maca root, [some of its benefits](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-dosage), and suggest a few ways (and interesting recipes) to make Maca root part of your diet. What is Maca Root? As a caffeine-free, plant-based superfood, it's hard not to love [Maca](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/maca). Not only can Maca root contribute to overall well-being, but it is also believed to balance hormone levels, maintain energy, and support a healthy libido.* This versatile adaptogenic herb helps the body adapt and deal with different stressors so you can live a well-balanced life.* And it's safe and easy to add to your everyday routine. Maca, Lepidium meyenii, is an indigenous Andean vegetable that has been grown and cultivated as a root crop for at least 2,000 years. Used both nutritionally and medicinally, Maca grows wild in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, but has primarily been cultivated in the highlands of the Peruvian Andes. Even though Maca has become quite popular in the last decade \u2014 and deservedly so \u2014 it has been used as an important food since the days of the Inca warriors in Peru.* Maca looks similar to radishes or turnips and the roots can be various colors such as yellow, purple, or black. Defining Adaptogenic Herbs We mentioned above that Maca is an adaptogenic herb, but before we move on, we'd like to explain just what that means. Jennifer Pottruff, DBM, DNM, DO, says that adaptogenic herbs (or [adaptogens](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/all-about-adaptogens)) are \"defined as agents that support the body's ability to accommodate varying physical and emotional stresses.\"1 It could also be said that these are plants with a nonspecific action that \"exert a normalizing influence on the body.\"2 Adaptogenic herbs have traditionally been used in Chinese and [Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/ayurveda-101) and are still used to support energy levels and the stress response system.*1 In addition to Maca root, there are other popular adaptogenic herbs, and even mushrooms, including: - American Ginseng - Reishi mushroom - Eleuthero - Schisandra - Holy Basil - Ashwagandha [American Ginseng](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-American-Ginseng) is an herb that has a history of use among Native Americans, while [Reishi](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-reishi) and [Eleuthero](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-eleuthero) are adaptogens used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Finally, [Schisandra](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-schisandra) berries, [Holy Basil](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-holy-basil), and [Ashwagandha](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/collections/all/herb-ashwagandha) are other popular adaptogens that many around the world turn to help them deal with stress.* At Gaia Herbs, we've combined a blend of six beneficial adaptogenic herbs in our [Everyday Adaptogen](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/everyday-adaptogen) formula \u2014 and left out added fillers, flavors, and sweeteners. Simply add one teaspoon, once a day, to your beverage of choice to maintain peak performance.* Now let's get back to Maca root, the adaptogen at hand, and the many benefits it has to offer. 6 Benefits of Maca Root Though it's traditionally used for supporting peak performance, energy and mood, the benefits of maca root span a wide range of health topics. #1. Maca Root May Support Energy and Mood* Maca root has been shown to provide sustained energy throughout the day without the [jittery crash of caffeine](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/natural-herbs-to-support-energy-stamina-without-the-caffeine-crash), which can help you feel more awake so you're able to focus on the things that matter.* Maca has also been shown to help [athletes](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/6-herbs-to-help-you-hiit-the-gym) maintain their energy. In one study, benefits were seen in a 40 kilometer cycling time trial after two weeks of Maca extract supplementation.3 What does Maca root have to do with mood? By maintaining positive energy levels throughout the day, Maca may also help improve mood.* #2. Maca Root May Support a Healthy Libido* prized aphrodisiac, Maca root supports [men's health](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/5-herbs-for-mens-health) and [optimizes healthy performance](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-benefits-for-men).* Maca has been shown in clinical studies to support men's reproductive health, including [healthy sexual libido and function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12472620/) as well as normal prostate function throughout many ages and stages of life.* But it's not just beneficial for men. In fact, an article by Harvard Health Publishing notes: \"At MGH [Massachusetts General Hospital], we have conducted two preliminary studies that suggest Maca root extracts may boost libido, particularly in postmenopausal women.\"5 #3. Maca Root May Support Sperm Function Regarding male reproductive health, Maca root has another potential benefit \u2014 in one study, it showed improved sperm function.* In this study performed on rats, black and yellow Maca were found to increase sperm count and movement. The same results were found in a study with nine human male participants.4 Although this needs to be studied further for conclusive results, this was an exciting early finding for men's reproductive health.* #4. Maca Root Has a Long History of Use for Supporting Women's Reproductive Function As we alluded to earlier, the benefits Maca root provides in the bedroom aren't reserved only for men.* This herb is also believed to tonify the female reproductive system, support arousal and sexual desire, and may also help with fertility.* Because of this, we turned to Maca root, along with other herbs, to formulate Gaia Herbs [Women's Libido](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/womens-libido), which supports a healthy drive to help women [maintain their spark](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/herbs-to-put-the-spark-back-in-your-love-life).* These vegan Liquid Phyto-Caps\u00ae also contain [Horny Goat Weed](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/herbs/horny-goat-weed) and Gaia-grown\u00ae Oats, which are extracted fresh immediately after harvest to preserve full spectrum compounds for optimal potency.* If you're unfamiliar with the phrase \"full-spectrum,\" Jeremy Stewart, Gaia Herbs Chief Scientist and Vice President of Scientific Affairs, describes it this way: \"Our full spectrum processing allows us to guarantee certain levels of constituents while simultaneously capturing all of the other naturally occurring compounds in the plant. Since our beginning over thirty years ago, our philosophy has been to use full spectrum extracts, representing the whole plant as Nature intended, versus other companies that choose to use single, chemically isolated compounds in their products.*\" Maca root provides other [benefits](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/maca-benefits-for-women) for [women](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/5-herbs-for-womens-health) in every life stage, as well. First, it has been shown to help support hormonal issues, including PMS, menopause, and hot flashes.* It has also been studied clinically to support a balanced transition through menopause, and it does so without particularly influencing sex hormone levels.* [Studies have shown that Maca may also support psychological health and sexual function in postmenopausal women](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18784609/).* #5. Maca Root May Help Balance Hormone Levels Many people think only of the reproductive organs when they think of \"hormones.\" But the truth is that hormones come from endocrine glands all over your body. Hormones constantly play a part in many processes including metabolism, cognitive function, mood, and regulation of hunger and thirst.6 By nourishing the [adrenal glands](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/blogs/seeds-of-knowledge/meet-your-adrenals), [Maca Root](https://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/maca-root) can help maintain balanced hormone levels.* As an adaptogenic herb, Maca supports normal hormone production and supports the body's natural detoxification.* #6. Maca Root is a Superfood Maca root is a nutritional powerhouse, providing key macro and micronutrients, and unique plant compounds to support an active human body. When it comes to macronutrients, dry Maca is 59% carbohydrates, 10.2% as micronutrients go, Maca root is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, copper, and zinc. And, compared to white potatoes, Maca root boasts higher levels of iron and calcium.7 It contains all eight essential amino acids and plenty of phytonutrients, too. How to Make Maca Root Part of Your Diet As we've seen, Maca root is loaded with nutrients and provides many benefits.
