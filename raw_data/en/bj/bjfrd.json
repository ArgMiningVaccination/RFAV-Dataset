Santos (De La Salle University, Manila, Metro Manila, Philippines) Importance of the Problem: This project examines quantum functional devices in the conjugated polymer system for molecular electronic devices and circuits. These enhanced circuits are aimed to be more energy thrifty than conventional transistor-only circuits and facilitate high-speed operation to reach node-to-node wireless communication. It has been predicted that by 2021, there will be 200 billion connected devices which should all operate and integrate smoothly with the Internet but also provide a vast spectrum of services in e.g. healthcare, smart homes, industry automation, and environmental monitoring. As the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) or \"Internet of Everything\" (IoE) continues to grow, the number of connected objects will grow at explosive rates. For this to be possible, a paradigm shift from current approaches based on rigid silicon CMOS where batteries are used will be required. In the future, IoT objects will have to be extremely low cost, flexible and thin (and in some cases also stretchable) in order for this ubiquitous electronics to be unobtrusive. In addition, these distributed devices must harvest their energy from other means than batteries, as massive numbers of batteries mean massive end of life, waste disposal and recycling issues. The ambition of this international collaboration is to deliver the technology to enable this paradigm shift. Advances in energy harvesting and storage will improve the ability to harvest energy from a variety of sources such as light, radio waves and motion and store it in printed supercapacitors that are non-toxic and unproblematic at end of life (Don Lupo). The exploitation of tunneling devices and novel devices combining atomic layer deposition (ALD) and printing will make possible a new generation of low-power and high-speed circuits for power management, data storage, computation and wireless communication (Paul Berger). As a result, this team will open the path to a true Internet of Things that will cost very little, be placeable anywhere, and deserve the description \"environmentally friendly\". These objects will be energy autonomous, battery free, be able to sense, process and analyze environmental, body (Matti Mantysalo) and other information and transfer it by acceptable wireless protocols (Mikko Valkama) to networks of the user's choice. Because they will be manufactured by low temperature, low cost mass manufacturing processes, they will be ultra-low cost and able to be put on thin, flexible carriers that make them able to be truly put anywhere. Brief Description of Our Work and Results: Conjugated polymers, with pi molecular orbitals delocalized along the polymer chain, are useful organic semiconductors that provide the possibility of molecular electronics for low power organic-based memory and logic. Quantum functional devices based upon carrier tunneling processes open vistas into very efficient and low power consumption circuitry that would be ideal for these applications. We demonstrate here strong room temperature NDR for poly[2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) polymer tunnel diodes using a thin TiO2 tunneling layer (~2-8 nm) sandwiched between the MEH-PPV and the indium tin oxide anode. A key advantage is the pronounced NDR using a thick polymer layer with a large active area, circumnavigating the need for molecularly sized junctions. Current-voltage measurements show large and reproducible NDR with a PVCR as high as 53 at room temperature. We also demonstrate basic logic circuit operation using a pair of these polymer tunnel diodes connected in series to form a monostable-bistable transition logic element latch. Our results indicate that polymer tunnel diodes are potential candidates for many flexible, low-power logic and memory applications for organic devices by using low-cost and simple solution processing.
