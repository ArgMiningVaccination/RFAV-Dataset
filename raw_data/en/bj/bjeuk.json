For example, if 1 million doses of a vaccine are given, 1 to 2 people may have a severe allergic reaction.Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include:Difficulty breathingSwelling of your face and throat A fast heartbeatA bad rash all over your bodyDizziness and weakness https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/safety/side -effects/index.htmlHow do Vaccines Work?The vaccine trigger your immune system that there might be an infection The immune system begins releasing antibodies to fight the germ \u2014think of antibodies as soldiers designed to fight off the specific germ you have. This process can take a few days. The antibodies work to attack, weaken, and destroy the germ. Afterwards, your immune system remembers the germ. If the germ invades again, your body can recognize it and quickly send out the right antibodies so you don't get sick! Vaccines often provide long-lasting immunity to serious diseases without the risk of serious illness (you might get a mild case)Why are Vaccines Important?Protection from serious disease -ourselves and those around us Reduce hospitalizations Reduce death from infections Reduce long -term effects of infectionsC NEW IMMUNIZATION PROJECT!Partners: States Represented in the Project AAFP IMPROVING ADULT IMMUNIZATION RATES AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES Statelocations(23 Practices) 18Quality Improvement project: To improve vaccination rates among older adults of racial and ethnic minority populations at the Landon Center on Aging. 4-year study: August 2021- and 3.Herpes well are we doing with our current immunization rates?
