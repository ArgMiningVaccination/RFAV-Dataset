Based on the observation that most local recurrences occurred near the tumor bed, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), consisting of a higher dose per fraction to the tumor bed over a reduced treatment time, has been gaining ground as an attractive alternative in selected patients with low-risk BC. Although more widely delivered in postoperative setting, preoperative APBI has also been investigated in a limited, though increasing, and number of studies. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of preoperative radiotherapy (RT) in a single fraction for selected BC patients. Methods: This is a phase I/II, single-arm and open-label single-center clinical trial using CyberKnife. The clinical investigation is supported by a preplanning section which addresses technical and dosimetric issues. The primary endpoint for the phase I study, covering the 1st and 2nd year of the research project, is the identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which meets a specific target toxicity level (no grade 3-4 toxicity). The primary endpoint for the phase II study (3rd to 5th year) is the evaluation of treatment efficacy measured in terms of pathological complete response rate. Discussion: The study will investigate the response of BC to the preoperative APBI from different perspectives. While preoperative APBI represents a form of anticipated boost, followed by WBRT, different are the implications for the scientific community. The study may help to identify good responders for whom surgery could be omitted. It is especially appealing for patients unfit for surgery due to advanced age or severe co-morbidities, in addition to or instead of systemic therapies, to ensure long-term local control. Moreover, patients with oligometastatic disease synchronous with primary BC may benefit from APBI on the intact tumor in terms of tumor progression free survival. The study of response to RT can provide useful information about BC radiobiology, immunologic reactions, genomic expression, and radiomics features, to be tested on a larger scale. Trial registration: The study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( [NCT04679454](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04679454) ).
