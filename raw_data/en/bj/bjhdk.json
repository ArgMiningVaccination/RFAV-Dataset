Massage is also a popular therapy used to relieve muscle tension, spasms, inflammation, fluid retention, aches, stiffness, and pain. During treatment, I may include localized massage therapy, full body therapy, or even energy work, all depending on the client's specific needs. Generally, people use massage for either general relaxation and wellbeing, or to address a specific complaint, such as pain or limited range of motion. Some of the general benefits of massage therapy may include: - Physical relaxation - Improved circulation, which nourishes cells and improves waste elimination - Relief for tight muscles (knots) and other aches and pains - Release of nerve compression (carpal tunnel, sciatica) - Greater flexibility and range of motion - Enhanced energy and vitality Some clinical styles may help heal scar tissue as well as tendon, ligament, and muscle tears. Each session is catered to your specific needs. A brief health history is talked about before every therapy so I, as the healer, can get information that is needed for implementation of specific treatment with a mixture of modalities to be used to get you to a place of wellbeing before leaving my office.
