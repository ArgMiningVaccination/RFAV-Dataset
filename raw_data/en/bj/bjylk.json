Pregnant patients (the live MMR vaccine should not be administered during pregnancy) 2. Immunocompromised patients 3. History of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of MMR vaccine or to an ingredient in the vaccine For additional information on contraindications, visit http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3072a.pd f General recommendations for adults: 1. At least 1 dose of MMR vaccine (patients vaccinated prior to 1968 with a killed vaccine or patients vaccinated prior to 1968 who do not know wha t type of vaccine they received should be revaccinated*) OR 2. If patient is born before 1957, it is assumed that the patient has been infected with measles and vaccine is not needed (if a patient in this category requests vaccine, healthcare providers can decide to administer at their discretion ) Recommendations for adults who are in post -secondary education (college), healthcare personnel or international traveler s (including people born before 1957) : 1. Documentation of 2 doses of MMR vaccine (patients vaccinated prior to 1968 with a killed vaccine or patients vaccinated prior to 1968 who do not know what type of vaccine they received - should be revaccinated*) OR 2. Laboratory confirmation of disease OR 3. Laboratory confirmation of immunity (tested and found to be IgG positive against measles) Gener al recommendations for children: 2 doses of MMR vaccine should be administered prior to star ting kindergarten: 1 dose at 12 -15 months of age and 1 dose at 4-6 years of age Iowa law requires school aged children to have 2 doses of MMR vaccine prior to sta rting kindergarten (even if children are 5 yea rs of age when they start kindergarten ). Iowa law does not address MMR vaccine requirements for teachers; however, it would be rea sonable for teachers to have 2 doses of MMR vaccine since that is the recommendation for t he children in their classrooms (or have laboratory confirmation of disease or laboratory confirmation of immunity). IDPH does not currently recommend giving the first dose of MMR vaccine before children are 12 months of age, unless the child is traveling internationally. The first dose MMR vaccine can be administered to children over 6 months of age , if they are traveling internationally ( howe ver, any dose administered prior to 12 months of age will not count toward the 2 -dose requirement). IDPH does not currently recommend that the second dose of MMR vaccine be administered prior to 4 -6 years of age ( however, if the dose is administered early it will count toward the 2 -dose school requirement if the second dose was administered at least 28 days after the first dose was given) * If a patient requests a titer check in lieu of re-vaccination that can be considered. However if the titer is ne gativ e, re -vaccination is recommended. Therefore, it may be more ti me and cost effective to re-vaccinate versus check ing titers, as receiving additional vaccine is not harmful. For "}
