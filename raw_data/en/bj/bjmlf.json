The work has had two primary goals: 1. better understand the determinants of treatment response by identify biomarkers for treatment outcomes - imaging, electrophysiological, genomic and clinical, and to develop new treatment approaches. 2. To investigate the fundamental neurobiological basis of the neuropsychiatric and medical co-morbidities present in many patients with epilepsy and related conditions. We have a major focus on developing new treatments, testing them in pre-clinical studies, and then translating these into early phase clinical trials. The group integrated with the Department of Neurology in the Alfred Hospital, including the dedicated Neurological Clinical Trials Facility which has capacity for first-in-disease clinical trials. Projects [ Neuropharmacological strategies: ](#Neuropharmacological_strategies-1) for disease modification and prevention of the development of epilepsy Current therapies for epilepsy are symptomatic, only suppressing the symptoms (seizures), but do not impact the development or progression of disease. Many groups around the world, including ours, are testing novel therapies to impact epileptogenesis, intervening very early in epilepsy development to limit the severity of disease, with some preclinical success. But most patients present at the clinic already experiencing seizures, so a more practical strategy would be to attempt to modify epilepsy disease progression. For this project, we will investigate whether our novel treatments can reverse epilepsy severity in a rat model of acquired epilepsy in cases of established epilepsy. We then evaluate if the animals are having less seizures, behavioural comorbidities and neuroimaging changes after the completion of treatment. If the results are positive, they would have major clinical implications in patients with already established acquired epilepsy. Moreover, the experimental drugs that we will be tested have a favorable safety profile in early phase clinical trials facilitating the translation of the results of this preclinical study into a clinical trial. [ Biomarkers of epileptogenesis and epilepsy disease progression ](#Biomarkers_of_epileptogenesis_and_epilepsy_disease_progression-2) A biomarker is an objectively measured characteristic of a normal or pathologic biological process. The development of novel interventions to treat, cure, and prevent epilepsy would benefit greatly from the identification and validation of such biomarkers. In addition, identification of biomarkers may facilitate the development of novel interventions to prevent epilepsy; to prevent the occurrence of epileptic seizures, reverse progression of epilepsy, and potentially even cure epilepsy after it is established. This project will investigate blood- and brain-derived biomarkers of epileptogenesis (the development of epilepsy) and of disease progression of epilepsy using small animal models. [ Characterisation of neuropsychiatry comorbidities: ](#Characterisation_of_neuropsychiatry_comorbidities-5) and the role of stress and early life trauma in patients with chronic epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures Depression and epilepsy are disabling disorders that are common in the community. Both disorders have been shown to have effects on the human body's physiological response to stress. These effects have been identified in both the autonomic nervous system (responsible for immediate responses to stress) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (which mediates longer-term stress responses). However, it is not known whether these effects occur through similar mechanisms, partly because previous research has not focused extensively on patients with both disorders. This project will broaden our understanding of stress physiology, and the enduring effects of early life trauma, in these disorders by assessing stress physiology in patients who have been admitted to hospital for assessment of seizures and have one or both disorders.
