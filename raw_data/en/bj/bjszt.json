With autumn's arrival and winter just around the corner, cooler temperatures, and reduced daylight hours, we can become more vulnerable to picking up a range of illnesses and infections. Prevention is always better than cure, so why not invest the time, think ahead and give your immune system a natural boost with Homeopathy. Your immune system is the most complex and critical component of your body's defence mechanism. A vast network of cells and organs that share the responsibility of maintaining your resistance to disease. Immunity is partly inherited and partly shaped by lifestyle. Your ability to ward off disease is determined by the resilience of your natural defences. A sluggish immune system precipitates the spread of deficiency diseases like the common cold, often leading to more serious secondary conditions. Homeopathic remedies can bring order back to a disordered state and help the body return to its own unique balance. "}
