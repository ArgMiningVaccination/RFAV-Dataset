Dominick D. - - - - - I wasn't sure about seeking medical help because I had a very bad experience with doctors in San Antonio. Anyways, I booked an appointment, I got there and the lady on the front desk helped me immediately, she was super nice. I met Dr. Kimberly and she was asking lots of questions and making sure to cover everything, she is friendly, nice and professional by all means. She recommended some lab tests and the lady at the lab was very sweet and she took the samples in no time. I had a very pleasant experience there and I really recommend Dr. Kimberly, she a sweetheart and most important thing is that she is a real PRO.
