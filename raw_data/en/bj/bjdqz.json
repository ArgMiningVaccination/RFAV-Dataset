This combination can look like an oily t-zone with enlarged pores on the forehead, nose and chin with dryness and even flakiness on the cheeks and under the eyes. We've curated the Balance skin care collection for normal and combination skin types to use. Featuring biocompatible formulas that support, nourish and provide the wide range of benefits needed for these skin types, this collection boasts natural and organic ingredients. Truly pure and gentle on your skin, these wildcrafted products are highly effective for achieving a healthy, vibrant look. This collection boasts products that will properly moisturize and balance your skin without clogging your pores or stripping the skin of its natural oils. Skin Care Products for Normal Skin Normal skin is not too dry or oily with the skin surface being smooth and having relatively smaller pores. Since our skin is our largest organ, it's important to put high quality, nourishing ingredients on our skin. That's why we created this collection of Balance skin care products made with organic, wildcrafted ingredients to help you get healthy, glowing skin. Support your skin by cleansing with our gentle, yet effective Aloe Herb Cleanser with a pH level of 5.5-5.6 that closely matches your skin's natural pH. Free of chemicals and toxins, this gentle, effect cleanser both hydrates and moisturizes with aloe vera and coconut oil. A few times a week, introduce a manual exfoliant like our Kaolin Micro Exfoliant to remove buildup or clarify skin. Or get a deeper cleanse and reduce the appearance of large pores with our Purifying Mud Mask. Here at Annmarie Skin Care, we truly believe a beautiful, radiant complexion is nurtured with high-quality, nature-powered ingredients that are sourced with integrity. All of our products are cruelty-free, non-toxic, free of phthalates, sulfates and other harmful, synthetic chemicals.
