A Healing Circle is a group of people who gather together with a clear intention of healing. The circle represents life's continuation - with no beginning and no end. Each healing circle is uniquely created based on the intentions and goals of the group, or an individual being honoured. There is preparation that needs to be done before a healing circle is conducted. The space must be purified, allowing for the maximum healing benefits. And it's important to have a clear understanding of the goals and hopes for the circle, including: Healing Circles allow people to share in healing, benefiting from the collective energy of the group, while supporting each individual to grow and strengthen themselves. Traditionally used in First Nations ceremonies, they brought people together in the spirit of healing, friendship, and community. There is sanctity within Healing Circles that offers people solitude and retreat, while simultaneously respecting the group's therapeutic process. Focussing on physical, emotional, and spiritual issues, there may be one person who is focused on during a Healing Circle or each member of the group may be asking for healing. They can be a one-time event, offered in times of crisis or when deep repair is needed, or they may be a monthly ritual to allow healing to deepen.

What are Sacred Women's Wisdom Circles? Sacred Women's Wisdom Circles are celebrations that honour wild creation wisdom, through intentionally coming together in a circle to cultivate deep healing practices that honour sacred femininity and its ability to heal. Meditation, singing, chanting, yoga, dance, rituals, plant medicines, and connecting from within will be practiced while we honour each other as a collective tribe of sacred wisdom sisters, awakening to our own unique inner goddess wisdom. These Sacred Women's Wisdom Circles bow deeply to the sacred masculine, offering gratitude as we honour the power and presence the masculine holds, recognizing there is not one more supreme than the other, but that each offers their own unique qualities. We are appreciative of the fact that true alchemy can only come when both the sacred masculine and feminine within us and within our world are healed, honoured, and cultivated. We welcome all parts of ourselves into the circle as we embody wild goddess wisdom. Sacred Wisdom Vision The vision of Sacred Wisdom Women's Circles is to support millions of people to understand, honour and welcome the way of the sacred feminine as a powerful and integral part of healing the world. We aim to heal generations of past, present and future, through healing the sacred feminine and sacred masculine within ourselves.
