Using a mouse model and a panel of live attenuated influenza virus vaccine candidates (cold adapted and single cycle), we show that pre-existing influenza-specific Abs directed against the vaccine backbone attenuate the size and quality of the vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell response. Importantly, we show that increasing the vaccine dose can overcome this impediment, resulting in improved vaccine-induced circulating and tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cell responses, which were protective against heterologous influenza challenge. Thus, the reduced size and quality of the T cell response elicited by a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine imparted by the influenza-specific Ab landscape of the vaccinee can be overcome by increasing vaccine dose.
