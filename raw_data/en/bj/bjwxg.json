Which people who work in healthcare settings need hepatitis B vaccine? The Occupational Safety and Health Administra - tion (OSHA) requires that hepatitis B vaccine be offered to healthcare personnel (HCP) who have a reasonable expectation of being exposed to blood and body fluids on the job. This requirement does not include personnel who would not be expected to have occupational risk (e.g., general office workers). At what anatomic site should hepatitis B vac - cine be administered to adults? What needle size should be used? For adults, administer hepatitis B vaccine intra - muscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle. A 22- to 25-gauge, 1-1\u00bd -inch needle should be used. The gluteus muscle should not be used as a site for administering hepatitis B vaccine. For optimal pro - tection, it is crucial that the vaccine be administered IM, not subcutaneously. If a person who works in a healthcare setting had one dose only of hepatitis B vaccine 4 months ago, should the series be restarted? No. The hepatitis B vaccine series should not be restarted when doses are delayed; rather, the series should be continued from where it stopped. The person should receive the second dose of vaccine now and the third dose at least 8 weeks later. There needs to be at least 8 weeks between the second and third doses and at least 16 weeks between the first and the third doses of vaccine. Is it safe for HCP to be vaccinated during preg - nancy? Yes. Many years of experience with hepatitis B vaccines indicate no apparent risk for adverse events to a developing fetus. Current hepatitis B vaccines contain noninfectious hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and should pose no risk to the fetus. If not vaccinated, a pregnant woman may contract an HBV infection during pregnancy, which might result in severe disease for the new - born. Women who breastfeed their babies can and should be vaccinated against hepatitis B if needed. Receipt of the vaccine is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Which HCP need serologic testing after receiving 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine? All HCP, including trainees, who have a high risk of occupational percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids (e.g., HCP with direct pa - tient contact, HCP who have the risk of needlestick or sharps injury, laboratory workers who draw, test or handle blood specimens) should have postvac - cination testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Postvaccination testing should be done 1-2 months after the last dose of vaccine. Postvaccination testing for persons at low risk for mucosal or percutaneous exposure to blood or body fluids (e.g., public safety workers and HCP without direct patient contact) likely is not cost-effective; however, those who do not undergo postvaccina - tion testing should be counseled to seek immediate testing if exposed. What should be done if a person's postvac - cination anti-HBs test is negative (less than 10 mIU/mL) 1-2 months after the last dose of vaccine? Repeat the 3-dose series and test for anti-HBs 1-2 months after the third dose of vaccine. If the test is still negative after a second vaccine series, the person should be tested for HBsAg and total anti-HBc to determine their HBV infection status. People who test negative for HBsAg and total anti- HBc should be considered vaccine non-responders and susceptible to HBV infection. They should be counseled about precautions to prevent HBV in - fection and the need to obtain hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to HBsAg-positive blood. Those found to be HBsAg negative but total anti-HBc positive were infected in the past and require no vaccination or treatment. If the HBsAg and total an - ti-HBc tests are positive, the person should receive appropriate counseling for preventing transmission to others as well as referral for ongoing care to a specialist experienced in the medical management of chronic HBV infection. They should not be ex - cluded from work. How often should I test HCP after they've re - ceived the hepatitis B vaccine series to make sure they're protected? For immunocompetent HCP, periodic testing or periodic boosting is not needed. Postvaccination testing (anti-HBs) should be done 1-2 months after the last dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. If adequate anti-HBs (at least 10 mIU/mL) is pres - ent, nothing more needs to be done. This infor - mation should be made available to the employee and recorded in the employee's health record. If postvaccination testing is less than 10 mIU/mL, the 3-dose vaccine series should be repeated and anti-HBs testing done, 1-2 months after the last dose of the second series. Should a healthcare professional who per - forms invasive procedures and who once had a positive anti-HBs result be revaccinated if the anti-HBs titer is rechecked and is less than 10 mIU/mL? No. Immunocompetent people known to have re - sponded to hepatitis B vaccination in the past do not require additional passive or active immunization. Postvaccination testing should be done 1-2 months after the original vaccine series is completed. In this scenario, the initial postvaccination testing showed that the healthcare professional was protected. Sub - stantial evidence suggests that adults who respond to a 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine series (anti-HBs of at least 10 mIU/ mL) are protected from chronic HBV infection for at least 22 years, even if there is no detectable anti-HBs currently. Only immuno - compromised people (e.g., dialysis patients, some HIV-positive people) need to have anti-HBs testing performed periodically. Booster doses of vaccine to maintain their protective anti-HBs concentra - tions to at least 10 mIU/mL are recommended for dialysis patients and may be given to some HIV- positive patients. Before reading the recommendations of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that say not to do this, we tested our employees for anti-HBs several years after they were vaccinated and some people had inad - equate titers, even though they had all complet - ed a 3-dose series. What should we do now? The ACIP guidelines do not address this situation; however, we know that anti-HBs concentrations decline over time and immunocompetent HCP who had anti-HBs levels of at least 10 mIU/mL 1-2 months after primary vaccination series re - Technical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTable 1: Recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis after percutaneous or mucosal exposure to HBV in an occupational setting(continued on page 3)Hepatitis B and Healthcare Personnel Page 2 (page 2 of 3)Vaccination and antibody response status of exposed persons1 Unvaccinated Fully vaccinated and known responder3 Vaccinated with 3 doses and known nonresponder3 Fully vaccinated with 3 doses but antibody titer unknownTreatment Source is HBsAg positiveSource is HBsAg negativeSource is unknown or not tested HBIG2 x 1 and begin a hepatitis B vaccine seriesBegin a hepatitis B vaccine series HBIG2 x 1 and begin a hepatitis B revaccination series4 No treatmentNo treatment No treatment No treatmentBegin a hepatitis B vaccine series.

There are several options to consider for immunocompetent HCP in this situation, depending on cost considerations, anticipated high risk of exposure (including medi - cal trainees), and employee/employer desire for documented immunity: Administer an additional dose of vaccine fol - lowed by serological testing (and then two sub - sequent doses if titers are non-protective followed by serological testing) as long as the series was documented; Administer an additional 3-dose series followed by serological testing 1-2 months after the third dose (and if titers are still non-protective, and HBsAg and total anti-HBc are negative, coun - seling about the importance of seeking care after a potential exposure); or Do not vaccinate further at this time, but counsel regarding the importance of seeking immediate assessment after percutaneous or mucosal expo - sure to blood or blood containing body fluids, and following the guidelines for postexposure management (see Table 1).How often should anti-HBs testing be done on healthcare professionals who perform invasive procedures? For people whose immune status is normal, peri - odic serologic testing to assess anti-HBs concentra - tions is not necessary. People who perform invasive procedures should be treated no differently from other HCP with respect to anti-HBs testing. If a healthcare professional has an exposure (e.g., needlestick), she/he should be evaluated for their need for immunoprophylaxis according to postex - posure guidelines in Table 1. If HCP received hepatitis B vaccination in the past and were not tested for immunity, should they be tested now? No. In this scenario, they do not need to be tested unless they have an exposure. If an exposure oc - curs, refer to the postexposure guidelines in Table 1. How should a fully vaccinated employee with an unknown anti-HBs response be managed if they have a percutaneous or mucosal expo - sure to blood or body fluids from an HBsAg- positive source? This person should be tested for anti-HBs as soon as possible after exposure. If the anti-HBs con -centration is at least 10 mIU/mL, no further treat - ment is needed. If the anti-HBs concentration is less than10 mIU/mL, HBIG and one dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered. In these HCP, anti- HBs testing should be repeated 4-6 months after administration of the booster dose and HBIG. If the result is at least 10 mIU/mL, the person is seropro - tected. It is necessary to do postvaccination test - ing later than the usual recommended time frame because anti-HBs from HBIG might be detected if testing is done any earlier. The postvaccination test result should be made available to the employee and recorded in the employee's health record. For a pre-employment physical, an applicant states she received all three hepatitis B vac - cine doses as an adolescent. Would you test for anti-HBs? If the person has written documentation of a full hepatitis B vaccine series, testing for anti-HBs at this point is not required. However, knowledge of immunity to HBV is recommended if the employee will have high risk of occupational percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids. If the vaccinated employee without documented immu - Vaccinated with 6 doses and known nonresponder3Keep track of your vaccinations! Record the dates you received hepatitis B vaccine, as well as the results of your postvaccination serologic testing (anti-HBs). Remember to keep records of all vaccinations you need - influenza, Tdap, MMR, varicella, and more - so you don't have to repeat them.

This information should be documented in the employee's health record. This approach should be sufficient to meet the needs of the employer and the requirements of OSHA. If there is no written documentation of hepatitis B vaccination, see the next question. Several physicians in our group have no docu - mentation showing they received hepatitis B vaccine. They are relatively sure, however, that they received the doses many years ago. What do we do now? Because there is no documentation of vaccina - tion, the 3-dose vaccination series should be ad - ministered and postvaccination testing should be performed 1-2 months after the third dose of vac - cine. There is no harm in receiving extra doses of vaccine. Care should always be taken to document vaccine lot, date, manufacturer, route, and vaccine dosages. Postvaccination testing results should also be documented, including the date testing was performed. All healthcare settings should develop policies or guidelines to assure valid hepatitis B immunization. An employee thinks she had 3 doses of hepati - tis B vaccine in the past but has no documen - tation of receiving those doses. Before reading the recommendations to revaccinate her, we obtained an anti-HBs titer and the result was greater than 10 mIU/mL. With this lab result, can't we assume she is immune? No. A positive anti-HBs indicates that the vac - cinated person is immune at the time the person was tested but does not assure that the person has long-term immunity. Long-term immunity has been demonstrated only for people attaining an adequate anti-HBs result of at least 10 mIU/mL after completing a full vaccination series. The most direct way to deal with this is to vaccinate the em - ployee with a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine; test for anti-HBs in 1-2 months and document the result in the employee's health record. An adequate anti-HBs result from a documented 3-dose vaccine series would assure not only seroprotection, but long-term protection. I'm a nurse who received the hepatitis B vac - cine series more than 10 years ago and had a positive follow-up titer (at least 10 mIU/mL). At present, my titer is negative (less than 10 mIU/ mL). What should I do now? Nothing. Data show that vaccine-induced anti-HBs levels might decline over time; however, immune memory (anamnestic anti-HBs response) remains intact following immunization. People with anti- HBs concentrations that decline to less than 10 mIU/mL are still protected against HBV infection. For HCP with normal immune status who have demonstrated adequate anti-HBs (at least 10 mIU/ mL) following full vaccination, booster doses of vaccine or periodic anti-HBs testing are not rec - ommended. A person who is a known non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine has a percutaneous expo - sure to HBsAg-positive blood. According to older ACIP recommendations, I have the op - tion to give HBIG x 2 or HBIG x 1 and initiate revaccination. How do I decide which to do? The current recommended postexposure prophy - laxis for people who are non-responders to hepatitis B vaccine (i.e., have not responded to an initial 3-dose series and revaccination with a 3-dose series) is to give HBIG as soon as possible after exposure and a second dose of HBIG one month later (see Table 1). If an employee does not respond to hepatitis B vaccination (employee has had two full series of hepatitis B vaccine), does s/he need to be removed from activities that expose her/him to bloodborne pathogens? Does the employer have a responsibility in this area beyond pro - viding vaccine? No. There are no regulations that require removal from job situations where exposure to bloodborne pathogens could occur; this is an individual policy decision within the organization. OSHA regula - tions require that employees in jobs where there is a reasonable risk of exposure to blood be offered hepatitis B vaccine. In addition, the regulation states that adequate personal protective equip - ment be provided and that standard precautions be followed. Check your state OSHA regulations regarding additional requirements. If there are no state OSHA regulations, federal OSHA regula - tions should be followed. Adequate documen - tation should be placed in the employee record regarding non-response to vaccination. HCP who do not respond to vaccination should be tested for HBsAg and total anti-HBc to determine if they have chronic HBV infection. If the HBsAg and total anti-HBc tests are positive, HCP should receive appropriate counseling for preventing transmission to others as well as referral for ongoing care to a specialist experienced in the medical manage - ment of chronic HBV infection. Persons who are HBsAg-positive and who perform exposure-prone procedures should seek counsel from a review pan - el comprised of experts with a balanced perspec - tive (e.g., infectious disease specialists and their personal physician[s]) regarding the procedures that they can perform safely. They should not be excluded from work. People who test negative for HBsAg should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled about precau - tions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to HBsAg-positive blood (see Table 1). Can a person with chronic HBV infection work in a healthcare setting? Yes. HCP should not be discriminated against because of their hepatitis B status. All HCP should practice standard precautions, which are designed to prevent HBV transmission, both from patients to HCP and from HCP to patient. There is, however, one caveat concerning HBV-infected HCP. Those who have HBV levels 1000 IU/mL or 5000 genomic equivalents/mL or higher should not perform exposure-prone procedures (e.g., gynecologic, cardiothoracic surgery) unless they have sought counsel from an expert review panel and been advised under what circumstances, if any, they may continue to perform these procedures.
