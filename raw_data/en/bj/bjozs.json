Named for SADO's long-serving and much- respected Norris J. Thomas, Jr., the award is given annually to a SADO attorney whose appellate advocacy achieves outstanding results for clients or the criminal justice system.

The devices - which are small enough to be portable - mimic cell-towers and can capture phone identification data, location information, and likely content without the phone-user being aware. In a few hours of driving around, the reporters were able to find 40 areas where the spying-devices were likely in use, including high-profile locations such as the Trump International Hotel, the Russian, Chinese, and Israeli embassies, and K Street, where many lobbyists may be found. The reporters estimated that about one-half of the devices in use were related to law enforcement or other governmental use. One security expert quoted in a recent article, Aaron Turner, said that phone-users cannot choose which cell-towers are used by their phones, but privacy precautions can be taken by using calling and texting apps that use encryption technology.
