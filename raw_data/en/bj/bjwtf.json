In 2010, there were about 600,000 cancer survivors in The Netherlands, expected to increase to 915,000 in 2020 1. Cancer has increasingly been referred to as a chronic disease since the majority (59%) of the pati ents survive relati vely long-term (>5 years aft 2. defi niti on of a 'cancer survivor' The concept of cancer survivorship and the populati on which the defi niti on covers has been widely discussed and interpreted over the last decades 3. Since the 1960's, when treatments started to improve, health care practi ti oners defi ned \"cancer survivors\" as those persons who had survived at least 5 years since initi al diagnosis or treatment 4. The number of cancer survivors increased further in the 1970's and 1980's and the US Nati onal Coaliti Cancer Survivorship (NCCS), a 'survivor-led advocacy organizati on' was founded. One of the founders of the NCCS, Fitzhugh Mullan, describes his personal experience as follows and populati on-based gures give us survival esti mates for various cancers, but those gures do not speak to the individual pati ent, whose experience is unique and not determined or described by aggregate data. Many pati ents are \"cured\" long before they pass the ve-year mark, and others go well beyond the ve-year point with overt or covert disease that removes them from the ranks of \"cured\", no matt er how well they feel. Survival is a much more useful concept, because it is a generic idea that applies to everyone diagnosed as having cancer, regardless of the course of illness. Survival, in fact, begins at the point of diagnosis, because that is the ti me when pati ents are forced to confront their own mortality and begin to make adjustments that will be part of their immediate, and to some extent, long-term future ' 5. The NCCS therefore defi nes a person diagnosed with cancer a survivor from the moment of diagnosis through the balance of his or her life 6. This defi niti on was also used by the Insti tute of Medicine (IOM) in their report \"Lost in transiti on\" 4 and was tute's Offi ce of Cancer Survivorship. The latt er however also included family members, friends, and caregivers since they are also impacted by the survivorship experience 4. In this thesis we use the defi niti on of the NCCS and IOM, focusing only on the cancer survivor, and not including relati ves or caregivers. This defi niti on shows that potenti ally anyone with a diagnosis of cancer can be a survivor. This defi niti on also raises the awareness of the need to consider issues of survival from the start of cancer treatment 4. CHAPTER 1 10Why study the fate of (long-term) cancer survivors? Scientific evaluations of new treatments and care protocols for cancer patients are traditionally based on biological outcomes, specifically disease-free and overall or relative survival 7. Although improving survival is an important issue in cancer treatment, evaluating (long-term) sequelae of treatment will finally determine the functional effectiveness of the treatment 8. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and other patient reported outcomes (PROs) are more and more recognized to be of importance 9, especially since many new treatments have only a marginal impact on survival rates, and many survivors face continuing physical and psychosocial problems after completion of primary treatment 7. Achieving and maintaining optimal well-being must be an important objective of current cancer treatment, cancer rehabilitation and aftercare.In the past decade a growing number of studies has documented the high prevalence of short-term effects (e.g. hair loss, pain, nausea and vomiting, anemia), long-term effects (e.g. fatigue, pain, memory problems and sexual dysfunction) and late effects (e.g. second malignancies, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis) of cancer treatment 10, 11. Furthermore, research shows that many survivors experience a decline in HRQoL, fear of recurrence, high levels of anxiety and depression, employment, insurance and financial problems and relationship difficulties 10, 12, 13. Due to these research findings concerns about long-term physical, psychosocial and economic effects of cancer and its treatment are increasingly being recognized and new therapies not only focus at maximizing cure but also at minimizing long-term effects. Up to now, most of these survivorship studies focused on survivors of common types of cancer like breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Thyroid cancer survivors: an underexposed group Although the knowledge about cancer survivorship has grown in the past decade, survivors of rare tumours, like thyroid cancer, so far received little attention in the cancer survivorship literature. Each year 500-600 patients are diagnosed with thyroid cancer in The Netherlands 2. Due to the increasing incidence and good prognosis of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (exceeding >90% 5-year survival) 14 the number of thyroid cancer survivors is increasing rapidly. In 2000, 3800 people survived thyroid cancer diagnosed in the past 20 years vs. 5500 in 2010, an increase of 45% 1. Treatment of thyroid cancer involves surgery, predominantly (near-) total thyroidectomy with or without lymphadenectomy, followed by radioiodine (iodine-131) therapy to ablate the remaining thyroid tissue. Depending on type and size of the tumour hemithyroidectomy could suffice. The removal of the whole thyroid gland is accompanied by a lifelong dependence on supplement therapy with exogenous thyroid hormone (levothyroxine), in the first years with dosing regimens suppressing thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) production 15, 16. Despite the efficacy of these primary treatments, 15-35% of the patients develop a locoregional recurrence or 1GENERAL INTRODUCTION 11distant metastases, even decades later 17. Therefore, intensive long-term periodical follow- up is necessary. Given the longevity of thyroid cancer survivors and the radical surgery and aggressive postoperati ve radioiodine treatment accompanied by a lifelong dependence on exogenous thyroid hormone, possible (long-term) physical and psychosocial problems are of considerable concern. However, the number of studies focusing on quality of life of (long-term) thyroid cancer survivors is limited. Cancer survivorship care: Informati on provision Survivorship care includes four components: (1) preventi on and detecti on of new cancers and recurrent cancer; (2) surveillance for cancer spread, recurrence, or second cancers; (3) interventi on for consequences of cancer and its treatment; and (4) coordinati on between specialists and primary care providers to ensure that all of the survivor's health needs are met 4. An essenti al factor of supporti ve cancer care across all four components is the provision of informati on. The goals of informati on provision are to assist pati ents in making treatment decisions, prepare pati ents for their treatment, increase treatment adherence and abiliti es to cope with the illness as well as to promote recovery 18, 19. Unti l the 1980s most doctors disclosed only selected informati on about cancer. With the introducti on of the concept of cancer survivorship in 1986, more att enti on has been paid to the informati on needs of cancer pati ents and their right to be fully informed, parti cularly in the Western world 20. Previous research showed that informati on needs are prevalent among cancer survivors and the majority (>80%) of cancer survivors even want to be fully informed 21-23. The nature of informati on needs is associated with the stage across the cancer conti nuum. During diagnosis and treatment the most prominent informati on needs are informati on about disease stage, treatment opti ons and side-eff ects of treatment. Post-treatment, pati ents report a conti nued need for treatment related informati on and also informati on about rehabilitati on is important 22. Other studies showed that socio-demographic and clinical factors like age, sex, disease stage, marital status, educati onal level and ethnicity, may also infl uence informati on needs 18. For example, younger age has been associated with more informati on needs and female survivors have reported more psychosocial informati on needs, while males have reported more informati on needs related to treatment 24. Furthermore, informati on needs might also vary as a functi on of adjustment to cancer and it is suggested that personality traits may inhibit or assist informati on seeking behavior 25, 26. A systemati c review showed that 6-93% of the cancer survivors report adequate informati on provision as an unmet need throughout the cancer conti nuum 27. Especially the informati on needs of cancer survivors post-treatment are unmet 22. This may be because health CHAPTER 1 12care providers do not have enough time and resources to inform patients appropriately. Furthermore, patients may have difficulty understanding the often complex information or have problems with processing the potentially upsetting information 25. In addition, there is a discrepancy between the actual information needs of cancer patients and the perception of health care providers about the needs of cancer patients 28. It is important that this discrepancy disappears, since the provision of tailored information, that is congruent with patients' needs, is an important determinant for patient satisfaction 29. Additionally, unmet information needs and dissatisfaction have been linked to negative PROs like increased emotional distress (anxiety and depression) and HRQoL 30, 31. However, the number of studies that investigated these associations is limited and inconclusive because of methodological flaws such as cross-sectional designs and use of self-developed and not yet validated questionnaires or single questions to assess information provision. aIms and OrganIza TIOn Of THIs THesIs The current thesis can be subdivided into two parts. Part I addresses the perceived level of, and satisfaction with, information received by cancer survivors in different stages of their disease and how this is related to PROs like HRQoL, distress (anxiety and depression) and illness perception. Part II addresses the (long-term) health-related quality of life of thyroid cancer survivors. Part I - Information provision and patient reported outcomes In the past decade, the role of information provision in (supportive) cancer care has been acknowledged. Throughout this thesis information provision is defined as all cancer-related information provided by the health care provider in oral, written or other form. Part I of this thesis is guided by the conceptual model presented in Figure 1. Investigating the current state of information provision and degree of satisfaction with information provision of cancer survivors is necessary to determine whether the information provision is sufficient, or whether improvements are necessary (centre of conceptual model). Therefore the aim of Chapter 2 was to assess the perceived level of and satisfaction with information received by melanoma cancer survivors with an internationally validated questionnaire 32. Furthermore, possible associations between clinical and socio-demographic characteristics and the perceived level of and satisfaction with received information were explored (left part of conceptual model). Furthermore individual differences in personality might be related to the perception of received information. Recently, a large amount of studies focused on the effects of Type D personality on clinical and psychological outcomes in different patient populations 33-35. A distressed personality (Type D) is defined by the combination of two personality traits; 1GENERAL INTRODUCTION 13the tendency to experience negati ve emoti (negati ve aff ecti vity) and to inhibit self- expression in social interacti on (social inhibiti on) 36. The combinati on of the two personality traits possibly makes Type D pati ents vulnerable for inadequate informati on provision, since they probably experience more negati ve emoti ons associated with medical informati on and will probably not ask for further informati on if their needs are not met. Therefore, diff erences in the perceived level of, and sati sfacti on with, informati on received by Type D and non-Type D cancer survivors of diverse cancer types were described in Chapter 3. Next to the clinical, socio-demographic and psychological factors that might infl uence the perceived level of and sati sfacti on with the received informati on, some PROs might have a bidirecti onal relati onship with informati on provision (right part of conceptual model). Several studies have investi gated the relati onship between informati on provision and HRQoL, anxiety and depression, Chapter 4 gives an overview of these studies. Pati ents respond to their illness by forming cogniti ve and emoti onal representati ons of the illness that lead to coping responses 37. These illness percepti ons are a major determinant of HRQoL 38 and are possibly associated with informati on provision. Therefore, the aim of Chapter 5 was to examine the associati on between illness percepti ons and informati on provision among a diverse group of 3080 cancer survivors. The studies included in our systemati c review focused on cancer survivors without advanced disease. Pati ents with metastasized cancer might have diff erent and percepti ons compared to pati ents with non-metastati c cancer. The objecti ve of Chapter 6 was to measure the perceived level of, and sati sfacti on with, informati on received by pati ents with metastati c (stage IV) colorectal cancer as with pati ents with non-metastati c (stage I,II,III) colorectal cancer. Furthermore, associati ons of informati on provision with HRQoL, anxiety and depression, and illness percepti ons were examined for pati ents with metastati c disease only. Perceived level of, and satisfaction with, information received Patient (including personality) , tumour (including disease stage), treatment and hospital characteristics Health -related quality of life Anxiety and depression Chapters 2,3,6 Chapters 4,6,7 Illness perception Chapter s 5, 6 Background characteristics Information provision Outcomes figure 1: Conceptual model of informati on provision and pati ent reported outcomes. The numbers indicate the chapter numbers of this thesis where the relati onship is discussed.CHAPTER 1 14Most studies described in the systematic review (Chapter 4) had a cross-sectional design and determination of causal associations was therefore difficult. The relationship between information provision and prospectively assessed HRQoL, anxiety and depression among a large group of lymphoma and multiple myeloma survivors was examined in Chapter 7. Part II - Thyroid cancer survivors: an understudied groupThe first aim of Part II of this thesis was to assess trends in incidence, mortality, and survival of thyroid cancer in The Netherlands between 1989 and 2009 (Chapter 8). This chapter shows that the prevalence of thyroid cancer is rising. Given the longevity of thyroid cancer survivors and the radical surgery and aggressive postoperative radioiodine treatment accompanied by a lifelong dependence on supplemental exogenous thyroid hormone, possible (long-term) physical and psychosocial problems are of considerable concern. In Chapter 9 the existing literature on HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors was systematically reviewed. The studies included in the review showed contradictory results and there were several methodological issues that impede drawing strong conclusions on the HRQoL of (long-term) thyroid cancer survivors. The main problem was the lack of a valid, thyroid cancer specific instrument to assess HRQoL. Most studies only used a general HRQoL questionnaire, which cannot capture the specific complaints associated with thyroid cancer and its treatment. The development of a thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire applicable in combination with the core questionnaire of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) 39 was described in Chapter 10. Since long-term thyroid cancer survivorship studies were lacking, the aim of Chapter 11 was to assess (thyroid cancer specific) HRQoL among long-term thyroid cancer survivors and to compare this with the HRQoL of an age- and sex-matched normative population. The second objective was to investigate which clinical and socio-demographic characteristics and thyroid cancer specific problems were associated with HRQoL.Fatigue is a common problem among patients with (subclinical) hyperthyroidism 40, as is the case for thyroid cancer survivors with suppressing doses of levothyroxine in the first years after surgery. It can therefore be expected that short-term thyroid cancer survivors (<5 years since diagnosis) report higher levels of fatigue compared to a normative population or long-term thyroid cancer survivors (5 years since diagnosis) who have returned to a euthyroid state. Up to now, no study has focused on the level of fatigue among thyroid cancer survivors. Therefore, the aim of Chapter 12 was to obtain insight into the prevalence of fatigue among short-term (<5 years) and long-term (5 years) thyroid cancer survivors, by comparing a sample of thyroid cancer survivors with an age- and sex-matched normative population. Furthermore, associations between clinical and socio-demographic characteristics and thyroid cancer specific problems with fatigue were assessed.1GENERAL INTRODUCTION 15In Chapter 13 the main fi ndings of this thesis will be discussed and implicati ons for future research and clinical practi ce will be outlined.

Husson, C. Holterhues, F. Mols, T. MELANOMA SURVIVORS 21madam, The incidence of melanoma is rapidly rising which can lead to an increasing burden for health care providers 1. Informati on provision is one of the most important aspects of supporti ve cancer care. Providing informati on that is congruent with pati ents' needs may lead to lower levels of distress, bett er quality of life, improved pati ent sati sfacti on and sense of control 2, 3. More disease knowledge can result in informed decision making and can have positi ve eff ects on treatment- and follow-up adherence leading to reduced follow-up visits 1. However, one of the most frequently reported unmet needs by cancer pati ents is informati on disclosure 4. There is a discrepancy between the actual informati on needs of cancer pati ents and the percepti on of health care providers about the needs of cancer pati ents 5. Health care providers are oft en sti ll reluctant to give the full amount of informati on about cancer and its treatment. Melanoma pati ents would appreciate especially more informati on concerning their diagnosis, treatment and skin conditi on 6. We conducted a cross-secti onal study to measure the perceived level of, and sati sfacti on with, informati on received 7. Pati ents diagnosed with melanoma between January 1st 1998 and August 1st 2007 from three regional hospitals were selected. Melanoma was defi ned using the ICD-O codes: C44.0-C44.9 specialists sent their (former) pati ents a lett er to inform them about the study and a questi onnaire. The EORTC-QLQ-INFO26 questi onnaire was used informati on received by melanoma pati ents 8. Of the 699 melanoma survivors, 562 (80.4%) returned a completed questi onnaire. There were no demographic or clinical diff erences between respondents and non-respondents. Demographics of parti cipati ng pati ents are presented in Table 1. A large percentage of pati ents indicated the absence of informati on about diff erent aspects of melanoma, treatment and aft ercare (Table 2). In multi variate linear regression analysis, none of the pati ent characteristi cs were signifi cantly associated with perceived informati on provision about the disease. More informati on about medical tests was associated with shorter ti me since diagnosis (\u00df = -0.10; p < 0.05) and a higher stage melanoma (\u00df = 0.19; p<0.01). More perceived informati on provision about treatment was signifi cantly independently associated with younger age (\u00df = -0.15; p<0.05), higher stage of disease (\u00df = p<0.01) and higher educational level (\u00df = -0.10; p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that satisfaction with information was independently associated with hospital of treatment (odds rati o, OR = 0.49 (95% CI 0.32-0.76), p<0.01), 0.63 (95% CI 0.41-0.99), p<0.05) and less frequent use of the internet for additi onal informati on (OR = 0.60 (95% CI 0.39-0.92), p<0.05). Pati ents with a higher disease stage are more likely to undergo more medical tests and/or treatments due to the increased risk of recurrence and metastasis. Therefore these pati ents might get more att enti on and informati on from their health care providers compared to pati ents with stage I melanoma. Also, the majority of melanoma pati ents receive most informati on immediately aft er diagnosis. Aft er the completi on of treatment the contacts of the pati ents with their doctor will diminish 3, while the informati on need of the melanoma survivor may sti ll exist. Pati ents diagnosed and treated shortly before the completi on of the questi onnaire, might have a clearer picture of the informati on they received and therefore reported to have received more informati on.

Older pati ents are reported to be less interested in detailed informati on and leave the provision of details up to the doctor 9. Likewise, doctors can be prejudiced against older pati ents. Furthermore, older and less educated pati ents may have more diffi culti es processing and remembering informati on they receive and may compensate for their reduced cogniti ve capacity by asking fewer questi ons to their specialist 9. The observed variati on in informati on sati sfacti on levels between pati ents treated in diff erent hospitals can be explained by the variati on in pati ent-centred informati on giving, which is strongly related to informati on recall and understanding. Our fi nding that only 25% of the melanoma survivors wanted more informati on could be explained by the increasing internet use of melanoma pati ents 10. When pati ents are not sati sfi ed with the informati on received from their health care provider, they will search for additi onal informati on on the internet. Health care providers oft en have limited ti me and resources to provide the informati on that melanoma pati ents require. With well-informed pati ents are more sati sfi ed with their care, and do bett er clinically, eff orts are needed to improve the informati on provision to melanoma pati ents. Explorati on of the pati ents personal on needs must lead to a more pati ent-tailored approach of informing melanoma pati ents. A good opportunity would be the implementati on of a survivorship care plan, which aims at providing a cancer survivor with a summary of their course of treatment, management of late eff ects, and strategies for health promoti on.CHAPTER 2 24Table 2: Perceived information provision characteristics (N (%)) received no informationreceived a little informationreceived quite somewhat informationreceived a lot of information disease Diagnosis 47 (9%) 309 (56%) 154 (28%) 41 (7%) Spread disease 104 (19%) 271 (49%) 135 (25%) 37 (7%) Cause disease 203 (37%) 226 (41%) 103 (19%) 17 (3%) Under control 76 (14%) 258 (47%) 164 (30%) 48 (9%) medical tests Purpose test 134 (25%) 220 (41%) 157 (29%) 29 (5%) Course test 125 (23%) 237 (44%) 144 (27%) 32 (6%) Results test 74 (14%) 237 (44%) 188 (35%) 38 (7%) Treatment Medical (34%) 202 (38%) 122 (23%) 25 (5%) Side effects 333 (62%) 131 (25%) 56 (10%) 14 (3%) Expected results symptoms288 (54%) 163 (31%) 65 (12%) 14 (3%) life423 (6%) (1%) (1%) help 484 36 6 2 (5%) 3 (1%) 2 (0%) single items Different care locations 472 (91%) 38 (7%) 9 (2%) 3 (0%) Things to do get better399 (76%) 92 (18%) 25 (5%) 7 (1%) not satisfied a little satisfied Quite satisfied satisfied Satisfaction with information72 (13%) 259 (48%) 164 (30%) 46 (9%) not useful a little useful Quite useful Very useful Usefulness information 43 (8%) 224 (43%) 194 (38%) 57 (11%) Yes no Received written information279 (52%) 259 Received information on video or (99%) Wanted more information 10 AMONG MELANOMA SURVIVORS 25referenCes 1.

Mols 3 28abs Tra CT Objective: Optimal information provision is important in cancer survivorship, but satisfaction with this provision may depend upon individual differences in personality. We examined the effect of personality traits negative affectivity and social inhibition and their combined effect (Type D personality) on satisfaction with information received. methods: Four population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted through the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR). All individuals diagnosed with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, endometrial cancer or colorectal cancer (1998-2008) as registered in the ECR were eligible for participation. In total, 4446 patients, received questionnaires including the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 and the Type D personality scale (DS14); 69% responded (n=3080). results: Nineteen percent of patients (n=572) had a Type D personality. On the information provision subscales of the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 (scale 0-100), the perceived receipt of disease specific (mean 46 vs. 51), medical test (56 vs. 63) and treatment information (37 vs. 42) was significantly lower for Type D patients compared to non-Type Ds (all Ps<0.01). Type D cancer patients were less satisfied with the received information (49 vs. 58;p<0.01) and found the received information less useful (55 vs. 61;p<0.01) compared to non-Type Ds. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that Type D personality was independently associated with information about the disease (Beta=-0.09), medical tests (Beta=-0.12) and treatment (Beta=-0.08) and with satisfaction with information received (Odds ratio=0.54; 95%CI=0.44-0.66;all Ps<0.01). Conclusions: This study showed that patients with a Type D personality perceived to receive less information and reported less satisfaction with the amount of received information as compared to non-Type D patients. 3INFORMATION PROVISION AND TYPE D PERSONALITY 29InTrOduCTIOn Providing cancer pati ents with appropriate informati on is one of the most important aspects of cancer care across the whole cancer conti nuum. Informati on provision is defi ned as all cancer-related informati on provided by the health care provider/nurse in oral, writt en or other form 1. Adequate informati on provision can result in informed decision making, bett er treatment adherence, bett er health-related quality of life (HRQoL), lower levels of distress, improved sati sfacti on with care and sense of control 1, 2. However, one of the most frequently reported unmet needs by cancer pati ents in all phases of the disease is informati on provision 3. This indicates that health care providers and pati ents diff er in their percepti ons of informati on needs 4 and diff erences between health care providers in communicati on skills 5. Informati on provision can be diffi cult since medical informati on is oft en complex and someti mes emoti onally charged (e.g. likelihood of survival) 6. The majority of cancer pati ents want as much informati on as possible about their disease, treatment and rehabilitati on 7. However, informati on needs vary by sex, age, cultural background, ti me since diagnosis, educati onal level, disease stage and as a functi on of adjustment to cancer 6, 8. There also may exist substanti al diff erences in the informati on needs of cancer pati ents as a functi on of underlying individual diff erences in personality. It has been suggested that personality characteristi cs may inhibit or assist informati on seeking 9. Studies have shown that personality characteristi cs such as high internal locus of control, self-esteem and self-effi cacy are shown to contribute positi vely to informati on seeking 10-12, while nervousness formed an obstacle for seeking informati on for 20% of cancer pati ents 13. Informati on seeking is frequently described as a coping mechanism, where pati ents with a monitoring style tend to require more informati on and pati ents with a blunti ng style feel bett er with less informati on 14. However, litt le research to date has focused on the area of personality and informati on provision in cancer survivorship. Recently, a large amount of studies focused on the eff ects of Type D personality on clinical and psychological outcomes in diff erent pati ent populati ons 15-17. A distressed personality (Type D) is defi ned by the combinati on of two personality traits; the tendency to experience negati ve emoti ons (negati ve aff ecti vity) and to inhibit self-expression in social interacti on (social inhibiti on) 18. Studies showed that cancer pati ents with a Type D personality experience a lower quality of life and mental health status 19, report higher rates of comorbid conditi ons and to report to feel more bothered by these conditi ons 20. Also, pati ents with a Type D personality had more negati ve percepti ons about their illness, were more concerned about their illness and felt that their disease more oft en infl uenced them emoti onally 21. A possible explanati on for these negati ve illness percepti ons is that there might be a diff erence CHAPTER 3 30in the perceived receipt of information between cancer patients with and without a Type D personality, however research on this topic is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was t o evaluate differences in the perceived level of, and satisfaction with, information received by Type D and non-Type D cancer patients. We hypothesized that Type D patients would indicate to receive less information and to be less satisfied with it as compared to non-Type D patients, since they probably experience more negative emotions (for example anxiety, sadness, anger, depression, guilt) associated with medical information (negative affectivity) and will probably not ask for further information if their needs are not met (social inhibition) . meTHOds setting and Participants For this study, data from four large population-based cross-sectional surveys on patients of endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma and multiple myeloma was used 22- 26. These surveys were set up between 2008 and 2009 with the goal to evaluate various patient-reported outcomes among cancer patients. Data collection was done within PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship). PROFILES is a registry for the study of the physical and psychosocial impact of cancer and its treatment from a dynamic, growing population-based cohort of both short- and long-term cancer survivors 22. PROFILES contains a large web-based component and is linked directly to clinical data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR), which compiles data of all individuals newly diagnosed with cancer in the southern part of the Netherlands, an area with 10 hospitals serving 2.3 million inhabitants 27. Data from the PROFILES registry will be available for non-commercial scientific research, subject to study question, privacy and confidentiality restrictions, and registration (www.profilesregistry.nl).All individuals diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma between 1999-2008 or with endometrial cancer or colorectal cancer between 1998-2007 as registered in the ECR were eligible for participation. However due to the large number of colorectal cancer patients (n=5399) a weighted random selection of 2219 patients based on tumour, sex, and year of diagnosis was made 25, 26. We excluded those patients who had cognitive impairment (based on medical records and advice attending specialist), had unverifiable addresses or had died prior to start of study (according to the ECR, hospital records, and the Central Bureau for Genealogy which collects information on all deceased Dutch citizens via the civil municipal registries). All the studies were approved by the certified Medical Ethics Committee of the Maxima Medical Centre in the Netherlands.3INFORMATION PROVISION AND TYPE D PERSONALITY 31data collecti on Details of the PROFILES data collecti on method have been described previously 22. In summary, pati ents were informed about the study via a lett er from their (ex)-att ending specialist. The lett er explained that by completi the questi to and agreed to the linkage of the questi onnaire data with their disease history in the ECR. Non-respondents were sent a reminder lett er and questi onnaire within two months. sociodemographic characteristi cs Pati ents' sociodemographic and clinical from The ECR routi nely collects data on tumour characteristi cs, including date of diagnosis, tumour grade according to the Tumour-Node-Metastasis clinical classifi cati on 28, clinical stage 28, treatment, and pati ent background characteristi cs including date of birth and comorbidity at the ti me of diagnosis. Questi ons on marital status, educati onal level, and current occupati on were added to the questi onnaire. Informati on provision To evaluate the informati pati ents, the questi onnaire incorporates four informati on provision scales and eight single items. The scales are as follows: 1) perceived receipt of informati on about the disease (four items regarding diagnosis, spread of disease, cause(s) of disease and whether the disease is under control), 2) medical tests (three items regarding purpose, procedures and results of tests), 3) treatment (six items regarding medical treatment, benefi ts, side-eff ects, eff ects on disease symptoms, social life and sexual acti vity) and 4) other care services (four items regarding additi onal help, rehabilitati on opti ons, managing illness at home, psychological support). The questi on format was as follows: \"During your current disease or treatment, how much informati on have you received on\". The single questi ons concerned the perceived receipt of writt en informati on or informati on on CDs or tape/video, wanti ng to receive more or less informati on, and the sati sfacti on with the, amount of, and helpfulness of informati on. The answer categories of the items ''not four items which had a dichotomous (yes/no) scale. Aft er linear transformati on, all scales and items range in scores from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicati ng bett er perceived informati on provision 2. The questi onnaire has been internati onally validated, and internal consistency for all scales is good (a > 0.70), as is test-retest reliability (intraclass correlati ons > 0.70) 29. Apart from the EORTC-QLQ- INFO25 questi onnaire, two single questi ons about the use of Internet for seeking additi onal informati on were added (i.e., ''Do you make use of the Internet?'' and ''Have you used the CHAPTER 3 32Internet to look for information about cancer?''), which could be answered with either yes or no. Type d Personality Type D personality was measured with the 14-item Type D Personality Scale (DS14) 18. The DS14 is self-administered and takes only a few minutes to complete. The 14 items of this scale are answered on a 5-point response scale ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (true). Seven of these items refer to \"Negative Affectivity\" (NA) or the tendency to experience negative emotions in general. The remaining 7 items refer to the patient's level of \"Social Inhibition\" (SI) or the tendency to inhibit the expression of emotions in social relationships. Patients were categorized as having a Type D personality using a standardized previously established cut-off score of \u00b310 on both the NA and SI subscales 18, item response theory analyses showed that the DS14 has the highest information around this point 30. The DS14 is a valid and reliable scale with Cronbach's of 0.87/0.88 in our study sample and a test-retest reliability over a 3-month period of r = 0.72/0.82 for the two subscales, respectively 18. statistical analyses Routinely collected data from the ECR on patient and tumour characteristics enabled us to compare the group of respondents, non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. Furthermore, differences in sociodemographic, clinical characteristics and single items of the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 between patients with and without a Type D personality were also analyzed using ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. The mean subscale scores of the EORTC QLQ-INFO25, stratified by 1) Type D personality, 2) non-Type D personality, were compared by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Confounding background variables included for adjustment in these analyses were determined a priori 31 and chosen to be age, sex, years since diagnosis, comorbidity, primary treatment (radiotherapy/chemotherapy) and educational level since previous studies have shown that these factors are related to information provision 23, 24, 32, 33. Also, the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 subscale mean scores, stratified by 1) Type D personality (NA+/SI+), 2) SI only (NA-/SI+), 3) NA only (NA+/SI-) 4) the reference group (NA-/SI-), were compared with ANCOVA adjusted for the same variables as described above.Four multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to investigate the independent association of Type D personality with the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 subscales and one logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the independent association of Type D personality with satisfaction with the amount of received information (dichotomized item). For the logistic regression analysis, patients were categorized into two groups: (a) patients 3INFORMATION PROVISION AND TYPE D PERSONALITY 33who were unsati sfi ed or only a sfi ed, classifi ed as sati sfi ed. All regression analyses were adjusted for clinical (years since diagnosis, tumour type treatment, comorbiditi es) and demographic (age, sex, educati onal level and marital status) variables and internet use for additi onal informati on since previous studies have shown that these factors are related to informati on provision 23, 24, 32, 33. All stati sti cal tests were two-sided and considered signifi cant if p < 0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (Stati sti cal Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). resulTs respondents and non-respondents Three thousand and eighty (69.3%) pati ents returned a completed questi onnaire. respondents, non-respondents and pati ents unverifi able addresses indicated that pati ents with unverifi able addresses were younger, with more years since diagnosis, and they were less oft en treated with surgery, and less oft en diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Non-respondents were more oft en female, and were less oft en treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy 19. Type d, sociodemographic and clinical characteristi cs Nineteen percent (n=572) of the respondents could be classifi ed as having a Type D personality, 13% (n=406) scored above the cut-off for NA only (NA+/SI-) and 17% (n=512) for SI only (NA-/SI+). characteristi cancer pati ents, strati fi ed by pati ents with 1) Type D personality (NA+/SI+), 2) SI only (NA-/SI+), 3) NA only (NA+/SI-) 4) the reference group (NA-/SI-) are presented in Table 1. Pati ents with high NA only were more oft en female compared to the other three groups. Type D cancer pati ents and pati ents with high NA only more oft en reported comorbid diseases compared to cancer pati ents with high SI only and the reference group. No signifi cant diff erences between the groups were found in age, years since diagnosis, stage of disease, marital status, educati onal level, current occupati on. Perceived informati on provision The single questi ons of the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 showed that most pati ents (69%) indicated that they received quite a bit or very much informati on about the diagnosis (Table 2). Around a third (31%) of the cancer pati ents stated that they were not or a litt le informed about the medical treatment of their cancer, almost half (47%) of the pati ents were not or a litt le informed about the expected results of treatment and 55% of the pati ents indicated that they did not receive any informati on on the possible side eff ects of their treatment.

Only a few cancer pati ents (8-18%) indicated that they received quite a bit or very much informati on about other services (e.g. psychological support, additi onal help outside the hospital) or things to do to improve their health (23%).Overall, 41% of the pati ents were a litt le sati sfi ed with the informati on they received and 35% found the informati on a litt le or not useful at all. Almost a quarter of the pati ents wanted to receive more informati on regarding the cause of their cancer, complicati ons and long-term eff ects of treatment, aft er care and coping with the disease, and overall informati on on cancer. More than two-thirds of the pati ents (71%) stated that they received writt en informati The internet was used of which 1090 to search for additi onal informati on about their cancer. Type d and perceived informati on provision Type D cancer pati ents indicated that they received less informati on on all single items of the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 compared to non-Type D cancer pati ents (p<0.01), except for expected results of treatment on social and sexual life, psychological assistance and other care locati ons. There were no signifi cant diff erences D pati ents in for additi onal informati on (39% vs. 36%). A greater percentage of Type D cancer pati ents wanted more informati on p<0.01).The ANCOVA revealed a signifi cant eff ect of Type D personality on the subscales disease specifi c informati on, medical test informati on, treatment informati on, sati sfacti on with received informati on, and usefulness of informati on, aft er adjustment for diff erences in age, sex, years aft er diagnosis, comorbidity, primary treatment (radiotherapy/chemotherapy) and educati onal level (all p<0.01).

Results showed that Type D cancer pati ents perceived to receive less informati on about medical tests and score lower on sati sfacti on with the amount of received informati on and usefulness of the informati on compared to the three other groups (all p<0.01). The perceived receipt of disease and treatment informati on was lower for Type D cancer pati ents compared to the reference group and pati ents with NA only (all p<0.01).

Logisti c regression analysis showed that Type D personality was negati vely associated with sati sfacti on with informati on (Table 4).Younger age, less years since diagnosis and undergoing chemotherapy were also associated with more perceived informati on about the disease, medical tests and treatment. Higher educati onal level and internet use for additi onal informati on were associated with more informati on about the disease and medical tests, while having one or more comorbid diseases was associated with less informati on about the disease and treatment. Undergoing radiotherapy was associated with more informati on about the treatment. Finally, less years since diagnosis, chemotherapy, no comorbiditi es and higher educati onal level were associated with more sati sfacti on with the received informati on (Table 4). dIsCussIOn To our knowledge, this is the fi rst study that reported on the relati onship between Type D personality and informati on provision among cancer pati ents. The perceived receipt of informati on, and the sati sfacti on with and usefulness of the received informati on were low in general and even lower for cancer pati ents with a Type D personality. The perceived receipt of informati on was lower for Type D cancer pati ents compared to pati ents with high scores on NA or SI only and pati ent with low scores on both NA and SI, also aft er controlling for demographical and clinical variables. The results were in agreement with our hypotheses.

Individuals with a Type D personality tend to use more maladapti ve, passive coping strategies such as resignati on, denial, avoidance or withdrawal 34-36 and will not seek for support and informati on acti vely 36. Even if the doctor gives a large amount of informati on, it might be possible that the passive coping style leads to inadequate informati on processing, whereby the relevant informati on will not be picked up. Previous research showed that people experiencing higher levels of negati ve aff ect had diffi culty with their att empts to access, obtain, and understand cancer informati on 37. Individuals with high scores on neuroti cism, who might also have high scores on NA 18, have a preference for informati on that reassures them 38 and will probably not seek out other informati on. Cancer related informati on might be judged as threatening by pati ents with high scores on NA and this will probably be accompanied by the experience of more negati ve emoti ons. The experience of negati ve emoti ons requires energy and can distract att enti on and diminish concentrati on. The recall of the received informati on could therefore be hindered. The perceived receipt of less informati on by Type D cancer pati ents could have resulted in lower levels of sati sfacti on with the received informati on and their indicati on that they wanted to receive more informati on as compared to non-Type D cancer pati ents.Furthermore, pati ents with a Type D personality tend to be more socially withdrawn than non-Type D's, resulti ng in less social support 39. Social support of a companion during the doctor- pati ent conversati on has been found to increase pati ent understanding and involvement in consultati on 40, and will possibly also aff ect the recall of informati on. Previous studies also showed that one aspect of SI is feeling insecure and less competent when communicati ng with others 35, 41. These feelings might result in a lower willingness to ask questi ons during a consultati on. Type D pati ents may not follow through to get the informati on from their health care provider when their informati on needs are not met. Another interesti ng observati on in this context is that the perceived receipt of writt en informati on and the use of internet to search for additi onal informati on did not diff er between Type D and non-Type D cancer pati ents in our study. This supports the idea that Type D cancer pati ents are less competent in acti vely communicati ng with their health care provider. In additi on, the informati on needs of cancer pati ents with a Type D personality might diff er from the needs of non-Type Ds, since a recent study showed that Type D cancer pati ents experienced worse illness percepti ons and found their illness less comprehensible compared to non-Type Ds 20. Future research should try to identi fy the specifi c informati on needs of cancer pati ents with a Type D personality. The Type D scale can probably be used as a screening tool in cancer pati ents to identi fy subgroups at risk for inadequate informati on provision. Type D cancer pati ents may benefi t from behavioural interventi ons that are aimed towards reducing maladapti ve coping strategies such as withdrawal 15. Such an interventi on should focus on CHAPTER 3 40the empowerment of Type D patients to increase their health control and to reduce negative emotions 36. Giving special attention to patients with a Type D personality is important because both inadequate information provision and Type D personality are independently associated with worse health outcomes 1, 17, 42-44. It would also be interesting to investigate in future research whether health care practitioners identify Type D patients as a difficult group to work with. This study has some limitations that should be noted. Although information was present concerning the demographic and clinical characteristics of the non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses, whether non-respondents more often had a Type D personality remains unknown. In addition, although Type D personality is a stable construct 45, the cross-sectional study design limits the determination of causal associations between the study variables. Furthermore, the validity of the cut-off scores used for the dichotomization of Type D personality has not been tested in cancer patients. Recent taxometric analyses have suggested that Type D may be better represented as a dimensional construct 46. This does not necessarily imply that dichotomization is inappropriate. The Type D construct has never inferred a true taxon that is defined by discontinuity between groups on an underlying dimension, and individuals belong only probabilistically to Type D and non Type D categories 16. Rather, Type D refers to similar patterns of standing along the NA and SI dimensions that do occur across patients, and dichotomization helps to identify Type D patients who are more similar to their subgroup's personality profile than non-Type D patients. Dimensional and categorical approaches to Type D do not need be to mutually exclusive, but rather represent two different ways of capturing psychological tendencies of individuals that warrant more research 47. Also, this study relies on self-report measures of information provision and it is not clear how much information was actually provided. The passive coping style of Type D cancer patients, including denial and avoidance, could lead to underreporting of the received information. It would therefore also be interesting to compare data on actual information provision with self-report data from questionnaires. Furthermore, the mean time since diagnosis was 4.6 years, which could hinder the recall of information received. Patients often forget a substantial amount of the information given because the information is complex and emotionally charged 48. Since the patients in the current study can be described as patients who are out of the acute phase of medical treatment and decision making, the results cannot be generalized to patients who are in the midst of their treatment phase or shortly after treatment completion. For future research, it would be interesting to compare the responses of patients in the midst of their treatment to determine possible differences between Type D and non-Type D's in recall bias.3INFORMATION PROVISION AND TYPE D PERSONALITY 41A frequently reported unmet need is informati on about aft er care 3. In our study the perceived receipt of informati on about other services was low for all pati ents and we therefore could not identi fy between Type D and non-Type D pati ents on this scale. One of the strengths of our study is the high response rate among the diff erent populati on-based tumour groups that facilitates generalizing the to a larger populati on of cancer pati ents. In additi on, we evaluated a broad spectrum of possible confounding factors, including age at ti me survey, years since diagnosis, sex, marital status, educati onal level, primary treatment and comorbidity. In conclusion, this study showed that pati ents with a Type D personality perceived to receive less informati on and reported less sati sfacti on with the amount of received informati on as compared to non-Type D pati ents. Future research could focus on the eff ecti veness of tailored communicati on possibly in combinati on with a behavioral interventi on to teach Type D pati ents how to deal with cancer related informati on.CHAPTER 3 42referenCes 1.

Husson, F. information, that is congruent with patients' needs is an important determinant for patient satisfaction and might also affect health related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and depression levels of cancer survivors. design: The authors systematically reviewed the available literature on the relationship between information provision and health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression. A PubMed literature search for original articles published until February 2010 was performed. Twenty-six articles, all conducted between 1996 and 2009, which met the predefined inclusion criteria, were subjected to a quality checklist. results: Satisfied patients, patients with fulfilled information needs, and patients who experience less information barriers, in general have a better HRQoL and less anxiety and depression. Out of eight intervention studies that aimed to improve information provision, only one showed a positive association with better HRQoL. Conclusion: Health care providers must pay more attention to patient-centered information provision. Additional research is needed to make definitive conclusions about information interventions, as most results did not reach statistical significance due to methodological constraints. The quick development of the relatively young research field of patient reported outcomes in cancer survivorship will make it possible to conduct better quality studies in the future.4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 47InTrOduCTIOn The provision of informati on to pati ents is one of the most important factors of supporti ve cancer care, across the whole cancer conti nuum. The goal of providing informati on is to prepare pati ents for their treatment, to increase adherence to therapy and to increase their abiliti es to cope with the illness and to promote recovery 1. However, the results of a systemati c review show that 6 to 93 percent of the cancer pati ents report adequate informati on provision as an unmet need throughout their cancer experience 2. Pati ents frequently report barriers to receive the informati on needed 3. Health care providers are oft en sti ll reluctant to give the full amount of informati on about cancer and its treatment, while the majority of cancer pati ents want as much informati on as possible about their disease, treatment and rehabilitati on 3. The informati on needs of cancer pati ents vary by gender, age, cultural background, educati onal level, cancer type, stage of disease and coping style 4, 5. Providing informati on, that is congruent with pati ents' needs is an important determinant for pati ent sati sfacti on and might also aff ect health related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety and depression levels of cancer pati ents. HRQoL is a multi dimensional construct that covers the pati ents' percepti ons of his or her physical, emoti onal, social, and cogniti ve functi ons. HRQoL assessment is an important aspect of cancer care. HRQoL parameters providing prognosti c informati on can facilitate clinical decision making in terms of bett er treatment selecti on for cancer pati ents 6-8. Furthermore, cancer survivors oft en deal with adaptati on problems and assessment of their HRQoL could help to improve aft ercare 9. Cancer survivors experience high levels of psychological distress; a range of feelings and emoti ons that people experience in reacti on to cancer including depression and anxiety, with an important impact on HRQoL 10, 11. In the last decade, the role of informati on provision in cancer care has been acknowledged. Several studies have investi gated the relati onship between informati on provision and HRQoL, anxiety and depression, but results seem inconsistent 12. The evaluati on of a possible relati onship between HRQoL and informati on provision is diffi cult because of the conceptualizati on of both constructs and methodological challenges in measuring these constructs. Throughout this review, informati on provision is defi ned as all cancer related informati on provided by the health care provider/nurse in oral, writt en or other form. From the perspecti ve of the pati ent, informati on provision is mostly measured in terms of 'sati sfacti on with received quality' and 'informati on clarity'. Importantly, this review did not focus on informati on disclosure regarding the initi al cancer diagnosis or end of life issues. The goal of our review is to provide a complete overview of the literature on the impact of informati on on the HRQoL, anxiety and depression levels of cancer survivors. We used the defi niti on of CHAPTER 4 48the US National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship that defines a person as a survivor from the moment of diagnosis through the balance of his or her life (http://www.canceradvocacy.org/about/org/). We hypothesize that better information provision (fulfilled needs, less barriers, clear and high quality information) is related to higher satisfaction levels of cancer survivors regarding information which may impact HRQoL, especially mental health, anxiety and depression levels. meTHOds search strategy A computerized search of the literature through the search engines Pubmed and PsychINFO was performed on December 3, 2009. The search strategy combined the term 'cancer' with other key terms related to information provision and HRQoL. For 'information provision' we included the terms information, information provision, information disclosure, information needs, information satisfaction, information level, information barriers, written information, oral information, audiotape information, CDROM. For the constructs of HRQoL, anxiety and depression we included the terms quality of life, health related quality of life, health status, well-being, anxiety and depression. The reference lists of all identified publications were checked to retrieve other relevant publications, which were not identified by means of the computerized search. There were no restrictions with regard to the years of publication. The search yielded 5732 hits. selection criteria Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) if they evaluated the relation between information provision and HRQoL, anxiety and depression in adult cancer survivors, and this evaluation was one of the key objectives of the study (2) if the publication was an original article (e.g. no poster abstract, letter to the editor etc.), (3) if the article was a full report published in English and (4) if it was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: (1) if they were individual case reports or articles that reviewed the literature, (2) if the study was focused on end-stage cancer patients (terminal ill patients), because this patient group is dealing with specific end-of-life issues, (3) if the study focused on communication aspects (e.g. body language), (4) if the study focused on information provision to family members, (5) if the study focused on diagnosis or prognosis as primary information measure, or if (6) HRQoL was measured with one single item and was not a part of a validated questionnaire.4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 49 Computerized search of databases and reference checking 5695 articles excluded due to selection criteria and removal of duplicate articles* 37 articles potential applicable Hard copies were obtained for more detailed evaluation of our selection criteria After applying our selection criteria to the hard copies, 25 articles were selected and were finally selected for this review Articles excluded because: - focused on diagnosis (9) - HRQoL was measured with one single item and was not a part of a validated figure 1: Flow diagram of papers accepted and rejected during selecti on procedure. * The selecti on criteria are described in the methods secti on. The described inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to our initi al 5732 hits. Based on their ti tles and abstracts, 37 arti cles met our criteria. The 37 hard copies were obtained and reviewed by three investi gators. Aft er careful review, 25 arti cles fulfi lled our selecti on criteria and were included in this review 12-36. The fl ow-chart of this selecti on procedure is shown in Figure 1. Quality assessment The methodological quality of each of the selected arti cles was independently assessed, by all three investi gators based on established criteria for systemati c reviews (Table 1) 37, 38. Each item of a selected study, that matched our criteria, was assigned one point. If an item did not meet our criteria or was described insuffi ciently or not at all, zero points were assigned. The highest possible score was 13. Studies scoring 10 points or more were arbitrarily considered to be of 'high quality'. Studies scoring between 6 and 10 points were rated as 'adequate quality'. Studies scoring less than 6 points were considered to be of 'low quality'.CHAPTER 4 50Table 1: List of criteria for assessing the methodological quality of studies on HRQoL, anxiety, depression and information provision among cancer survivors Positive if with respect to HRQoL 1. A valid (health-related) quality of life, health status, anxiety or depression questionnaire is used. If items were deleted from the valid questionnaire, the new questionnaire must be validated. Information assessment 2. A valid \"information provision\" questionnaire is used. If items were deleted from the valid questionnaire, the new questionnaire must be validated. Study population 3. A description is included of at least two socio-demographic variables (e.g., age, employment status, educational status). 4. A description is included of at least two clinical variables of the described patient population (e.g., tumour stage at diagnosis, treatment). 5. Inclusion and/or exclusion criteria are described. 6. Participation and response rates for patient groups have to be described and have to be more than 75%. 7. Information is given about the degree of selection of the patient sample (information is given about the ratio respondents versus non-respondents). Study design 8. The study size is consisting of at least 50 patients (arbitrarily chosen). 9. The data is prospectively gathered.10. The process of data collection is described (e.g., interview or self-report etc.). Results 11. The results are compared between two groups or more (e.g., healthy population, groups with different treatment or age) and/or results are compared between at least two time points (e.g., pre- versus post- treatment). 12. Mean, median, standard deviations or percentages are reported for the most important outcome measures. 13. Statistical proof for the findings is reported. resul Ts study characteristics In total, 25 studies were included, all published between April 1996 and December 2009. Different questionnaires with different outcome measures to assess HRQoL, anxiety and depression were used. All studies used different instruments to measure one or more aspects of information provision. Prospective, cross-sectional, observational as well as intervention studies were included. The main findings are summarized in Table 2. 4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 51methodological quality The evaluati on of the methodological quality of the studies by the three reviewers yielded disagreement on some items, mostly due to diff erences in interpretati on. These were solved through discussion in a consensus meeti ng. The quality scores ranged from 7 to 13 points (Table 2) and the mean quality score was 9.6. None of the studies had a low quality. Thirteen studies had a high quality 15, 17, 21, 22, 24, 26-28, 30, 31, 35, 36. The remaining twelve studies had an adequate quality 12-14, 16, 18-20, 25, 29, 32-34. General shortcomings of the included arti cles were the absence of a validated \"informati on\" questi onnaire, absence of informati on about the degree of selecti on of the pati ent sample, a cross-secti onal design, and the lack of comparison between two groups or ti me points. Health-related quality of life Fift een studies, 5 prospecti ve and 10 cross-secti onal, examined the relati 12-14, on between informati on sati sfacti on and HRQoL 12, 27, 35. A Swedish study of 36 pati ents with a carcinoid tumour, showed a between sati of informati on and emoti onal functi on and global quality of life (QoL) at three of the four ti me points 12. In a study among 82 head and neck cancer pati ents, sati sfacti on with informati on before treatment was predicti ve of bett er Mental Component Summary scores 6-8 months aft er the end of treatment, but not to the Physical Component Summary scores 27. The third study among 211 Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma pati ents found that more sati sfacti on with the medical informati on provided one month aft er the end of radiotherapy, was related to a bett er QoL four months later 35. Two other prospecti ve studies focused on the clarity and quality of the informati on provided, and the need for informati on. Breast cancer pati ents reporti ng unclear informati on provision scored signifi cantly worse, up to 4 years aft er diagnosis, on 17 of the 27 QoL variables, including emoti onal functi oning, cancer pati ents who rated their level of informati on at baseline as high, experienced higher quality of life aft er three (p < .001) and six months (p = .049) 36. Overall, prospecti ve studies showed that sati sfi ed pati ents, pati ents who reported to receive clear and high levels of informati on, reported bett er mental HRQoL and global HRQoL. Positi ve associati ons between informati on provision and physical HRQoL have not been found. Five out of six cross-secti onal studies found a positi ve relati on on sati sfacti on and HRQoL 13, 17-20, 28. Two studies among breast cancer survivors found a strong positi ve associati on between sati sfacti on with treatment and survivorship informati on and mental health and vitality 20, 28. A Briti sh study among 102 breast cancer and 112 prostate cancer pati ents concluded that aft er controlling for demographic and disease characteristi cs, CHAPTER 4 52information satisfaction explained 21% of the variance in global QoL, in physical being, social in emotional well-being, and 10% in functional well-being (all p < 0.001) 18. This study, and an Italian study among a varied sample of 175 cancer patients, also found a positive association between satisfaction with information received and QoL 13, 18. Besides, the Italian study found no differences in QoL of adequately versus inadequately informed patients 13. A French study of cancer patients with different diagnoses showed that higher global scores for QoL were related to higher satisfaction with all aspects of care, including the information provision 17. Contradictory, lower physical and emotional functioning also predicted higher satisfaction with the doctors' information provision in this study. One cross-sectional study among 30 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy found no differences in QoL between satisfied and dissatisfied patients 19. Four other cross-sectional studies focused on the clarity and quality of the information provided, and the need for information 14, 16, 29, 34. Worse physical and emotional functioning were significantly associated with worse ratings of information quality, more barriers to obtain information and a greater need for information in two large American studies among a sample of diverse cancer survivors 16, 29. Breast cancer patients who reported greater difficulty in accessing needed information or had greater unmet information needs experienced lower emotional, functional, and social well-being and worse physical, cognitive and role functioning as well as lower perceptions of health competence (p<0.01) 14, 34. In the cross-sectional studies better mental, physical and global HRQoL were associated with fulfilled informational needs, satisfaction with the received information, the receipt of good quality and clear information and less information barriers. However, one study found no difference in HRQoL 19 and one study reported conflicting results 17. anxiety and depression Five studies, three prospective and two cross-sectional, focused on anxiety and depression in relation to information provision 12, 25, 27, 33, 36. A study of 82 head- and neck cancer patients found satisfaction with information before treatment, to be predictive of depression but not anxiety, 6-8 months after the end of treatment 27. However, a study of 36 carcinoid tumour patients found a negative relation between satisfaction with doctors' provision of information and anxiety and depression at the first three of four time points (T1-T3) 12. Breast cancer patients who rated their level of information at baseline as high were less depressed after three (p = .010) and six months (p < .001) 36. The studies with a prospective design showed that, satisfaction with the received information and less information needs were independently related to less anxiety and depression. The receipt of information was positively associated with the cancer patients' physical condition and negatively with mood and depression in a Finnish cross-sectional study 33. A 4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 53study among breast, prostate, cervical and laryngeal cancer pati ents showed that pati ents who were dissati sfi ed with the received informati on were much more likely to be depressed and were marginally more likely to be anxious 25. The results of the cross-secti onal studies support the results of the prospecti ve studies. Interventi ons Some studies examined the eff ect of diff erent informati on interventi ons on the HRQoL or depression and anxiety levels of cancer pati ents 15, 21-24, 30-32. In a Swedish study, 210 consecuti ve cancer pati ents were randomized to one of three informati on conditi ons before the start of curati ve radiati on treatment 23. Compared to pati ents receiving standard informati on or standard informati on plus an extra brochure, pati ents who received standard informati on plus group and repeated individual informati on were signifi cantly more sati sfi ed with the informati on. However, there were no diff erences with respect to anxiety, depression, subjecti ve distress and QoL. A Dutch study investi gated the eff ects of the Interacti ve Breast Cancer CDROM, compared to the standard oral informati on, as a decision aid for 180 breast cancer pati ents with a choice between breast conserving therapy and mastectomy 30. An overall positi ve eff ect of the CDROM was found on sati sfacti on with the general and breast cancer-specifi c informati on received. Further, an overall positi ve eff ect of the CDROM conditi on was found on generic QoL as well as on breast-specifi c QoL. Subsequent analyses revealed that at 3 and 9 months follow-up pati ents in the CDROM conditi on health than control Additi onally, 9 months reported bett er physical functi oning, and less pain and arm symptoms. Three studies tested the effi cacy of an audio-taped consultati on on the QoL of cancer pati ents showing no main eff ect of the interventi on on QoL or mood state 21, 22, 31. The fi rst study showed that the provision of a taped initi al consultati on resulted in more sati sfi ed pati ents than pati ents allocated to the control group 31. The other two studies among breast and prostate cancer pati ents showed that the provision of an audiotape of their primary treatment consultati on was not signifi cantly related to pati ent sati sfacti on on and was not signifi cantly aff ected by choice of receiving the audiotape 21. Furthermore, the compliance was low with 40% of the pati ents who did not listen to the audiotapes, mainly because they felt emoti onally not prepared to listen 21. However, pati the audiotape interventi on positi vely. Pati ents receiving the consultati on audiotape reported having been provided with signifi cantly more disease and treatment informati on in general and more informati on about treatment alternati ves and treatment side eff ects in parti cular, than pati ents who did not receive the audiotape 22. CHAPTER 4 54A Greek study of 145 cancer patients who were randomized to receive a booklet about chemotherapy or not, showed that patients provided with the information booklet reported significantly higher rates of satisfaction with information than the control group, felt better and more informed, and perceived the information received as being clearer and more detailed 24. However, no significant benefits in anxiety, depression and QoL occurred. Another study randomized patients to receive oral information only or oral plus written information describing the disease and its associated surgery and outcomes 15. There was no significant difference in QoL at baseline, during the postoperative period or at 3 months post surgery. In addition, the QoL scores for each dimension (anxiety, depressed mood, positive well-being, self-control, general health, and vitality) were not statistically different between both groups at each time of analysis. In a cluster randomized trial, no statistically significant effects of a Point of Information and Support (PIS) on anxiety or dissatisfaction levels was observed 32. However, 52% of centers in the experimental group did not implement the PIS in accordance with the protocol. The same study highlighted that a greater likelihood of dissatisfaction was associated with the presence of anxiety and/or depression 32. dIsCussIOn The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate the results of all studies focussing on the relationship between information provision and HRQoL and psychological distress. All five prospective observational studies found a positive relation between appropriate information provision (satisfaction with the received information, fulfilled informational needs, high quality and clear information) and mental and global HRQoL and a negative relation between appropriate information provision and depression and anxiety. The results of all 12 cross-sectional observational studies are in accordance with the findings of the prospective studies, however they also found a positive association between appropriate information provision and physical HRQoL. Only one out of eight intervention studies found a positive effect of information on HRQoL. The prospective observational studies found a strong positive relation between adequate information provision and mental health but not physical health. A better understanding of a patients' situation after the information provision or the receipt of information aimed at learning to cope with cancer or reducing distress might be responsible for better mental health and lower levels of anxiety and depression 35. Patients who had difficulties in obtaining the information they desire were found to have less confidence in their ability to deal with health-related issues 14.4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 55Table 2: Overview of all included studies sorted on outcome first author [ref], country, year design study populati onHrQol, anxiety and/or depression instrumentInformati on provision instrumentresultsQuality score Health related quality of life (HrQol) Frodj T1-T3.9 Llewellyn 27, UK, 2006Prospecti ve 82 newly diagnosed head and neck cancer pati ents; 47% had an early stage (1 or 2)General Health Survey Questi onnaire, Short Form le (SCIP)Sati sfacti on with informati on before treatment was predic-ti ve of mental component summary scores 6-8 months aft er the end of treatment, but not of physical compo-nent scores.13 Yu 35, China, 2001 Prospecti ve 211 nasopharyngeal carcinoma pati ents; 41% had an early stage (I or II), 59% had a higher stageFuncti onal Assessment of (MISS)More sati sfacti on with the medical informati on provided an average of 1 month aft er the end of radiotherapy had a bett er QoL 4 months later.10 Kerr 26, Germany,2003Prospecti ve 980 breast cancer pati ents, 93.3% had an stage (is, stay, doctor and aft ercare17 QoL variables were sig-nifi cantly worse, up to 4 years aft er diagnosis, those pa-ti ents reporti ng unclear infor-mati 25 item Likert scale- developed questi on about level of informati onPati ents who rated their level of informati on at baseline as high experienced a higher QoL aft er 3 and 6 months.10 Griggs 20 , USA, 2007Cross-secti onal 235 breast cancer pati ents- Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36)- Impact of Events Scale (IES)Self-developed: Sati sfacti on between sati sfacti on with in-formati on and vitality, mental health, and a strong negati ve relati onship with distress.9 Mallinger 28, USA, 2005Cross-secti onal 182 breast cancer survivorsMedical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36)Informati on needs scale for recently diagnosed breast cancer pati entsBett er mental health is associ-ated with greater sati sfacti on with informati on about treat-ment and survivorship.10CHAPTER 4 56 Table 2: Overview of all included studies sorted on outcome (Continued) first author [ref], country, year design study populationHrQol, anxiety and/or depression instrumentInformation provision instrumentresultsQuality score Davies 18, UK, 2008 Cross-sectional -102 breast cancer -112 prostate cancer patientsFunctional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G)Adapted version of the Information Satisfaction Questionnaire (ISQ)Information satisfaction is a predictor of global QoL and its four dimensions.

From the cross-sectional observational studies the direction of the relationship is not clear. A lack of information, or information of low quality, can lead to anxiety, depression or a decreased mental and/or global HRQoL as suggested by the prospective studies. However some information can elevate patients' distress levels 39. On the other hand anxiety can inhibit information processing, patients with a poorer mental health may have more difficulty to understand the information even when the information is of high quality, while patients with better global health are more satisfied beforehand because of their better emotional state 20, 40. The results of the observational studies were not confirmed by the intervention studies. This can be explained by the nature of the intervention studies. The objective of these studies was to test the efficiency of an information intervention in terms of information satisfaction, HRQoL, anxiety or depression, while the observational studies searched for a possible relation of information provision and HRQoL, anxiety or depression. Although patients in the experimental conditions overall rated the additional information positive, felt that they received more information, and were satisfied with the overall received information, only one intervention study observed positive relations with HRQoL, anxiety or depression. Most patients tend to adjust well to their disease and it is therefore possible that additional gains in HRQoL are not easily achieved 30. A further explanation for these results might be the limited surplus value of the additional information given in the experimental conditions. Written information can be useful but is often non-specific and not tailored to patients' information needs, this can lead to confusion or even elevation of anxiety and depression levels 31, 41. Audiotapes seem to facilitate patients' requests to clarify earlier provided information and might enhance the recall of information. Interventions that aim to empower patients might be more useful and effective to decrease anxiety and depression and enhance HRQoL 23. Mostly, information is given in a neutral mode, with no direct attempt to promote active participation of the patient in the conversation and no attempts to influence patients' inferences. The information provided has an impact on the cognitive level, with no emphasis on affect or the emotions related to the receipt of medical information. The intervention study with a CDROM as decision aid operates both at the cognitive and affective level. Patients who exit their consultation with the belief that they played an active role had better HRQoL scores 21. An intervention might therefore be more powerful with elements of counselling or psychotherapy 24. Another explanation for the lack of intervention effects on HRQoL, anxiety and depression levels may be the short duration of some of the interventions. The information booklet 4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 61about chemotherapy was presented for only 30 minutes 24. A recent meta analysis showed that psychosocial interventi ons should last 12 weeks or more to improve HRQoL 42. When the informati on is off ered for a short ti me it seems reasonable that pati ents forget a substanti ve amount of that provided informati on. Further in six out of eight interventi on studies, cancer pati ents were randomized on individual level, which might result in contaminati on bias when the health care practi ti oner gives more than the usual standard informati on to the control group pati ents. When this happens, the eff ects of the experimental conditi ons might be underesti mated. The CDROM study used a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design and the PIS study used cluster randomizati on to overcome the problem of contaminati on bias and maximize internal validity 30, 32, 43. In additi on, in some of the interventi on studies the compliance was low, parti cipants did not use the additi onal informati on. For example just below 40% of the pati ents in the experimental group did not listen to the audiotapes 21, and the Italian PIS-study showed that eventually only 48% of the centers indeed started a PIS 32. Results favouring these interventi ons are therefore diffi cult to fi nd. When the centers who did not comply with the PIS protocol were removed from the analyses, the interventi on did improve pati ent-centered outcomes 32. The interventi on studies show that it is not the quanti ty but the quality of informati on that is important for adequate informati on provision. The additi on of general informati on, with limited surplus value, to the standard informati on provided did not have an infl uence on HRQoL or anxiety and depression levels. Instead of adding general informati on to the standard informati on provided, the interventi ons must be directed to give each pati ent the specifi c, high quality informati on they need. Another important issue is the role of cross-cultural diff erences in informati on provision. Truth telling and honest disclosure of cancer informati on appears to remain controversial in southern and eastern (European) countries 44. Awareness of a cancer diagnosis or prognosis is associated with more anxiety and depression, poorer physical, social and emoti onal QoL in those countries 45-47. However, among the included papers, the associati on between informati on provision and HRQoL, anxiety and depression was not diff erent between the diff erent countries. There are several methodological issues that impede drawing strong conclusions on the relati on between informati on provision and HRQoL. The included studies in this review all used diff erent measures and questi onnaires of informati on provision. There was only one validated informati on provision questi onnaire, the sati sfacti on with informati on profi le 27. All other studies used subscales of (validated) questi onnaires, self-developed and not yet validated questi onnaires or single questi ons. This makes it diffi cult to compare the results of CHAPTER 4 62the different studies. Only recently the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) developed a questionnaire that evaluates the information received by cancer patients 48. It might be helpful to use this validated questionnaire in future studies because it is available in many languages which makes international comparison possible. Also, many different questionnaires are used to assess HRQoL. All these questionnaires claim to assess HRQoL or the individual's perception about their position in life, however many questionnaires measure different constructs and therefore comparison between the studies is difficult. Taken into account these methodological limitations, the overall picture suggests a positive association between information provision and HRQoL. We can conclude that doctors should provide patients with the information patients desire in order to optimize patient satisfaction. Satisfied patients, patients with fulfilled information needs, and patients who experience less information barriers, in general have a better HRQoL and lower levels of depression and anxiety. The consistency of these associations indicates that further attention must be paid to more patient-centered information provision taking into account the differences in information needs by gender, age, cultural background, educational level, stage of disease and coping style. Additional research is needed to make definitive conclusions about information interventions, as most results did not reach statistical significance due to methodological constraints. The recent emergence of cancer survivorship research and the increasing recognition of its importance will hopefully lead to more research focussing on good information provision interventions that are able to improve HRQoL and decrease psychological distress.4LITERATURE REVIEW: INFORMATION PROVISION AND QUALITY OF LIFE 63referenCes 1. van der Meulen N, Jansen J, van Dulmen S, Bensing J, van Weert J.

In total, 4446 survivors received a questionnaire including EORTC-QLQ-INFO25 and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire; 69% responded (n=3080). results: Lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients were most satisfied with the information they received and they perceived to having received more information about their treatment and other services (after care) compared to colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors (p<0.05). Multiple myeloma patients reported the highest scores (conceptualized their illness as very serious) on the illness perception scales. The perceived receipt of more disease-specific information was associated with more personal and treatment control and a better understanding of the illness, while the perceived receipt of more information about other services was associated with more negative consequences of the illness on the patients' life, longer perceived duration of illness, less treatment control, more symptoms attributable to the illness, less understanding of, and stronger emotional reaction to the illness (p<0.05). Satisfaction with the received information was associated with better illness perception on all subscales, except for personal control (p<0.05). Conclusion: Improving the patients' illness perceptions by tailoring the information provision to the needs of patients may help patients to get a more coherent understanding of their illness and will possibly lead to a better health-related quality of life.695INFORMATION PROVISION AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS InTrOduCTIOn Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of cancer pati ents has been identi fi ed as an important endpoint in research and clinical practi ce. A major determinant of HRQoL, next to the illness itself, is the way pati ents' perceive and respond to their illness 1. Research on these illness percepti ons is guided by the self-regulati on model 2. This model is based on the assumpti on that pati ents respond to symptoms and signs of illness by forming cogniti ve and emoti onal representati ons of the illness, that lead to coping responses 3. These representati ons can be divided into eight dimensions: 1. consequences, anti cipated and experienced consequences of the illness on the pati ent's life; 2. ti meline, the perceived progress and durati on of the illness; 3. personal control, the percepti on of having self-control and whether the illness is easy to cure; 4. treatment control , how much treatment can help to control the illness; 5. identi ty, complaints or symptoms a pati ent att ributes to his/her illness; 6. illness concern, worries about illness; 7. coherence, how well the pati ent feels (s)he understands the illness; 8. emoti onally aff ected by the illness 3. Results of studies among diff erent groups of cancer pati ents show that negati ve illness percepti ons predicted worse HRQoL and depression aft er treatment 4-9 . Another important factor associated with HRQoL in cancer pati ents is adequate informati on provision 10. The provision of informati on to pati ents is one of the most important factors of supporti ve cancer care across the whole cancer conti nuum. Appropriate informati on provision can result in informed decision making, bett er treatment adherence, lower levels of distress (anxiety and depression) and higher levels of HRQoL, improved sati sfacti on with care and sense of control 11-16. However, one of the most frequently reported unmet needs by cancer pati ents in all phases of the disease is informati on disclosure (6-93%) 17, especially the informati on needs of cancer survivors (post-treatment) are unrecognized 18. There is a discrepancy between the actual informati on needs of cancer pati ents and the percepti on of health care providers about the needs of these pati ents 16, 19. A recent study showed that informati on needs of cancer pati ents vary as a functi on of adjustment to cancer 20. The self-regulati on model proposes that pati ents form beliefs about their illness based on abstract and concrete sources of informati on available to them 7. Informati on provision seems to play an important role in illness percepti on and HRQoL 10 . However, research into the relati onship between informati on provision and illness percepti on is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associati on between illness percepti ons and informati on provision. We hypothesized that pati ents who were sati sfi ed with the received informati on would score bett er on each illness percepti on dimension. 70CHAPTER 5 meTHOds setting and Participants In this study, data from five large population-based cross-sectional surveys on survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, endometrial and colorectal cancer was used 21. These surveys were set up between 2008 and 2009 using data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR), and were designed to evaluate different patient reported outcomes (e.g., late effects, physical and mental health status) among cancer survivors. The data collection procedure across those five surveys was comparable and is described below. The ECR compiles data of all individuals newly diagnosed with cancer in the southern part of the Netherlands, an area with 10 hospitals serving 2.3 million inhabitants 22. All individuals diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma between 1999 and 2008, or with endometrial cancer or colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2007 as registered in the ECR were eligible for participation. Due to the large number of colorectal cancer survivors (n=5399) a weighted random selection of 2219 patients based on tumour (colon/rectal), sex, and year of diagnosis was made 23, 24. The weights on tumour and sex were derived from the total distribution of colorectal cancer survivors in the ECR region. Patients with shorter years since diagnosis were oversampled for inclusion in future follow-up assessments. After excluding those patients who had cognitive impairment (medical records and advice attending specialist), had unverifiable addresses, or had died prior to study initiation (according to the ECR, hospital records, and the Central Bureau for Genealogy which collects information on all deceased Dutch citizens via the civil municipal registries), data collection started between 2008 and 2009. All surveys were approved by a local certified Medical Ethics Committee. data collection Survivors were informed of the surveys via a letter from their (ex)-attending specialist. The letter explained that by completing and returning the enclosed questionnaire, patients consented to participate and agreed to the linkage of the questionnaire data with their disease history in the ECR. Patients were reassured that non-participation had no consequences on their follow-up care or treatment. Non-respondents were sent a reminder letter and the questionnaire within 2 months.715INFORMATION PROVISION AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS measures Sociodemographic and clinical characteristi cs Data on tumour and pati ent background characteristi cs were obtained from the ECR 25. The questi onnaire contained questi ons on sociodemographic data, including marital status, current occupati on, educati onal level, and comorbidity. Socioeconomic status was determined by an indicator developed by Stati sti cs Netherlands based on individual fi scal data from the year 2000 on the economic value of the home and household income, and provided as aggregate level for each postal code (average 17 households), which were then categorized into terti les 26. Disease progression (e.g. recurrence, metastasis, or new primary tumour) was determined through check of medical fi les. Informati on provision To evaluate the informati on received by cancer survivors, the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 questi onnaire was used 27. The EORTC QLQ-INFO25 consists of 25 items, grouped into four informati on provision subscales: perceived receipt of informati on about the disease (four items regarding diagnosis, spread of disease, cause(s) of disease and whether the disease is under control), medical tests (three items regarding purpose, procedures and results of tests), treatment (six items regarding medical treatment, benefi ts, side-eff ects, eff ects on disease symptoms, social life and sexual acti vity) and other care services (four items regarding additi onal help, rehabilitati on opti ons, managing illness at home, psychological support). The questi on format was as follows: \"During your current disease or treatment, how much informati on have you received on\". In additi on, it contains eight single items on receiving writt en informati on or informati on on CDs or tape/video, receiving more or less informati on, and items on the sati sfacti on with, amount of, and helpfulness of informati on. All responses were ranged according to a four-point Likert scale, except for the fi rst four single items which had a binary yes/no scale. All scales were linearly converted to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicati ng bett er perceived informati on provision. Internal consistency for all scales is good ( > 0.70), as is test-retest reliability (intraclass correlati ons > 0.70) 27. Illness percepti ons Illness percepti ons were assessed using the Brief Illness Percepti on Questi onnaire (B-IPQ), a nine-item cogniti ve and emoti onal representati ons of the illness 28. The English version of the B-IPQ was translated into Dutch by forward-backward translati on procedures and adapted for use among cancer pati ents. The B-IPQ uses a single-item scale approach to assess percepti ons on a conti nuous linear 0-10 point scale. Five of the items assess cogniti ve illness representati ons: 1. How much does your illness aff ect your life (consequences); 2. How long do you think your illness will conti nue (ti meline); 3. How much control do you feel you have over your illness (personal control); 4. How much do you think 72CHAPTER 5 your treatment can help your illness (treatment control); 5. How much do you experience symptoms from your illness (identity). Two items assess emotional representations: 6. How concerned are you about your illness (concern) and 7. How much does your illness affect you emotionally (emotional representation). One item assesses illness comprehensibility: 8. How well do you understand your illness (coherence). Answer scales of three items (personal control, treatment control and coherence) were reversed for statistical analyses to get the same response direction as the other five items. A higher score means worse illness perception. Statistical analyses Routinely collected data from the ECR on patient and tumour characteristics enabled us to compare the group of respondents, non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses, using t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables.Mean scores on the B-IPQ and EORTC-QLQ-INFO25 for different subgroups were compared using Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) or chi-square analyses for dichotomous items of EORTC-QLQ-INFO25. Multivariate linear regression analyses were carried out in order to investigate the association between the four information provision subscales of the EORTC-QLQ-INFO25 with the B-IPQ items, controlled for demographics and tumour characteristics. Eight linear regression models, respective of the eight single items of the B-IPQ, were estimated with outcomes. Multicollinearity was checked for every analysis. We reran these linear regression analyses stratified by tumour group (endometrial, colorectal, Hodgkin lymphoma, non- Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma), age group (younger 65, older 65), gender, treatment modality (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), time since diagnosis (<2 years, >2 years), and comorbidity (none, 1 or >1), based on a priori assumptions that information provision or disease perception may be different among these strata. We tested for effect modification by including cross-product terms in the regression models for variables where stratified analyses showed different results as the main regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered significant if p<0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). resul Ts Patient characteristics Three thousand and eighty (69.3%) patients returned a completed questionnaire. A comparison of respondents, non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses indicated that patients with unverifiable addresses were younger, with more years since diagnosis, and they were less often treated with surgery, and less often diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Non-respondents were more often female, and were less often treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy21.735INFORMATION PROVISION AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS Sociodemographic and clinical characteristi cs of cancer survivors, according to type of tumour, are presented in Table 1. Hodgkin lymphoma pati ents were signifi cantly younger, were more likely to have a job and reported less comorbid conditi ons than the other four pati ent groups. Multi ple myeloma pati ents where more recently diagnosed compared to the other four tumour groups. Lymphoma and multi ple myeloma pati ents did not receive surgery as a primary treatment, but signifi cantly more oft en received chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared to colorectal and endometrial cancer pati ents.

Hodgkin lymphoma cancer patients perceived to have received more information and were more satisfied compared to the other four tumour groups. Non-Hodgkin and multiple myeloma cancer patients perceived to have received more information about treatments than colorectal and endometrial cancer patients (p<0.01). Endometrial cancer patients perceived to have received less information about other services (like options for after care) than the other four tumour groups (p<0.01).Patients with a advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis (III or IV) were more satisfied with- and perceived to have received more information about treatment and other services (p<0.01) than patients with earlier stage of disease (I and II). Patients who underwent radiotherapy perceived to have received more information about medical tests, treatment and other services, while patients who underwent chemotherapy also perceived to have received more information about the disease and were more satisfied than their counterparts (p<0.01). Patients without comorbidities received more information about the disease, medical tests and treatment and were more satisfied than patients with one or more comorbidities (p<0.01). Men were more satisfied and wanted to receive more information than women (p<0.01), while women more frequently reported to want less information (p<0.05). Employed patients, patients under 65 years of age, patients with a partner and patients less than two years after diagnosis were more satisfied and scored better on most information provision subscales than their counterparts (p<0.01). Higher educated patients perceived to have received more information about the disease and medical tests than lower educated patients (p<0.05). Illness perceptions Endometrial cancer patients experienced less serious consequences and symptoms of their cancer, had shorter timeline beliefs, were less concerned and emotionally affected by their illness compared to the other four tumour groups (all p<0.05; Table 3). Endometrial and Hodgkin lymphoma cancer patients felt to have more personal control over their illness compared to the other three tumour groups, while Hodgkin lymphoma patients also felt their treatment could control their illness more compared to the other groups. Multiple myeloma patients scores highest on all illness perception dimensions, indicating worse illness perceptions. No differences between the cancer types were seen on coherence (understanding) of their illness.Patients who were not satisfied with the received information, were less than two years after diagnosis, had a higher stage disease, had one or more comorbidities and who received radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy scored worse on most illness perception scales than their counterparts.775INFORMATION PROVISION AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONSTable 3 : Mean scores on items of Brief Illness Percepti on Questi onnaire (\u00b1 SD) according to IIIIIIIV3.4(2.5)3.6(2.5)4.7(2.6)6.4(2.8)**3.6(3.2)3.9(3.1)4.7(3.4)7.7(2.9)**5.7(3.3)6.0(3.2)6.1(3.0)6.8(2.8)**3.6(2.9)3.6(2.7)3.6(2.5)5.0(3.0)**3.1(2.6)3.2(2.4)4.0(2.7)5.8(2.5)**3.6(2.6)3.9(2.6)4.6(2.7)6.7(2.7)**4.3(3.2)4.3(3.0)4.3(2.8)3.7(2.7)3.3(2.6)3.3(2.5)3.9(2.6)5.5(2.6)** Chemotherapy YesNo4.6(2.6)3.6(2.5)**5.4(3.5)4.5(3.6)**6.1(3.1)5.9(3.3)3.1(2.3)3.8(2.9)**4.1(2.7)3.3(2.6)**4.4(2.7)3.8(2.7)**4.1(2.8)4.3(3.1)4.0(2.6)3.4(2.5)**78CHAPTER 5 Table 3 : Mean scores on items of Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (\u00b1 SD) according to demographic and clinical characteristics (Continued) bIPQ 1 ConsequencesbIPQ2TimelinebIPQ3PersonalcontrolbIPQ4TreatmentcontrolbIPQ5IdentitybIPQ6ConcernbIPQ7CoherenceBIPQ8emotional representation radiotherapy ** <0.01795INFORMATION PROVISION AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS multi variate analyses Receiving more disease specifi c informati on was associated with more personal control and treatment control over the illness, and bett er understanding of the illness (Table 4). More receipt of informati on about other services was associated with worse consequences and symptoms of the illness, less treatment control, more concerns and higher emoti onal impact. Sati sfacti on with received informati on was associated with bett er scores on all illness percepti on items, except for personal control. The associati ons between informati on about the disease, treatment, other services and illness percepti ons were not found in subanalyses among pati ents less than two years aft er diagnosis (data not shown). The relati on between treatment informati on and emoti onal representati on was not found for pati ents who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (data not shown). The formal tests for interacti ons between treatment and years since diagnosis with the informati on subscales only confi rmed eff ect modifi cati on for years since diagnosis (data not shown). Table 4: Standardized betas of multi variate linear regression analyses evaluati ng the associati on of independent variables with for gender, age, ti me since diagnosis, tumour type, treatment, comorbidity, educati onal level, marital status and current occupati on dIsCussIOn In general, lymphoma and multi ple myeloma pati ents were most sati sfi ed with the received informati on and perceived to have received more informati on about their treatment and other services compared to colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors. Multi ple myeloma pati ents reported the worst scores on the illness percepti on scales, which is in accordance with their disease severity. The perceived receipt of more disease specifi c informati on was associated with more control and understanding, while the perceived receipt of more 80CHAPTER 5 information about other services was associated with worse illness perceptions. This last finding can be explained by the fact that patients who received more information about other services were the more severely affected patients and therefore had worse illness perceptions. Satisfaction with the received information was the strongest predictor of good illness perceptions. Our findings are in agreement with the results of a study among head and neck cancer patients 7. This study found that higher levels of satisfaction with information were related to stronger beliefs in the usefulness of treatment and the controllability of the illness, a better understanding of the illness, and a weaker illness identity, before treatment. However this study only reported correlation coefficients and did not look deeper into the relationship. Another study among six illness groups (without cancer) showed that personal and treatment control and coherence were best in hospitalized myocardial infarction patients, who just received a lot of disease related information, while patients who did not receive a diagnosis reported the worst identity scores, lowest understanding, shortest timeline perceptions, lowest treatment control beliefs and highest emotional response 28. Both studies were not specifically focused on the relation between information provision and illness perceptions. In our study we found that time after diagnosis was an effect modifier of the relation between information provision and illness perceptions. Patients diagnosed less than two years ago received more information and had worse illness perceptions; this might indicate that illness perceptions change over time. This finding could also be ascribed to information bias, as the majority of cancer patients receive most information immediately after diagnosis and patients who are more recently diagnosed could therefore better remember the amount of information they received. Negative illness perceptions were associated with a worse HRQoL, poor adjustment to cancer, depression, treatment adherence and even the perceived benefit from surgery 6-8, 29, 30. Besides the association of illness perceptions with HRQoL, adequate information provision and satisfaction with information also have a positive influence on HRQoL, anxiety and depression levels of cancer survivors 10. Our study showed that the illness perceptions were better for patients who were satisfied with the information they received. It is important to gain insight into patients' perceptions of their illness in relation to their satisfaction with information prior to and during treatment 7 as patients compare the received information with their own ideas and theories of their illness (comparing own current health status with that of past and also health of others) and interpret their disease within this framework 31, 32. Inaccurate information provision, misunderstanding, or negative conceptualizations of the illness can all lead to maladaptive responses to the illness. Restructuring illness perceptions by providing appropriate information according to patients' needs, may help patients to 815INFORMATION PROVISION AND ILLNESS PERCEPTIONS get a more coherent understanding of their illness and will help in a bett er (long-term) adjustment to cancer 1, 8. Pati ents diff er in the kind and amount of informati on they require and sati sfacti on is more related to the extent informati on needs are met, than to having received all possible informati on available. The informati on needs of cancer pati ents vary by gender, age, cultural background, educati onal level, cancer type, stage of disease and coping style 33, 34. For example, some pati ents (monitoring style) search for all kinds of informati on about their disease, while others (blunti ng style) distract themselves from informati on. Pati ents feel bett er when the informati on they receive is tailored to their own coping style 33. Health care practi ti oners need to move from a \"one size fi ts all\" method of informati on provision to a more pati ent centered approach that considers the unique needs, skills, values, illness percepti ons, and emoti ons of pati ents 35. Research shows that informati on needs of cancer pati ents are broader than disease and treatment related informati on, also encompassing issues of psychosocial well-being which are oft en not discussed 35, 36. The inclusion of a psychologist into the multi disciplinary oncology team could be helpful to identi fy maladapti ve illness percepti ons. Discussing psychosocial items more extensively could help pati ents interpret the informati on in the right way 1. Maladapti ve illness percepti ons could be changed by giving informati on meeti ng pati ents' needs, when necessary in combinati on an individualized behavioral interventi on. Empowerment of pati ents by teaching them adequate coping skills and self management training will translate into illness percepti ons refl ecti ng greater sense of control 37. More research into this area is needed. The present study has limitati ons that should be menti oned. Although the response rate was high and informati on was present concerning demographic and clinical characteristi cs of the non-respondents and pati ents of with unverifi able addresses, whether non-respondents declined to parti cipate in the study because of poor health remains unknown. Second, the cross-secti onal design of the study limits the determinati on of causal associati on between informati on provision and illness percepti on, and the change in illness percepti ons over ti me. Diff erent studies found that illness percepti ons predicted HRQoL, however a randomized controlled trial showed that pati ents' illness percepti consultati ent sati sfacti on with the consultati on 38. Therefore more research is needed to the directi on of this relati onship. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that sati sfacti on with the received informati on was the most important factor associated with bett er illness percepti on. Improving the pati ents' illness percepti ons by tailoring the informati on provision to the needs of pati ents can possibly lead to a bett er HRQoL.82CHAPTER 5 referenCes 1.

Appropriate information provision leads to better patient reported outcomes for patients with non-metastatic disease. Objective: To measure the perceived level of, and satisfaction with, information received by patients with mCRC as compared to those with non-metastatic (stage I,II,III) CRC. Also, associations of information provision with health status, anxiety, depression, and illness perceptions were investigated. design: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted. subjects: All CRC patients diagnosed between 2002 and 2007 according to the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were selected. Response was 75% (n=1159; of which 139 had mCRC). measurements: Participants completed questionnaires on information provision (EORTC- QLQ-INFO25), health status (SF-36), anxiety and depression (HADS), and illness perceptions (B-IPQ). results: The perceived receipt of information was quite comparable between CRC patients with and without mCRC. Only perceived receipt of treatment information was higher for patients with mCRC (45 v. 37; p<0.01). Sixty percent of the patients with mCRC was satisfied with the amount of received information and almost 30% wanted to receive more information. The perceived receipt of more disease information and information about other services was associated with worse health outcomes, while satisfaction with the received information was not associated with health outcomes Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that some improvements can be made in the provision of information to patients with mCRC. Adequate assessment of information needs of mCRC patients, as well as appropriate responses to these needs by providing the information in an appropriate way could possibly lead to improvements in patient satisfaction.6INFORMATION PROVISION AMONG PATIENTS WITH METASTASIZED COLORECTAL CANCER 87InTrOduCTIOn The provision of informati on to pati ents is one of the most important factors of supporti ve cancer care. Appropriate informati on provision can result in informed decision making, bett er treatment adherence, bett er health status, lower levels of distress, improved sati sfacti on with care and a sense of control 1-5. However, adequate informati on provision is a frequently reported unmet need among cancer pati ents across the whole cancer conti nuum 6. There is a discrepancy between the actual informati on needs of cancer pati ents and the percepti on of health care providers (HCPs) about the needs of cancer pati ents 7, 8. Most cancer pati ents want as much informati on as possible, however this varies by gender, age, cultural background, educati onal level, coping style and stage of disease 5, 9, 10. About one fi ft h of colorectal cancer (CRC) pati ents will present with metastati pati ents will develop metastati c CRC (mCRC) aft er successful curati ve treatment of the primary tumour 11. Pati ents with mCRC are living longer due to earlier detecti on and eff ecti veness of treatments 12. It is important to ensure pati ents' well-being during this phase of fi ghti ng against a potenti ally life threatening disease. Pati ents with mCRC experience decline in health status 13, report high levels of anxiety and depression 14 and have problems with illness percepti on 15. Furthermore, they are dealing with specifi c questi ons and uncertainti es concerning end-of-life issues, symptom relief and patt erns of decline 16. For pati ents with advanced disease, informati on about the course of the disease, prognosis, available (palliati ve) treatment opti ons, how to manage disease symptoms and how cancer will aff ect daily life are the most important informati onal needs 17. Pati ents need to be aware of the nature of and the course of their disease to make informed medical decisions and to handle and plan this phase of their lives 7, 8, 16, 18, 19. However, a recent study showed that oncologists are oft en unwilling, unable or uncomfortable to honestly disclose and discuss informati on regarding diagnosis and prognosis with pati ents with advanced disease 20. In additi on, many HCPs avoid discussing the topic or withhold informati on 21. Furthermore HCPs tend to underesti mate pati need for informati on and overesti mate pati ents' understanding of their prognosis 7. Since a positi ve associati on was found between sati sfacti on with received informati on and health outcomes among cancer pati ents with less advanced disease 1, 22, it is important to study these relati ons among pati ents with metastati c disease. Therefore, the objecti ve of this study was to measure the perceived level of, and sati sfacti on with, informati on received by pati ents with mCRC (stage IV) as compared to those with non-metastati c (stage I,II,III) CRC. Second, our objecti ve was to investi gate the associati on of informati on provision with health status, anxiety, depression, and illness percepti ons among pati ents with mCRC. CHAPTER 6 88meTHOds setting and participants This study is part of a long-term follow-up assessment of CRC patients registered with the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR). The ECR compiles data of all individuals newly diagnosed with cancer in southern Netherlands, an area with 10 hospitals serving 2.3 million inhabitants 23. For this study, all patients identified from the ECR and diagnosed with CRC between 2002 and 2007 were eligible for participation. A local certified Medical Ethics Committee approved this study. data collection Data collection started in January 2009 within PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship). PROFILES is a registry for the study of the physical and psychosocial impact of cancer and its treatment from a dynamic, growing population-based cohort of both short and long-term cancer survivors. PROFILES contains a large web-based component and is linked directly to clinical data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR). CRC patients (N=1542) were informed of the study with a letter from their (ex-) attending surgeon. The letter explained that by completing and returning the enclosed questionnaire, patients consented to participate in the study and agreed to the linkage of the questionnaire data with their disease history in the ECR. Details of the data collection method have been previously described 24. measures Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics Patients' sociodemographic and clinical information were available from the ECR. The ECR routinely collects data on tumour characteristics, including date of diagnosis, tumour grade 25, clinical stage 25, treatment, and patient background characteristics. Since the ECR only collects clinical disease stage at primary diagnosis, we conducted a chart review to identify the respondents who have developed metachronous metastasis between initial diagnosis and the start of our study. Questions on marital status, educational level, current occupation and comorbidity at time of questionnaire were added to the questionnaire. Information provision To evaluate the information received by cancer patients, the internationally validated EORTC QLQ-INFO25 questionnaire was used 26. The EORTC QLQ-INFO25 consists of 25 items, grouped into four information provision subscales: perceived receipt of information about the disease (four items regarding diagnosis, spread of disease, cause(s) of disease and whether the disease is under control), medical tests (three items regarding purpose, procedures and results of tests), treatment (six items regarding medical treatment, benefits, 6INFORMATION PROVISION AMONG PATIENTS WITH METASTASIZED COLORECTAL CANCER 89side-eff ects, eff ects on disease symptoms, social life and sexual acti vity) and other care services (four items regarding additi onal help, rehabilitati on opti ons, managing illness at home, and psychological support). Additi onally, it contains eight single items on for instance wanti ng to receive more or less informati on, and on the sati sfacti on with and helpfulness of the received informati on. Answer categories range from one (not at all) to four (very much), except for four items with a two point scale (yes/no). Aft er linear transformati on, all scales and the items range in scores from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicati ng bett er perceived informati on provision. Health status Health status was assessed with the validated Dutch version of the SF-36 questi onnaire which incorporates eight domains: physical functi on, role limitati ons due to physical health, bodily pain, general health percepti ons, vitality, social functi on, role limitati ons due to emoti onal health and general mental health 27. According to standard scoring procedures, the subscales were linearly converted to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicati ng bett er functi oning. Anxiety and depression Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a self-report questi onnaire comprising 14 items on a four-point Likert-scale; seven for depression and seven for anxiety 28. We used a score of eight as a cut- off value for both depression and anxiety 28, 29. Illness percepti onsIllness percepti ons were assessed using the Brief Illness Percepti on Questi onnaire (B-IPQ), a nine-item cogniti ve and emoti onal representati ons of the illness 30. The B-IPQ uses a single-item scale approach to assess percepti ons on a conti nuous linear 0-10 point scale. Five of the items assess cogniti ve illness representati ons (consequences, ti meline, personal control, treatment control and identi ty), two items assess emoti onal representati ons (concern and emoti on) and one item assesses illness comprehensibility (coherence). stati sti cal analyses Routi nely collected data from the ECR on pati ent and tumour characteristi cs enabled us to compare the group of respondents, non-respondents and pati ents with unverifi able addresses, using ANOVA for conti nuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. Furthermore, diff between with sociodemographic and clinical characteristi and the subscales of the EORTC-INFO25, SF-36, HADS and B-IPQ were also analyzed using ANOVA or Wilcoxon tests (when normality and CHAPTER 6 90homogeneity assumptions are violated) for continuous variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. Multivariate linear regression analyses were carried out to investigate the associations of the different information subscales (perceived receipt of disease information, medical test information, treatment information, information about other services and satisfaction with received information) with the subscales of the SF-36, HADS and B-IPQ for patients with mCRC only. We controlled for sociodemographic variables (age, gender) and clinical variables (primary treatment, years since diagnosis and comorbidity).All statistical tests were two-sided and considered significant if p < 0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). resul Ts Patient characteristics Of the 1542 eligible CRC patients, 1159 (75%) returned a completed questionnaire. A comparison of respondents, non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses indicated that respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses were younger and more often male compared to non-respondents (Table 1). No differences were found in mean years after diagnosis, stage of disease and treatment.

However this was only signifi cant for the subscale informati on about treatments (Table 3). In-depth analyses of single items of the EORTC-QLQ-INFO25 showed comparable results between both groups, where 72% of the cancer pati ents with mCRC received (quite) a lot informati on about their diagnosis (versus 66% of the pati ents without metastasis). Seventeen percent (vs. 15%) received (quite) a lot informati on about the causes of their disease. The perceived receipt of medical test informati on was high: 73% (vs. 64%) received (quite) a lot informati on about the goals of the tests, 74% (vs. 68%) about the course of the tests and 79% (vs. 74%) received informati on on the results of the tests. Most pati ents with mCRC received (quite) a lot treatment informati on (80% vs. 64%), about the results of the treatment (51% vs. 47%) and about the side eff ects of treatments (65% vs. 35%). In contrast, a lot less informati on was received on other services, for example rehabilitati on opti ons (14% vs. 13%), dealing with cancer at home (21% vs 20%) and psychological help (12% vs. 7%). There were no signifi cant diff erences between the two groups on sati sfacti on with and usefulness of the received informati on (Table 3). More than half (60% vs. 55%) of the pati ents with metastasis was (quite) sati sfi ed with the received informati on and 68% (vs. 63%) perceived the received informati on as (quite) useful. Pati ents with mCRC wanted to receive more informati on (29% vs. 24%), especially about the course of the disease (prognosis, future), side eff ects of treatment(s) and supporti ve care (open fi eld questi on). Health status, anxiety and depression, illness percepti on: erences Pati ents with mCRC reported worse health status except for mental health (all p<0.01), higher levels of anxiety (p=0.02) and quite similar levels of depression (p=0.24) (Table 3). Pati ents with mCRC perceived their illness as worse (belief that their life is more aff ected, their disease is of longer durati on, have less treatment and personal control, more symptoms, and were more concerned and emoti onally aff ected) compared to pati ents without metastasis, which is in accordance with their disease severity (all p<0.01). Pati ents with mCRC had a bett er understanding their illness compared to pati ents without mCRC (p=0.01). No diff erences in ents with synchronous (n=69) and metachronous metastasti s (n=70; data not shown).CHAPTER 6 94association of information provision and information satisfaction with health status, anxiety and depression, and illness perceptions among Cr C patients with mCr C Among patients with mCRC more information about the disease was associated with worse general health, social functioning and bodily pain, while more information about the treatment was associated with less role limitations due to emotional problems when corrected for covariates (Table 4). More information about other services was associated with worse functioning on all domains (except social functioning and general health), higher levels of depression and more symptoms attributed to their illness. Among patients without metastatic disease, higher satisfaction with the received information was associated with better health status, lower levels of anxiety and depression and better illness perceptions, whereas more perceived receipt of information about other services was negatively associated with these outcomes (data not shown). dIsCussIOn The present study showed that the perceived receipt of information was quite comparable between patients with and without mCRC. Patients with mCRC perceived receiving more treatment-related information compared to patients with non-mCRC. However, both groups perceived having received little information about other services and indicated to want more information. Issues related to disease course and supportive care were mentioned most frequently as topics that patients with mCRC wanted to receive more information about. Only 60% of the patients with mCRC was (quite) satisfied with the received information. Despite the severity of their disease, the majority of cancer patients with metastasis want to be fully informed 31. However, 40% of the patients with mCRC in our study was not satisfied with the received information and almost 30% wanted to receive more information. This possibly indicates that not all informational needs were met. This is confirmed by our finding that patients with mCRC reported receiving only a little information about other services, and wanted more information about these topics. Other studies showed that the perceived need for additional help was very high among advanced cancer patients, but HCPs are often unaware of this need 32. HCPs are inclined to give routine medical/technical information (diagnosis, type of treatment) and avoid emotional and quality of life issues 33. Furthermore, patients with mCRC possibly want (and expect) more direct emotional support from their HCP instead of only a referral to more formal organized support 32.6INFORMATION PROVISION AMONG PATIENTS WITH METASTASIZED COLORECTAL CANCER 95Table 4: Standardized betas of multi variate linear regression analyses evaluati ng the associati on of informati on provision subscales with health status, anxiety and depression, and illness percepti ons (these analyses only include pati ents with metastasized disease at ti me of diagnosis) Informati on about the diseaseInformati on about medical testsInformati on about treatmentInformati on about other servicessati sfacti on with informati on Health status+ General Health -0.24* ns ns ns ns Physical Functi oning ns ns ns -0.36** ns Role Limitati ons Physical Health ns ns 0.32* -0.32** ns Bodily Pain -0.24* ns ns -0.26* ns Vitality ns ns ns -0.37* ns Social Functi oning -0.26* ns ns ns ns Role Limitati ons Emoti onal ns ns ns -0.25* ns Mental Health ns ns ns -0.32** ns anxiety and depression# Anxiety ns ns ns ns ns Depression ns ns ns 0.29** ns Illness percepti ons^ 1 Consequences ns ns ns ns ns 2 Timeline ns ns ns ns ns 3 Personal control ns ns ns ns ns 4 Treatment control ns ns ns ns ns 5 Identi ty ns ns ns 0.27* ns 6 Concern ns ns ns ns ns 7 Coherence ns ns ns ns ns 8 Emoti onal representati on ns ns ns ns ns ** < 0.01; *< 0.05; ns = not signifi cantCorrected for gender, age, ti me since diagnosis, chemotherapy and comorbidity+ Higher score indicates bett er functi oning; # Higher score indicates higher levels of anxiety/depression; ^Higher score indicates worse illness percepti ons Our results do not show diff erences in the perceived level of received informati on between pati ents with or without mCRC. This could indicate that the informati on HCPs provide is very general and routi nely given, and not tailored to the individual pati ent. Further complicati ng the interpretati on of our results is that cancer pati ents tend to forget a substanti al amount of informati on that has been given to them, because they may be emoti onally overwhelmed 34, impaired in their cogniti ve capability, may not understand the medical terminology used, or in the case of metastasized disease deny the \"terminal\" nature of their illness as a coping strategy to retain hope 16, 35. HCPs may have provided the required informati on but pati ents do not recall having received this informati on. Since sati sfacti on with informati on provision is for a part determined by the amount of informati on received, it is important that HCPs constantly check what the pati ent has understood and whether the informati on was helpful 36. CHAPTER 6 96When necessary, the HCP must repeat the information several times, both between and within consultations 7. The perceived receipt of more disease information and information about other services was associated with worse health outcomes among patients with mCRC. Part of this result could be influenced by confounding. Information provision about metastasis and other services may cause negative feelings on its own, since it is often emotionally loaded, while information about treatment options possibly gives the patient new hope. Hope is an important factor for a person's well-being and quality of life 37. Also, treatment information could empower the patient to anticipate and react to expected toxicities with a clear action plan. Furthermore, information provision about other services was too limited for most patients, possibly leading to more uncertainty or confusion. While satisfaction with the received information was associated with better health outcomes among patients with curable cancer 1, we did not find this association in our study among patients with mCRC. A possible explanation for the absence of this association is that next to the amount of information, the content of information and the way the information is provided are at least equally important for the satisfaction levels of patients with mCRC 38. Furthermore, patient satisfaction is associated with supportive HCP behaviors 33, the way information is provided (although not assessed in this study) could influence the way information will be perceived 16. Advanced cancer patients want the HCP to be honest, to convey hope, to speak plain language instead of difficult medical terminology, to be empathic, to give enough time during discussion and to pace the amount of information to what they can assimilate 16. Another study reported that 100% of the respondents wanted HCPs to be honest, while 91% also wanted HCPs to be optimistic. However, it is difficult for HCPs to remain optimistic while being honest about a poor prognosis 39. Further, our results showed that patients with mCRC had worse illness perceptions compared to CRC patients without metastasis. Patients with mCRC were aware of the severity of their disease and also reported a better understanding of their illness compared to patients without mCRC. This indicates that HCPs did a good job in informing patients about their disease severity. However, we did not find an association between information provision and illness perceptions for patients with mCRC. In comparison, a recent study showed that patient awareness of incurable disease was associated with improvements in health status 40, since they were better able to understand and manage their symptoms. Our results indicate that the delivery of information to patients with mCRC can be improved. Adequate assessment of patients' individual information needs as well as appropriate responses to these needs might lead to higher levels of satisfaction. HCPs can start a 6INFORMATION PROVISION AMONG PATIENTS WITH METASTASIZED COLORECTAL CANCER 97conversati on by giving general informati on per topic and then ask whether or not a pati ent want to discuss this topic in more detail 41. In parti cular, providing informati on about other services can be bett ered as both metastati c and non-mCRC survivors perceived receiving litt le informati on on this topic. HCPs need to become aware of the supporti ve care needs and provide the pati ent with more emoti onal and quality of life informati on when necessary. However, HCPs might not feel competent to provide pati ents with informati on about advanced disease 42. Since sati sfacti on levels of mCRC pati ents might not only be related to the amount of informati on received, but also to the way the informati on is provided it seems important to pay att enti on to the communicati on skills of HCPs by developing and implementi ng educati on and training programs 43. The study has limitati ons. First, pati ents with mCRC included in our study were long-term survivors which could have biased our results. Relati ve survival for stage IV colon and rectal cancer was respecti vely 7% and 6% in the period 2004-2006 44. Multi -agent chemotherapy has enabled previously unresectable mCRCs to be resected 11 and fi ve-year survival for pati ents undergoing hepati c resecti on has increased to 45% 45. It is therefore possible that part of the pati ents with mCRC were cured at ti me of our study. Since we aimed to compare the levels of received informati on between pati ents who are curable (non-mCRC) and those who are incurable (mCRC), the potenti al curability of mCRC could have confounded our results. Unfortunately, we did not have data about the exact rates of cure in our study sample. Future research is needed to determine diff erences over ti me in health outcomes between pati ents with mCRC who are actually cured and those with incurable mCRC. Second, the cross-secti onal design of the study limits the determinati on of causal associati ons between informati on provision and health outcomes. Third, since all parti cipants were CRC pati ents, we can only generalize our results to this group of cancer pati ents. Finally, the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 does not measure who provided the informati on and when the informati on was provided exactly. It would be interesti ng to assess which aspects of informati on pati ents receive from diff erent HCPs or other sources and at what point in their disease trajectory they receive the informati on. Prospecti ve research is needed to overcome part of the recall bias. In conclusion, the fi ndings of this study indicate that some improvements can be made in the provision of informati on to pati ents with mCRC. Pati ents especially wanted more informati on about supporti ve care. Our results with regard to the associati ons between perceived receipt of more disease informati on and informati on about other services with worse health outcomes should be interpreted with care, since the way and the content of the informati on provided are probably more important for pati ent sati sfacti on than the amount of received informati on. This can possibly also explain the lack of a relati on between sati sfacti on with the received informati on and health outcomes.CHAPTER 6 98referenCes 1. Husson O, Mols F, van de Poll-Franse LV.

Husson, F. Mols, CT background: Providing information that is congruent with patients' needs is an important determinant for patient satisfaction and might also affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and depression levels of cancer survivors. aim: To obtain insight into the relationship between information provision and HRQoL, anxiety and depression levels among lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma (MM) survivors.methods: All patients diagnosed with lymphoma or MM between 1999 and 2009, registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received a questionnaire including the EORTC QLQ-INFO25, EORTC QLQ-C30 and HADS. Subsequently, 407 of the 1369 participants completed these questionnaires again two years later. Paired sample t-tests were used to assess changes over time and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine independent associations of information provision with HRQoL, levels of anxiety and depression. results: The perceived receipt of information about medical tests (65 vs. 62, p<0.01), treatment (48 vs. 45, p=0.01) and the helpfulness of the received information (66 vs. 63, p=0.04) were significantly higher at baseline compared to 2-year follow-up. The perceived level of information about the disease and other services and the HRQoL and levels of anxiety and depression did not change over time.Higher satisfaction with the received information at T1 was associated with better physical, role, emotional and social functioning and global quality of life at T2 (\u00df ranging from 0.15 - 0.25; all p<0.05). After correction for baseline functioning levels, this relationships remained only significant for role functioning (\u00df=0.17, p<0.05) and global quality of life (\u00df=0.14, p<0.05). Survivors who were satisfied at both time points (56%) reported highest levels of mental HRQoL. discussion: Satisfaction with the received information is associated with better HRQoL and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Survivors, who are stable satisfied with information, report better mental HRQoL. Future studies should explore strategies to optimize patient satisfaction with received information.7SATISFACTION WITH INFORMATION AND HRQOL AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS 103InTrOduCTIOn The provision of informati on to pati ents is one of the most important factors of cancer care across the cancer conti nuum. The goal of providing informati on is to prepare pati ents for their treatment, to increase treatment adherence and abiliti es to cope with the illness as well as to promote recovery 1. Adequate informati on provision is a diffi cult task since informati on is oft en complex, meant to make serious decisions, and potenti ally upsetti ng 2. The majority of cancer pati ents (>80%) want as much informati on as possible about their disease, treatment and rehabilitati on 3-5. Informati on preferences vary by sex, age, cultural background, ti me since diagnosis, educati onal level, stage of the disease and coping style 6-8. Results of a systemati c review show that 6-93% of the cancer pati ents report adequate informati on provision as an unmet need 9, indicati ng the existence of misconcepti ons among health care providers (HCP) regarding pati ents' needs for informati on 10. A study among lymphoma and multi ple myeloma (MM) survivors showed that informati on provision and sati sfacti on with the received informati on were relati vely good, however one third of pati ents sti ll expressed unmet informati on needs 11. A recent review from our group showed that sati sfi in general have a bett er health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and lower levels of anxiety and depression 12. However, most studies included in this review were inconclusive because of methodological fl aws. Almost all included studies used non-validated questi onnaires to measure informati on provision, sample sizes were small, and most studies had a cross-secti onal design which limits the determinati on of causal associati ons. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine the relati onship between informati on provision at baseline and HRQoL, anxiety and depression among lymphoma and MM survivors 2 years later. meTHOds setti ng and populati on This study is part of a dynamic longitudinal populati on-based survey among lymphoma and MM survivors registered within the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR) of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South. The ECR records data on all pati ents who are newly diagnosed with cancer in the southern part of the Netherlands, an area with 2.3 million inhabitants, 18 hospital locati ons and 2 large radiotherapy insti tutes. The ECR was used to select all pati ents who were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and MM between 1/1/1999 and 1/1/2009. We included indolent (including Chronic Lymphocyti c Leukemia) and aggressive B-cell NHL, HL, and MM as defi ned by the Internati onal Classifi cati on of Diseases for Oncology-3 codes (ICD-O-3) 13. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from a local certi fi ed Medical Ethics Committ ee.CHAPTER 7 104data collection Data collection was done within PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship). PROFILES is a registry for the study of the physical and psychosocial impact of cancer and its treatment from a dynamic, growing population-based cohort of both short and long-term cancer survivors. PROFILES contains a large web-based component and is linked directly to clinical data from the ECR. Details of the data collection method were previously described 14. From May until November 2009, patients between 6 months and 10 years after diagnoses were included in the study and received the first questionnaire at baseline (T1). From May until November 2011, the patients who agreed to participate in the follow-up received the second questionnaire containing the same study measures (T2). study measures Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics Clinical information was available from the ECR that routinely collects data on tumour characteristics, including date of diagnosis, tumour grade, histology, stage 15, primary treatment, and patients background characteristics, including sex and date of birth. Comorbidity at the time of survey was categorized according to the adapted Self-administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ) 16. Questions on marital status, educational level, and current occupation were added to the questionnaire. EORTC QLQ-INFO25 The Dutch version of the internationally validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Information (EORTC QLQ-INFO25) was used to evaluate the information received by lymphoma and MM patients 17 18. This 25- item questionnaire incorporates four information provision subscales: perceived receipt of information about the disease (four items regarding diagnosis, spread of disease, cause(s) of disease and whether the disease is under control), medical tests (three items regarding purpose, procedures and results of tests), treatment (six items regarding medical treatment, benefits, side-effects, effects on disease symptoms, social life and sexual activity) and other care services (four items regarding additional help, rehabilitation options, managing illness at home, psychological support). Additionally, it contains eight single items on for instance wanting to receive more or less information, and on the satisfaction with and helpfulness of the received information. Answer categories range from one (not at all) to four (very much), except for four items with a two point scale (yes/no). After linear transformation, all scales and the items range in scores from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better perceived information provision. 7SATISFACTION WITH INFORMATION AND HRQOL AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS 105EORTC QLQ-C30 HRQoL was measured by the Dutch version of validated EORTC QLQ-C30 19. This 30-item HRQoL questi onnaire (physical, role, cogniti ve, emoti onal and social), a global health status quality of life scale and three symptom scales and single symptom items. Answer categories range from one (not at all) to four (very much). Aft er linear transformati on, all scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100 20. A higher score on functi on scales and global quality of life implies bett er HRQoL. Anxiety and depression Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a self-report questi onnaire comprising 14 items on a four-point Likert-scale; seven for depression and seven for anxiety 21. The depression subscale mainly covers loss of interest and pleasure (anhedonia), which are core depressive symptoms, while the anxiety subscale covers the core anxiety features of worry and tenseness. The scores range from 0-21, with higher scores indicati ng higher levels of anxiety or depression. A cut-off score of 8 was used to determine symptoms of depression or anxiety 21, 22. stati sti cal analyses Diff erences in socio-demographic and clinical characteristi cs between respondents and non- respondents or pati ents with unverifi able addresses and pati ents who completed one or two questi onnaires were compared with a chi-square or t-test, where appropriate.Paired sample t-tests were performed the EORTC EORTC QLQ-C30 and HADS scores on T1 and T2. The same analyses were performed for the subgroup of short-term survivors (<2 years since diagnosis at baseline) only.The mean scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 scales on T1 and fi ed by the score on the sati sfacti on with received informati on questi on of EORTC QLQ-INFO25 ed, quite sati sfi ed, 4) very sati sfi ed, were compared by ANOVA. Multi variate linear regression analyses were carried out in order to investi gate the associati on on T1 between HRQoL, anxiety and depression (dependent variables) with the four informati on provision subscales and sati sfacti on with received informati on (independent variables), controlled for covariates age, sex educati onal level, marital status, ti me since diagnosis, tumour type, disease stage and number of comorbiditi es, that were determined a priori 23. Furthermore, the predicti ve value of the four informati on provision subscales and sati sfacti on with received informati on (T1) on HRQoL, anxiety and depression (T2) was investi gated by multi variate linear regression analyses corrected for baseline HRQoL, anxiety and depression CHAPTER 7 106(T1) and the same covariates as described above. These analyses were also performed for the subgroup of short-term (<2 years since diagnosis at baseline) only.Additionally, mean EORTC QLQ-C30 subscale scores, stratified by survivors who were 1) satisfied at T1 and T2 (stable satisfied), 2) unsatisfied at T1 and satisfied at T2 (became satisfied), 3) satisfied at T1 and unsatisfied at T2 (became unsatisfied) 4) unsatisfied (stable unsatisfied), were compared by ANOVA. Multivariate linear regression analyses were carried out, to investigate the association between the stability of satisfaction with received information (independent) with HRQoL, anxiety and depression (dependent), corrected for baseline HRQoL, anxiety and depression and the same covariates as described above. All statistical tests were two-sided and considered significant if p<0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 17.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA). resul Ts Patient characteristics Of the 2.033 lymphoma and MM survivors who were sent a questionnaire, 1.369 (67%) completed this. Subsequently, 407 (30%) completed this questionnaire again two years later. Patients with unverifiable addresses were younger and diagnosed longer ago compared to respondents and non-respondents (Table 1). Non-respondents were more often diagnosed with MM, less often with aggressive NHL, disease stage was more often unknown, and they received chemotherapy less often but active surveillance more often compared to respondents. The mean age at baseline survey completion was 61.6 years with a mean time since diagnosis of 3.8 years (Table 1). Chemotherapy was the most common primary treatment (66%). Two third of the survivors reported one or more comorbid conditions; most common were arthritis, back pain and hypertension. A baseline comparison between survivors who completed one or two questionnaires indicated that the latter had a significant longer mean time since diagnosis, more often received stem cell transplantation, were employed and had a partner more often (Table 1). Furthermore, survivors who completed both questionnaires scored somewhat better on physical and emotional functioning, global quality of life and had lower levels of anxiety and depression compared to survivors who only completed the baseline questionnaire (Table 2), although differences were not clinically relevant 24.7SATISFACTION WITH INFORMATION AND HRQOL AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS 107Changes over ti me in informati on provision, HrQol, anxiety and depression The perceived receipt of informati on about medical tests (65 vs. 62, p<0.01) and treatment (48 vs. 45, p=0.01) and the usefulness of the received informati on (66 vs. 63, p=0.04) were signifi cantly higher at T1 compared to T2 for the total group of survivors (Table 2). Survivors <2 years since diagnosis showed a signifi cant decrease in medical test informati on and sati sfacti on with and helpfulness of the received informati on (Figure 1). In total, 28% of the survivors would have liked to receive more informati on at T1 and 23% at T2. Most frequently menti oned topics to receive more informati on about were the possible causes of cancer, possible side-eff ects of their treatment, long-term eff ects of cancer on diff erent aspects of life, aft ercare, and overall informati on on cancer. Overall, 22% of the survivors wanted to receive more informati on at one of the assessment periods, 63% wanted no additi onal informati on and 15% did want to receive more informati on at both assessment periods. Of this latt er group, 47% wanted to receive informati on about the same topics and 53% wanted to receive diff erent informati on at T2 compared to T1 (from more general disease specifi c informati on to informati on about the course of the disease and aft ercare). figure 1: Diff erences in perceived level of informati on received and sati sfacti on with and usefulness of informati on over ti me for survivors <2 years since diagnosis.

After correction for baseline HRQoL, the relationship of satisfaction with the received information remained only significant for role functioning (\u00df=0.17, p<0.05) and global quality of life (\u00df=0.14, p<0.05). Subanalyses for survivors <2 years since diagnosis showed the same relationships. Stable satisfied survivors (56%) reported better HRQoL and lower levels of anxiety and depression at T2 compared to survivors who were unsatisfied (13%) or with changing satisfaction levels over time (30%; Figure 3). Multivariate linear regression analyses corrected for baseline HRQoL and covariates showed that the stability of satisfaction with received information predicted emotional, cognitive and social functioning (\u00df ranging from -0.09- -0.13, p<0.05). dIsCussIOn This population-based study among lymphoma and MM survivors showed that survivors with high levels of satisfaction with received information had the highest HRQoL and lowest anxiety and depressive symptom levels. The perceived receipt of information decreased slightly over time (mostly among short-term survivors), while HRQoL, anxiety and depression levels did not change over time. The receipt of more disease-related information was associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression, while the receipt of more information about the treatment and other services was associated with worse HRQoL and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Satisfaction with the received information at baseline was associated with HRQoL 2-years later, however after correction for baseline HRQoL the relationships partly disappeared. Satisfaction with the received information at both time points was associated with better emotional, cognitive and social HRQoL compared to fluctuating satisfaction levels or constant dissatisfaction with the received information. The perceived levels of information about treatment and especially about other services were low at both assessment periods. The negative associations of information about treatment and other services with HRQoL, anxiety and depression could therefore indicate that this information was not enough, possibly leading to more uncertainty or confusion. This is confirmed by our finding that the most frequently mentioned topics survivors wanted more information about were possible side- and long-term effects of their treatment, late effects of cancer on different aspects of life and aftercare. However, patients with a higher stage disease might indicate to receive more information, but still have worse HRQoL and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms as a consequence of their disease severity.7SATISFACTION WITH INFORMATION AND HRQOL AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS 113figure 3: HRQoL at T2 according to the stability of sati sfacti on with the received informati on over ti me. 100Functioning scales of EORTC QLQ-C30 at T2 stratified to stability of satisfaction with received information 8090100 *** * 7080 5060 EORTC QLQ-C30 functioning scores Became satisfied not satified 3040Became not satified Stable not satisfied 1020 0 Global quality of life Physical functioning Role functio ning Emotional functioningCognitive functioningSocial functioning *p<0.05; ** p<0.01; Sati on informati on was associated with bett er HRQoL and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Although levels of received informati on (quanti ty) determine part of the sati sfacti on levels of cancer survivors, the quality of informati on (the degree to which informati on needs are met) is even more important. For some survivors the topics they wanted more informati on about were constant over ti me, possibly indicati ng that these needs remained unmet. Other survivors reported changing needs over ti me. HCPs must be aware of the possible (changing) needs of cancer pati ents, however studies show that there is a discrepancy between the actual informati on needs of the pati ent and the percepti on of HCP about the needs of the pati ents 25. The relati onship between sati sfacti on with received informati on and HRQoL, anxiety and depression largely disappeared aft er correcti on for baseline levels. A limitati on of these analyses is that they focus on mean diff erences and not on individual changes. Given the large standard deviati ons of the informati on provision scales, there is a high degree of variati on between individuals. Therefore we decided to make a disti ncti on between survivors who remained stable sati sfi ed or dissati Our results show that stable sati sfi ed survivors had the highest levels of mental HRQoL also aft er adjusti ng for baseline levels. These positi ve mental health outcomes can be the direct result of conversati ons between HCP and pati ent from which pati ents feel recognized, CHAPTER 7 114validated, trusted, worthy, reassured and comforted 26, 27 and indirectly through diagnosis and treatment of mental problems (anxiety and depression) and strengthened social support. Alternatively, it is possible that patients with higher levels of HRQoL and lower levels of distress naturally report higher levels of satisfaction with the received information, independent of the information they actually received. Our results suggest that it is important to satisfy the patient and to keep the patient satisfied with respect to information. The best way to unravel the information needs of a patient is to consult the patient him or herself, however this is rarely done 28. Furthermore, HCPs often do not check the understanding of the patient 29. Recently, some strategies were devised to address the information needs of cancer survivors. First, survivorship care plans provide cancer survivors with a summary of their treatment as a formal document that also includes recommendations for subsequent cancer surveillance, management of late effects, and strategies for health promotion 30 29. Second, feedback of patient reported outcomes (PRO) to the HCP has the potential to help detect unmet needs and symptoms, leading to better control and monitoring of such issues, serve as a guide for HCP to discuss HRQoL issues, act as patients' voice, and facilitate individualized information provision and care 31 32. Last, a recent founded Working Group of haematologists, radiation oncologists, epidemiologists and internists aimed to establish survivorship clinics with the goal to improve survivors' HRQoL by informing survivors about long-term risks, advice preventive measures, suggest screening and improve aftercare by providing rehabilitation programs 33. Participation of survivors could be an efficient solution to address the unmet information needs. The present study has limitations that should be mentioned. First, although the response rate at baseline was high and information was present concerning socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses, whether non-respondents declined to participate in the study because of poor health remains unknown. Secondly, a large part of the survivors did not respond to the second questionnaire, these non-responders had worse HRQoL scores at T1, which possibly caused some selection bias at T2. Third, the mean time since diagnosis was almost 4 years, which could influence the recall effect of information received. However we did not found differences in the perceived receipt of information among short- and long-term survivors and the majority of patients was still under active follow-up. Fourth, the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 only measures the information patients indicated to have received, it is not clear how much information was actually provided. It would therefore be interesting to compare data on actual information provision with data from questionnaires. Patient information delivery and perception are part of a complex process that is influenced by many factors including preexisting patient-related psychological and behavioral patterns, which can influence our 7SATISFACTION WITH INFORMATION AND HRQOL AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS 115results. Finally, since the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 is not a measure of clinical outcomes it was not possible to determine clinically meaningful diff erences. The declines in perceived receipt of informati on over ti me were stati sti cal signifi cant but small, while HRQoL, anxiety and depression did not change over ti me. It is therefore diffi cult to determine causal associati ons. An interventi on study which aims to improve informati on provision could provide more insight into the causality of these relati ons. Despite the limitati ons noted, the present study showed that sati sfacti on with the received informati on among lymphoma and MM survivors was associated with bett er HRQoL and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Survivors who were sati sfi ed with the received informati on on both ti me points report bett er mental HRQoL. HCPs should provide pati ents with informati on adapted to pati ents needs in order to sati sfy survivors and also to keep them sati sfi ed. The eff ecti veness of PRO feedback, survivorship care plans and the foundati on of survivorship clinics on pati ent sati sfacti on with informati on should be investi gated in future studies.CHAPTER 7 116referenCes 1. van der Meulen N, Jansen J, van Dulmen S, Bensing J, van Weert J.

Husson, H.R. 8 120abs Tra CT background: The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) is increasing worldwide, partly due to increased detection. We therefore assessed combined trends in incidence, survival and mortality of the various types of TC in The Netherlands between 1989 and 2009. methods: We included all patients 15 years with TC, diagnosed in the period 1989-2009 and recorded in The Netherlands Cancer Registry (N = 8021). Information on age, gender, date of diagnosis, histological type of tumour and TNM classification was recorded. Mortality data (up to 1 January 2010) were derived from Statistics Netherlands. Annual percentages of change in incidence, mortality, and relative survival were calculated. results: Since 1989 the incidence of TC increased significantly in The Netherlands (estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) = +1.7%). The incidence rates increased for all age groups (except for females 65 years), papillary tumours and -2.3% respectively). Five-year relative survival rates remained stable, however appeared to be somewhat higher for papillary (93%) and follicular and medullary tumours (68%) in the 2004-2009 period compared to earlier periods. Mortality due to TC decreased (EAPC = -1.9%). Conclusion: TC detection and incidence has been rising in The Netherlands, while mortality rates are decreasing and survival rates remained stable.8TRENDS IN THYROID CANCER INCIDENCE, MORTALITY AND SURVIVAL 121InTrOduCTIOn In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has increased drasti cally in the US and most European countries 1, 2. TC is the most common endocrine malignancy 3. The higher incidence rates are oft en att ributed to increased environmental radiati on exposure 4, radiati on therapy for the treatment of the head and neck areas 5, lower iodine nutriti on 6 or higher prevalence of obesity 7. The exact eti ology of TC remains unclear. It is also suggested that increasing use of more precise diagnosti cs, like cervical ultrasound and fi ne needle aspirati on biopsy (FNAB), contribute to an increased identi fi cati on of subclinical disease 2 8. Although a larger porti on of small tumours then appears to have been detected, slightly increased incidence rates of larger tumours are also observed 8. Contrary to the increasing incidence, mortality from TC remained stable in north America 2 and decreased (-23% and -28%, for men and women respecti vely) in the European Union 9 and prognosis is good (except for the anaplasti c type of tumour). The combined measurements of TC burden (i.e., incidence, mortality and survival) could indicate whether and where progress had been made in cancer diagnosis and treatment and where improvements might be needed. As none of the previous studies described all three determinants of TC burden in combinati on, we assessed long-term trends in incidence, mortality, and survival of TC in The Netherlands between 1989 and 2009. We hypothesized that in the absence of a clear patt ern of eti ological/environmental exposures the rising incidence might be largely due to increased diagnosti c scruti ny, leading to an increased detecti on of small tumours. If the incidence of small tumours would increase, due to its excellent prognosis, we expect the overall mortality rate to decrease and survival rates to increase. maTerIals and meTHOds data collecti on Populati on-based data were used from the nati on-wide Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR), which was started in 1989 and combines data from eight Dutch regional cancer registries, currently merged into two. The NCR is based on noti fi cati on of all new diagnosed malignancies in The Netherlands by the automated pathological archive (PALGA), supplemented by noti fi cati ons from the nati onal registry of hospital discharge, various clinical chemistry laboratories and radiotherapy insti tuti ons. Informati on on pati ent (sex, date of birth) and tumour characteristi cs (date of diagnosis, nely obtained from the medical records 6-12 months aft er diagnosis. CHAPTER 8 122Vital status was actively obtained on a regular basis from the municipal registries and from the database of deceased persons of the Central Bureau for Genealogy (date of last follow-up: 1 st January 2010). Survival time was calculated as the time from diagnosis to death or to 1st January 2010 or to date of emigration. Topography and histology were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3) 13. All tumours with an ICD-O-3 topography code thyroid (C73) diagnosed in the period 1989-2009 were included this study (n= 8021). The following 2), follicular cancer (8290, 8330-8332, 8335; and differentiation grade = 1 or 2), poorly differentiated TC (8010, 8012; and (8345, 8020-8035, 8041, 8575, 8980) and other. T stage was based on pathological T stage. For cases where pathological stage was unknown, clinical stage was used. Patients <15 years and >95 years were excluded from the survival analysis, as well as cases diagnosed at autopsy. Age at diagnosis was divided into four groups (<45; 45-59; 60-74; 75 years). The study period was divided into four categories of 5 years and one of 6 years: 1989-1993, 1994-1998, 1999-2003, and 2004-2009. Incidence rates were calculated per age group, sex, histological type and T stage. statistical analyses Annual incidence and mortality rates for the period 1989-2009 were calculated per 100,000 person-years, using the mid-year population size as obtained from Statistics Netherlands. Rates were age-standardized to the European standard population (European Standardized Rates (ESR)). Trends in incidence were evaluated by calculating the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). To calculate this, a regression line was fitted to the natural logarithm of the rates, using the calendar year as regressor variable (i.e. y = ax + b where y = ln (rate) and x = calendar year, then EAPC = 100 * (e a - 1)). This calculation assumes that the rates increased or decreased at a constant rate over the entire period. Joinpoint analyses were performed to discern significant changes in the trend and, if present, when they occurred 14. Relative survival was used as an estimation of disease-specific survival. It was derived as the ratio of observed survival of the cancer patients and the expected survival of a comparable age- and sex-matched group of the general population while using the Ederer method 15. Traditional, cohort-based, relative survival analysis was used to calculate 5-year relative survival. For the 5-year relative survival estimates of the last period (2004-2009) only the patients diagnosed in 2004 had 5-year follow-up. Recent changes in survival might therefore 8TRENDS IN THYROID CANCER INCIDENCE, MORTALITY AND SURVIVAL 123not be accurately represented by standard cohort 5-year survival esti mates. Period-based relati ve survival analysis should provide the most-up-to-date esti mates for recent ti me periods.Survival trends were quanti fi ed as the mean period percentage change (MPPC) within the period 1989-2009 esti mated by a linear regression model. A positi ve value of the mean period change implies an upward trend in survival (i.e. improving) and a negati ve value implies a negati ve trend (i.e. deteriorati on). Multi variate relati ve survival analyses, using Poisson regression modeling, were carried out to esti mate relati ve excess risk (RER) of dying adjusted for follow-up interval and age group. SAS soft ware (SAS system 9.2, SAS Insti tute, Cary, NC) was used to perform the stati sti cal analyses. resulTs Trends in incidence In The Netherlands 8021 new TC cases were registered between 1989 and 2009. Mean age at diagnosis was 53 \u00b1 19 (standard deviati on (SD)) years. The female to male rati o was 2.4:1. The proporti on male pati ents years from in 1989-1993 to 32% in 2004-2009. In females, 40% were < 45 years of age at diagnosis. Furthermore, the proporti on pati ents 45-59 years increased (Table 1). The overall incidence rate increased from 2.0 in 1989 to 2.9 per 100,000 person years in 2009 (EAPC= +1.7%; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3), corresponding to an increase from 315 cases in 1989 to 537 in 2009. For females the incidence rate increased from 3.1 in 1989 to 4.1 per 100,000 person years in 2009 (EAPC= +1.7%; 95% CI: to +4.7% (95% CI: 2.7-6.7) aft er 2001. For males the incidence rate increased from 1.0 in 1989 to 1.7 per 100,000 person years in 2009 (EAPC= +1.6%; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3).

While in 1989-2003, 5-year relati ve survival was bett er for females than in males, this discrepancy disappeared aft er 2003. Five-year relati ve survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis, being ~98% for <45 years, ~88% for 45-59 years, ~61% for 60-74 years and ~42% for 75+ years in the enti re study period, and increased non-signifi cantly for all age CHAPTER 8 128groups over time. Survival decreased with increasing stage of disease, with 5-year relative survival of ~95% for T1 disease in the entire period 1989-2009, while the 5-year relative survival for T2, T3, T4 disease were respectively, ~94%, ~80%, and ~52% in the entire study period. A non-significant increase over time was seen in survival of T1, T2, T3 thyroid cancer, while survival from T4 appeared to decrease over time. Five-year survival rates remained more or less stable for papillary TC (~93%) and follicular TC (~87%) over the entire study period and appeared to decrease slightly for medullary TC from 68% to 64% in 2004-2009. The 1-year relative survival for anaplastic thyroid cancer decreased from 16.2% in 1989-1993 to 14.5% in 2004-2009.

In absolute numbers we observed a slight increase from 98 deaths in 1989 to 105 deaths in 2009. dIsCussIOn Our study shows that since 1989 the incidence of TC increased significantly in The Netherlands, while mortality from TC decreased. This increase was due to papillary tumours only. Five-year relative survival remained stable and appeared to be somewhat higher for both sexes, all age groups and T1-T3 tumours and somewhat lower for T4 and medullary tumours in the period 2004-2009 compared to earlier periods. The one-year survival rate of anaplastic tumours remained low. The rising age-standardized incidence of TC in The Netherlands is in concordance with patterns observed in many other European countries and the US 1. The increase in our study was mainly due to the increased number of detected early stage tumours (T1) of papillary histological subtype. This shift to the detection of more early stage papillary tumours can partly be explained by the change in TNM classification in 2002, however the T1 incidence rates were already increasing before 2002 16 and incidence rates for T2 were also increasing after 2002. The incidence rates started to increase at a younger age in women than in men, possibly related to greater use of health care services by young and middle-aged women compared to men of the same age 17. Also, the incidence rate of papillary TC increased more steeply among women than men, likely because of the higher number of biopsies performed in this population 18. The main question debated in the literature is whether or not the observed increase in TC incidence is the result of a real increase in number of cases or of improved detection? A recent study in the US showed a significant decrease in tumour size over time and concluded that the apparent increase in TC incidence was largely due to more detection of subclinical disease 8. It has been shown that TC can exist as subclinical entity since at least one third of the adults have subclinical TC at autopsies 19. Improved detection by the increased use of and improved (resolution of) diagnostic tools and medical surveillance might be responsible for the detection of more subclinical disease and could also have resulted in a shift in detection from more advanced tumours to early stage tumours 18. Nevertheless, incidence rates also increased for T3 tumours, and this increase was larger than the decrease in incidence rates of T4 tumours. This increasing trend might be less related to the improved detection and increased surveillance. True increases in incidences of TC have been 8TRENDS IN THYROID CANCER INCIDENCE, MORTALITY AND SURVIVAL 131associated with diff erent risk factors like exposure to ionizing radiati on (fallout, diagnosti c tests like computed tomography scans and treatments like radiotherapy), low iodine intake 6 20 and overweight 7. However, none of these factors have been proven as risk factors in The Netherlands. Therefore more research into the events involved in the initi ati on and progression of thyroid cancer is needed. Five-year relati ve survival rates for diff erenti ated TC were high and within the range of rates described for the US 21 and Europe 22. The small diff erences suggest corresponding diff erences in the availability of diagnosti c and treatment opti ons, and in the eff ecti veness of healthcare systems. The non-signifi cant decrease in fi ve-year relati ve survival rates for T4 tumours could be explained by the decrease in incidence of the slowly growing T4 tumours, indicati ng that those tumours are earlier detected as T3 tumours. Furthermore, since 2002 any tumour with minimal extrathyroidal extension is registered as T3 instead of T4 and anaplasti c tumours are also registered as T4, leaving the truly advanced cancers with a worse prognosis as T4, which could explain the decrease in survival rates for these tumours.Five-year relati ve survival rates for anaplasti c (5.6 - 11.4% depending on race) and medullary cancer (73.5 - 88.7% depending on race) were higher is the US compared to The Netherlands 21. The low incidence rates of both tumours have limited the development of clinical experti se and conducti on of randomized clinical trials 23. The American Thyroid Associati on recently came up with evidence-based management guidelines for medullary 23 and anaplasti c TC 24. Disseminati on of standardized guidelines to Europe is important to ensure opti mal treatment for these pati ents. Recently, a study showed improved disease-specifi c survival for a subpopulati on of anaplasti c TC pati ents who were treated by aggressive multi modal regimes based on a prognosti c index 25. Applicati on of this prognosti c index in The Netherlands could possibly lead to some improvements in survival rates for this most lethal tumour. The increased incidence of TC was not accompanied by a concurrent increase in TC mortality which even decreased for both men and women, equal to other studies in Europe 9 and the US 26. Many of the detected tumours were indeed small treatable cancers. The detecti on of these small tumours could have preceded development of more advanced cancers (T4) or tumours with more unfavourable prognosis such as medullary and anaplasti c cancers whose incidence decreased and whose prognosis remained stable or decreased. Since a large part of the increased incidence in our study can be ascribed to the detecti on of small (subclinical) tumours, overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant cancer might be occurring 27. Indeed, most pati ents with cytological indeterminate nodules are referred for diagnosti c thyroid surgery, but the majority (66%) prove to have benign disease 28 CHAPTER 8 132and for these patients surgery is unnecessary 29. It has been hypothesized that increased detection of low risk tumours can lead to an overestimation of treatment efficacy and a subsequent rise in use of treatment 30. Up to now, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials to support management decisions for small and low-risk tumours. For patients with early-stage differentiated TC whose primary tumour is > 1 cm the guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine treatment to be selectively considered 9. Nevertheless, treatment with radioactive iodine is of uncertain benefit for patients with low-risk disease 31. In addition, the majority of patients with early-stage differentiated TC will have a favorable outcome and many of these tumours would remain asymptomatic during lifetime 32 However a small proportion of these patients will experience recurrent disease with increased morbidity 33. There is a need to improve the preoperative evaluation of low- risk thyroid nodules in order to prevent potential overtreatment and in addition to this a more conservative surgical approach without radioiodine therapy should be considered for low risk patients 33. A complete understanding of the various prognostic factors is important to advise the patient accordingly on the best treatment and long-term surveillance 26. This is important since we recently showed that problems and symptoms of TC and its treatment can be detected up to 20 years after diagnosis 34. These late symptoms were mostly related to thyroid dysregulation (neuromuscular, concentration, sympathetic, psychological and sensory problems) and not so much to specific morbidities as a consequence of surgery (voice problems, throat/mouth problems and problems with scar). Long term health problems are becoming more important since the prevalence of TC survivors who received more or less aggressive/invasive treatment is increasing and will probably lead to an increased burden on health care in the coming years. By combining the three epidemiologic determinants of TC burden (i.e., incidence, mortality and survival) with essential prognostic determinants we achieved a more comprehensive assessment of the progress against TC, however also quality of life assessments should be added 35. Some limitations of this study require consideration. Despite the rather clinical nature of the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR), lack of details regarding applied primary treatments in our population-based registry limited the potential to explore and elucidate specific reasons for the observed changes in survival. Also, information on the exact tumour size is lacking in the NCR. Thirdly, to calculate 5-year relative survival, we used two different methods, i.e., cohort- and period-based survival analyses. However, the cohort- and period-based 5-year relative survival estimates exhibited relatively small differences. In conclusion, TC detection and incidence has been rising in The Netherlands, while mortality rates are decreasing and survival rates remained stable and appeared to be somewhat higher except for advanced tumours of which the frequency decreased markedly. 8TRENDS IN THYROID CANCER INCIDENCE, MORTALITY AND SURVIVAL 133referenCes 1.

A PubMed literature search for original articles published until February 2011 was performed. Twenty-seven articles, conducted between 1997 and 2010, which met the predefined inclusion criteria, were subjected to a quality checklist. results: All selected studies, except one, were of adequate or good quality. Surgery had a negative impact on short-term HRQoL scores, but these scores returned to preoperational levels when time since surgery increased. Long-term thyroid hormone therapy (levothyroxine) can lead to abnormalities like hyperthyroidism. HRQoL was most affected during thyroid hormone withdrawal for radioiodine remnant ablation or follow-up procedures. The use of recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone instead of hormone withdrawal leads to considerable improvements in HRQoL during follow-up testing. The results for (long-term) survivors were contradicting. While most (long-term) survivors report some specific long-lasting health problems, some studies found a lower HRQoL for thyroid cancer survivors compared with a healthy population or other reference groups, whereas other studies found similar HRQoL levels. Conclusion: This review indicates that thyroid cancer survivors generally have a similar or slightly worse HRQoL compared to the normative population, however they report some specific medical problems after cancer treatment and follow-up tests which have a direct negative impact on their current HRQoL and could affect their long-term HRQoL. Specific longitudinal survivorship studies are lacking.9LITERATURE REVIEW: QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER PATIENTS 137InTrOduCTIOn The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising worldwide. As the mortality rate remains relati vely stable, the number of thyroid cancer survivors is growing, with over 430,000 people with a history of thyroid cancer in the United States in 2007 1, 2. Treatment of thyroid cancer mostly involves surgery (total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy with or without lymphadenectomy) followed by radioiodine ablati on therapy. These aggressive surgical and postoperati ve treatments are associated with toxicity and long-term physical and psychological morbidity 3.The removal of the total thyroid gland is accompanied by a lifelong dependence on exogenous thyroid hormone (levothyroxine). Despite the effi cacy of these primary treatments and the high long-term survival rates, the disease can recur even decades later. Therefore long-term follow-up (neck whole body scanning (WBS)), is necessary and associated with physical and psychological discomfort. In case of recurrence, additi onal radioiodine treatment or surgery is indicated. The treatment and follow-up care procedures impose great challenges on thyroid cancer survivors and could potenti ally aff ect their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of cancer treatment is not only to increase survival but also to preserve HRQoL 4. HRQoL is a multi dimensional construct that covers the pati ents' percepti ons of his or her physical, emoti onal, social, and cogniti ve functi ons. HRQoL assessment is an important aspect of cancer care. It gives a good overview of cancer pati ents' subjecti ve experiences with cancer, its treatment, and follow-up procedures 5. Cancer survivors oft en deal with adaptati on problems and assessment of their HRQoL could help to improve aft ercare 6. The recent availability of recombinant human thyroid sti mulati ng hormone (rhTSH or thyrogen) as a less burdensome alternati ve for thyroid hormone withdrawal in the follow-up procedure sti mulated the research into the HRQoL of thyroid cancer pati ents. However, litt le is known about the impact of primary treatment and follow-up therapies on the HRQoL of (long-term) cancer survivors. The US Nati onal Coaliti on for Cancer Survivorship defi nes a person as a survivor from the moment of diagnosis through the balance of his or her life 7. The term 'long-term cancer survivors' refers to those who are living 5 years or more beyond a cancer diagnosis. The goal of this review is to provide a complete overview of the literature on the HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors. CHAPTER 9 138meTHOds search strategy A computerized search of the literature through the search engine Pubmed was performed on February 7, 2011. The search strategy combined the term 'thyroid cancer' or 'thyroid and 'well-being'. The reference lists of all identified publications were checked to retrieve other relevant publications. There were no restrictions with regard to the year of publication. The search yielded 371 hits. selection criteria Studies that met the following criteria were included: (1) if the objective was to describe HRQoL of thyroid cancer patients (2) if the publication was an original article (3) if the article was a full report published in English and (4) if it was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: (1) if the study focused on terminally ill patients (life expectancy of less than 6 months) or children with thyroid cancer (<18 years of age), (2) if the study focused on patients with other thyroid diseases such as hypothyroidism without having thyroid cancer or other cancers as head-neck cancer or nasopharyngeal cancer, (3) if the study focused on risk groups with a (genetic) predisposition for thyroid cancer, (4) if the study only described experienced symptoms instead of HRQoL outcomes (5) if the objective was to describe the relation of HRQoL with other variables such as mood states, without the description of HRQoL itself. The described inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to our initial 371 hits. Based on their titles and abstracts, 37 articles met our criteria. The hard copies were obtained and reviewed by two investigators (OH and LP). After careful review, 27 articles fulfilled our selection criteria and were included in this review. The flow-chart of this selection procedure is shown in Figure 1. Quality assessment The methodological quality of each of the selected articles was independently assessed by the two investigators based on established criteria for systematic reviews (Table 1) 8. Each item of a selected study, that matched our criteria, was assigned one point. If an item did not meet our criteria or was described insufficiently or not at all, zero points were assigned. The highest possible score was 12. Studies scoring 10 points or more were arbitrarily considered to be of 'high quality'. Studies scoring between 6 and 10 points were rated as 'adequate quality'. Studies scoring less than 6 points were considered to be of 'low quality'.9LITERATURE REVIEW: QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER PATIENTS 139Figure 1 Flow -chart of selection procedure Computerized search of databases and reference checking 371 articles found 371 hits 334 articles excluded due to selection criteria and removal of duplicate articles 37 articles potentially applicable Hard copies were obtained for more detailed evaluation of our selection criteria 27 articles were finally selected for this review After applying our selection criteria to the hard copies 10 articles were excluded because they: - described symptoms instead of HRQoL measures (5) - were written in Polish (1) and German (1) - focused on patients with other thyroid diseases (2) - described the relation of HRQoL with other variables, without the description of HRQoL (1) figure 1: Flow-chart of selecti on procedure Table 1: List of criteria for assessing the methodological quality of studies on quality of life of thyroid cancer pati ents Positi ve if with respect to HRQoL assessment 1.

HRQoL was the primary outcome in all studies. Eight studies focused on the impact of a specific treatment on HRQoL, 11 studies on the impact of follow-up procedures on HRQoL (3 of these also focused on some aspects of treatment) and 11 studies evaluated HRQoL among (long-term) cancer survivors. Prospective, cross-sectional, observational as well as intervention studies were included. The SF-36 9 was the most frequently used HRQoL questionnaire. The main findings are summarized in Table 2. methodological quality The evaluation of the methodological quality of the studies by the two reviewers yielded disagreement on 11 items (3.3%), mostly due to differences in interpretation. These were solved through discussion in a consensus meeting. The quality scores ranged from 2 to 12 points (Table 2) and the mean quality score was 8.8. One of the studies had a low quality according to our criteria and 10 studies had a high quality. The remaining 16 studies had an adequate quality. General shortcomings of the included studies were a lack of description of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, response rates below 75%, a cross-sectional design, and a lack of information on the degree of selection of the patient sample. The studies will be discussed in order of their aim, starting with the effects of specific treatments and follow-up procedures on HRQoL, and ending with the HRQoL of (long-term) thyroid cancer survivors in general. Terminology is not consistent over the included articles, therefore 'HRQoL' is used throughout this manuscript to overcome illegibility. Thyroid cancer treatments Surgery Three studies, two prospective 10, 11 and one cross-sectional 12, focused on the effects of surgery on HRQoL of thyroid cancer patients. The first prospective study showed that thyroid cancer patients who underwent (hemi)thyroidectomy had worse scores on social functioning, mental health and role limitation due to physical and emotional problems in comparison with the general population of the United States 10. However, there was a trend towards recovery when time since surgery increased up to 12 months after operation. There were no differences in HRQoL scores between patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy at any time point. The second prospective study demonstrated that postoperative HRQoL scores (12 months after surgery) on the domain of eating and emotional functioning, for patients who underwent tracheal resection for locally invasive thyroid cancer, were significantly 9LITERATURE REVIEW: QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER PATIENTS 141bett er than those of a comparison group composed of pati ents undergoing treatment for oropharynx cancer 11. Baseline HRQoL scores were lacking in this prospecti ve study. In a cross-secti onal study (pati ents' median ti me since treatment was 2 years), pati ents submitt ed to modifi ed radical neck dissecti on reported worse chewing and shoulder scores than pati ents submitt ed to selecti ve paratracheal lymph node on and pati ents who only underwent total thyroidectomy 12. A mild dysfuncti on of the shoulder of pati ents undergoing neck dissecti on was also found in a study aimed to investi gate HRQoL of long-term thyroid carcinoma survivors 13. In summary, surgery for thyroid cancer leads to worse mental and physical HRQoL scores compared to the scores of the general populati on, however there is a trend towards recovery in ti me. The size of the eff ect of HRQoL depends on the type of surgery. Radioiodine remnant ablati on Two randomized controlled trials focused on the eff ects of radioiodine ablati on with or without recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) 14, 15 on HRQoL. In both studies, euthyroid pati ents on L-thyroxine treatment receiving rhTSH was preserved to a drop in HRQoL for hypothyroid pati ents withdrawing L-thyroxine treatment to prepare for remnant ablati on. In the Italian study, scores of seven of the eight scales of the SF-36 improved for the euthyroid group from baseline (within 14 days aft er thyroidectomy) to one month aft er ablati on (week 4), while these same scores deteriorated for the hypothyroid group 14. In the French study, physical well-being, functi onal well-being, and fati gue were aff ected in the hypothyroid group at t1 (leaving the hospital aft er remnant ablati on) compared to baseline (one day aft er thyroidectomy). However, HRQoL was preserved in the euthyroid pati ents aft er remnant ablati on. Aft er 3 (t2) and 9 months (t4), the groups were no longer stati sti cally diff erent study found that postoperati ve radioacti ve iodine treatment was the most important predictor of HRQoL in pati ents with thyroid cancer, aff ecti ng the domains chewing, speech, taste, saliva and anxiety 12. This study also concluded that pati ents who received higher doses (more than 150 mCi) of radioacti ve iodine reported signifi cantly worse HRQoL compared to ents who doses.In summary, radioiodine remnant ablati on aff ects some, mainly physical, domains of HRQoL, however rhTSH preserves HRQoL bett er than withdrawing levothyroxine treatment. Thyroid hormone therapy Four studies, three prospecti ve 16-18and one cross-secti onal study 19, focused on the eff ects of lifelong thyroid hormone treatment on HRQoL.The fi rst prospecti ve study found that pati ents under chronic suppressive levothyroxine treatment (chronic mild or subclinical hyperthyroidism) had an impaired HRQoL compared CHAPTER 9 142with healthy age-matched controls 18. The total score and the emotional, sleep, energy and social scales of the Nottingham Health Profile and mental health, general health and social function of the SF-36 were lower in the thyroid cancer patient group at baseline (under usual levothyroxine dose). After 4 to 7 days of withdrawal of levothyroxine, necessary for whole body scanning, HRQoL scores were better than under levothyroxine treatment although one day before scanning (hypothyroid state) the HRQoL scores were worse.In a randomized controlled trial it was investigated whether restoration to euthyroidism by decreasing levothyroxine dose improved HRQoL parameters. After 6 months, all HRQoL parameter values of the low TSH-group were the same as the baseline values. For the euthyroid group, only the role limitations as a result of physical problems (SF-36) deteriorated after 6 months 17. The authors concluded that restoration of euthyroidism in general does not affect HRQoL.Another prospective study found that patients on thyroid hormone treatment, before rhTSH, were not significantly different from the US norm population on four of the eight SF-36 scales (physical functioning, vitality, social functioning and role emotional) and on the mental component scale. However, patients on thyroid hormone therapy scored better than the US norm population on two scales (role physical function and bodily pain) and the physical component scale whereas they scored worse on the general and mental health scale 16. A cross-sectional study evaluated the effects of chronic suppressive doses of levothyroxine on HRQoL. Compared with the German general population, patients scored lower on seven of eight SF-36 domains (not bodily pain) and on the mental component scale 19. However, patients using levothyroxine scored better on physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, vitality and role-emotional scales and the mental and physical component scores compared to patients under short-term hypothyroidism 19. In summary, levothyroxine treatment results in similar or slightly impaired HRQoL compared to the general population. Thyroid cancer follow-up tests Thyroid hormone withdrawal for Tg measurement and/or whole body scanning Four prospective studies found a negative effect of thyroid hormone withdrawal on several aspects of HRQoL 18, 20-22. The first study found a significant reduction of HRQoL from the week before the radioiodine scan to peak thyroid hormone withdrawal, while there was a gradual improvement from peak withdrawal to 4 weeks after the scan at normal levothyroxine therapy. The main differences in HRQoL between peak withdrawal and normal levothyroxine therapy were seen on the physical, psychological and social well-being scales, both for the thyroid specific HRQoL and the general HRQoL (FACT-G) 20. Besides this, the second study also found a reduction in the spiritual domain between baseline (prior to withdrawal) and 9LITERATURE REVIEW: QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER PATIENTS 143aft er the 3 week withdrawal period. Four weeks aft er resumpti on of the thyroid hormone therapy the HRQoL domains were similar to baseline levels 21. The third prospecti ve study found that HRQoL worsened with the ti me of levothyroxine withdrawal. In the fi rst 2 weeks of levothyroxine withdrawal there was a signifi cant worsening of the physical domain and total HRQoL score of the FACT-G, and additi onally aft er 4 weeks of withdrawal the emoti onal and social domains were also signifi cantly aff ected compared with the start of withdrawal 22. Another study found that pati ents in profound hypothyroidism aft er withdrawing levothyroxine treatment for whole body scanning had worse scores on all HRQoL indexes of the SF-36 and Notti ngham Health Profi le compared to euthyroid controls 18. One prospecti ve study searched for HRQoL eff ects of a short (3 week) levothyroxine withdrawal instead of a long (4 weeks) levothyroxine withdrawal for thyroglobulin screening. There was a signifi cant reducti on in 6 of the 8 HRQoL scales of the SF-36 (physical functi on, role-physical, vitality, social functi on, role-emoti onal and mental health) from the ti me of withdrawal to the ti me of peak TSH. Four weeks aft er resumpti on of levothyroxine therapy HRQoL returned to prewithdrawal levels for all categories. In comparison with the general populati on SF-36 scores, except vitality, did not fall below 50% of the general populati on scores 23. A qualitati ve cross-secti onal study found that changes in physical well-being due to withdrawal from thyroid hormone medicati on infl uenced psychological en social well-being 24. The other two cross-secti onal studies evaluated the eff ects of short-term hypothyroidism in pati ents hospitalized for radioiodine therapy or whole body scanning 5, 19. The hypothyroid pati ents scored worse in seven of eight domains of the SF-36 in the fi rst study 19 and on all domains in the second study compared with the German general populati on 5. The mental component score of the SF-36 was also signifi cantly lower in both studies for the hypothyroid pati ents and the physical component score was worse in the second study for the hypothyroid group. In summary, thyroid hormone withdrawal causes signifi cant reducti ons in physical and mental HRQoL. Aft er resumpti on of the levothyroxine treatment HRQoL levels will return to prewithdrawal levels. Thyroid hormone withdrawal vs. rhTSH for Tg measurement and/or WBS Three prospecti ve studies were conducted to assess HRQoL diff erences between rhTSH and thyroid hormone withdrawal in thyroglobulin measurement and/or whole body scanning 16, 25, 26. The fi rst prospecti ve multi center study found that aft er rhTSH administrati on, 7 of 8 domains of the SF-36 were at or above the level of the US reference group; only general health was signifi cantly lower for the rhTSH group. In contrast, aft er hormone withdrawal the pati ents scored signifi cantly worse on all 8 domains compared to the US reference group 16. The same was found in the other two studies where rhTSH pati ents reported signifi cantly CHAPTER 9 144better HRQoL scores on performance of physical activities, problems with daily activities as a result of physical health, bodily pain, and emotional problems compared to hypothyroid patients. The physical component score of the SF-36, but not the mental component score, was also higher for rhTSH patients 25, 26. In summary, the use of rhTSH instead of thyroid hormone withdrawal prevents HRQoL deterioration accompanied by the withdrawal. Thyroid cancer survivors Eleven studies, 2 prospective 27, 28 and 9 cross-sectional 13, 29-36, focused on the HRQoL of (long-term) thyroid cancer survivors. One prospective study found no significant differences in SF-36 scores between thyroid cancer patients (14 years since the primary operation) and a healthy Swedish reference population 27. However, the other prospective study found significant differences in HRQoL between patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) (diagnosed from < 1 to 23 years earlier) and a control group of subjects with non-toxic multinodular goiter (enlargement of the thyroid that is not associated with overproduction of thyroid hormone or malignancy) on levothyroxine therapy 28. DTC patients scored worse on anxiety, depression, somatisation, hostility. A second evaluation with a subset of the thyroid cancer patients after 8-14 months showed a slight improvement in overall sum scores and on the somatisation scale.Four cross-sectional studies found worse HRQoL scores for thyroid cancer survivors compared with healthy reference groups 29-31, 35. Thyroid cancer patients (5 months - 27 years after diagnosis) had lower scores on all domains of the SF-36 except for social functioning compared to the general Singaporean population. Older patients ( 50 years) scored worse on physical functioning, higher educated patients (>12 years) scored better on mental health, and employed patients scored better on role physical emotional domains compared to their counterparts 29. Compared with German reference values, patients with non-metastatic thyroid cancer under levothyroxine therapy (mean period since the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was 5.5 years) reported significantly lower vitality, role-physical, mental health, role-emotional and social functioning domains of the SF-36 during their first year after diagnosis. After this first year, the SF-36 domains increased correlating with the time since initial diagnosis, except for vitality and role-emotional functioning 30. When compared with Dutch controls, selected by patients themselves, thyroid cancer survivors (median time after initial treatment was 6.3 years) scored worse on social functioning and general health of the SF-36. When compared with age- and gender-matched controls from other HRQoL-studies, physical functioning and role limitations due to physical problems were also negatively affected in the patient group. Better scores on the social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems and general health scales were correlated with a longer time since initial treatment 31. Disease-free survivors of DTC showed decreased 9LITERATURE REVIEW: QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER PATIENTS 145HRQoL compared with age-matched controls from the Korean general populati on on fi ve functi onal domains (physical, role, cogniti ve, emoti onal and social) of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 35. A lower HRQoL was associated with higher scores on anxiety, depression and fati gue. One cross-secti onal study found no signifi cant diff erences in total HRQoL scores on the 15D between thyroid cancer survivors (mean 12.4 years aft er initi al treatment) and an age- and gender-standardized general Finnish populati on. The survivors scored worse on the sleeping, speech and distress domains of the 15D and bett er on the discomfort and symptom items compared to the general populati on. Older age at ti me of initi al treatment was associated with worse HRQoL 32. Four cross-secti onal studies without a reference group found that thyroid cancer survivors reported good long-term health 33 and scored very high on all domains of the EORTC- QLQ-C30 34, but also reported thyroid specifi c, lasti ng medical problems due to cancer and its treatment33, 34. The mean score of general health was 3.1 on a 5-point scale for pati ents who underwent total thyroidectomy 13. This was lower than expected when compared with other forms of cancer. The last study found that fati gue, high impact of operati onal scar, and chills (cold intolerance) were negati vely associated with HRQoL, while social support was positi vely correlated with HRQoL 36. Contradictory, they also showed that pati ents at 19-36 months aft er thyroidectomy had lower HRQoL scores compared with those pati ents within 18 months of operati on 36. In summary, (long-term) thyroid cancer survivors score similar or worse on HRQoL scales compared to the general populati on. Thyroid cancer survivors report some specifi c long-lasti ng problems. dIsCussIOn Thyroid cancer survivors report severe (long-term) impairments of HRQoL aft er treatment and follow-up procedures. Surgery had a negati ve impact on short-term HRQoL scores, but HRQoL scores recovered when the ti me since surgery increased. Based on one study, no diff erences were found between total thyroidectomy and hemithyroidectomy, more research is needed. The exact infl uence of surgery on HRQoL cannot be determined, because most pati ents received radioiodine shortly aft er the operati on which distorts the infl uence of surgery. Lifelong thyroid hormone therapy can lead to slightly impaired HRQoL scores, this impairment was not found in studies with higher quality. HRQoL was most aff ected during thyroid hormone withdrawal for radioiodine remnant ablati on or follow-up procedures. The use of rhTSH instead of hormone withdrawal leads to considerable improvements in HRQoL during follow-up testi ng.

While most patients report some specific long-lasting health problems, most high quality studies found a lower HRQoL for thyroid cancer survivors compared with a healthy population or other reference groups, whereas lower quality studies found no differences with the normal population. However, long-term survivorship studies are lacking and also the influence of developing a metastasis on HRQoL is underreported. Comparison of the results of the included survivorship studies using the SF-36 as HRQoL questionnaire 27, 29-31, with data from studies with patients with chronic disorders showed that thyroid cancer survivors reported better HRQoL scores on all SF-36 subscales compared to patients with chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fibromyalgia and depression 38-40. Thyroid cancer survivors scored better or similar on the physical scales (physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, role-physical) and worse on vitality and the mental scales (social functioning, role-emotional, mental health) compared to diabetes mellitus patients 39, 41. The results of the studies discussed in this review should be handled with caution. Most included studies were of adequate quality. However there were several methodological issues that impede drawing strong conclusions on the HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors. First, there is a lack of a valid, thyroid cancer specific instrument to assess HRQoL 12, 42. Most studies used a general HRQoL questionnaire, which cannot capture the specific complaints associated with thyroid cancer and its treatment. Also, many different questionnaires were used to assess HRQoL which makes it difficult to compare the results of the different studies. Other problems were small sample sizes (less than 100 patients) 10, 11, 13-15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 34, lack of (healthy) control groups 12, 13, 20-24, 34, 36 and use of cross-sectional designs 5, 12, 13, 19, 24, 29-34, 36. Most studies focused on survivors between 1 and 5 years after diagnosis while the negative effects of cancer and its treatment can still fluctuate years thereafter. The diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer significantly impacts the lives of survivors 43. Radical surgical treatment and toxicities of treatment can create chronic long-term health problems and late effects like vocal cord paralysis, hoarseness, fatigue, insomnia, chills (cold intolerance), tetany and tingling around the mouth 36. Because the thyroid gland is (partially) removed, most health problems are endocrine related and caused by the hyper- and hypothyroid states. Frequently reported symptoms are peripheral edema, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, insomnia, intolerance of cold, temperature sensitivity, weight gain, sleep disturbances, skin dryness, muscle cramping, constipation, hoarseness, slow movements, anxiety, puffy face and hands, and loss of libido 3, 19, 44. The fluctuating thyroid hormone levels could cause the different results for the effect of levothyroxine on HRQoL. Some patients experience hyperthyroid symptoms accompanied by more energy and better well-being, while others experience more hypothyroid symptoms accompanied by more 9LITERATURE REVIEW: QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER PATIENTS 153negati ve distress and worse well-being. It is important for pati ents to undergo regular medical check-ups, not only to check the recurrence status, but also to adapt the dose of levothyroxine. The use of rhTSH in follow-up care leaded to a reducti on in health problems and consequently maintenance of HRQoL. The recent trend in management of thyroid cancer towards individualizing treatment and avoiding aggressive interventi ons in low risk cases 45 is expected to have a positi ve impact on HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors. Besides direct treatment and follow-up related eff ects, HRQoL can also be aff ected negati vely by fear and uncertainty related to a cancer diagnosis, feelings of diagnosis being dismissed as not seriously or \"having a good cancer (prognosti cally)\", receiving confl icti on about treatment-related side-eff ects 43. There is a need for multi disciplinary aft er care leading to an improved HRQoL 30.The fi rst step for multi disciplinary aft er care will be recogniti on, recording and acknowledgment of specifi c (long-term) health problems of thyroid cancer pati ents by both primary and secondary health care professionals. Thereaft er, development and evaluati on of eff ecti ve interventi ons is needed to address the needs of thyroid survivors. These interventi ons should not only be directed to adequate management of long-term problems, but also to adequate informati on provision. Thyroid pati ents perceive their illness on a subjecti ve, emoti onal basis unrelated to its actual severity therefore inclusion of a psychologist in the multi disciplinary team could help to improve illness representati ons 46. Another good opportunity would be the implementati on of a survivorship care plan 47, which aims at providing a cancer survivor with a summary of their course of treatment, management of late eff ects, and strategies for health promoti on. Another component of such a plan is an ongoing care plan so that cancer survivors receive coordinated care from team members knowledgeable about the disease process and treatment-related side-eff ects. Concluding, thyroid cancer has a big impact on survivors and multi disciplinary monitoring is therefore recommended. Future studies on HRQoL in thyroid cancer survivors should be prospecti ve in design, include larger number of parti cipants and include a thyroid cancer specifi c HRQoL questi onnaire.

Ensuring quality care for cancer survivors: ng the survivorship care quality of life questi onnaire (THYCa-Qol) background: To date, no valid instrument is available that focuses on specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues that affect thyroid cancer survivors. Objective of this study was to develop and pretest a thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire that can be used in addition to the more general European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). material and methods: Potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a focusgroup meeting, and an issue list completed by 6 health care professionals (HCP) and 18 thyroid cancer survivors. Resultant issues were analyzed on importance and relevance (Phase I). The issues were formulated into a long provisional list of questions (Phase II). These questions were administered in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 306 Dutch thyroid cancer survivors to pretest the hypothesized scale structure (Phase III). Although the development of this questionnaire was not set up as an international study, phase I-III are in agreement with the methodology of the EORTC guidelines. results: The literature search, focusgroup and issue list completed by HCP and survivors resulted in 75 issues. These were reduced to create a 30 item provisional list. Pretesting led to a selection of 24 items with a good range of response. This resulted in the THYCA-QoL containing 24 items and seven conceptual scales. Conclusion: The THYCA-QoL in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C30 is ready for a large (international) scale validation study, and will assess HRQoL issues of most relevance and concern for thyroid cancer survivors.10DEVELOPMENT OF THYCA-QOL 159InTrOduCTIOn The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising worldwide 1. Since the mortality rate of pati ents suff vely stable, and survival rates are high (5-year survival rates around 97% in 2007)2, the number of thyroid cancer survivors is growing. In the United States in 2007, over 430,000 people have a history of thyroid cancer 2, 3. Treatment of thyroid cancer mostly involves surgery, predominantly total thyroidectomy with or without lymphadenectomy, followed by radioiodine treatment to ablate the remaining thyroid ti ssue 4. Dependent on staging of the thyroid cancer hemithyroidectomy could suffi ce. These aggressive surgical and postoperati ve treatments are associated with long-term physical and psychological morbidity 5. The removal of the whole thyroid gland is accompanied by a lifelong dependence on pharmacotherapy with thyroid hormone (levothyroxine) with dosing regimes suppressing TSH producti on. Despite the effi cacy of these primary treatments and the high long-term survival rates, the disease has the potenti al to recur even decades later. Therefore, intensive long-term periodical follow-up, is necessary and associated with physical and psychological discomfort. In case of recurrence, additi onal radioiodine treatment or surgery is indicated. The treatment and follow-up care procedures impose great challenges on thyroid cancer survivors and could aff ect their health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a multi dimensional construct that covers the pati ents' percepti ons of his or her physical, emoti onal, social, and cogniti ve functi ons. HRQoL gives a good overview of cancer pati ents' subjecti ve experiences on cancer and its treatment and follow-up procedures 6. Cancer pati ents oft en deal with adaptati on problems. Assessment of their HRQoL could help to improve aft ercare 7. However, to date litt le is known about the impact of primary treatment and follow-up therapies on the HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors. The US Nati onal Coaliti on for Cancer Survivorship defi nes a person as a survivor from the moment of diagnosis through the balance of his or her life 8. The long-term HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors is also underexposed. A recent systemati c review indicated that thyroid cancer survivors generally have a similar or slightly worse HRQoL compared to the normati ve populati on 9. Nevertheless, thyroid cancer survivors do report some specifi c medical problems during and aft er cancer treatment and follow-up tests which have a direct negati ve impact on their current HRQoL and could possibly aff ect their long-term HRQoL 9. The main problem of previous studies is the lack of a valid, specifi c instrument to assess the HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors. Most studies used a general HRQoL questi onnaire, which cannot unveil specifi c thyroid cancer related complaints. In a limited number of studies, some thyroid cancer specifi c items were added to a more general HRQoL questi onnaire 10-13. However, these items were never validated, nor do they cover the whole spectrum of CHAPTER 10 160health problems associated with thyroid cancer. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) developed a core cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) consisting of 30 items 14. The core questionnaire was intended to be supplemented by additional modules to assess specific disease and treatment related quality of life issues in particular patient groups 15. To the best of our knowledge, no module existed for thyroid cancer, nor did any other validated disease-specific questionnaire exist for this patient population. Aim of this study was to develop a thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire applicable in combination with the core measure (EORTC QLQ-C30), in order to assess treatment and cancer specific side-effects of thyroid cancer. We describe the first three out of four phases of the development of a thyroid cancer specific module to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30. maTerIal and meTHOds study design Preparation and development of the thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire followed the guidelines published by the EORTC QOL Group for phase I-III 15-17, however our questionnaire is not an EORTC QOL group product and the development of this questionnaire was not set up as an international study. The module development process has four distinct phases, aimed at ensuring validity and reliability. Phase I: Phase I was aimed at compiling an exhaustive list of relevant HRQoL issues for thyroid cancer survivors. Extensive literature searches through PUBMED (February 2010) were conducted to identify all relevant HRQoL issues using the keywords: \"quality of life\", \"health-related to \"thyroid cancer\" or \"thyroid carcinoma\". The retrieved provisional list with issues was then translated into Dutch.A focus group with thyroid cancer survivors (N=4) was composed in order to discuss relevant HRQoL issues in general, with respect to their phase of disease. An estimation of the impact of these issues to the survivors was explored. With this information issues that were lacking in the provisional list were added to this list. The provisional list was then presented to health care providers (HCP; N=6) for feedback on appropriateness of content and breadth of coverage. Missing issues were added to the list. The health care providers were asked to rate the issues from 1 (not relevant for thyroid cancer survivors) to 4 (very relevant for thyroid cancer survivors on a Likert scale (relevance rating) and to select the 25 core issues which must be definitely included in the questionnaire (priority rating). The same was asked to a diverse group of thyroid cancer survivors (N=18). Issues with high relevance ratings 10DEVELOPMENT OF THYCA-QOL 161(mean score 1.5) for both health care providers and survivors and high priority rati ngs for inclusion in the module (rati ngs 25%) for both health care providers and survivors were added to the fi nal list of issues. Phase II: The fi nal list of HRQoL issues was operati onalised into questi ons compati ble with the EORTC much') and ti me frame (one week for all items, except four weeks for the sexuality items). Where possible, issues which had been constructed into items in previous EORTC modules were used or adapted to provide comparability of data. This was done using the EORTC QOL Item Bank 18, which comprises all Phase III:Phase III of the module development was divided into two parts. In the fi rst part the fi nal list was pretested in a group (N=8) of thyroid cancer survivors (who did not parti cipate in phase I). The objecti ve was to identi fy problems relati ng to the phrasing and clarity of items. Survivors were asked to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the thyroid specifi c items and underwent cogniti ve debriefi ng, indicati ng if they found any questi ons annoying, confusing, upsetti ng or intrusive, and if so, they were asked to re-phrase the questi on. Survivors were asked whether or not questi ons were irrelevant or additi onal issues should be included in the module. The questi onnaire was adapted to the responses on these debriefi ng questi ons.In the second part of phase III, the resultant fi nal questi onnaire was pretested in a sample of survivors (N=306) to test the scale structure. stati sti cal analyses Descripti ve stati sti cs were used to calculate relevance and priority rati ngs of the issue list of phase I and to analyze the debriefi ng questi ons of the fi rst part of phase III. For the second part of phase III, item descripti ve stati sti cs and the response distributi ons for each item were calculated, in order to examine central tendency, variability and symmetry. To support construct validity, factor analysis was used to determine the underlying constructs, which explain signifi cant porti ons of the variance. The factor loadings were examined in order to explain the meaning of each construct. Multi -trait scaling analysis was employed to confi rm the scale structure (found aft er exploratory factor analyses) of the questi onnaire. To test for item-scale convergent validity, correlati ons of 0.40 or greater were sought between an individual item and its scale, corrected for overlap. Item-scale discriminant validity was examined by comparing the correlati on of each item with its own scale versus other scales. An item was expected to CHAPTER 10 162correlate significantly higher with its own scale than with other scales. Additionally, reliability was tested via Cronbach's alpha coefficients, which ranges between 0 and 1. The higher the score, the more reliable the generated scale is. A minimum score of 0.70 is preferred 20. Furthermore, convergent and divergent validity was examined by evaluating Pearson's correlations between the various scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and found scales of the thyroid cancer specific questionnaire. It was expected that scales that are conceptually related correlate moderately to highly with one another (r0.40). Conversely, scales with a less conceptual relation are expected to show weak correlations (r<0.40) 20 All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) resul Ts Phase I: Twenty-seven papers on HRQoL of thyroid cancer survivors were identified 9, and one non-validated thyroid cancer specific questionnaire was identified 10. This non-validated questionnaire did not cover the whole spectrum of health problems associated with thyroid cancer because it only added four thyroid cancer specific items to a more general HRQoL questionnaire for cancer survivors. A list of 64 relevant issues related to thyroid cancer was derived from these 27 articles. The focusgroup with four thyroid cancer survivors (mean age of 53 years, 2-19 years since diagnosis, 3 survivors with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and 1 with medullary thyroid carcinoma) resulted in 11 additional issues relevant for thyroid cancer survivors. The rating (mean scores, range, prevalence and proportions of priority ratings) of the 75-issues by health care providers (N=6; three internist-endocrinologists, two surgeons and one MD specialized in nuclear medicine) and 18 thyroid cancer survivors (mean age of 49 years, 1-18 years since diagnosis, all differentiated thyroid cancer) resulted in removal of 37 issues. Additionally, eight issues of the remaining 38 issues were already covered by the EORTC QLQ-C30 (sleeping troubles (item 11), constipation (item 16), tiredness (item 18), difficulty concentrating (item 20), irritability (item 23), difficulty with remembering (item 25), troubles with family life (item 26), troubles in social life (item 27). This resulted in a list of 30 issues, relevant for thyroid cancer survivors. Phase II: A provisional questionnaire of 30 thyroid cancer specific items was constructed. Seventeen existing items from the EORTC QOL Item Bank (comprising all items used in disease-specific modules of EORTC QLQ-C30) were used and 13 new items were created. 10DEVELOPMENT OF THYCA-QOL 163Phase III: Eight survivors reviewed the 30 items for clarity of wording and overlapping of items (debriefi ng questi ons), none of the items was excluded. The ti me for survivors' self completi on of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and provisional thyroid cancer module was 10 minutes for four survivors (50%), between 11 and 15 minutes for three survivors (37.5%) and > 15 minutes for one survivor. Table 1: Thyroid cancer pati ent characteristi cs (n=306) age at ti me diagnosis - Mean(SD) 46.3 (14.9) age at ti me of survey - Mean(SD) 56.4 (14.5) Years since diagnosis - Mean(SD) 25th QLQ-C30 and the provisional thyroid cancer specific list were completed by 306 survivors (Table 1).

The KMO value should be higher than 0.5 for a sati sfactory analysis to proceed 21. The KMO measure in this study was 0.84. Items with initi al communaliti es < 0.10 should be deleted for further analyses; none of the items were deleted based on this criterium. Based on Catt ell's scree plot and the Kaiser-Gutt man rule (which states that an eigenvalue (the amount of the total variance explained by that factor) must be greater than one) 7 factors were identi fi ed. Oblique rotati on, which assumes that the factors could be correlated with each other, simplifi ed their interpretati on by minimizing the items with high loadings on each factor. The seven factors cumulati vely accounted for 46% of a patt ern matrix with factor loadings and a structure matrix with correlati ons between items and components in a structure matrix (Table 3). A cut-off point of 0.35 for factor loadings was adopted, i.e. only those items scoring higher than this threshold were retained for further analyses. Six items were dropped based on this criterium and were treated as single items. The multi -trait scaling analysis showed that scaling assumpti ons were adequately met for four of the seven scales (Table 4). Cronbach's alpha coeffi cients range from 0.45-0.82, four of the seven scales scored higher than the preferred 0.70 level. Most scales of the thyroid specifi c questi onnaire were weakly correlated (Att achment). dIsCussIOn The THYCA-QoL has been methodologically developed using standard guidelines 15-17. It is designed for use in combinati on with the EORTC QLQ-C30 core instrument to assess all major dimensions of HRQoL in thyroid cancer survivors. The content of the questi onnaire has been determined by an extensive literature search, and by interviews with HCP and thyroid cancer survivors. The next step of development (phase IV) involves administrati on in a large internati onal group of thyroid cancer survivors to provide additi onal psychometric properti es of the questi onnaire. Content validity was addressed in phase I to enlarge confi dence that the instrument measures the aspects it was designed for. The content of our items is in agreement with the items of the non-validated Thyroid Cancer City of Hope Questi onnaire (TCCHQ) 10-12, however our questi onnaire covers the whole spectrum of health problems thyroid cancer survivors' are dealing with. The TCCHQ adds four thyroid cancer specifi c questi ons to a more general HRQoL questi onnaire, while our questi onnaire adds 24 relevant items to the EORTC QOL-C30. Also, CHAPTER 10 166scoring of the TCCHQ produces four general subscale scores (physical, psychological, social, spiritual), giving little specific information of how HRQoL is affected by thyroid cancer and its treatment. Because thyroid cancer survivors were extensively involved in the development of the questionnaire, our questions are more adapted to the terminology used by thyroid cancer survivors. Furthermore, the initial validation of the Thyroid Cancer Module of the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory is based on a small sample (n=60) of survivors who were not very symptomatic and were not representative for thyroid cancer survivors in general 13.

Pearson correlati ons between items and other scales.4. Correlati ons higher between items and other scales in comparison with hypothesized scaleCHAPTER 10 168Some limitations of the module development should be acknowledged. First, the results confirmed the hypothesized scale structure and reliability of 4 of 7 of the multi-item scales (voice, concentration, sympathetic and psychological problems), with reliability estimates between 0.72 and 0.82. In contrast, the reliability of the neuromuscular, throat/mouth and sensory problem scales was suboptimal (0.63, 0.62 and 0.45, respectively). The lower reliability observed for these scales may reflect the limited variability observed in the scores of the items comprising these scales. The lower reliability estimates will not necessarily negate the value of the scales, since survivors and HCP rated the items as relevant during phase I of the development process. Given that the found scales were in line with the expectations we had after reviewing the literature and a scale structure could improve clinical interpretability, we preferred to keep the scale structure rather than treating those items as single ones. Since we also used the same patient sample for the factor analysis as well as for the multi-trait analysis, our hypothesized scale structure must be further confirmed in another large (international) sample of diverse thyroid cancer survivors. Statistical techniques from the Item Response Theory (IRT) will be used for the final validation of the questionnaire and its hypothesized scales. Second, during phase III, the provisional module was tested in a group of 306 survivors of which almost half (45%) was diagnosed more than 10 years ago, creating a potential for bias (floor/ceiling effects). Results from the focus group indicated that the kind of problems thyroid cancer survivors are dealing with do not differ across the cancer continuum, only the severity of the problems changes over time. In the next phase of questionnaire development, the method of known-groups validation must be used to assess the ability of the THYCA-QoL to distinguish between subgroups of thyroid cancer survivors with regard to years since diagnosis, disease stage, treatment, and histology. The study sample of the next development phase should include more medullary thyroid cancer patients, since the number of those patients was too low in the provisional test phase to test the applicability of the questionnaire within this group. Also, as is recommended by the EORTC, the responsiveness to change and the cross-cultural validity need to be tested in the last phase of questionnaire development 15-17. The THYCA-QoL is the first thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire developed using standard methodologically proven guidelines. This questionnaire can be of value in the treatment and after care of thyroid cancer survivors. It will make medical doctors more aware of the potential HRQoL issues thyroid cancer survivors are dealing with. Also, this questionnaire helps doctors to provide survivors with adequate information on HRQoL and thereby improve survivors' experiences of their illness. After the phase IV validation is completed, the questionnaire can be used in future trials of new and existing treatments for thyroid cancer survivors. It may also be of value in the longitudinal follow-up of survivors in order to find survivors who are most vulnerable for health problems and to arrange additional help for those who need it. 10DEVELOPMENT OF THYCA-QOL 169Table moderate and >0.60 = high*p<0.05; ** p<0.01SC = Did the scar in your neck bothered you; CH = Have you felt chilly; THF = Did you have ti ngling hands and/or feet; GW = Have you gained weight ; HA = Did you have headaches ; SXI = To what extent were you interested in sexCHAPTER 10 170referenCes 1.

Therefore, the first aim of this study was to assess (thyroid cancer specific) HRQoL among long-term thyroid cancer survivors and to compare this with the HRQoL of an age- and sex-matched normative population. Secondly, our aim was to investigate which clinical and socio-demographic characteristics and thyroid cancer specific problems were associated with HRQoL. material and methods: All patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1990-2008, as registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received a survey on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) and disease-specific symptoms (THYCA-QoL). The scores were compared with age-and-sex-matched cancer free controls (n=800). A series of multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the independent associations between clinical, socio-demographic and thyroid cancer specific factors with HRQoL. results: A total of 306 patients (86%) responded to the invitation. Thyroid cancer survivors had significantly lower scores on physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning (p<0.001) compared to the normative population after adjusting for comorbidities. Sympathetic problems (feeling chilly (52%), hot flushes (cramp legs (43%) and pain joints/muscles (64%)) and abrupt attacks of fatigue (50%) were the most often reported thyroid cancer specific complaints.Thyroid cancer specific neuromuscular, concentration, sympathetic and psychological problems explained 41-58% of the variance in HRQoL. Clinical and socio-demographic factors explained a small part of the variance in (thyroid cancer specific) HRQoL (1-27%). Conclusion: Thyroid cancer survivors experience symptoms and deteriorated HRQoL long after diagnosis. Thyroid cancer specific neuromuscular, sympathetic, concentration and psychological symptoms are stronger associated with HRQoL than clinical and socio-demographic factors alone. Awareness of these specific determinants of HRQoL could help health care practitioners to provide better supportive care.11QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 175InTrOduCTIOn In the Netherlands, the incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) is 3.1 cases per 100.000 people per year. Each year 570 pati ents are diagnosed with TC 1. Worldwide incidence rates are rising 2. The incidence is 2.5 ti mes higher in women than in men. The papillary and follicular type account for about 80-90% of all cases, and poorly diff erenti ated (medullary and anaplasti c) TCs for about 10-20%. As a result of the very good prognosis of papillary or follicular TC (exceeding >90% 5-year survival rates) the number of TC survivors is growing 3. Treatment of TC involves surgery, predominantly (near-)total thyroidectomy with or without lymphadenectomy, followed by radioiodine (iodine-131) therapy to ablate the remaining thyroid ti ssue. Depending on type and size of the tumour hemithyroidectomy could suffi ce. The removal of the whole thyroid gland is accompanied by a lifelong dependence on supplement therapy with thyroid hormone (levothyroxine), in the fi rst years with dosing regimes suppressing thyroid sti mulati ng hormone (TSH) producti on 4. Despite the effi cacy of these primary treatments and the high long-term survival rates, 15-35% of the pati ents develop a locoregional recurrence or distant metastases, even decades later 5. Therefore, intensive long-term periodical follow-up is necessary. Given the longevity of TC pati ents, possible impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the follow-up period are of considerable concern. There is a limited number of studies focusing on HRQoL among TC survivors that moreover show contradictory results 6. A few studies found a lower HRQoL for TC survivors compared with a reference group, whereas other studies found similar HRQoL levels 6. The main problem of previous studies is the lack of a valid, specifi c instrument to assess the HRQoL among TC survivors. Therefore, we recently developed a TC c HRQoL questi onnaire to unveil specifi c TC related complaints 7. Furthermore, most other studies were inconclusive because they had small sample sizes and focused on short-term TC survivors (<2 years aft er diagnosis) 6. Consequently litt le is known about long-term HRQoL in TC pati ents. Therefore, the primary objecti ve of our study was to assess general and TC specifi c HRQoL of long-term TC survivors and to compare this with an age- and sex-matched normati ve populati on. To be able to tailor supporti ve care to the individual needs of TC pati ents, it is important to obtain insight into the factors infl uencing HRQoL. Therefore our second aim was to investi gate which clinical and socio-demographic characteristi cs and TC specifi c problems were associated with HRQoL. CHAPTER 11 176meTHOds setting and population This study is a population-based survey among TC survivors registered within the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR) of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South (CCCS). The ECR compiles data of all individuals newly diagnosed with cancer in the southern part of the Netherlands, an area with 10 hospitals serving 2.3 million inhabitants 8. All individuals diagnosed with TC between 1990-2008 as registered in the ECR were eligible for participation (N=568) (Figure 1). We excluded patients who had cognitive impairment or were too ill at time of the study (N=31), had unverifiable addresses (N=90), or died prior to the start of the study (according to the ECR, hospital records, and the Central Bureau for Genealogy (N=6). One hospital declined to participate (N=86). The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Maxima Medical Centre Eindhoven. 568 patients diagnosed and registered with thyroid cancer between January 1990 and August 2008 (and still alive on Nov ember 1st 2010), diagnosed within the Eindhoven Cancer Registry -One general hospital declined to participate (86 patients) - Six patients deceased shortly before the study started - 90 addresses could not be verified. -31 patients were too ill or incompetent due to cognitive impairment or language barriers A questionnaire was sent to the remaining patients (N=355; 100%). 306 (86%) patients returned a compl eted questionnaire 49 (14%) patients did not complete the questionnaire, some had a known reason: -Actively refused -Did not confirm they had cancer figure 1: Flow-chart of the data collection process data collection Data collection was conducted in November 2010 within PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship). PROFILES is a registry for the study of the physical and psychosocial impact of cancer and its treatment from a dynamic, growing population-based cohort of both short and long-term cancer survivors. PROFILES contains a large web-based component and is linked directly to clinical data from the ECR. Survivors were informed about the survey via a letter from their (ex)-attending specialist. The letter explained that by completing the questionnaire (online or by pencil-and-paper), patients consented to participate and agreed to the linkage of the questionnaire data with their disease history in the ECR. Further details of the data 11QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 177collecti on method have been described previously 9. Data from the PROFILES registry will be available for non-commercial scienti fi c research, subject to study questi on, privacy and confi denti ality Socio-demographic and clinical characteristi cs Clinical informati on of the survivors was available from the ECR. The ECR routi nely collects data on tumour characteristi cs, including date of diagnosis, disease stage, primary treatment, and pati ent background characteristi cs including date of birth. Questi ons on marital status, educati onal level, and current occupati on were added to the questi onnaire. Comorbidity at the ti me of survey was categorized according to an adapted Self-administered Comorbidity Questi onnaire (SCQ) 10, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, long disease, diabetes, ulcer or stomach disease, kidney disease, anemia or other blood disease, depression, osteoarthriti s, back pain, rheumatoid arthriti s and a questi on on other medical problems. EORTC-QLQ-C30 HRQoL was measured by the European Organisati on for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality Questi onnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) (physical, role, cogniti ve, emoti onal and social), a global quality of life scale, 3 symptom scales (fati gue, pain, nausea and vomiti ng) and a number of single items assessing common symptoms (dyspnoea, loss of appeti te, sleep disturbance, consti pati on and diarrhea) and perceived fi nancial impact of the disease. The ti me frame of the questi ons is the previous week, and each item is scored on a 4 point response scale ranging from 1, 'not at all' to 4, 'very much,' with the excepti on of the global QoL scale, which is scored on a 7-point modifi ed linear analogue scale ranging from 1, 'very poor' to 7, 'excellent'. Aft er linear transformati on, all scales and single item measures range in score from 0-100. A higher score on the functi onal scales and global QoL means bett er functi oning and HRQoL, whereas a higher score on the symptom scales means more complaints. Thyroid cancer speci c HRQoL (THYCA-QoL) TC to assess side-eff ects due to TC or its treatment 7. We developed and validated the TC specifi c HRQoL questi onnaire according to the methods of the European Organisati on for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life group. The questi onnaire consists of 24 items, with a ti me frame of the previous week (except for the sexual interest item which is four weeks) and each item is scored on a 4 point response scale ranging from 1, 'not at all' to 4, 'very much'. The THYCA-QoL consists of seven symptom scales (neuromuscular, voice, CHAPTER 11 178concentration, sympathetic, throat/mouth, psychological and sensory problems) and six single items (problems with scar, felt chilly, tingling hands/feet, gained weight, headaches, interest in sex). Scores were linear transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on this scale means more symptoms. normative population Normative population data was obtained from CentERpanel, an online household panel that is representative of the Dutch population. The process of the annual data collection, which started in 2009 by our study group, is described elsewhere 12. The data wave in 2009 included assessment of HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30). From the 1731 members 18 years who responded (78%), an age-and-sex-matched normative cancer-free sample (n=800) was selected for this study to reflect the age and sex distribution of the TC sample. Socio-demographic data were also collected for this group. statistical analyses Differences in clinical and socio-demographic characteristics between respondents, non- respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses and between TC patients and the normative population were compared using chi-square statistics for categorical variables and t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. ANCOVA was used to compare the mean scores on the individual EORTC QLQ-C30 scales between TC survivors and the normative population, controlled for the number of comorbidities. In addition, clinical meaningfulness of the differences was determined according to the guidelines of the EORTC Quality of Life Group 13. Differences in (TC specific) HRQoL between subgroups of survivors (<5 years; 5-10 years; > 10 years since diagnosis) were analyzed using ANOVA. A series of multiple linear regression analyses (enter method) were conducted to investigate the independent associations between clinical (disease stage, primary treatment, comorbidity) and socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, partner, educational level) with subscale scores of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and THYCA-QoL. Also, independent associations of the TC specific problems with the subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were analyzed with multiple linear regression analyses and were adjusted for clinical and socio-demographic variables (determined a priori).All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.11QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 179resulTs Pati ent and tumour characteristi cs Three hundred and pati ents returned a completed questi onnaire (response 86%). between respondents, non-respondents and ents with unverifi able addresses indicated that pati ents with unverifi able addresses were younger compared to non-respondents and respondents. No diff erences between groups were seen regarding sex, type of TC, stage of the disease or primary treatment.The mean age at diagnosis was 46 (SD=15) years (Table 1). Average ti me since diagnoses was 9.6 (SD= 5.5) years. More than half of the pati ents were diagnosed with stage I disease (57%). Surgery (99%) was followed by iodine-131 ablati on therapy in 69% and by radiotherapy in 3% of the cases. More than three quarters (78%) of the pati ents had one or more comorbid conditi ons. The most common comorbiditi es were backache (36%), high blood (12%). TC pati more oft en the presence of comorbid conditi ons and more oft en had a lower educati onal level compared to the normati ve populati on (Table 1). No diff erences between groups were seen in age, sex, partnership and occupati on. HrQol of TC survivors compared with normati ve populati on HRQoL of TC survivors as measured by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 was compared with an age- and-sex-matched normati ve sample from the general Dutch populati on (Figure 2a/2b). The survivors had signifi cantly lower scores on physical (83 vs. 89), role (82 vs. 88), emoti onal (83 vs. 88), cogniti ve (82 vs. 92) and social functi oning (85 vs. 93; all p<0.001) compared to the ve populati on er adjusti ng for comorbiditi es.

TC specifi c neuromuscular, concentrati on, sympatheti c and psychological problems were most strongly associated with worse physical and psychosocial functi oning. Primary treatment was not associated with HRQoL, which is in agreement with an earlier study that found no diff erences in HRQoL scores between thyroidectomy and hemithyroidectomy respecti vely A recent study showed that those pati ents submitt ed to higher doses of radioacti ve iodine are at risk for poor HRQoL 15. For part of the pati ents there may be overtreatment, since low risk pati ents are unlikely to benefi t from radioacti ve iodine therapy aft er initi al surgery 16. Unfortunately, no data on doses of radioacti ve iodine were available in the present study. Furthermore, the recent use of recombinant human thyroid sti mulati ng hormone (rhTSH) as alternati ve for thyroid hormone withdrawal preserved HRQoL during radioacti ve iodine ablati on 6. Disease stage and ti me since diagnosis were not related to HRQoL, although high disease stage and short ti me since diagnosis were related to more TC specifi c voice and throat/mouth problems, indicati ng the severity of surgery. Our results show that TC specifi c problems related to thyroid dysregulati on (neuromuscular, concentrati on, sympatheti c, psychological and sensory problems) were most strongly associated with HRQoL. Although TC specifi c symptoms diminish over ti me, they remain present long aft er initi al treatment. The high doses of replacement therapy (TSH < 0.1 mU/L) in the fi rst years of follow-up, for pati ents who underwent ablati on therapy or had high risk of recurrence, and the subsequent TSH suppression may cause symptoms of subclinical hyperthyroidism. Aft er the fi rst years the doses of replacement therapy will be lowered for low risk survivors (TSH level around median (1 mU/L)), however the lower doses might not be the opti mal (pre-operati ve) level for the specifi c pati ent and in that case the symptoms are a result of the supplemental thyroid hormone treatment 17. Furthermore, long-term exposure to excess thyroid hormone CHAPTER 11 186can lead to (irreversible) changes of the autonomous nervous system, which could not be reversed by restoration to euthyroidism 18. These changes possibly influence the well-being of a patient and might be an explanation for the symptoms patients experience even long-term after diagnosis. Having one or more comorbidities was associated with worse functioning and more (TC specific) symptoms. Comorbid conditions could affect the presentation and recognition of symptoms and result in worse HRQoL on their own. Since 78% of the survivors reported one or more comorbidities, it is unclear whether comorbidity is associated with lower HRQoL or whether it is the disease itself, or their collaborative effect that negatively impacts HRQoL. Since the prevalence of comorbidities in the normative population (natural aging effects) was significantly lower compared to TC survivors, this might indicate that part of the comorbid diseases developed after primary treatment for TC and their development might be related to the treatment procedures 15. Studies suggest that subclinical hyperthyroidism (due to suppressive hormone therapy) has potential harmful effects on bone metabolism and the cardiovascular system 19 and is even associated with increased mortality due to cardiovascular diseases 20. More research is needed into the type, severity and impact of comorbid conditions in TC survivors, the development over time and the associations with treatments 21. Our finding that partnered patients and patients with a higher educational level had higher HRQoL scores are in line with previous research 22, 23. Partnered patients experience more social support 23 and higher educated patients possibly receive more information by asking more questions, are more satisfied, choose the best doctor for their feeling and have a better understanding of the disease 22, that might lead to lower levels of anxiety and depression and better coping strategies. The strengths of our population-based study are the high response rate, the inclusion of long-term TC survivors (2-20 years after diagnosis), the large sample size, the availability of normative data of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the use of a TC specific HRQoL questionnaire. However, the present study has the following limitations. First, detailed follow-up treatment data was lacking because the cancer registry registers only the primary treatment procedure. Secondly, patients with unverifiable addresses were younger and more often had stage I papillary tumour compared to the respondents. Therefore our findings cannot be generalized to this younger group of patients with papillary tumours. Furthermore, people from the normative population more often had a higher educational level compared to the TC survivors, which could have influenced our results. The fourth limitation was the cross-sectional study design which limits the determination of causal associations. 11QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 187Assessment of more specifi c biochemical (TSH levels and serum free T4, treatment (levothyroxine dose, extent surgery, additi onal treatments) in combinati on with the assessment of THYCA-QoL over ti me is needed to draw defi niti ve conclusions about the exact mechanisms leading to a decreased HRQoL among long-term TC survivors. As a consequence of the good prognosis for diff erenti ated TCs, HCP that TC is not a serious problem 24. This atti tude trivializes the importance of the disease and causes pati ents to feel dismissed as not having a serious disease 25. Since survivors report decreased HRQoL and several TC specifi c symptoms long-term aft er diagnosis, there is a need for multi disciplinary aft ercare. The fi rst step for multi disciplinary aft ercare will be recogniti on, recording and acknowledgment of specifi c long-term health problems of pati ents with TC by HCPs. Our questi onnaire (THYCA-QoL) can be of value in the treatment and aft er care of TC survivors. It will make HCPs more aware of the potenti al HRQoL issues TC survivors are dealing with. HCPs can monitor changes in HRQoL (and its determinants) over ti me and provide conti nuous support for pati ents with TC during follow-up surveillance. In additi on, could also help to improve HRQoL among pati ents with TC by showing them how to manage uncomfortable symptoms and by referring them for further services when necessary (for example physical acti vity programs or support groups). In conclusion, TC survivors have a worse HRQoL compared to the normati populati on. TC specifi c neuromuscular, sympatheti c, concentrati on and psychological problems last up long-term aft er diagnosis and are more strongly associated with HRQoL than socio-demographic and clinical factors alone. Awareness of these specifi c determinants of HRQoL could help health care practi ti oners to provide bett er supporti ve care.CHAPTER 11 188referenCes 1.

Secondly, our aim was to investigate which demographic, clinical, and thyroid cancer specific characteristics were associated with fatigue. methods: All patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1990-2008, as registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry, received a cross-sectional survey on fatigue (FAS) and disease-specific symptoms (THYCA-QoL). The fatigue scores were compared with those of an age- and sex-matched normative population (n=530). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate the independent associations between clinical and demographic variables and (thyroid cancer specific) HRQoL. results: Eighty-six percent (n=306) responded. Short-term survivors and long-term survivors (< 6.7) had statistically significant higher scores on fatigue compared to the normative population (18.7 \u00b1 5.9; p<0.001). Anxiety 95% CI: 1.22-1.68) were associated with fatigue, as was also the case for thyroid cancer specific neuromuscular (OR: Conclusion: Short-term and long-term thyroid cancer survivors report higher levels of fatigue compared to an age- and sex-matched normative population. Both thyroid cancer specific and mental health problems were strongly associated with fatigue. Future research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of fatigue among thyroid cancer survivors and identify possible treatment options.12FATIGUE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 193InTrOduCTIOn Worldwide, the incidence of thyroid cancer is rising 1. As a result of the very good prognosis of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (exceeding >90% 5-year survival) the number of thyroid cancer survivors is rising 2, 3. Treatment of thyroid cancer involves surgery, predominantly (near-)total thyroidectomy, followed by radioiodine (131-I) therapy to ablate the remaining thyroid ti ssue. Depending on type and size of the tumour hemithyroidectomy could suffi ce. The removal of the thyroid gland is accompanied by a lifelong dependence on supplement therapy with levothyroxine, in the fi rst 2 years with dosing regimens suppressing thyroid sti mulati ng hormone (TSH) producti 4, 5, causing subclinical hyperthyroidism. Despite the effi cacy of these primary treatments and the high long-term survival rates, the disease can recur even decades later. Therefore, long-term follow-up is necessary. Given the longevity of thyroid cancer pati ents, the possible long-term eff ects of cancer and its treatment on pati ents' well-being are of increasing importance. Fati gue is a common problem among diff erent groups of cancer survivors, with prevalence rates ranging between 17% and 90% 6-8. High levels of fati gue are associated with low health- related quality of life 9 and high levels of emoti onal distress 10. Research focusing on the levels of fati gue among thyroid cancer survivors is lacking. Nevertheless, fati gue is a frequently reported complaint among pati ents with (subclinical) hyperthyroidism 11. Since short-term thyroid cancer survivors receive suppressing doses of levothyroxine, causing subclinical hyperthyroidism, it can be expected that these survivors experience higher levels of fati gue compared to long-term thyroid cancer survivors who have returned to an euthyroid state. The primary objecti ve of our study was to obtain insight into the prevalence of fati gue among short-term and long-term thyroid cancer survivors, by comparing a sample of thyroid cancer survivors with an age- and sex-matched normati ve populati on. Secondly, our objecti ve was to investi gate which demographic and clinical characteristi cs and which thyroid cancer-specifi c and mental health problems were associated with fati gue in thyroid cancer survivors. Our hypotheses were 1) short-term thyroid cancer survivors report higher levels of fati gue compared to long-term survivors and the normati ve populati on; 2) long-term survivors 'return' to normal levels of fati gue and therefore report similar fati gue levels compared to the normati ve populati on; 3) clinical and psychological variables are signifi cantly associated with fati gue.CHAPTER 12 194meTHOds setting and population This study is a population-based survey among thyroid cancer survivors registered within the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR) of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South (CCCS). The ECR compiles data of all individuals newly diagnosed with cancer in the southern part of the Netherlands, an area with 10 hospitals serving 2.3 million inhabitants 12. All individuals diagnosed with thyroid cancer between 1990 and 2008 as registered in the ECR were eligible for participation (N=568). We excluded patients who had cognitive impairment or were too ill at time of the study (medical records and advice attending specialist N=31), had unverifiable addresses (N=90), or died prior to the start of the study (according to the ECR, the Central Bureau for Genealogy which collects information on all deceased Dutch citizens via the civil municipal registries, and hospital records; N=6). One hospital declined to participate (N=86). Questionnaires were send to the remaining 355 patients. This study was approved by the certified Medical Ethics Committee of the Maxima Medical Centre in Eindhoven. data collection Data collection started in November 2010 and was done within PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship) 13. PROFILES is a registry for the study of the physical and psychosocial impact of cancer and its treatment from a dynamic, growing population-based cohort of both short and long-term cancer survivors. PROFILES contains a large web-based component and is linked directly to clinical data from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry (ECR). Details of the PROFILES data collection method have been previously described 13. In summary, survivors were informed of the study via a letter from their (ex-)attending specialist. The letter included a link to a secure website, a login name, and a password, so that interested patients could provide informed consent and complete questionnaires online. If the patient did not have access to internet, or preferred written rather than digital communication, (s)he could return our postcard by mail after which (s)he received our paper-and-pencil version of the informed consent form and questionnaire. Data from the PROFILES registry is available for non-commercial scientific research, subject to study question, privacy and confidentiality restrictions, and registration (www.profilesregistry.nl). study measures Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics Survivors' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at time of cancer diagnosis were available from the ECR. The ECR routinely collects data on tumour characteristics, including date of diagnosis, tumour grade and stage according to the Tumour-Node-Metastasis clinical 12FATIGUE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 195classifi cati on 14, treatment, and pati ent background characteristi cs including date of birth and comorbidity at the ti me of diagnosis. Self-reported comorbidity at the ti me of survey was categorized according to the adapted Self-administered Comorbidity Questi onnaire (SCQ) medicati on use for each comorbid conditi on. Questi ons on marital status, educati onal level, and current occupati on were added to the questi onnaire. Mental health Mental health was assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), with 7 items each assessing anxiety and depression. 16 Clinical level of anxiety or depressive symptoms was indicated with a score of 8 on each subscale.16, 17 Thyroid-speci c HRQoL Thyroid cancer specifi c HRQoL was measured by the THYCA-QoL which was developed to assess side-eff ects due to thyroid cancer or its treatment. 18The questi onnaire consists of 24 items, with a ti me frame of the previous week, except for the sexual interest item which is four weeks. Each item is scored on a 4 point response scale ranging from 1, 'not at all' to 4, 'very much'. The THYCA-QoL consists seven scales (neuromuscular, voice, concentrati on, sympatheti c, throat/mouth, psychological and sensory problems) and six single items. Scores were linear transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on this scale means more complaints. Fati gue Fati gue was assessed with the Fati gue Assessment Scale (FAS), a questi onnaire consisti ng physical fati gue and fi ve questi ons for mental fati gue. The response scale is a 5-point scale (1 never to 5 always) and scores can range from 10 to 50. The psychometric properti es are good 19 20 and the questi onnaire has been used with cancer pati ents before 21. normati ve populati on Normati ve populati on data was obtained from CentERpanel, an online household panel that is representati ve of the Dutch populati on. The process of the annual data collecti on, which started in 2009 by our study group, is described elsewhere 22. The most recent data wave in 2011 also included an assessment of fati gue with the FAS. From the 2040 (82%) members of 18 years and older, an age- and sex-matched normati ve sample (n=530) was selected for this study to refl ect the age and sex distributi on of the thyroid cancer sample. Sociodemographic data such as marital status, and comorbidity with the SCQ were also collected for this group. CHAPTER 12 196statistical analyses Demographic and clinical data of respondents, non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses were compared using chi-square statistics for categorical variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was applied when normality and homogeneity assumptions of continuous variables were violated.ANOVA was furthermore used to compare the mean scores of the thyroid cancer sample (stratified by years since diagnosis: short-term >15 years) on the FAS items and total score with those of the Dutch normative population. Logistic regression models were conducted to identify associations of demographic and clinical variables, mental health and thyroid cancer specific problems with fatigue. The models were composed as follows: 1) demographics; 2) demographics + clinical variables; 3) demographics + clinical variables + mental health; 4) demographics + clinical variables + thyroid specific HRQoL. The total FAS score was divided into two groups, 10 to 21 (not fatigued), 22-50 (fatigued) as previously done 23. Clinically meaningful differences were determined with Norman's 'rule of thumb', whereby a difference of 0.5 SD indicates a threshold of discriminant change in scores of a chronic illness 24. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. resul Ts Patient and tumour characteristics Three hundred and six patients returned a completed questionnaire (response 86%). A comparison of respondents, non-respondents and patients with unverifiable addresses indicated that patients with unverifiable addresses were younger compared to non-respondents and respondents (mean 52, 56 and 54 years respectively) 25. No differences between groups were seen regarding sex, type of thyroid cancer, stage of the disease or primary treatment. The mean age at time of the survey was 56 (SD=15) years. Average time since diagnoses was 9.6 (SD= 5.5) years. More than half of the patients were diagnosed with stage I disease (57%). Surgery (99%) was followed by iodine-131 ablation therapy in 69% and by radiotherapy in 3% of the cases. More than three quarters (78%) of the patients had one or more comorbid conditions. 12FATIGUE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 197Table 1: Clinical and socio-demographic characteristi cs of thyroid cancer survivors strati fi ed by ti me since diagnosis and the normati ve populati on (n (%)) short-term survivors <5 years (n=64)normati ve populati on (n=530)p-value Mean age at ti me of survey (\u00b1SD)55.6 \u00b1 16.0 54.5 \u00b1 14.8 56.8 \u00b1 13.1 59.6 \u00b1 13.4 55.8 \u00b1 14.6 0.26 Mean years since initi al diagnosis (\u00b1SD)3.3 \u00b1 0.9 7.3 \u00b1 1.5 -42 (66)17 (27) (8)n.a.0.15 Primary treatment Surgery alone Surgery + iodine-131 ablati on Surgery + radiotherapy Other (chemotherapy/radiotherapy treatment)19 (24)59 (68) 1 (1)1 (1)16 (25)43 (67) 5 3 (5)1 (2)n.a.<0.001 Comorbidity at ti 100% due to rounding off ; some variables do not add up to 100% due to missing data. a Educati on: Low (no or primary school); Medium (lower general educati on or n.a.: these were not assessed in the normati ve populati onCHAPTER 12 198Table 2: Mean scores (\u00b1 SD) of thyroid cancer specific problems and mental health problems stratified by time since diagnosis and the normative population short-term survivors <5 years (n=81)long-term survivors 5-10 survivors years (n=64)normative population 5.2 3.6 5.1 \u00b1 4.4 4.1 \u00b1 3.2 4.2 \u00b1 3.7 3.7 \u00b1 3.3 0.001 HADS depression 3.6 \u00b1 2.9 3.7 \u00b1 3.5 3.0 \u00b1 2.6 3.4 \u00b1 3.2 3.6 \u00b1 3.3 0.66 % above the 8 clinical cut-off 16, 17 HADS anxiety 19 (24) 20 (24) 8 (12) 8 (14) 64 (12) 0.004 HADS depression 11 (14) 13 (16) 5 (7) 7 (12) 7 (12) 0.60 n.a.: these items were not assessed in the normative population Comparisons on clinical and socio-demographic characteristics, thyroid cancer specific and mental heath problems of respondents stratified by years since diagnosis showed that short-term survivors were more likely to be diagnosed with a higher stage disease compared to long-term survivors (Table 1). Furthermore, survivors <5 years since diagnosis were more likely to report voice, sympathetic and throat/mouth problems compared to survivors >15 years since diagnosis and higher levels of anxiety compared to survivors 10 years since diagnosis (Table 2). There was a trend toward diminishing thyroid cancer specific problems over time.The normative population was more likely to be higher educated, reported less comorbidities and were less likely to have anxiety compared to short-term and long-term thyroid cancer survivors (Tables 1 and 2). fatigue of thyroid cancer survivors compared with a normative population In general, short-term survivors reported the highest levels of mean fatigue scores and the normative population, the lowest (Table 2). The normative population was significantly less likely than the survivors group to report being bothered by fatigue, getting tired quickly, not being able to do much, feeling exhausted physically and mentally, problems with starting things and thinking clearly, and no desire to do anything. Also, the FAS total score was significantly lower for the normative population 12FATIGUE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 199compared to the thyroid cancer survivors. No signifi cant diff erences were found between short- and long-term survivors.Clinically meaningful diff erences between the normati ve populati on and the short-term survivors were found for the items getti ng ti red very quickly, feeling physically exhausted, problems with thinking clearly and the FAS total score. Furthermore, a clinically meaningful diff erence was found between long-term survivors (5-15 years aft er diagnosis) and the normati ve populati on for the item getti ng ti red very quickly. Comparison between short- and long-term survivor groups showed no clinically meaningful diff erences in fati gue scores (Table 3). When strati fi ed by ti me since diagnosis and divided into three fati gue groups; not fati gued (as defi ned by a score of 10 to 21 on the FAS), fati gued (22 to 34), and very fati gued (35 to 50) as previously done 23, signifi cant diff erences were noted between all the survivors (Figure 1) and the normati ve populati on (p<0.001). Survivors were more oft en to normati ve populati on (25%). Furthermore long-term survivors >15 years aft er diagnoses reported less fati gue compared to the other three survivor groups, and survivors <10 years aft er diagnosis reported more oft en to be very fati gued compared to survivors 10 years aft er populationVery fatigued Fatigued Not fatigued figure 1: Fati gue levels of thyroid cancer survivors compared to an age and sex-matched normati ve populati on % Thyroid cancer survivors strati fi ed by years since diagnosis (short-term: <5 years; long-term: 5 years), and who are fati gued.

Model 1 consisti ng of only demographic variables showed that lower educati on (odds rati (CI): was associated with a higher risk for fati gue (Table 4). With the inclusion of clinical variables in Model 2, educati on remained signifi cantly associated with fati gue, while partnership became signifi cant in this model, whereby absence of a partner was associated with more fati Model 3, anxiety cantly associated with fati gue. Following the inclusion of psychological factors, only comorbidity (OR: 2.39, 95%CI: 1.14-5.00, p=0.02) remained signifi cantly associated with fati gue, whereby more problems indicated higher levels of fati gue. All clinical variables were not signifi cantly associated with fati gue anymore, while age 0.97, were also cant, whereby an older age and higher educati onal level were associated with less fati gue. The single items of the thyroid cancer specifi c HRQoL questi onnaire (problems with scar, felt chilly, ti ngling hands and/or feet, headaches, gained weight) were not related to fati gue, except for sexual functi oning (OR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97-1.00, p=0.05), whereby less interest in sex was related to higher levels of fati gue. dIsCussIOn This large populati on-based study among survivors of thyroid cancer showed that fati gue remains a problem long-term aft er diagnosis. In general, regardless of ti me since diagnosis, thyroid cancer survivors reported stati sti cally signifi cant higher levels of fati gue when compared with an age- and sex-matched normati ve populati on, although clinically meaningful diff erences were only found between short-term survivors and the normati ve populati on. Levels of fati gue decreased with increasing ti me since diagnosis, but these diff erences were not signifi cant. Thyroid cancer specifi c (neuromuscular, concentrati on and psychological) and mental health problems were most strongly associated with fati gue.CHAPTER 12 202Table 4: Logistic models of factors associated with fatigue model 1 (demographics)model 2 (model 1 + clinical)model 3 (model 2 + mental health)model 4 (model 2 + thyroid specific symptoms) Or (95%CI) Or (95%CI) Or (95%CI) Or (95%CI) block 1 (demographic variables) Age at survey 0.99 (0.97-1.01) 0.99 (0.97-1.01) 0.98 1.38 (0.62-3.07) 1.00 (0.39-2.56) block 2 (clinical since diagnosis health) HADS anxiety 1.15 (1.03-1.28)* HADS depression 1.43 (1.22-1.68)** block 4 (thyroid cancer specific problems)Neuromuscular problems 1.03 (1.01-1.06)** Voice problems 1.01 (0.99-1.03) Concentration problems 1.03 (1.01-1.06)* Sympathetic problems 1.02 (0.99-1.04) Throat/mouth problems 1.00 (0.98-1.02) OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence interval.

A Dutch study among cured diff erenti ated thyroid cancer pati ents (median durati on of cure of 6.3 years) showed that a longer durati on of cure was correlated with bett er scores on general, mental and physical fati gue 28. Our results also show decreasing levels of fati gue with increasing years since diagnoses, however levels of fati gue of long-term survivors were higher compared to the normati ve populati on albeit not clinical relevant higher. The high doses of replacement therapy (TSH < 0.1 mU/L) in the fi rst years of follow-up, for pati ents who underwent ablati on therapy or had high risk of recurrence, and the subsequent TSH suppression, may cause symptoms of (subclinical) hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a reversible cause of fati gue 11. However, aft er the fi rst years, the doses of replacement therapy will be lowered for low risk survivors (TSH level around median (1 mU/L)) to restore euthyroidism and fati gue levels are therefore expected to decrease. This might explain the decrease in fati gue levels for long-term survivors compared to short-term survivors in our study. However, the long-term survivors sti ll had stati sti cally signifi cant higher fati gue levels compared to the normati ve populati on. This is in contrast with another Dutch study showing that thyroid cancer pati ents (n=24) under long-term subclinical hyperthyroidism (> 10 years) do not diff er in the levels of general, mental and physical fati gue compared to an age- and sex matched reference group 29. Our fi nding that thyroid cancer specifi c problems were associated with fati gue could indicate that the TSH level of around 1 mU/L, might not be the opti mal (pre-operati ve) level for the specifi c pati ent 30, and that the pati ent therefore does not feel well. Another explanati on of our fi ndings could be the presence of cancer-related fati gue (CRF). Fati gue levels of thyroid cancer survivors (43%) are comparable to those observed in other cancer survivor populati ons (17-90%) 6, 8, 31. According to the guidelines of the Nati onal Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), cancer-related fati gue is defi ned as a distressing, persistent, subjecti ve sense of physical, emoti onal, and/or cogniti ve ti redness or exhausti on related to cancer or its treatment that is not proporti onal to recent acti vity and interferes with usual functi oning 32. The underlying mechanisms involved in cancer-related fati gue are not well understood. Possible mechanisms include eff ects of cancer or its treatment on the central nervous system, muscle energy metabolism, sleep rhythms 33, mediators of infl ammati on and stress 34, immune acti vati on 35, and hormonal changes related to eff ects on the hypothalamic- pituitary axis 7. A Norwegian study showed that type or intensity of cancer treatment is unrelated to the level of cancer-related fati gue and more related to CHAPTER 12 204mental and somatic health problems 36. This finding is in line with the results of a Dutch study showing that levels of fatigue of thyroid cancer survivors (median duration of cure of 6.3 years) were not affected by initial tumour stage, total activity of radioiodine, tumour recurrence, and replacement therapy dose 28. In addition to this, our own results show no associations between clinical factors and fatigue (except for comorbidity), while thyroid cancer specific and mental health problems were most strongly associated with fatigue. Due to the high prevalence of fatigue and the profound effect that it can have on a patient's daily life, healthcare providers should be encouraged to inquire about the presence of this symptom 37. Both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments are available for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue. Currently, the best treatments are psychosocial interventions and exercise 37. Other non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions have less supporting evidence but still may be effective for some patients. Recently, an Internet-based education program based on NCCN guidelines showed good results to help patients manage cancer-related fatigue 38. Further research is needed to determine if an intervention for fatigue can reduce the high levels of fatigue among long-term thyroid cancer survivors. The present study has some limitations that should be mentioned. Although demographic and clinical information of non-respondents and survivors with unverified addresses were available for comparison, the health status of these survivors and its possible effects on current results remain unknown. In addition, the cross-sectional study design limits the determination of causal association between cancer-related factors and fatigue. A logistic regression model including mental health and thyroid cancer specific problems could not be performed, since there is a high correlation between the thyroid cancer specific psychological problem scale and the anxiety scale of the HADS. Therefore, it was not possible to determine which of the factors was most strongly associated with fatigue.Nevertheless, the present study provides an important contribution to the limited data available on fatigue of (long-term) thyroid cancer survivors. Since our study has a high response rate, extrapolating these results to the larger population of thyroid cancer survivors seems justified. Furthermore, we were able to compare fatigue levels with an age- and sex-matched normative sample. Future research with longitudinal designs should make use of an additional reference group, namely a group of patients with hyperthyroidism without thyroid cancer, to see whether it is the history of thyroid cancer accompanied by CRF or (subclinical) hyperthyroidism that causes the higher levels of fatigue compared to the normative population. In conclusion, about 40% of the thyroid cancer survivors report a high level of fatigue up till 20 years after diagnosis. Short-term and long-term thyroid cancer survivors report higher 12FATIGUE AMONG THYROID CANCER SURVIVORS 205levels of fati gue compared with the normati ve populati on. Thyroid cancer specifi c and mental health problems were highly associated with fati gue. Further research is needed to explore the underlying determinants of fati gue and the opti mal treatment opti ons for fati gue among thyroid cancer survivors.CHAPTER 12 206referenCes 1.

J Clin 13 summary and general discussion 13GENERAL DISCUSSION 211summarY Of resulTs In this chapter, the main fi ndings of this thesis are summarized, and put into a perspecti ve, whereby conceptual and methodological considerati ons and implicati ons for clinical practi ce and future research will be discussed. Part I: Informati on provision and pati ent reported outcomes The summary of part I will be guided by the conceptual model presented in the general introducti on (Figure 1). At the centre of the conceptual model is the perceived level of, and sati sfacti on with the received informati on. Throughout this thesis informati on provision was defi ned as all cancer-related informati on provided by the health care provider (HCP) in oral, writt en or any other form. Our fi rst aim was to assess the levels of received informati on and the sati sfacti on with this informati on among melanoma cancer survivors (Chapter 2). We used the internati onally validated EORTC QLQ-INFO25 to assess informati on provision 1. Melanoma survivors indicated that they received no informati on about diff erent aspects of their disease (9-37%), treatment (38%), and aft ercare (84-94%). More than half of the survivors (61%) were not or only a bit sati sfi ed with the amount of informati on received; a quarter of the pati ents indicated that they wanted to receive more informati on. Perceived level of, and satisfaction with, information received Patient (including personality) , tumour (including disease stage), treatment and hospital characteristics Health -related quality of life Anxiety and depression Chapters 2,3,6 Chapters 4,6,7 Illness perception Chapter s 5, 6 Background characteristics Information provision Outcomes figure 1: Conceptual model of relati ons between informati on provision and clinical, socio-demographic, psychological and pati ent reported outcomes. The left part of our conceptual model indicates that several background characteristi cs might be associated with the perceived level of and sati sfacti on with the received informati on. Among melanoma survivors the perceived receipt of informati on was associated with a higher disease stage, less years since diagnosis, a higher educati onal level and younger age, while sati sfacti on with informati on was associated with hospital of treatment, a higher educati onal level and use of the internet (Chapter 2).CHAPTER 13 212Besides the associations of clinical and socio-demographic factors with information provision, psychological factors like personality can also affect the perceived level of received information. Therefore the effects of the personality traits negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI) and their combined effect (Type D personality) on satisfaction with received information among a diverse group of 3080 cancer survivors were examined (Chapter 3). The perceived receipt of information, and the satisfaction with and usefulness of the received information were all lower for cancer survivors with a Type D personality compared to cancer survivors without a Type D personality or survivors with high scores for NA or SI only, also after controlling for clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. In the right part of our conceptual model it is hypothesized that several patient reported outcomes (PROs) could have a bidirectional relationship with the perceived level of, and satisfaction with the received information. In Chapter 4, the literature on the relationship between information provision and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and depression was systematically reviewed. This review showed that satisfied patients, patients with fulfilled information needs, and patients who experience less information barriers, in general have a better HRQoL and lower levels of anxiety and depression. Most of these findings are based on observational studies. Only one intervention study which aimed to improve information provision showed a positive relation with HRQoL, while the other seven intervention studies did not found an association. To investigate potential pathways between information provision and PROs as observed in the systematic review we hypothesized that illness perception might play an important role. It has been reported that illness perception is a major determinant of HRQoL 2 and is possibly associated with information provision, which was examined in Chapter 5. Results showed that among a diverse group of 3080 cancer survivors the perceived receipt of more disease-specific information was associated with more control and a better understanding of the illness, while the perceived receipt of more information about other services was associated with more negative consequences of the illness on the patients' life, longer perceived duration of illness, less treatment control, more symptoms attributable to the illness, less understanding of, and stronger emotional reaction to the illness. Satisfaction with the received information was associated with better illness perception on all subscales, except for personal control. In Chapter 6, we brought together the associations between information provision, illness perception and PROs among colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. It was shown that the perceived receipt of information was quite comparable between CRC patients with and without metastasis, except for information about treatments which was higher for patients with metastasized disease. Issues related to disease course and supportive care were mentioned most frequently as topics that CRC patients with metastatic disease wanted to 13GENERAL DISCUSSION 213receive more informati on about. Only 60% of with metastati c CRC were (quite) sati informati on. For pati ents with metastasized CRC the perceived receipt of more disease informati on and informati on about other services was associated with worse PROs (illness percepti on, HRQoL, anxiety and depression), while sati sfacti on with the received informati on was not associated with PROs.Most studies described in our systemati c review had a cross-secti onal design. Therefore, we prospecti vely examined the relati onship between informati on provision and HRQoL, anxiety and depression among lymphoma and multi ple myeloma (MM) (Chapter 7). We observed that the perceived receipt of informati on decreased slightly over ti me (mostly among short-term survivors), while HRQoL, anxiety and depression levels did not change. Sati sfacti on with the received informati on at baseline predicted HRQoL 2 years later, however aft er correcti on for baseline HRQoL the relati onship largely disappeared. Stability of sati sfacti on with the received informati on was associated with bett er mental HRQoL compared to fl on stable dissati sfacti on with the received informati on, also when adjusted for baseline HRQoL levels. Part II: Thyroid cancer survivors: an understudied group Long-term trends in incidence, mortality, and survival of thyroid cancer (TC) in The Netherlands between 1989 and 2009 were examined in Chapter 8. Since 1989 the incidence of TC increased signifi cantly in the Netherlands, while mortality from TC decreased. Five-year relati ve survival rates remained stable and appeared to be somewhat higher in the 2004-2009 period compared to earlier periods, except for advanced tumours of which the frequency decreased markedly. Due to the increasing incidence and good prognosis of diff erenti ated TC, the number of (long-term) TC survivors is rapidly increasing. The results of this study therefore support the need for research into the long-term HRQoL of TC survivors and possible physical and psychosocial problems survivors' are dealing with aft er the completi on of primary treatment.In Chapter 9, the available literature was systemati cally reviewed to provide a complete overview on the current knowledge about HRQoL of TC survivors. This review showed that TC survivors report severe impairments of HRQoL aft er treatment (surgery, radioacti ve iodine ablati on, supplemental thyroid hormone therapy) and follow-up procedures. Studies focusing on long-term TC survivors showed contradictory results. Therefore, strong conclusions on the HRQoL among long-term TC survivors could not be drawn from the studies included in our systemati c review. The main problem of included studies was the absence of a valid, TC specifi c instrument to assess HRQoL. Most studies used a general HRQoL questi onnaire, which cannot capture the specifi c complaints associated with TC and its treatment. This fi nding resulted in the need to develop a thyroid cancer specifi c HRQoL questi onnaire, which was described in Chapter 10. Potenti ally relevant issues were identi fi ed CHAPTER 13 214by our systematic literature review, a focus group meeting, and an issue list completed by six health care providers (HCP) and 18 TC survivors. Resultant issues were analyzed on importance and relevance by HCP and patients which resulted in a provisional list of 30 items formulated as questions according to the EORTC format. Pretesting by a large group of TC survivors led to a selection of 24 items with a good range of response. This resulted in the THYCA-QoL containing 24 items and seven conceptual scales (neuromuscular, voice, concentration, sympathetic, throat/mouth, psychological and sensory problems). The THYCA-QoL provided the possibility to assess TC specific HRQoL among long-term TC survivors. Using this questionnaire, the long-term HRQoL effects of TC and its various treatments was examined, by comparing a sample of TC survivors (2-20 years since diagnosis) with an age- and gender-matched normative population (Chapter 11). Our findings showed that TC survivors report lower levels of physical and psychosocial functioning, and more problems (fatigue, dyspnea, insomnia and financial) compared to an age- and gender matched normative population. Most differences were of small clinical importance. Clinical and socio-demographic factors explained only a small part of the variance in HRQoL, while TC specific neuromuscular, concentration, sympathetic and psychological problems explained a large part (41-58%) of the variance in HRQoL. Fatigue is a common problem among patients with (subclinical) hyperthyroidism 3, as is the case for TC survivors with suppressing doses of levothyroxine in the first years after surgery. Research focusing on the levels of fatigue among thyroid cancer survivors is lacking. Therefore, we examined the prevalence of fatigue among short-term and long-term TC survivors (Chapter 12). Our results showed that around 40% of the TC survivors report a high level of fatigue up till 20 years after diagnosis. Short-term and long-term TC survivors report higher levels of fatigue compared with the normative population, however differences were only clinically meaningful for short-term survivors compared with the normative population. TC specific (neuromuscular, concentration and psychological) and mental health (anxiety and depression) problems were highly associated with fatigue.13GENERAL DISCUSSION 215general dIsCussIOn With the ongoing improvements in early detecti on and treatment of cancer along with the ageing of the populati on, the number of cancer survivors is rapidly increasing in the Western world. Therefore, achieving and maintaining opti mal well-being must be an important objecti ve of current cancer treatment, cancer rehabilitati on and aft ercare. Adequate informati on provision is one of the most important factors in the supporti ve care for cancer survivors and is associated with positi ve pati ent reported outcomes (bett er HRQoL, lower levels anxiety and depression, positi ve illness percepti on). Although the knowledge about cancer survivorship has grown in the past decade, survivors of rare tumours, like thyroid cancer (TC), so far received litt le att enti on in the cancer survivorship literature. growing number of thyroid cancer survivors Since 1989 the incidence rates of TC increased signifi cantly in The Netherlands, while mortality from TC decreased. These trends caused a marked increase in the number of TC survivors (20-year prevalence of 2700 in 1990 vs. 5500 in 2010). There is an ongoing discussion in the literature about the questi on whether or not the observed increase in TC incidence is real or apparent. Since the beginning of the 1980's there is an increase in use of more precise diagnosti cs, like ultrasonography and fi ne needle aspirati on biopsies 4, 5, and bett er medical surveillance 6. An American study showed a signifi cant decrease in tumour size over ti me and concluded that the apparent increase in TC incidence was due to increased detecti on of subclinical disease 7. This fi nding is supported by the fi nding of a 36% incidence of occult papillary tumours in Finnish adults at autopsies 8. It might therefore be possible that the increased incidence of TC in the Netherlands is partly due to overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant cancer 9. Most pati ents with cytological indeterminate nodules are referred for diagnosti c thyroid surgery, but the majority prove to have benign disease 10 and for these pati ents surgery is unnecessary 11. The main problem of overdiagnosis is that pati ents cannot benefi t from \"unnecessary\" treatment, however this treatment can lead to morbiditi es and can aff ect the persons' well-being for the rest of his/her life 9. Furthermore, increased detecti on of small tumours can lead to an overesti mati on of treatment effi cacy and a subsequent rise in use of treatment 12 13. A recent study showed that implementati on of a gene-expression classifi er to identi fy a subpopulati on of pati ents with a low likelihood of cancer leads to a marked reducti on (74% to 7.6%) in the HCPs decision to operate on cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules 11 14. More clinical strategies should be developed to minimize overdiagnosis.The increase in incidence rates cannot be completely ascribed to improved detecti on. Real increases in incidences of TC have been associated with diff erent risk factors (radiati on exposure 15-17, low iodine intake 18 and overweight 19), although the exact eti ology of TC remains unclear and needs to be explored 20.CHAPTER 13 216Current state of information provision among cancer survivors As the number of cancer survivors is rapidly increasing, investigating the current state of information provision and the degree of satisfaction with received information is important. It reveals whether information provision is sufficient, or whether improvements are needed. Our studies among cancer survivors of different cancer types (melanoma, endometrial, colorectal, (non-)Hodgkin and multiple myeloma) indicate that survivors received quite a bit of information about their disease, medical tests and treatment 21, 22. However, a substantial percentage of the survivors stated that they were not or only a little informed about the cause of their disease and possible side effects of their treatment. Cancer survivors received the least information on topics related to aftercare, such as what to expect in their social and sexual life, where to go for additional help, rehabilitation, or psychological support, and how to cope with cancer at home, different care locations outside the hospital, or things to do to improve their health. Moreover, 15 - 28% of the survivors wanted to receive more information, and the most frequently mentioned topics were (psychosocial) aftercare, cause and course of the disease and late effects of treatment. Topics that survivors wanted to receive more information about changed over time, with information about disease stage, treatment options and side-effects of treatment most frequently mentioned in the diagnosis and treatment phase, while post-treatment, patients report a continued need for treatment related information and also information about rehabilitation was important 23. Survivors who were not satisfied with the received information, indicated on all information provision subscales that they received less information and found the information less helpful than satisfied survivors. Moreover, unsatisfied survivors indicated that they wanted to receive more additional information than satisfied survivors. However, a small group of unsatisfied survivors indicated that they wanted to receive less information than satisfied survivors. Although most patients prefer to be fully informed 23, a minority of patients do not want to receive all available information 24. Patient and clinical characteristics and perceived level of received information Several factors contribute to differences in the perceptions of the received information (left part conceptual model; Figure 1). Clinical factors associated with perceived levels of information Levels of perceived information differed between survivors with different types of cancer, possibly due to differences in intensity of treatment and follow-up procedures. Survivors with a higher stage disease and survivors who underwent more advanced treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) perceived to receive more information 21, 22. It is likely that HCPs provide more information to these patients, as the treatment is more complex and can have more serious acute and long-term effects than surgery alone. Furthermore, patients 13GENERAL DISCUSSION 217undergoing more advanced treatment oft en receive informati on from more than one HCP . In additi on, cancer survivors who were diagnosed and treated shortly before the start of our studies reported that they received more informati on compared to long-term survivors. Pati ents who are sti ll under supervision of a HCP might have a clearer picture of the informati on they received. The diminishing contacts of pati ents with their HCP aft er the completi on of treatment and follow-up could lead to less informati on exchange 25. It is also possible that recall bias infl uenced these fi ndings. Pati ents may forget informati on they received, because it is oft en complex and emoti onally charged 26. Except for melanoma survivors, cancer survivors with fewer comorbid conditi ons reported that they received more informati on and were more sati sfi ed with the informati on. One explanati on is that pati ents with more comorbid conditi ons have more specifi c informati on needs that are possibly not fulfi lled by the informati on provided to them. Moreover, the sati sfacti on and helpfulness of the received informati on and the amount of writt en informati on received varied between pati ents treated in diff erent hospitals in our area. This suggests that some hospitals and/or HCPs gave bett er informati on ets), which promotes informati on recall and understanding. Socio-demographic factors associated with perceived levels of informati on An associati on between younger age and more perceived informati on was observed, which is consistent with previous research 27. Studies have shown that older pati ents tend to ask fewer questi ons during their visit with their HCP , and might therefore receive less informati on 28, 29. Older pati ents appear to be less interested in detailed informati on, but have a preference for informati on about the most important aspects of their disease and treatment 29. The acquisiti on of detailed disease informati on might not be the main goal of older pati ents. They oft en leave the provision of details up to their HCP and therefore have a more passive role, leading to a doctor-centred interacti on 30. Older pati ents have been found to have a greater reliance on informati on provided by their HCP 23. Health care providers might also be prejudiced against older pati ents; some HCPs seem to provide older pati ents with less informati on 31. Finally, older pati ents may have more diffi culti es processing and remembering medical informati on they receive than younger pati ents 32. We did not fi nd a relati on between gender and levels of received informati on, while another study showed that women seek more informati on than men 23. Also, survivors with a high educati onal level indicated that they received more informati on than lower educated survivors. Previous studies have shown that higher educated pati ents want as much informati on on prognosis as possible 33, are more likely to seek informati on from a greater range of sources (like the internet) 23, obtain more informati on, and show more perceived uncertainty 34. For these reasons, higher educated survivors might ask their CHAPTER 13 218HCPs for more explanation when the provided information does not yet meet their needs 28. It is also possible that HCPs (who are higher educated themselves) are more prone to give more information to patients with a similar educational level. Higher educated patients may also be better able to understand and remember the information. In addition, survivors who have a partner indicated that they received more information about their disease. Previous research indicates that accompanied patients are likely to benefit from the extra information that their companions remember 35. Discussing the received information with their partner may help patients to better understand and remember the information they receive from their HCP . The presence of companions has been found to increase patient understanding, involvement in the consultation, and decision-making 36. Furthermore, another important issue not assessed in our studies, is the role of cross-cultural differences in information provision. Truth telling and honest disclosure of cancer information appears to remain controversial in some southern countries 37-39. Awareness of a cancer diagnosis or prognosis is associated with more anxiety and depression, and poorer physical, social and emotional HRQoL in those countries 40-42. Future studies should pay more attention to the cultural background of the survivor to get insight into differences in the perceived levels of received information and satisfaction. Personality and the perceived level of information received Cancer survivors with a Type D personality (combined effect of negative affectivity and social inhibition) perceived to receive less information. There exists a strong positive relation between positive affect and memory 43, while negative affect is associated with difficulties to access, obtain, and understand cancer information 44. Individuals scoring high on neuroticism, a trait closely related to negative affectivity, might have a preference for information that reassures them 45. Cancer related information might be judged as threatening by Type D cancer survivors and will probably be accompanied by the experience of more negative emotions. The experience of negative emotions requires energy and can distract attention and diminish concentration. The recall of received information could therefore be hindered. Also, individuals with a Type D personality tend to use a \"disengagement coping strategy\" which involves avoiding or denying threatening information, seeking distraction and distancing oneself from the stressor or related feelings 46, 47. Even if the HCP gives a large amount of information, it might be possible that the passive coping style leads to inadequate information processing, whereby the relevant information will not be picked up. Furthermore, previous studies show that one aspect of social inhibition is feeling insecure and less competent when communicating with others 48, 49. These feelings might result in more difficulties in communicating with the HCP and a lower willingness to ask questions during a consultation when information needs are not met. Type D cancer patients may 13GENERAL DISCUSSION 219benefi t from behavioural interventi ons that are aimed towards reducing maladapti ve coping strategies such as withdrawal 50. Such interventi ons should focus on the empowerment of Type D pati ents to increase their health control and to reduce negati ve emoti ons 51. Strategies targeti ng HCPs may focus on their facilitati ng behavior, since this has been associated with enhanced pati ent sati sfacti on in pati with their HCP 52. Informati on provision and pati ent reported outcomes Health-related quality of life in TC survivors In the past decade a growing number of studies have documented the high prevalence of short-term, long-term and late eff ects of cancer treatment. Up to now, most survivorship studies examining PROs have focused on survivors of common cancer types (e.g. breast, colorectal and prostate cancer). To date litt le is known about the long-term HRQoL among TC survivors. Our systemati c review showed that TC survivors report severe impairments of HRQoL aft er treatment (surgery, radioacti ve iodine ablati on, suppressive thyroid hormone therapy). However, the benefi ts of radioacti ve iodine ablati on and suppressive hormone therapy are of uncertain benefi t for low-risk TC survivors 53-57.These treatments have even been associated with harmful eff ects on bone metabolism and the cardiovascular system 58. Therefore, it is important to consider a more conservati ve therapeuti c approach for these pati ents 59. The results of our long-term survivorship study show that thyroid cancer survivors experience deteriorated HRQoL compared to a normati ve populati on and TC specifi c problems even 20 years aft er primary diagnosis. In this study we did not fi nd a direct relati on between primary treatment type and long-term HRQoL, although it seems that problems related to surgery (voice, throat/mouth and problems with scar) were more oft en present in the fi rst years aft er diagnosis. The decreased HRQoL and high levels of fati gue in the fi rst years aft er diagnosis could be caused by the high suppressing doses of levothyroxine, resulti ng in subclinical hyperthyroidism. When doses of levothyroxine are then lowered to restore euthyroidism, symptoms related to thyroid dysregulati on were expected to disappear. However, the symptoms remained present. Therefore, a possible explanati on for the decreased HRQoL might be that these lower doses of levothyroxine aft er the high suppressing doses might not be the opti mal (pre-operati ve) level for the specifi c pati ent and in that case the symptoms are a result of the supplemental thyroid hormone treatment 60. Furthermore, long-term exposure to excess thyroid hormone can lead to (irreversible) changes of the autonomous nervous system, which could not be reversed by restorati on of euthyroidism 61. These changes possibly infl uence the well-being of a pati ent and might also be an explanati on for the symptoms pati ents experience even long-term aft er diagnosis. More research is needed into the exact mechanisms leading to the decreased HRQoL among TC survivors. Despite the experience of these symptoms, pati ents are someti mes advised by HCPs that CHAPTER 13 220TC is not a serious problem, partly as a consequence of the good prognosis for papillary and follicular TC 62. This attitude trivializes the importance of the disease and causes patients to feel dismissed as not having a serious disease 63. The THYCA-QoL questionnaire can be of value in the evaluation of treatment effects and aftercare of TC survivors. It can make HCPs more aware of the potential HRQoL issues TC survivors are dealing with. HCPs can then provide TC survivors with information on (long-term) effects of TC and its treatment and care options and thereby possibly improve survivors' HRQoL. Patient reported outcomes and information provision: chicken or egg causality dilemma Results of this thesis show positive associations between information provision and patient reported outcomes (right part conceptual model; Figure 1). Especially satisfaction with the received information was strongly associated with better HRQoL, less anxiety, less depression and more positive illness perceptions. Nevertheless these results cannot be interpreted univocally, since the causal direction of the associations is not clear. On the one hand, adequate information provision can lead to improved PROs. The pathways through which information can influence PROs might be direct or indirect. A lack of information or too much information can directly lead to anxiety, depression or a decreased HRQoL. The positive influence of information on PROs appears to be mostly indirect. Recent studies identified several indirect pathways through which information can lead to better PROs including increased access to care, greater patient knowledge and (shared) understanding, higher quality medical decisions, enhanced therapeutic collaboration, strengthened social support, patient empowerment, better management of emotions and coping, better sense of control, health competence and better symptom management and treatment adherence 64-67. With respect to the mental health component, information exchange can work therapeutic in that a HCP can express empathy which may help the patient to experience more positive emotions (hope, optimism and self-worth) instead of negative emotions (fear and anxiety) 68, 69 70. An example for the physical health component could be that information provision about the beneficial effects of physical activity on treatment-related symptoms (e.g. fatigue) may help to motivate survivors to increase their physical activity levels and consequently diminish their symptoms. On the other hand, it is possible that patients with higher levels of HRQoL and lower levels of distress naturally report higher levels of satisfaction with the received information, independent of the information they actually received. Furthermore, high levels of anxiety or depression and low HRQoL can inhibit information processing; patients with a poorer mental health may have more difficulty to understand the information even when the information is of high quality. A special group in this context are patients with advanced disease, who 13GENERAL DISCUSSION 221might indicate to receive more informati on, but sti ll have worse HRQoL and higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms as a consequence of their disease severity. For this group the message of informati on (with regard to prognosis) and the way the informati on is provided (empathy) are probably more important than the degree to which the informati on meets the informati onal needs 71. However, it is diffi cult for HCPs to remain opti misti c while being honest about a poor prognosis 72. methodological considerati ons The studies presented in this thesis are subject to various strengths and limitati ons. Several methodological issues have been highlighted in the previous chapters. In this secti on, some general limitati ons of the studies will be considered. study design The studies included in this thesis, except for chapter 7, had a cross-secti onal design. This limits the potenti al for drawing causal inferences. The causati on may be reversed (e.g. chicken or the egg dilemma for informati on provision and PROs). Prospecti ve studies can give more insight into changes over ti me, but are sti ll limited in establishing causality. In additi on, other characteristi cs may confound the relati onship between the dependent and independent variables. Although we adjusted our analyses for potenti al confounders, some candidate confounders were lacking (e.g. cultural background, health literacy levels and biochemical data) and could not be taken into account. measurements Clinical and physiological data and reference groups Despite the rather clinical focus of the populati on-based Netherlands Cancer Registry, several important parameters were not registered for TC pati ents (e.g. extent of surgery, levothyroxine dose, applied treatments during follow-up, tumour size). Furthermore, informati on on biochemical parameters (TSH levels and serum free T3 and T4) was lacking. Long-term assessment of biochemical and treatment parameters in combinati on with the assessment of TC specifi c HRQoL (THYCA-QoL) could give more insight into the mechanisms accounti ng for the decreased HRQoL among TC survivors. In additi on, comparison of a group of TC survivors with a group of pati ents with subclinical hyperthyroidism without cancer could be helpful to test whether or not the symptoms survivors experience are TC specifi c or related to thyroid dysfuncti oning in general. Informati on of survivors parti cipati ng in our studies can be described as long-term (>5 years aft er diagnosis) cancer survivors, who are oft en out of the acute phase of medical treatment CHAPTER 13 222and decision making. The EORTC QLQ-INFO25 is not specifically designed for assessment of information provision among this group. The questionnaire has been validated among newly diagnosed cancer patients receiving primary treatment and patients with recurrent/metastatic disease starting a second line of treatment 1. The mean time since diagnosis was 3 - 5 years in our studies, which could influence the recall effect of information received. Although the Cronbach's alpha of the scales were good in all of our studies, further research is needed to test the psychometric properties of this questionnaire among long-term cancer survivors. Furthermore, the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 only assesses the information patients indicated to have received (self-report). Notwithstanding the fact that the perception of the patient is most important, comparing data on actual information provision with the subjective data from our questionnaire would be of additional value. Patients often forget a substantial amount of the information given because it is complex and emotionally charged. In addition, the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 does not measure who provided the information, and when the information was provided exactly. It would be interesting to assess which aspects of information patients receive from their different HCPs (i.e. radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, oncology nurse, general practitioner), at what point during their disease trajectory they receive the information, and whether these aspects are associated with usefulness of and satisfaction with the information received. Finally, since the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 is not a measure of clinical outcomes, it was not possible to determine clinical meaningful differences. Differences in the perceived receipt of information might be statistical significant yet considered as unimportant. In this respect, it would be interesting to study how patients define an important improvement/worsening of information provision. With this information HCPs could better interpret the importance of our research findings. future directions Cancer survivorship studies show that many survivors, including survivors of rare tumours, like thyroid cancer, face continuing physical and psychosocial problems long after completion of primary treatment. Achieving and maintaining optimal well-being is an important objective of current cancer treatment and of cancer rehabilitation and aftercare. One of the most important aspects of cancer care is the provision of adequate information. Survivors who are satisfied with the received information report better PROs compared to survivors who are dissatisfied. However, several areas of information provision were experienced as insufficient. Therefore, future research should focus on strategies to improve the information provision. In this section we will discuss some strategies to improve information provision, for cancer survivors in general and TC survivors specifically.13GENERAL DISCUSSION 223unraveling the informati on needs of cancer survivors The percepti ons of HCPs about pati ents' needs should become in agreement with the actual needs of the pati ent. The best way to unravel the informati on needs of a pati ent is to consult the pati ent, but this is rarely done and research is limited 73. Also, a neglected aspect of a consultati on is checking the understanding of the pati ent 74. It is necessary to regularly check what the pati ent has understood 75 and whether the informati on was helpful 76. When necessary, the HCP must repeat the informati on several ti mes, both between and within consultati ons 77. Cancer pati ents may not always be able to retain and process informati on because they may be emoti onally overwhelmed 78 79, impaired in their cogniti ve capability, or deny their illness as a coping strategy to retain hope 80, 81. Therefore, the ti ming and the way informati on is provided are important factors to take into account. Furthermore, awareness of the background characteristi cs associated with the perceived receipt of informati on could help HCPs to provide more pati ent-centered informati on. decision aid for TC to receive confl icti ng recommendati ons on radioacti ve iodine their HCP 63. Informati on on rati onale, risks and uncertainti es relati ng to this treatment are perceived as insuffi cient. Most of the ti mes no treatment choice was off ered and pati ents felt the treatment was imposed on them. Since there is uncertainty about the eff ecti veness of radioacti ve iodine treatment and TSH suppression low-risk TC pati ents, informed decision making and pati ent involvement should be improved. A decision aid intended to be used as an adjunct to individualized HCP counseling proved to increase medical knowledge and informed medical decision making in pati ents with early-stage papillary TC who were considering adjuvant radioiodine treatment 82, 83 84. Other studies showed that the use of decision aids can enhance pati ent sati sfacti on and understanding without increasing anxiety, even in pati ents with advanced cancer 85 86. survivorship Care Plan A recent communicati on strategy devised to address the informati on needs of cancer survivors is a Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) 27, 87. Previous studies have shown that providing pati ents with writt en informati on increases their recall, knowledge and sati sfacti on with informati on 88, 89, although general writt en informati on is oft en not empowering. A SCP provides cancer survivors with a summary of their course of treatment as a formal document 87. Essenti al in such a SCP is detailed informati on provision about diagnosis and treatment of cancer, possible long-term and late eff ects and management thereof, lifestyle and cancer surveillance recommendati ons, and available resources 90. The SCP is expected to be an empowering and enabling device 91, by facilitati ng bett er understanding and self-care by the pati ent. However, evidence concerning the eff ecti vity of the SCP to improve PROs is lacking 92.CHAPTER 13 224feedback of Pr Os from patient to HCP The most frequently reported unmet need among cancer survivors was information about long-term effects and aftercare. More than 60% of survivors report that their HCP lacked complete knowledge of how their HRQoL was affected by cancer and its treatment 93. A way to focus on key topics during a consultation is feedback of PROs. Feedback on HRQoL information to HCPs has the potential to help detect unmet needs and symptoms leading to better control and monitoring of such issues, serve as a guide for HCPs to discuss HRQoL issues, act as patients' voice, and facilitate individualized information provision and care 94. Research shows that PRO feedback to HCPs was effective in initiating discussion of problematic HRQoL and was able to focus the conversation on topics relevant for the patient without extending the visit 95. However, another study showed that PRO feedback alone does not overcome the existing barriers that prevent HCPs from discussing HRQoL issues with their patients 94. Future studies should investigate whether feedback of PROs directly to the patient is more effective in initiating a discussion than feedback of PROs to the HCP alone. One way to give PRO feedback directly to the patient is by a web-based intervention. An increasing number of patients participating in our PRO studies fill in the questionnaires online 96. When the raw online questionnaire data could be translated into easy interpretable graphical representations, this will give the patient insight into their own well-being compared to other cancer patients or a normative population. This PRO information may empower patients to initiate discussions about these topics with their HCP . The effectiveness of a web-based intervention, aimed at providing feedback on PROs directly to the patient, in increasing patient satisfaction with information and addressing unmet informational needs should be explored. Concluding remarks The number of cancer survivors is rapidly increasing in the Western world. The increasing incidence rates of TC can partially be explained by the improved diagnostics, possibly leading to overdiagnosis and accompanying overtreatment. Cancer survivors often experience a diminished HRQoL and higher levels of anxiety and depression as a result of cancer and its treatment. Recognition and monitoring (e.g. with the THYCA-QoL for TC survivors) of the specific health problems survivors' are dealing with is important to provide optimal supportive care. Another important aspect of survivorship care is information provision. Satisfaction with received information is related to better PROs. However, several areas of information provision are experienced as insufficient. The identification of specific information needs could facilitate a more patient-tailored approach of informing patients. Besides, HCPs need to be aware of the clinical and socio-demographic factors associated with these information needs and perceptions of received information. A more patient-tailored 13GENERAL DISCUSSION 225approach of informati on provision may contribute to improved sati sfacti on levels and PROs in cancer survivors. Strategies to improve informati on provision to cancer survivors, like survivorship care plans and feedback of PROs directly to the pati ent, need to be explored.CHAPTER 13 226referenCes 1.
