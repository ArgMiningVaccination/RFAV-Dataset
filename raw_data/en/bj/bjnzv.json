The webinars will be held Thursdays in February and March. North Dakota producers are seeing an increase in lice infestations in their herds. Feedlot School topics include feedlot production, nutrition, manure management and marketing. Grain, supplements, feeding hay and winter facilities are among the topics that will be covered. Beef cow pregnancy rates are important numbers to track. Now is a good time to evaluate cow condition and develop winter feeding programs. Backgrounding cattle is a program in which cattle are fed for a period of time after weaning and before they are placed in finishing feedlots. The goal of herd immunity is the reduction of infection or disease in a population's susceptible segment. Determining the nutrient content of forages and other feeds through laboratory analysis is the best way to design a nutrition program that meets livestock requirements. Early weaning can help reduce pressure on native pastures and extend forage supplies for adult beef cows. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will allow producers to graze, hay or cut cover crops on prevented-planting acres beginning Sept. 1. Sweetclover is a biennial legume that lives for two years. Pinkeye can result in increased labor, the need to purchase antibiotics, decreased weaning weights and lower prices paid for animals with scarred eyes. Lack of rain can impact forage production. Left untreated, flies can cause significant losses in production. The plan helps emergency personnel know how to assess an accident involving livestock, make critical decisions, and keep themselves and the public safe. The CREC's virtual beef production field day will go live July 14. The combination of heat and humidity can create stress on livestock. Instances of blue-green algae are on the increase in North Dakota. Planting a cover crop can enhance soil health while creating feed for late-season grazing or hay and haylage production. Some forages may contain levels of nitrate that are toxic to livestock. Good-quality water can have a major impact on cattle's intake and weight gain. Now is a good time to evaluate vaccination and herd health management protocols. The majority of diarrhea cases occur when calves are 3 to 16 days old. Flooding may be a problem some rural North Dakota areas this spring. Failing to meet cows' nutrient requirements before and after calving can have major impacts on reproductive performance. Floodwaters can rise quickly, cutting off access to feed and/or water for livestock. Planning can minimize calf losses and improve calves' performance. Abortions and stillbirths are frustrating to livestock producers. Drought and/or excessive moisture can lead to the development of molds, which can "}
