The National Curriculum Framework, 2005 recommends that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home, community and the workplace. The Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE), a constituent of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed learning materials for the skill subjects offered from Classes IX to XII (NSQF Levels 1-4). This student handbook, which has been developed keeping in view the National Occupation Standards (NOSs) set by the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) for the Job Role of Patient Care Assistant/General Duty Assistant is meant for students who have passed. The National Occupation Standards are a set of competency standards used for recognizing and assessing skills and knowledge needed to perform effectively in the workplace. articipation of learners in skill development exercises and inculcation of values and creativity is possible if we involve children as participants in learning and not as receivers of information. Flexibility in the daily time-table would be a necessity to maintain the rigour in implementing the activities and the required number of teaching days will have to be increased for teaching skill subjects. The student handbook has been reviewed by a group of experts team of doctors of AIIMS and MoHFW and their contributions are admirably acknowledged. The utility of the workbook will be adjudged by the qualitative improvement that it brings about in teaching-learning. The likelihood of text errors, including typographical errors cannot be ruled out. The feedback and suggestions on the content by the teachers and other stakeholders will be of immense value to us in bringing about necessary improvement in the student workbook.

Healthcare includes all the services provided to a person / population by various agencies related to healthcare. Healthcare services are the services designed to fulfill health based needs of people / community / population, through various resources available. The healthcare services should be comprehensive and should include promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative. These services are provided through a network of various primary, secondary and tertiary health care centres. Healthcare Systems The World Health Organization (WHO 2007) defines health system as follows: \" A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter- sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health. Healthcare in India is delivered by institutions owned by state governments, local bodies and the central government. However, health care delivery in India is a state subject. The center is mainly responsible for developing and monitoring the national standards and regulations, linking the states with funding agencies, and sponsoring numerous schemes for effective implementation. The healthcare services in India are also provided by the private sector. The government and the private sector are thus help in making healthcare accessible in both rural and urban India.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE6 The healthcare system is composed of different parts designed to work together to make healthcare accessible to everyone. It consists of hospitals, dispensaries, laboratories and health department for the common objective of maintaining good health for the community. A number of healthcare delivery models have been developed for the optimal delivery of healthcare services. The healthcare system/models in India can be categorized under the following sectors or programme: 1. Public Health Sector: It includes the following: a) Primary Healthcare Village level Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) Village level ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife is a village-level female health worker in India who is known as the first contact person between the community and the health services). Sub centers. Primary Health Centre. b) Hospitals/ Health Centers Community Health Centers. Rural Hospital. District Hospital/ Health Centers . Specialty Hospitals. Teaching Hospitals. d) Other Agencies Some examples are as follows: Defence Services. Railways. ESI Hospitals. Municipal Hospitals. Public Sector Companies.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 72. Private Sector: It Includes the following: Private Hospitals, Polyclinics, Nursing Homes and Dispensaries. General Practitioners and Clinics. Corporate and Superspeciality hospitals. 3 . Health Insurance Schemes: Universal Health Insurance programmes. Employee State Insurance Scheme. Central Government Health Scheme. Various schemes of contributory third party payment mechanism, e.g., Yashaswini Scheme, Arogya Bhadratha Scheme, Ayushman Bharat Scheme etc. Employee Health Insurance Programme sponsored by employer and provided by General Insurance Companies. Health Insurance Programme (Mediclaim). 2 . Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy a) Ayurveda : \" AYURVEDA\" is made up of two words- ' Ayuh' and 'Veda'. Ayuh means life and Veda means knowledge or science. Thus \" AYURVEDA' in totality means 'Science of life'. It incorporates all aspects of life whether physical, psychological, spiritual or social. What is beneficial and what is harmful to life, what is happy life and what is sorrowful life; all these four questions and life span allied issues are elaborately and emphatically discussed in Ayurveda. . b) Yoga: Yoga is a discipline to improve or develop one's inherent power in a balanced manner. It offers the means to attain complete self- realization. The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word Yoga is 'Yoke'. Yoga can therefore be defined as a means of uniting the individual spirit with the universal spirit of God. c) Unani : As the name indicates, Unani system originated in Greece. The foundation of Unani system was laid by Hippocrates. The system owes its present form to the Arabs who not only saved much of the Greek CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE8 literature by rendering it into Arabic but also enriched the medicine of their day with their own contributions. In this process they made extensive use of the science of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Therapeutics and Surgery. d) Homeopathy : The word 'Homoeopathy' is derived from two Greek words, Homois meaning similar and pathos meaning suffering. Homoeopathy simply means treating diseases with remedies, prescribed in minute doses, which are capable of producing symptoms similar to the disease when taken by healthy people. It is based on the natural law of healing- \"Similia Similibus Curantur\" which means \"likes are cured by likes\". It was given a scientific basis by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann ( 1755-1843) in the early 19th century. e) Naturopathy : Naturopathy is an art and science of healthy living and a drugless system of healing based on well founded philosophy. It has its own concept of health and disease and also principle of treatment. Naturopathy is a very old science. We can find a number of references in our Vedas and other ancient texts. The morbid matter theory, concept of vital force and other concepts upon which Naturopathy is based are already available in old texts. f) Sidha : Siddha system is one of the oldest systems of medicine in India . The term Siddha means achievements and Siddhars were saintly persons who achieved results in medicine. Eighteen Siddhars were said to have contributed towards the development of this medical system. Siddha literature is in Tamil and it is practised largely in Tamil speaking part of India and abroad. 3 . Voluntary Health Sector and Non-Government Organizations The Voluntary Health Sector can be broadly classified as Follows: Government Voluntary Organization: These are voluntary organizations which play the role of implementing government programs like Family Planning and Integrated Child Development Services. Healthcare for Special Groups of People: This includes education, rehabilitation and care of the handicapped.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 9Model of Healthcare System Health Researchers and Activists: The efforts of these groups are usually directed towards writing occasional papers, organizing meetings on conceptual aspects of health care and critiquing government policy through their journals. Health Work Sponsored by Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs and Chambers of Commerce: They usually concentrate on eye camps - conducting cataract operations in the rural areas on a large scale with the help of various specialists, etc. Integrated Development Programs: In these programs, health is a part of integrated development activities. Consequently, their emphasis on health care may not be as systematic or as effective as that of the previous group. Specialized Community Health Programs: They include income generating schemes for the poorer communities so that they can meet their basic nutritional needs. Model of healthcare system A simplified model of healthcare system can be represented as below:CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE10 Exercise 1. Long Answer Questions: a) Describe various Healthcare delivery models. b) Enumerate the various health insurance schemes in the country. c) Define who has primary responsibility to provide healthcare to the population in our country? 2.

Fill in the Blanks: a) The healthcare services should be promotive, __________________ and rehabilitative. b) Healthcare in India is delivered by institutions owned by __________________ government, __________________ and the __________________ government. c) ASHA stands for __________________ .SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 11Session 2 Components and Activities of a Hospital Relevant Knowledge The term Hospital is derived from the Latin Word 'Hospes' meaning 'host', which is the root word for English words like hotel, hostel and hospitality. The place where a guest is received is called hospitium or hospitale. Thus, taking it further a hospital is an institution for healthcare providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. Hospitals are an important and integral part of our healthcare delivery system. Hospital is defined as an integral part of social and medical organization, the function of which is to provide for the population a complete healthcare. The outpatient services of the hospital reach out to the family and its home environment. The hospital is also a centre for the teaching, training and research. A hospital has various components that are integrated by common purpose of achieving a set of objectives. Components of Hospitals The various components of the hospital includes: 1. Clinical such as Outpatient, Inpatient, emergency. 2. Diagnostic Services such as laboratory, radiological, pathology etc. 3. Administrative including finance, security, ambulance services etc.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE12 4. Teaching, training and Research. 5. Miscellaneous - Ambulance, CSSD, Laundry, Mortuary etc. The performance of all these services is dependent on the cooperation and coordination of various components within the system. The individual sub- systems have their independent goals for providing best patient care. It is can be inferred that hospitals are highly complex, social, economic and scientific organization whose function is to provide comprehensive healthcare. Functions of Hospital The purpose of healthcare services is to effectively meet the total health needs of community. The hospitals play a major role in maintaining and restoring the health of the community. The main functions of the hospitals can be listed as follows: Patient Care Preventive care Training and Research The above functions can be further described as below: 1. Patient Care The various patient care services in the hospital include: Diagnostic services: It includes the inpatient services involving medical, surgical and other specialties and specific diagnostic procedures. Curative services: It includes treatment of all ailments/diseases. Rehabilitative services: Those activities include physical, mental and social rehabilitation. Emergency Services: It includes emergency services required for dealing with injury, trauma, accidents, natural disasters, epidemics, etc. 2. Preventive services The hospitals also carry out various preventive functions which include the following: Supervision of pregnancies and childbirth Supervision of normal growth and development of children Control of communicable diseasesSECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 13 Prevention of life style related disease like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity etc. Provision of health education services Occupational health services Preventive health check up 3. Training and Research Services The training activities of the hospitals generally refers to the training of medical, paramedical and other support staff (Clinical/Non-clinical) required and working in the facility. The training is generally provided to: Medical undergraduates Nurses and Midwives Specialists and post graduates Medical social workers Paramedical staff including technical staff The research activities carried out by the hospitals are generally for the enhancement of medical technology and services in the following areas: Physical, psychological, spiritual and social aspects of health and diseases Clinical medicine Hospital practices and administration.

Long Answer Questions: a) What is hospital? b) Discuss the functions of a hospital. c) Discuss the components of a hospital.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 15Session 3 Describe the Roles and Functions of a Clinic Relevant Knowledge The word clinic is derived from the Greek word \"klinein\" meaning to slope, lean or recline. Hence kline is a couch or bed, klinikos is sloping or reclining and Latin is clinicus. An early use of the word clinic was referred to the person 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed'. A clinic is a healthcare facility that provides examination, consultation, prescription to outpatients including dispensing of medicines by a single / doctor (general practitioner/ specialist doctor /super-specialist doctor). A polyclinic is a facility that provides examination, consultation, prescription to outpatients including dispensing of medicines by more than one doctor (general practitioner/ specialist doctor /super-specialist doctor). A few minor procedures like dressing and administering injections etc may be provided in the clinic/polyclinic which donot require observation/short stay. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded, and typically cover the primary healthcare needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays. Role and the Functions of a Clinic The function of clinics will differ from place to place. For instance, a local general practice run by a single general practitioner will provide primary healthcare, and will usually be run as a for-profit business by the owner whereas a government specialist clinic may provide subsidised and specialised healthcare to the patients. They are advantageous to patients because they can provide immediate medical attention. In these clinics, the injury or illness which are not serious enough may be managed. However, they can provide initial treatment for serious injuries and then the person can be referred to a higher facility Some of these clinics may have diagnostic equipment such as X- ray machines and other diagnostic facilities. Types of Clinics There are many different types of clinics providing outpatient services. Such clinics may be public (government funded) or private medical practices.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE16 A free clinic provides free or low-cost healthcare for it is generally provided by the State/ Central government and some other charitable organisations/ NGOs. A specialist clinic is a clinic providing advanced diagnostic or treatment services for specific diseases or parts of the body. This type of clinic contrasts with general out- patient clinics, which deal with general health conditions and disease categories. E.g. dental clinic, eye and ENT clinic, fertility clinic, etc. An ambulatory clinic offers outpatient guidance and counselling for various diseases and procedures that can be carried out in specialised hospitals or clinics.

It improves, normalises and even returing the lost functions in post injury, post surgical and disabled conditions. Rehabilitation facilities help in restoring a person back to normal life and to get a useful place in society. People may experience an accident or illness that temporarily makes them unable to function normally; others may have an injury that handicaps them. A rehabilitation center provides a support system to helps restoring people to their place in society. Functions of a Rehabilitation Center: Rehabilitation centre provide the care needed when required, it includes: Medical support. A specialized care plan to help regain strength and independence. Guidance to the family and caregivers. Depending on the need, a specialized care team of doctors and nurses with support from professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dietician and social workers make the rehabilitation plan. The function of a rehabilitation center is to help in the recovery process. Rehabilitation centers use a combination of therapy, exercises , small groups and/or individual sessions. The function of a rehabilitation center is to both increase the quality of life and to help the patient integration back into the community. These Programs provides care to people who require specific medical and therapeutic services in a supportive environment. Rehabilitation can be of various types like : 1. Physical Rehabilitation: It focusses on the use of physical therapy for rehabilitation. Physical therapy or physiotherapy helps in promoting mobility, function, and quality of life. It focusses more on using physical exercises to help patients regain movement (motor) skills. Such therapy also helps to rehabilitate patients who have accident- related injuries or who have lost a limb, they also help rehabilitate those who have spinal, muscular or bone problems. SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 192. Occupational rehabilitation : The focuss of occupational rehabilitation is to recover & improve the daily living and work skills. For example, an occupational therapist may work with a patient who has had a severe spinal cord injury to help him regain the use of her arms or legs for his daily work. 3. Addiction Rehabilitation: Assists a person to defeat alcohol and drug addiction, eating disorders, gambling etc., so that he/she can get back on the right path and live a successful, happy and productive life. 4. Psychosocial rehabilitation (involving both psychological and social aspects) Involves restoration of community functioning and well- being of an individual diagnosed with mental or emotional disorder. Psychosocial rehabilitation focus on the rehabilitation of the mind. Psychosocial rehabilitation, deals with psychiatric disorders such as major depression, bi-polar disorder, and schizophrenia. It helps persons with psychiatric disorders to stabilize themselves through therapy and medication. Exercise 1.

Generally, it provides the non-skilled care, such as assisting with normal daily tasks like dressing, bathing, and using the bathroom. Essentially, it involves providing a level of medical care that requires the expertise of skilled practitioners to address the often multiple chronic conditions associated with older populations. Long-term care can be provided at home, in assisted living facilities or in nursing homes. Long-term care may be needed by people of any age, although it is more commonly needed for senior citizens. Definition Long Term Care facility provides rehabilitative, restorative, and/or skilled nursing care to patients who are in need of assistance with the activities of daily living. Long-term care facilities include nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, inpatient behavioural health facilities, and long-term chronic care hospitals. Need for Long Term Care Life expectancy is improving in most countries, implying that more and more people are living longer and entering an age when they may need care in their daily activities. Changing social patterns, including nuclear families, different residential patterns and increased female labour participation in the work force, often contribute to an increased need for long term care. In many countries, the largest percentages of older persons needing Long Term Care services still rely on informal home care, or services provided by unpaid caregivers such as Trusts, societies and some NGOs. Types of Long Term Care Long-term care can be provided formally or informally. Facilities that offer these formal services typically provide living accommodation for people who require on site delivery of around-the-clock supervised care, including CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE22 professional health services, personal care and services such as meals and housekeeping. These facilities may be called as nursing home, personal care facility, residential continuing care facility, etc. Long-term care provided formally in the home, also known as home healthcare. These services are usually done as advised by a physician or other professional. Informal long- term home care is care and support provided by family members, friends and other unpaid volunteers. Exercise 1. Observe how elderly persons in your family is being cared for? 2. Suggest at least five ideas that will enhance the quality of care for elderly at your home. a) In today's Indian society, why do we need long term care? b) Which services are provided at a Long Term Care facility? c) What is non-formal long term care?

SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 23Session 6 Hospice Care Relevant Knowledge Hospice care is a type and philosophy of care that focuses on the relieving and preventing the suffering of a terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional needs. The focus of hospice care is on palliation of the patient's pain and symptoms. These symptoms may be physical, emotional, or psychosocial in nature. Hospice care focuses on bringing comfort, self-respect, and peace to people in the final time of life. Patients' symptoms and pain are controlled, goals of care are discussed and emotional needs are supported. Hospice care focuses on quality rather than length of life. It provides humane and compassionate care for people in the last phases of incurable disease so that they may live as fully and comfortably as possible. Hospice care treats the person rather than the disease, working to manage symptoms so that a person's last days may be spent with dignity and quality, surrounded by their loved ones. It is family-centered as it includes both the patient and the family in making decisions. Hospice care is used when you can no longer be helped by curative treatment, and you are expected to live few months or less if the illness runs its usual course. Hospice care gives you supportive or palliative care, which is treatment to help relieve disease-related symptoms, but not cure the disease. Its main purpose is to improve your quality of life. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India is also implementing the National Programme for Palliative Care. Places where Hospice Care is Provided Hospice care is generally, designed to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It can be given at the patient's home, a hospital, nursing home, or private hospice facility. The doctor, guidance counselor helps in deciding which program is best for the patient and the family. Hospice can be provided at: 1. Home Hospice Care Most home health agencies and independently owned hospice programs, offer home hospice services. A nurse, doctor, and other professional staff monitor the home hospice program but the main caregiver is usually CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE24 a family member or friend who is responsible for around-the-clock supervision of the patient. This person is with the patient most of the time and is trained by the nurse to provide much of the hands-on care. Members of the hospice staff usually visit regularly to check on the person, his/ her family, and caregivers to give needed guidance and services. Care begins when a patient is admitted to the hospice program, which generally means that a hospice team member visits your home to learn about you and your needs. Return visits are scheduled so that the patient's needs are re-evaluated regularly. To provide further support on call nurse and counselors are available throughout the day. 2. Hospital Based Hospices Hospitals that treat seriously ill patients often have a hospice program. This allows patients and their families easy access to support services and healthcare professionals. Very few hospitals have a special hospice unit, while others use a hospice team of caregivers who visit patients with advanced disease on any nursing unit. Support Facilities Extended by Hospice Care Various types of services are provided by the hospice care team, depending upon the need of the patient and the family. The following are the main services extended by the hospice care: a) Pain Control The goal of pain control is to help patient to be comfortable while allowing then to stay in control and enjoy life. This means that patient is free of pain as much as possible and alert enough to enjoy the people around him/ her and make important decisions. b) Home Care and Inpatient Care Although hospice care can be provided at home, a patient may be admitted to a hospital, extended-care facility, or a hospice inpatient facility. The patient can go back to in-home care when he and his family are ready. c) Family Conferences Regularly scheduled family conferences, often led by the hospice nurse or social worker, keep family members informed about the condition of the patient. SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 25d) Bereavement Care Bereavement is the time of mourning after a loss. The hospice care team works with surviving loved ones to help them through the grieving process. A trained volunteer or professional counselor provides support to survivors through visits, phone calls, and/or other contact, as well as through support groups. The hospice team can refer family members and care giving friends to other medical or professional care, if needed. Exercise 1. What you understand by hospice? 2.

A Care Plan outlines the care needs to be provided to an individual. It is a set of actions that the GDA will have to implement to support patient care. The terms Plan of Care and Care Plan are used interchangeably. The Care Plan provides a systematic method of individualized care that focuses on the patient's response to an actual or potential alteration in health, based on patient's assessment. This plan reflects all disciplines involved in providing care to the patient. It communicates pertinent patient problems or needs, outlines appropriate medical and nursing interventions to meet these needs, and documents the effectiveness of those interventions in the medical record. Essential Duties and Responsibilities The Essential Duties of a PCA include the following. 1. Assist professional healthcare staff with performing physical examinations and procedures, which are as follows: a) Patient data, such as vital signs and measurement of intake and output are taken and recorded according to the policy and procedure of the Hospital. b) Changes and abnormal findings in patient's data are communicated to the registered nurse and other members of the healthcare team in a timely manner. c) Patient is assisted with personal hygiene. d) Patient is given assistance with ADLs (Activities of Daily Living), exercise and ambulation as directed by therapists and other members of the healthcare team. e) Personal care and patient related services are provided in the patient's home as needed per guidelines set forth by the Home Health Agency.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE32 2.

Long Answer Questions: a) Communication skill question. b) What are the roles and responsibilities of Patient Care Assistant?SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 35Session 2 Identify Various Activities of Patient's Daily Care Relevant Knowledge Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily self- care activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. Health professionals routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regards to people with disabilities and the elderly. Younger children often require help from adults to perform ADLs, as they have not yet developed the skills necessary to perform them independently. ADLs are defined as \"the things we normally do such as feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure\" etc. While basic categories of ADLs have been suggested, what specifically constitutes a particular ADL in a particular environment for a particular person may vary. Patient Care Assistance in the Hospital Patients need help with various activities because they may not remember or they may not be able to perform due to medical/surgical condition including physical inability in that particular situation. Also, at times, patient may not be in condition to perform the daily activities such as after surgery, when on ventilator etc. Also,they may not be able to understand instructions when someone tries to help them. So PCA needs to perform or assist these activities for the patient: Bathing and showering (washing the body). Bowel and urinary bladder management (recognizing the need). Dressing. Feeding (setting up food and bringing it to the mouth). Functional mobility (moving from one place to another while performing activities). Care for medical devices being used by the patient. Personal hygiene and grooming of patient (including washing hair).CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE36 Daily Care Plan of Patients To a patient, every task could be a source of stress if it seems beyond their ability. On an average day, therefore, is a series of stressful tasks, and it is no wonder they get frustrated and tired. One very helpful way of reducing their stress is establishing a regular routine for the day doing the same things at the same time every day. This routine can be fine-tuned to ensure that the patient seems comfortable with it. Necessary tasks are all fitted into this routine so that the patient's day is regular and predictable, and the patient can get used to it. They need less effort to get through the day as they sort of know what to expect. They get a greater sense of comfort, and also feel more in control of their lives. The daily routine should only be disrupted if it is very necessary. In addition to a daily routine, the environment around the patient needs to be relaxed and friendly. Also, the patient should have access to whatever is needed to perform activities easily. There should be enough things to keep the patient oriented about where he/ she is, and what the time is. Also, depending on the patient's likes and dislikes, various other means of keeping the patient comfortable and relaxed should be adopted. This could include pictures of happy days, or incense, or music, if these are helpful to the patient. Often, caregivers do not spend enough time making the environment comfortable because they are already having enough work and problems handling care. But even a few appropriate adjustments to the home can drastically improve the patient's emotional state, and consequently, the patient's ability to understand and do things. All of us work better when we are relaxed and happy and surrounded by things we like. So do the patients. So PCAs can coordinate among all persons involved in patient care. When we thinks of how to do something, we shouldn't think only of how to get the task accomplished, but also whether we can make it more pleasant for ourselves and the patient. That will change the activity from a chore to something we may enjoy. Key Messages for Patient Assistance These are some of the tips that can be used for specific activities in healthcare: Bathing Patients often misjudge the temperature of the water, and may end up bathing with very hot or very cold water if not helped.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 37 A bathroom can be very unsafe for a patient if left alone, so stay with the patient. Patients may feel embarrassed or angry at the presence of a caregiver. Handing them the soap and then turning the face away may give them back their sense of privacy. A bath stool may be needed so that the patient sits down comfortably for the bath. Ensure appropriate use of grab rails by the patient during bathing. Skin folds need to be kept any. Also dry areas like between the toes. If bathing is tiring and difficult, reduce frequency to what is indicated by the weather and the needs of personal hygiene. Or give partial baths. A daily full bath may not be needed. Noticed in the time injuries and sores of patient can be easily. Dental Care Need to help the patient brush properly. Denture cleaning will probably have to be done by the caregiver. In later stages, have to assist the patient put in and remove the dentures; dentures should fit well, or the patient will get sores in the mouth. Grooming Patients may cut themselves while shaving with an ordinary razor, and therefore switch to twin blade or electric razors. Caregivers may need to take this activity after sometime. Combing hair is another activity the caregiver may need to take over. Nail cutting and filing require fine coordination, and will need to be taken over. Even if the patients are unable to use face creams and groom themselves, they like to look neat and presentable, and the caregiver needs to take over these tasks as the patient's inability makes them too difficult to be done independently. Dressing Clean and comfortable to the dusting home care is beneficial for the patient. Sequential laying out of clothes provide case to the patient. Long clothes are avoided, so that patients do not trip.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE38 Without zippers or elaborate buttoning should be preferred. Pajamas/ salwars with elastic or nightgown preferred so that they can be just pulled on or taken off. Preferable shoes are with velcro straps instead of shoes with laces. Loose fitting clothes should be warm. Toileting Incontinence occurs for many reasons, some of which are that the patient is not able to reach the bathroom in time, or forgets where the bathroom is. Use signage to point the way, have night lights, have grab rails that the patient can use while reaching the bathroom, and have clothing that can be taken off easily. Timed visits to the bathroom often reduce accidents. Watch out for signs of constipation and dehydration (note colour of urine) and change diet and water intake accordingly. If the patient shows signs of pain while urine passing urine or during bowel movements, consult with the doctor. Adquate cleaning and hygine should be maintain in bathroom. Persons who have been used to different styles of toilets in their childhood may forget what a commode is for, and may need to be reminded. Grab rails or toilet seats with rails may make the experience of sitting on the toilet seat less frightening for the patient. Watch the patient to ensure proper wiping, and proper washing of hands. For visits outside, diapers may be a good option. Even patients, who could be tense about finding a suitable bathroom outside, may easily agree to using diapers for outside visits (such as to the doctor). Patients will need assistance in wearing and removing diapers. Extra undergarments & clothes should be ready in case of soiling. Eating Someone should be ensure that the patients eat on regular intervals. Eating becomes messier over time, and patients who used to use a spoon may switch to eating with hand. They may have problems handling larger pieces, and food may need to be cut down in smaller sizes they can handle.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 39 Patients may not mix food while eating. They may eat all the daal / sambar first, and the curds, and then try to eat the rice without anything mixed. They may finish off the vegetable or curry, and then be left with the roti and nothing to eat with it. They may even eat the pickles separately. This is because they find it a problem to handle multiple items. Caregivers may need to mix food and give it to them, or to make combined dishes like pulao, khichdi, bisi bele bath, and curd rice. Beware of dental problem. Dental consultation should be sought when needed. Chewing becomes a problem over time, and food may need to be made softer, and finally, liquidized in a Mixer. Consult doctors about diet supplements like calcium and vitamins, and also find out whether the patient needs to take a serving of balanced diet. Drinking Water Sometimes, patients, in order to avoid repeated trips to the bathroom, reduce their water intake. They may also forget to drink water. Caregivers need to make sure that patients are drinking enough water. Doctors may also ask patients to include electrolyte rich drinks in the daily routine,if the patient is showing an electrolyte imbalance. Taking Medication In the beginning, patients may find it problematic to keep track of their medicines. Using small labeled boxes for the medicines can help. Soon, however, more care needs to be taken to ensure that patients continue taking their medicines as prescribed. Forgetting to take medication is a common problem. Patients cannot be depended on to take their medication as required. They may forget to do so. Even if reminded, they may not believe they need to take the medication (they may say things like, but I don't have high blood pressure). If caregivers insist, patients sometimes hide the medicine away under the mattress or pretend to swallow it and then spit it out. It is good to be alert on this, and if necessary, supervise the patient to ensure that the medicines are taken as prescribed. In later stages, as swallowing becomes difficult, doctors should be asked to switch prescriptions to medicines that can be crushed and given or can be substituted by syrups.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE40 Physical Exercise 1.

In addition, proper acoustics and hygiene are important. Comfort is best defined as the absence of discomfort. People feel uncomfortable when the environment is too hot or too cold, or when the air is odorous and stale. Positive comfort conditions are those that do not distract by causing unpleasant sensations of temperature, drafts, humidity, or other aspects of the environment. Environmental aspects of patient comfort The environmental conditions conducive to thermal comfort are not absolute, but rather vary with the individual's metabolism, the nature of the activity engaged in, and the body's ability to adjust to a wider or narrower range of ambient. For comfort and efficiency, the human body requires a fairly narrow range of environmental conditions compared with the full scope of those found in nature. The factors that affect humans pleasantly or adversely include: 1. Temperature of the surrounding air 2. Radiant temperatures of the surrounding surfaces 3. Humidity of the air 4. Air motion 5. Odours 6. Dust 7. Aesthetics 8. Acoustics 9. Lighting 10. Room hygiene 11. Sound 12. Bed comfort 13. Personal hygieneCENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE42 These aspects have already been discussed in previous sections. Patient care assistant needs to coordinate with nurses for providing these environmental conditions for his/her comfort. It needs to be remembered that while providing such care, associated medical or surgical conditions also needs to be taken care. Certain aspects like temperature of surrounding environment needs to be adjusted as per patient needs in view of medical condition. Exercise 1. List various elements that can help in providing comfort to patients. 2. Prepare patient check list and compare with standard measurements. 3. Demonstrate care needed by the patient. 4. Long Answer Questions: a) Discuss the various comfort requirements of a patient. b) How can tempeture be notified for providing comfort to the patient?SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 43Session 4 Describe the Various Aspects of Patient's Environment Relevant Knowledge The environment of a patient is vital to assist in the recovery process. As such, the environment must be maintained so that it contributes to and not be a detriment to healing. The patient's environment consists of the setting around him, equipment, furniture, as well as people. The patient's environment should have the following characteristics: 1. The environment should be conducive to rest. 2. The environment should be well lighted to ensure safety. 3. The environment should be free from noise and extraneous activity. 4. The environment should be well ventilated. 5. The environment should be predictable. Environment Conducive to Taking Proper Rest When a person is sick, he/she requires rest among other things as part of his/her therapy. It should allow the patient to regain his/her resources so that he restores his/her health. Many factors should be considered to make this possible, such as scheduling procedures promptly. In addition, assisting the patient in their activities of daily living should be as close to the personal routines the patient has at home. For example, some patients prefer to have their baths in the morning, while others prefer them in the evening. Schedule for visitors should be adhered to so that the patient can focus on physical rest. Well-lighted Rooms Since many elderly individuals are usually hospitalized, their needs must be kept in mind. Accidents may be prevented when corridors and rooms have good lighting. Good lighting includes the avoidance of glares which can distract the patient's vision. The light should also be adjusted to have sufficient rest and sleep as well. There should not be unnecessary light exposure during sleep times and at night. This too helps in maintaining sleep-wake cycle.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE44 Free from noise and Extraneous activity Noise pollutes the environment and is considered as pollution for humans. If a hospital environment is noisy, it detracts from the healing that rest provides. Personnel should control their voices when talking and avoid the use of telephones and other personal electronic equipment in patient care areas. Trolleys, carts, stretchers, and wheelchairs should not be noisy so as to distract the patient. Well Ventilated Rooms Maintaining good ventilation can be achieved in air-conditioned as well as non- air- conditioned rooms. The Patient Care Assistant should ensure that good ventilation is achieved by not allowing too many people to visit the hospital at the same time, as well as to maintain a good air circulation by opening or closing windows or doors as needed. In cases of air -conditioning, the ventilation and cooling nees to be appropriately adjusted. The filters used during ventilation needs to be cleaned and timely replaced. Making Environment Familiar As part of the admission procedure, patients and their families are oriented to the room. Since patients are in unfamiliar surroundings, consistency in the placement of personal effects, equipment and furniture should be maintained. They should know where the urinal or bedpan is or where they can obtain water and their personal effects. The patient care assistant should always return these equipment or furniture to their original placements so as not to confuse the patient. In addition, routines should be followed closely as much as possible, such as the schedule for meals, as well as visitation. Patient Environment and Its Components 1. Typical Equipment / Accessories in the Patient's Room include the following: A) In the Room Bedside table Overhead table Bed Mattress Intravenous (IV) poleSECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 45 B) In washroom/side room Sink 2.

Supplies in Nursery Unit / Ward typically comprises of the following: Nursing station Medication room Examining room Treatment room Procedure room Clean utility room Dirty utility room Kitchen Movement in Patient Rooms and Corridors Another aspect of creating a safe environment in the hospital is adhering to movement patterns. It includes the following: 1. Elevators used for transporting carts, drugs and equipment should not be accessible to non-hospital personnel. 2. Delivery carts should never be left unattended in corridors. They should always be parked away from access pathways, as well as away from patient rooms. 3. Walk following the rules of street traffic. Keep left. 4. Use the stairways instead of the elevator when going up one floor or when going down two floors. 5. Ensure that corridors hazards, such as a wet floor, are marked with appropriate warning signs or notices. 6. Signages for exit and emergency exit should be appropriately placed.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE46 Proper Functioning of Equipment and Patient Room accessories Equipment and accessories in patient rooms are designed to either contribute to the therapeutic regimen of a patient or to assist the patient in maintaining activities of daily living. As such, equipment and accessories should be functional at all times. It should be part of the ward activity. Personnel should check these at regular intervals as part of a preventive maintenance program. Rooms should be checked before a patient is admitted to the make sure that equipment are in working order. Defective equipment should be tagged and sent to the appropriate department for repair. In addition, all equipment should have a regular schedule of being calibrated, tested, and updated as recommended by the manufacturer. Remember that prevention is better than repair. Do not wait for an equipment to fail while it is used on a patient. Exercise 1. Visit a private and a government - run hospital and observe their set - up of patient rooms.

They work under the supervision of nurse in the hospital. As per to the institutional guideline, the PCA has to have a good code of ethical conduct. Medical Ethics Some of the important medical ethics they should follow which are listed below as per Indian Medical standards: 1. Informed Consent: Assist the patient in understanding informed consentrading procedure or treatment in the native language. 2. Confidentiality: The PCA should consider the details about his patients as purely personal between him and the patient. Except for professional reasons the details should not be discussed with others or in public. 3. Communication: Clear communication between the PCA and the patient is very important for successful treatment. Any doubt that the patient has should be dealt with care and cleared at once in simple language which he/she understands. 4. Control: It is the ability to purposefully direct or change. 5. Cultural Concerns: To be sensitive to the cultural practices of the patient/patient in any given circumstance.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 496. Communication with Family Members of the Patient: The PCA should understand the anxiety of the relatives of the patients and make them aware of the medical condition of the patient. 7. Business Related Issues: Healthcare providers should not entertain unethical practices in the hospital. 8. Telling the truth about illness, about medication, and side effects of medicines: Telling the truth implies respect for autonomy - if a patient is lied to, they cannot make a reasoned and informed choice, because they do not have the information they need to do so. 9. Follow the Guidelines of the Hospital: The PCA should strictly follow the guidelines for hygiene, patient care, etc as per hospital protocols and policies. This helps prevent hospital required infections. 10. Accountability: As a professional, the PCA is personally accountable for actions and omissions in his/her practice and must always be able to justify his/ her decisions. He/she must always act responsible as per the rules of professional ethics. PCA and GDA should understand that the above mentioned concerns should be as per hospital policy. Also, the disease related issues needs to be informed as per doctors and nursing instructions. In cases of any confusion, PCA should discuss with doctors or nurses before informing the patient.

When these waste products are not disposed of properly, it may result in transmission of diseases to humans. Patient Care Assistants, like other Health Care Workers must know what biomedical waste is and how to dispose them off in the appropriate containers. By having waste classified, it becomes easier to process the waste so that it is decontaminated following existing guidelines. In addition, proper classification and disposal of biological waste protects healthcare workers and others in the community from accidental exposure to infectious or hazardous materials. Segregation of Biomedical Waste at Source As soon as a waste product is generated, it must be disposed of properly according to the classification of that waste. For example, if you used a glove contaminated SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 55with a body fluid, such as blood, it must be disposed in the right container immediately. By disposing and segregating the waste at its source, it will limit the potential exposure to individuals involved in waste management. Colour Coding and Type of Containers for Disposal of Bio-Medical Waste BLACK BAG: Black bags are used for disposing off paper waste, uninfected plastic waste, gloves, wrappers, masks, empty ointment tubes and caps. YELLOW BAGS: Yellow bags are used for Disposing off the following items: Items contaminated with blood. Cotton containing body fluids. Dressings, soiled plaster cast. Discarded medicines. Cyotoxic drugs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Electrodes. BLUE BAGS: Blue bags are used for Disposing off the following items: All unbroken glasses and vials.

While in modern medical sciences there is a set of standards of hygiene recommended for different situations. What is considered hygienic or not may vary between different cultures and gender groups. Some regular hygienic practices may be considered as good habits by a society, while the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful or even threatening. Personal Hygiene Personal hygiene is the first step to good grooming and good health. Elementary cleanliness is common knowledge. Neglect causes problems that you may not even be aware of.. More often than you know, good looks are the result of careful and continuous grooming. Hand washing ,bruishing bathing nail care etc. arean intregant part of personal hygiene Every part of the body demands a basic amount of attention on a regular basis, such as care of Hair Skin Teeth Hands Nails Feet Menstrual Hygiene Bathing Shaving Hair Hair is your crowning glory. It is easy enough to maintain it. Keep it at a length and style at which you can maintain it. Wash your hair daily using soap or mild shampoo. Avoid shampoos with borax or alkalis. Rinse well. Dry your hair after a wash. Brush your hair three to four times a day with a soft bristled brush or a wide toothed comb. Wash your brush and comb regularly.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE64 Skin Soap and water are essential for keeping the skin clean. A good bath once or twice a day is recommended, especially in tropical countries like India. Those who are involved in active sports or workout should take a bath after the activity. A mild soap will do the job adequately. Germicidal or antiseptic soaps are not essential for the daily bath. You can use a bath sponge for scrubbing. Back brushes and heel scrubbers are available. But do not use abrasive material. Wash off well after soaping. Drying with a clean towel is important. Avoid sharing soaps and towels. Teeth Have you heard of the sixty-second battery operated wonder brush? It has been analysed that it takes only that long to give your teeth a good brush. You have to hold the brush to your teeth and say cheese (and then perhaps S-A-U-C-E for the brush to get a good scrub inside!). Well, whether it is a neem twig or battery brush, you cannot give brushing a miss. Brush teeth twice a day and rinse well after every meal. Brushing before going to bed is important While brushing, pay attention to the fact that you are getting rid of the food particles stuck in between the teeth and in the crevices of the flatter teeth at the back, the molars and premolars. Brush down on the upper teeth and brush up on the lower teeth. Use a circular motion. Pay attention to the tongue and the inner surface of teeth as well. The brush should have resilient bristles. It should be rinsed well and left to dry after use. There are no perfect toothpastes or powders. Use one without harsh abrasives or strong antiseptics. Hands The world around us swarms with micro-organisms. Some bacteria are found on our bodies. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after every meal and after visiting the toilet. Soaping and rinsing should cover the areas between fingers, nails front and back of the hand undividing wrist. Hands should be dried with a clean towel after wash. The towel at the wash stand has to be washed and changed everyday. While cooking, especially when packing lunches, you can prevent food from spoilage and minimise contamination by keeping your hands clean. While handling food avoid scratching, or touching the ears, nose, mouth or other body SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 65orifices. If you need to use a handkerchief or tissue, wash your hands after that. Keep your nails short. Nail Polish users should see that it does not chip off into the food. Nails Clip nails short, along their shape. Don't cut them so close that it pinches the skin. A healthy body ensures healthy nails. Brittle or discoloured nails indicates deficiencies or disease conditions. Feet Give your feet a good scrub with a sponge, pumice stone or foot scrubber that is not made of very abrasive material when having a bath. Dry between toes after bath. Keep toe nails clipped. In many Indian households it is mandatory to wash feet as you enter the house. Wear cotton socks. Wear a clean pair every day. Give importance to wearing comfort in the choice of footwear. For those who go barefoot indoors, door mats must be cleaned or changed frequently. Extra foot care is required for diabetics. Menstrual Hygiene Maintaining menstrual hygiene is an important aspect of personal hygiene. Best is to use good quality sanitary pads, Absorbent pads may be noticeable in form fitting clothes. Apart from pads, tampoons are also available, while using them necessary instruction should be followed. Whatever the preference, washing is important. There need be no taboo about bath on these days. Importance of Personal Hygiene Maintaining personal hygiene is necessary for many reasons; these can be personal, social, health, psychological or simply as a way of life. Essentially keeping a good standard of hygiene helps to prevent the development and spread of infections, illnesses and bad odour. Personal Reasons Self-esteem, confidence and motivation can all be altered by our body image, often reflected on our ability to care for ourselves and keep good hygiene practices.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE66 A bright white smile with clean and healthy teeth can endear people to us, whereas brown, unhealthy teeth can cause embarrassment and can alter our sense of well- being. Healthy hair, skin and nails are signs of a good well- balanced diet and can give us confidence in everyday life. Such hygiene maintenance boosts up self-confidence and hence overall growth. Social Reasons By ensuring that our body is clean and well presented, we are more assured of projecting a positive body image that reflects our personalities. Children should be taught the importance of hygiene and how to achieve good hygiene very early to keep themselves and others healthy. Person with good hygiene is well appreciated socially. Health Reasons A good hygiene has direct relation to good health. Hand washing cannot be emphasized enough as this simple action can prevent a plethora of illnesses and diseases. Many people 'forget' to wash their hands after using the toilet or before handling foods; this can cause illness. Conditions such as head lice, athlete's foot are related to lack of hygiene. Psychological Issues People feel more confident, when they keep themselves clean and tidy and look presentable. Our chances of succeeding either in work or social settings can be influenced by good hygienic practices. Overall, maintaining hygiene not only helps to reduce the risks of ill health but also affects how other perceive us and can influence our levels of confidence and self-esteem which can affect many aspects of our lives.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 67Exercise 1.

Health is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans, it is the general condition of a person's mind and body, usually meaning to be free from illness, injury or pain. Healthcare involves promoting health and preventing disease. It is essential for an health care provider to maintain personnel hygiene, remain healthy and look presentable. Factors for good health includes: Healthy Diet: Ensure eating well balanced diet including all macro and micronutrients. The food should be cooked well, fresh and served hygienically. Food from each of the five major food groups should be eaten daily (milk, meat, fish and poultry, vegetables, fruits, bread, cereals, rice and pasta). Avoid use of tobacco, drugs and alcohol. Use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs, seriously affects good health. Rest: Adequate rest is important for maintaining good health. Provides energy and ability to deal with stress. The amount of rest or sleep required varies. Regular Exercise: It promotes good health and feeling of well being. It is equally important to maintain good posture. Prevents fatigue and puts less stress on muscles Good Posture: Stand straight with muscles pulled in, shoulders relaxed and weight balanced equally on both feet All the above maintain circulation and improve muscle tone, help mental attitude, contribute to more restful sleep. Maintaining a successful routine exercise 1. Make good health as your goal Remember that your overall health is what matters most. Vow to not make excuses, commit yourself to a lifestyle change, and start new habits that will improve your health and outlook.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 692. Start slowly and gradually to build your fitness A gradual approach to fitness will help ensure that you maintain your routine and prevent injuries. 4. Eat balanced diet Be sure that your overall diet is well balanced to give you the energy you need throughout the day and during your workout. Since eating just before you exercise can lead to cramping, consume an easily digestible food such as a banana at least an hour before you work out. 5. Keep a written log of your exercise schedule and set goals In addition to being a good reminder of what you have done at each workout, a written log will give you a chance to work toward a goal and see what you have accomplished as you progress through the weeks and months. 6. Exercise each day Establishing a routine often makes it easier to stick with an exercise program. 7. Exercise with a friend whenever possible Walking or running with a friend will give you the chance to visit as well as ward off boredom. Many exercisers suggest their workout flies by when they have a partner. 8. Change your route if you walk or run Check out new neighbourhood, tracks and parks. Changing the scenery can add interest to your routine and help prevent boredom. 9. Warm up, work out and cool down with each exercise session Starting slowly and gradually increasing the intensity of your workout is a good wayto prevent injuries. 10. Include music in your routine Music is a good distraction from the monotony of exercise. Use faster tunes to boost the intensity of your work out and calm music to help you cool down. 11. Consider safety Choose routes with little traffic. Walk or jog on sidewalks whenever possible. If you exercise outside, schedule your workout during the day. When exercising at dawn, dusk, or at night, wear bright colours and reflectors so that you can be easily spotted.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE70 12. Keep changing your exercise Try Yoga for stretching and balance. Brisk walking, running, jogging, and spinning is useful for enhancing for endurance; and weight training to build strength. Cross training or combining a variety of exercises in your weekly routine is the best way to boost your metabolism and ensure overall strength and fitness. Make a point of adding extra activities in your day such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking instead of driving to lunch. 13. Dress appropriately for your activity Wear fast-drying fabrics, such as polyester blends that wick away moisture and help keep you warm. Be sure your shoes fit well and are made for the activity you have chosen. 14. Attitude for workout Focus on a pleasant memory, thought, fantasy, or activity while you work out. Some exercisers find inspiration in positive self talk as they work out. 15. Have a positive outlook about weather Exercising outside in light rain, on cloudy days, and even cold, windy days can energise you and make you feel more in touch with the weather elements. 16. Get plenty of sleep Sleep is essential for getting a good workout. If you did not have enough sleep, either take a rest day or modify your workout so that it is less vigorous. 17. Drink at least 2 litres of water per day Remember that your body is 70 percent water. If you have not had enough to drink, your workout is likely to fall short of your expectations. 18. Listen to your body If you are tired or beginning to get a cold, take a break. Your body needs time to rest and repair. 19. For added physical activity and sociability, take a dance class Dancing provides a terrific aerobic work out and burns up to 300 calories an hour. Remember that increased physical activity of any kind will help keep you healthy. 20. Don't let anything come between you and your fitness routine Since exercise is one of the most important things you can do to maintain SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 71good physical and mental health, be sure to include it in your daily routine no matter what scheduling complications you encounter. Make exercise as essential as bathing, brushing your teeth, eating, and sleeping. 21. Eat a healthy diet A healthy, low-fat diet that is combined with regular exercise can help guard against obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, insomnia, depression, anxiety, osteoporosis, cancer, and heart disease. 22. Reward yourself! Take a hot bubble bath, get a massage, or get a new outfit to celebrate your hard work. Exercise 1.

Hand washing for hand hygiene is the act of cleaning one's hands with or without the use of water or another liquid and with the use of soap, for the purpose of removing soil, dirt, and/or microorganisms. Use soap and warm running water and wash hands for at least 10 seconds. Liquid soap is best. In some circumstances, alcohol based hand sanitizer may also be used. Medical hand hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes disease and the spreading of disease. Hand washing with soap and water is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (including bacteria or viruses) and chemicals which can cause personal harm or disease. Washing hands properly after using the toilet, changing nappies, handling animals and before and after handling food helps prevent the spread of various forms of gastroenteritis, some of which can cause serious health problems. This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public. Why is Hand Hygiene Important? The hands normally have a \"resident\" population of micro-organisms. Other micro- organisms (germs) are picked up during everyday activities. We all carry millions of germs on our hands, most are harmless, but some cause colds, flu, skin infections or diarrhea. When we forget to wash our hands, we can spread these germs to other people. We can also infect ourselves by touching our eyes, mouths or open cuts. Hand washing should remove these infection causing organisms before they are transferred to surfaces, another patient or to a susceptible area on the same patient.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 73Why is Hand Hygiene Important in Health Care? People receiving healthcare may be more vulnerable to infection from germs carried on their hands or other people's. Germs that naturally live on the skin and normally cause few problems may be more serious when brought into a healthcare environment. These germs are often passed from one person to another by physical contact so it's important that patients, visitors, health care workers, nursing staff and doctors cut the risk of spreading infections by regularly cleaning their hands. Advice to Healthcare Staff and Patients All health care staff should use hand wash with soap and water or alcohol based sanitizer: Before and after direct patient contact; After helping a patient to use the toilet After any procedure; Before putting on and after taking off gloves. Wash your hands before and after eating food and after using the toilet. Wash them at any sink with liquid soap and water. Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps to water. The main action of soaps is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility. Water is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water. Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water. A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus or Norwalk type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. If you are assisting for wound dressings, stitching, catheterization or securing an intravenous line, try not to touch them any more than absolutely necessary. You could spread germs to other parts of the body. Let us now practice the steps used for hand washing.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE74 Steps for Hand Washing Source: *World Health Organization Hand Washing Procedure Washing should take 15-30 seconds.

Importance of Personal Grooming Personal grooming is important for a positive self-image, and thus every effort should be made to maintain a pleasing and attractive. Self grooming is important as it creates better self-confidence when interacting with other health care providers, patient and their attendants. Basic Grooming Basic grooming involves practices that are followed daily to keep healthy. Some of these practices are as follows: Groom hair For long hair's, tie them appropriately. Cover them with a cap in critical areas of hospital. Brush teeth. Take care of skin. Trim fingernails and toenails, and clean the dirt out from under them. Keep the ears clean Wear name badge and clean uniform. Use effective communication skills while speaking to the patient and their relatives. Get regular health check-up. Exercise 1.

Medical treatment is not just providing treatment to sick patients but extends to well-being of the people in community and includes disease prevention and promoting good health, and lifestyle habits. There evolved specific goals and objectives for maintaining health of an individual as well as community. To achieve these objectives appropriate systems need to be developed to measures taken to prevent diseases on one hand and promote good health on other side with provision for treatment of diseases on other side. Various studies indicated that significant population in India borrows money to meet their healthcare costs which are sudden and unexpected there is poor accesits health insurance. The progress of the country depends on strong health system, preventive and promotive health. It is essential to develop good systems to include preventive health, have effective immunization, provide adequate understanding and care for maternal and child health, effective reimbursement or insurance mechanism to reimburse the costs of medical treatment, mechanism to manage epidemics and good emergency transport system to provide prehospital care during emergencies. Health care not only requires these aspects, but also supportive and rehabilitative support to the patients with chronic diseases. Primary Health Care Health is defined as \"State of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity\". Primary Health Care is medical care available to people at first level, it combines all the available medical facilities at the community for improving health status. Primary Health Care is defined as an essential healthcare based on scientific methods, universally accessible to the individuals and family in community at a cost which community and country can afford. It is the first level of contact of the SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 81individuals and integrates the family and the community with the national health system bringing healthcare as close as possible to where people live and work which includes awareness on preventive health, first level care at the community, immunization, alerts, awareness and precautions in case of epidemics, referral of patients to appropriate care facility, supportive supervision and guidance and logistic support and supplies. Primary Health Care is conceived as an integral part of the country's plan for socio-economic development. In India Primary Health Care is delivered both private sector and public sector. Public sector includes Village level Accredited Social Health Activist (commonly known as ASHA), Village level ANM, Sub Centers and Primary Health Centers. Components of Primary Healthcare The essential components of Primary Healthcare are as follows: Education about prevailing health problems and methods of preventing and controlling them. Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition. Adequate supply of water and basic sanitation. Maternal and Child Healthcare including family planning. Immunization against infectious diseases. Prevention and control of endemic diseases. Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries. Provision of essential drugs. Medical Emergency Medical Emergency is any medical condition which has a sudden onset, unexpected occurrence needs attention, may be dangerous or may possess an immediate risk to person's life, limb and organ or long term health. Considering the emergency situation and availability of resources, the Emergency Medical Response varies. However a standardized approach with sequential steps, well reinforced in the society and healthcare provider, followed systematically helps in increasing chances of survival and faster recovery. Emergency Medical Response is standard medical response by a first responder or qualified CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE82 medical professional based on his competency provided to emergency victim which would help in increasing the chances of survival. First Aid In our day-to-day life we come across many medical and surgical condition warranting immediate care. Provision of the bystander care would help the patient overall outcome. At times, in few medical emergencies we come across unconscious / unresponsive patients, or seriously ill patients who need attention and no immediate professional medical help is available. In such case every second counts. Under such circumstances, it is quite common that everyone attempts to help in their own way to rescue the victim. Instead if one, who is a qualified first aider or doctor takes lead and adopts a standard approach to respond, it would increase the chances of survival. Time is of essence as any episdoe of lack of oxygen to vital organs like brain and heart can lead to adverse effect. Appropriate first aid at appropriate time help in the sustenance of life, prevent a victim's medical condition from worsening, increases chances of recovery, and to assist to timely and safe transportation/ medical help. Dealing with Emergencies and Initial Management Whenever in an emergency situation, a First aid provider should give the highest priority to the following steps, in this sequence: Step 1: Make the area Safe (for you and for the victim) Your own safety is most important Check for an unsafe situation (traffic, electricity cables etc.) and summon help to make the area safe like calling police, fire brigade, life guard etc. See whether the victim is responding or breathing normally (rise and fall of chest), any limb movements, coughing, any air felt on the cheek or any breathing sounds are noted. Also, see whether the victim is bleeding or not. Look for any deformity or swelling of limbs. If the victim is apparently unconscious, then Check the victim's response to your sound and to your touch (Tap and talk)SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 83 Also, check whether there is any sign of life and if the victim is breathing or not. A gurgling or snoring sound in an unconscious victim is an indirect indicator that air is not getting through the windpipe. Always stay calm, don't panic. Call an ambulance for help Call whoever is available nearby Provide Appropriate and Timely First Aid Introduce yourself to the victim Show empathy, kindness, and concern Make him/her comfortable In case you are providing any first aid, explain what you are going to do and what will likely happen In general, you should not give any food item and/or drink to the victim, especially when the person is injured or unconscious Always wash your hands before and after providing first aid. The most important principle for first aid is assessment and management of ABC (Airway, Breathing Circulation). This mandates keeping the airway open, provision of breathing and maintains circulation (this may require control of bleeding by direct pressure). At times, patient may sustain cardio-respiratory arrest, then cardio-respiratory resuscitation is required. Compression Only Life Support (COLS) This technique is applicable for providing CPR of a cardiac arrest victim by a lay person and has been formulated by Indian Resuscitation Council. The provision of immediate bystander CPR is essential for optimal outcome after a cardiac arrest.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE84 Core links in adult COLS: Sequential conducts of targeted core steps are essential for optimal outcome. The core links for resuscitation in adult by lay person in adult COLS as (Figure): Early Recognition and Activation, Early Chest Compression Early Transfer. Core links Of COLS (Photo Courtesy: Indian Resuscitation Council) Steps for Adult COLS: The adult COLS is a simple, easy to remember and perform cardiac resuscitation by a minimally trained person, unable or unwilling to perform rescue breaths (Figure). It is the preferred algorithmic approach by a lay person who witnesses a victim collapsing or comes across a victim who has collapsed. It can even be performed by family members who witnesses collapse of their near and dear ones. COLS have a series of predefined steps which need to be followed sequentially. Safe place for resuscitation: The safety of the rescuer is paramount. In panic situations, mishaps can happen leading to injury to rescuer, if the place is not safe for management of victim with cardiac arrest. In case any imminent danger is perceived (like risk of accident, fire, electrocution, drowning, riots, etc), then the rescuer should activate the concerned authority or seek help from the available people to shift the victim to a safe place. The resuscitation should be initiated, as soon as feasible, while this activity of information is being undertaken.SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 85 Algorithmic Approach For Cardiac Arrest Victim Compression Only Life Support (COLS). (Photo Courtesy: Indian Resuscitation Council)CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE86 EARLY RECOGNITION AND ACTIVATION FOR HELP VICTIM'S RESPONSE CHECK: For victim's response check, come from front, facing the victim face, tap on the shoulder, speak loudly (eg HELLO - Are you alright?) in a language the victim could understand. If the victim responds either by verbal response and/or by purposeful movement, then cardiopulmonary arrest is unlikely. Such victim needs to be monitored constantly and shifted to nearby medical facility at the earliest for further evaluation and management. If no response is elicited, the victim may be having cardiopulmonary arrest and would require further help. The emergency medical system must be activated for early transfer of the victim to a nearby hospital. Check Response (Photo Courtesy: Indian Resuscitation Council) Call for help, inform emergency medical system or ambulance service: If the rescuer is alone, then he should activate the emergency medical system or ambulance services himself for early transfer of the victim for definitive treatment. Early Chest Compression: Adequate training needed before application. Once the cardiac arrest is recognized, the rescuer should place the victim supine with his back over a hard flat surface or over the ground and start providing chest compression immediately. Cycles of 30 chest compressions should be initiated. This SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 87 Chest Compression (Photo Courtesy: Indian Resuscitation Council) Chest Compression (Photo Courtesy: Indian Resuscitation Council) guideline suggests identification of centre of chest by identifying the xiphoid process (lowest end of breast bone) and keeping heel of the hand 2 fingers above it for chest compression. The rescuer should chant the count loudly 1,2,3,4, ....30, to maintain the speed and number of chest compressions. The rate of chest compressions should be 120/minutes and compression depth should be at least 5 cm but not more than 6 cm. The rescuer should allow complete chest recoil between compressions without lifting hands from the chest but should not lean on the victim's chest. There should be minimum interruptions during chest compressions.CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE88 If the rescuer is alone he/she should continue chest compression for 5 consecutive cycles (30 compressions in each) or more till there is sign of return of spontaneous circulation (movement of any part of the body, coughing or vocalizing), the rescuer gets exhausted or medical help arrives. If there is more than one rescuer, then they should exchange hands after every 5 cycles till there is sign of return of spontaneous circulation or medical help arrives. Transfer of the Victim for better Medical Help: The victim needs definitive medical care and management of the underlying aetiology of the cardiopulmonary arrest and so should be shifted to nearest health care facility. The COLS needs to be continued till medical help arrives (ambulance service) or victim is handed over to a medical care facility or victim becomes responsive (moving, coughing or vocalizing).

Chain of Survival SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 91In life threatening events in out of hospital scenarios, when one comes across an unconscious patient or seriously ill patients (appears to have dead) there are series of actions, if put into action would increase the chances of survival of the patient. These series of action are termed as \"Chain of Survival\" in various resuscitation guidelines. Step 1. Ensure Scene Safety - In emergency resuscitation the first principle is safety, unless you are safe, you can't provide help to others. Ensure the location is safe for yourself, the victim who is in emergency condition and also the bystanders around. Step 2. Check for response from Victim - It is essential to understand if the victim is conscious and is able to respond. To check this gently shake his shoulder and ask him loudly \" Are you O.K\", \"Can you hear me\". Step 3. Check for Response - If he responds, ensure he is in position in which you find him, ensure there is no further danger from surroundings, try to identify the cause and provide necessary help, seek for medical attention and try to transfer him to a medical facility as early as possible. If he doesn't respond, then Immediately shout for help Turn him onto his back Open Airway using head tilt and chin lift method Place your hand on his forehead and gently tilt his head back With your fingertips under the point of victim's chin, lift the chin to open the airway. Keeping the airway open Look - Look for chest movement Listen - At the victim's mouth for breath sounds Feel for breathing - Feel for air on your cheek Identify if breathing is normal, not normal or absent If breathing normally, turn him into appropriate position (side position with head dependent, with no pressure on the chest) ensuring the position is CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE92 stable. Also ensure that there is no obstruction to breathing. Seek help, Call for Ambulance, Call National Ambulance Service Telephone Numbers i.e. 108 or 102 or any other ambulance service available. Continue to assess breathing, check if breathing is normal. If the breathing is not normal or absent, alert the ambulance service, attempt to bring an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if available, and attempt Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). (CPR method would be taught to you in subsequent NVEQF levels). The simple model of Emergency Medical Response can be represented as below, further it is followed by CPR which would be taught in subsequent levels.

When body is infected by viruses, bacteria or other infectious organisms (e.g. a fungus or parasite), it undergoes a process of fighting the infection and then healing itself. As a result of this, when our body encounters the same organism, we will be 'immune' to this infection. This means that person are less likely to get the same disease again, if we get the infection it will be less severe. This is the principle behind vaccination. How Does Immunity Work? Whenever our body encounters a foreign organism, like bacteria or a virus, a complicated set of responses are set in motion. Our body has two sets of defensive mechanisms, one called 'innate immunity' and another called 'adaptive immunity'. Innate Immunity Innate immunity describes our body's barriers to infection that are in-built (or innate). This includes: Skin Acidic Environment of Stomatch Saliva Tears Cells in blood stream that can destroy bacteria. All of these systems are extremely important as a first line of defence to prevent us from becoming infected, and for getting rid of the infections. These innate systems do not change with multiple exposures to the same infection; there is no 'learned' response no matter how many times our body is exposed to the same organism. CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE100 Adaptive Immunity Our body's second line of defence is called adaptive immunity which is more complex. By adapting to fight infections from particular bacteria or viruses, our body can become immune to infections caused by the same organism in the future. This adaptation by body to prevent infection is the basis of immunization. Certain types of blood cells can learn from exposure to an infection. This means that the next time they encounter that infection they can remember it and mount a faster and stronger response. For Example: Antibodies are made by the body in response to an infecting organism. They can recognise specific types of viruses or bacteria. They work by attaching themselves to the organism, and preventing them from infecting your body. Exercise 1. Short Answer Questions: a) What is immunity? b) State the difference between innate immunity and adaptive immunity? 2. Long Answer Questions: a) Prepare a presentation on \"how does the immune system works? b) What is virus? c) What is bacteria?SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 101Session 2 Describe the Immunization Schedule Relevant Knowledge What is Immunization? Immunization protects children (and adults) against harmful infections, before they come into contact with them in the community. Immunization uses the body's natural defense mechanism, the immune response, to build resistance to specific infections. Nine diseases can be prevented by routine childhood immunization - diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis (polio), measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) and hepatitis B. All of these diseases can cause serious complications and sometimes death. Immunization is given as an injection or in the case of polio vaccine, taken as drops by mouth. Immunization helps children stay healthy by preventing serious infections. Immunization and Vaccination Technically 'vaccination' is the term used for giving a vaccine, that is, actually getting the vaccine injected or swallowing the drops. 'Immunization' is the term used for the process of both getting the vaccine and becoming immune to is the disease as a result of the vaccine. Most people use the terms 'vaccination' and 'immunization interchangeably but their meanings are not exactly the same because immunity follows vaccination in most, but not all, cases. For the purposes of this workbook, we have always used the term 'immunization' because this is the expression most commonly used in the community. How Does Immunization Work? All forms of immunization work in the same way. When someone is injected with, or swallows, a vaccine, their body produces an immune response in the same way it would following exposure to a disease but without the person getting the disease. If the person comes in contact with the disease in the future, the body is able to make an immune response fast enough to prevent the person getting sick. What is Vaccine? A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE102 its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and \"remember\" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines may be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated. The term vaccine derives from Edward Jenner's 1796 use of cowpox (Latin variola vaccinia, adapted from the Latin vaccinus, from vacca, cow) to inoculate humans, providing them protection against smallpox. Macrophages are specialised blood cells that can directly attack and destroy an infecting organism, digesting them so they cannot produce disease. Vaccines trigger the adaptive immune system by stimulating the body to make antibodies, so that it can prepare for a potential infection in the future. Passive immunity is acquired through transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells from an immune host, and is short lived, usually lasting only a few months, whereas active immunity is induced in the host itself by antigen and lasts much longer, sometimes lifelong. How Long Do Immunizations Take to Work? In general, the normal immune response takes several weeks to work. This means protection from an infection will not occur immediately after immunization. Most immunizations need to be given several times to build long lasting protection. A child who has been given only one or two doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTPa) is only partially protected against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus, and may become sick if exposed to these diseases. How long do immunizations last? The protective effect of immunizations is not always life-long. Some, like tetanus vaccine, can last up to 30 years, after this time a booster dose may be given. Some immunizations, such as whooping cough, give protection for about five years after a full course. Is Everyone Protected from Disease by Immunization? Even when all the doses of a vaccine have been given, not everyone is protected against the disease. Measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio and Hib vaccines protect more than 95% of children who have completed the course. Three doses of whooping cough vaccine protects about 85% of children who have SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 103been immunized, and will reduce the severity of the disease in the other 15% of children (who have also been immunized), if they do catch whooping cough. Booster doses are needed because immunity decreases over time. Three doses of hepatitis B vaccine protect over 95% of children. Why do Children Get So Many Immunizations? A number of immunizations are required in the first few years of a child's life to protect the child against the most serious infections of childhood. The immune system in young children does not work as well as the immune system in older children and adults, because it is still immature. Therefore, more doses of the vaccine are needed. In the first months of life, a baby is protected from most infections by antibodies from her or his mother which are transferred to the baby during pregnancy. When these antibodies wear off, the baby is at risk of serious infections and so the first immunizations are given before these antibodies have gone. What are the Side Effects of Immunization? Common side effects of immunization are redness and soreness at the site of injections and mild fever. While these symptoms may concern you and upset your child at the time, the benefit of immunization is protection from the disease. Medician may be taken as advised. Other side effects are very rare but if they do occur, a doctor should be consulted immediately. What is the Importance of Immunization? Each year, vaccines prevent more than many child deaths globally. An additional child deaths could be prevented each year through immunization with currently available vaccines. Prevention against various diseases: Immunization helps to prevent your child against various diseases. Immunization is safe and effective: All vaccines that are given to children are completely safe and effective, as various medical professionals have tested them. The only discomfort can be pain, redness or tender feeling among few. Immunization prevents spread of diseases: If a person is immunized, there is little to risk of an epidemic. Thus, it also prevents spreading of the disease. CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR : HEALTHCARE104 Immunization saves time and money: A prolonged illness can take a toll on your finance as well as your precious time. Immunization is a good investment, as it saves time, money and promotes good health. Immunization protects future: Immunization has helped to eradicate polio to some extent. If we keep on practicing immunization, in near future we will be able to eradicate all these diseases completely. Immunisation has reduced mortality rate. Immunisation has made children more healthy and fit. Immunisation promotes long life span.

Immunization is one of the key areas under National Rural Health Mission of Government of India. Since 1997, immunization activities have been an important component of National RCH Programme. Certain diseases may require universal immunization of a population to control them. Such efforts usually target infants in the first year of life so that immunity is completed as early as possible before the risk of infection, (e.g., diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, polio). Others may require immunization of only selected high risk groups (e.g., at risk elderly for Pneumococcus). In some cases the target group may not be the group that the vaccine is designed to protect (e.g., rubella vaccination of all children and females of child bearing age in order to protect the fetus). Diseases Prevented through Vaccines used in the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) Presently, the Universal Immunization Program in India provides vaccines mainly to children below 5 years of age and pregnant women for the following preventable diseases: 1. Tuberculosis 2. Poliomyelitis 3. Diphtheria 4. Pertussis (whooping cough) 5. Measles 6. Tetanus 7. Hepatitis B 8.

However, administration of Vitamin A is also a part of the Universal Immunization Program. Some other diseases have combined vaccines so as to avoid multiple shots, for example DPT for Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus. This is also called a triple antigen. A pentavalent vaccine (5 vaccines together) is also being considered for introduction in the UIP . This will include DPT+ Hepatitis B vaccine+ vaccine for Haemophilus B.

This project deals with the ways to fight poliomyelitis through a large scale immunization programme, co-operating with various international institutions, state governments and Non-governmental organization. In India, vaccination against Polio started in 1978 with Expanded Program in Immunization (EPI). By 1984, it was successful in covering around 40% of all infants, giving 3 doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to each. In 1985, the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country. UIP became a part of child safe and survival motherland program (CSSM) in 1992 and Reproductive and Child Health Program (RCH) in 1997. This program led to a significant increase in coverage, up to 95%. The number of reported cases of polio also declined from 28,757 during 1987 to 3,265 in 1995. In 1995, following the Polio Eradication Initiative of World Health Organization (1988), India launched Pulse Polio Immunization Program along with Universal Immunization Program which aimed at 100% coverage. In 2012, India was declared free of polio by WHO. Importance of Pulse Polio Programme The Polio viruses are three related virus type: type 1, 2 and 3. All three types cause paralysis. Type 1 causes paralysis most frequently. Polio is highly communicable having incubation period of 7-10 days. Transmission is primarily person-to- person via the faecal-oral route (from fecal matter taken into the mouth through contaminated food or fingers); i.e. the poliovirus multiplies in the intestines and is spread through the faeces. The virus is intermittently excreted for one month or more after infection. Communicability of infected children is highest just prior to the onset of paralysis and during the first two weeks after paralysis occurs. SECTOR : HEALTHCARE CENTRAL BOARD OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 111Protective immunity against poliovirus infection develops by immunization or natural infection. Polio usually begins with common symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, and muscle pains and spasms and is followed by a more serious and permanent paralysis in one or more limbs. More than half of all polio cases occur in children under the age of five. Between 5 and 10 percent of infected persons display only the most general symptoms while more than 90 percent show no sign of illness at all. Polio vaccine is highly effective in producing immunity to the poliovirus and protection from paralytic polio. Approximately 90 percent or more of polio vaccine recipients develop protective antibodies to all three poliovirus types after two doses, and at least 99 percent are immune following three doses. Dr. Albert Sabin developed Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). India launched the Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI) programme in 1995 as a result of the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative. All the children below 5 years of age irrespective of immunisation status. Key Components of Pulse Polio Immunization Programme Polio has been eradicated from most of the world using several key strategies. Each of the following strategies is important components in the National Polio Eradication Programme: (a) Routine Immunization: Sustaining high levels of coverage with 3 doses of oral polio vaccine in the 0-1 year age group. (b) Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs): Simultaneous administration of oral polio vaccine to all children in the age group of 0-5 years, 4-6 weeks apart to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission and to increase immunity amongst children. SIAs include: National Immunization Days (NIDs) when the entire country is covered Sub National Immunization Days (SNIDs) when some states or parts of states are covered. Mop-ups are conducted, as soon as possible after identification of the virus as an end game strategy to interrupt transmission.
