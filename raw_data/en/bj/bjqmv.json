Relaxation techniques such as [meditation](https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-breathing-brain-health/) and yoga are not just good for general well-being, but can also buffer some of the dangerous health effects of stress. According to study lead author Michelle Dossett of [UC Davis Health](https://health.ucdavis.edu/medicalcenter/), stress exacerbates anxiety and depression and plays a role in many conditions such as cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic pain. \"By reducing the body's stress response, mind-body practices can be a powerful adjunct in medicine by helping to decrease patients' symptoms and improving their quality of life,\" explained Dossett. She pointed out that mind-body practices can also reduce stress related to the COVID-19 epidemic. Study senior author Dr. Herbert Benson is the founder of the Benson-Henry Institute (BHI) for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Benson was one of the first Western physicians to bring spirituality and healing into medicine, and is well-known for his work with the Relaxation Response. \"The Relaxation Response is an inborn, anti-stress capacity that transcends the differences that separate mind from body, science from spirituality and one culture from another,\" Dr. Benson stated previously. At BHI, mind-body medicine is known as the third leg of a three-legged stool. The first leg is surgery, the second is treatment with pharmaceuticals, and the third is self-care. For the self-care approach, patients learn about health and fitness interventions such as exercise, nutrition, and mind-body medicine. \"Western medicine has produced revolutionary health benefits through advances in pharmacotherapies and procedures,\" wrote the researchers. \"It now faces enormous challenges in battling stress-related noncommunicable diseases.\" \"Chronic pain, often perpetuated by psychosocial stress, has become an epidemic that our pharmaceutical arsenal is poorly equipped to handle and medical costs continue to soar. Mind-body therapies can be a helpful adjunct in managing chronic pain and other stress-related noncommunicable diseases by fostering resilience through self-care.\" The research is published in the the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/). \u2014 By [Chrissy Sexton](http://csexton@earth.com), [Earth.com](https://www.earth.com/staff/) Staff Writer "}
