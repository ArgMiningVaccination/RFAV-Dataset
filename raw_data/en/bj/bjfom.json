Earlier today, in my previous blog post I gave instructions for Circle Casting. I have a little extra time on my hands today so thought it would be nice to have a list of herb, tree and flower correspondences available to view on our website. Below I have listed some of the most popular herbs used in Witchcraft but please feel free to comment on the blog post to ask me for any Plant kingdom correspondence you would like to know about, or even add your own. All of these plants have many more correspondences than I have listed, these are the ways in which our Coven uses them. You will also observe that many of the plants involved hold the same correspondences for certain things, this is why we blend herbs. I dont recommend that a beginner tries this this particular blend but for instance; mugwort, cedar, Wormswood, Dandelion Leaf and Amber would be ideal if you wished to perform a summoning or communicate with the afterlife. You would also utilise crystals and oils which correspond with your intention to accompany and amplify the power of your chosen plants. I will write further blog posts to include crystal, herb and oil correspondences over the coming weeks. Love and Light Leanne xx You can also find a wide selection of bagged Herbs, Roots & Flowers in my Earth Magick Category. You'll find all correspondences of each on the product pages.
