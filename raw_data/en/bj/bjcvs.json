AVERILL PARK, N.Y. , June 27, 2023 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Curriculum developer and faculty director Leonard Perlmutter (Ram Lev), and Jenness Cortez Perlmutter will present an important lecture on \"The Ancient Chakra System as a Diagnostic Tool\" at the American Meditation Institute's 12th annual Heart and Science of Yoga CME Conference 17-21, 2023 at the Equinox Resort and Spa in Manchester, Vermont. The presentation is a component of AMI's proprietary, comprehensive training in Yoga Science as Holistic Mind/Body Medicine, which was recently found in a peer-reviewed clinical study to reduce Burnout and Stress, is accredited by the American Medical Association for 34 CME credit hours, and will be offered simultaneously in-person and virtually on Zoom. Since 1996, Leonard and Jenness Perlmutter have taught courses on the Chakra system as holistic mind/body medicine. Their mission for the past 27 years has been to unite Eastern philosophy with Western medical science. The Perlmutters are direct disciples of Swami Rama of the Himalayasthe medical pioneer who, in 1970, under laboratory conditions at the Menninger Institute in Topeka, Kansas, demonstrated that blood pressure, heart rate and the autonomic nervous system can be voluntarily controlled. These research demonstrations have been one of the major cornerstones of the modern mind/body medicine movement. Commenting on the effectiveness of the Chakra system, Leonard Perlmutter states that, \"by employing the ancient Chakra system as a diagnostic tool in their own lives, physicians and other medical providers can experience less burnout, better health, more creativity and kinder work/home balance. By learning to employ their knowledge of Chakra psychology (subtle emotional/mental causes of stress), physicians will be able to diagnose and treat dis-ease with greater clarity and intuitive understanding.\" This \"Heart and Science of Yoga\" CME conference is dedicated to providing quality, comprehensive and evidence-based education. By design, it offers a broad curriculum of Yoga Science as mind/body medicine to relieve and prevent physician burnout. In addition to the lecture on the \"Chakra System as a Diagnostic Tool,\" topics at this year's conference will include instruction on AMI Meditation, Epigenetics, mantra science, yoga psychology, resiliency, mind function optimization, food as medicine, Ayurveda, easy-gentle yoga, lymph system detoxification, and a physician panel discussion which will share how other healthcare providers have successfully incorporated Yoga Science tools into their own medical practice and home life. The dedication, enthusiasm, and teaching methodology of the entire AMI faculty create a dynamic and interactive course for their students. Each faculty member is committed to the advancement and training of Yoga Science as holistic mind/body medicine.
