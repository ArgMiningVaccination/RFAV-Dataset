Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses and animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, the dose at which 50% of humans become infected is likely between 10 and 1,000 plaque -forming units (PFU). We need to know the infectious dose for huma ns by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection efforts. Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? ..................................................... 4 SARS- CoV-2 is passed easily between humans (R 0 = 2.2 -3.1, k = 0.2 -0.7), through close contact and aerosol transmission.38, 91, 265, 465 Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible193, 674 but rare.642 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others while asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic. Household transmission is rapid, but clusters from social settings are larger than those occurring in households.20 Super -spreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. Rates of transmission on public transit are unclear but appear low,251 but the US CDC recommends masks during travel.605 The role of children in disease transmission is not well -understood, but confirmed pedi atric cases in the US are increasing.15 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission,392 and most cases are not reported.327, 581, 611 Individuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID -19 are unlikely to be infectious.740 We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species to species? ........................................................ 5 SARS- CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.395, 408, 410 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.80 SARS- CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans. Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? ........................ 6 On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range of 2 -14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but c an still transmit disease. It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. We need to know the incubation duration and length of infec tivity in different patient populations. Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? .................................................................. 7 Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.10 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.500 Fever is most often the first symptom. Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection.94, 97, 367, 377, 384, 457, 483, 498, 632, 650 The case fatality rate is unknown, but individuals >60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.641, 763 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.464 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,177 though generally show milder128, 423 or no symptoms. We need to know the true case fatality rate, as well as the duration and prevalence of debilitating symptoms that inhibit an individual's ability to function. Protective Immunity - How long does the immune response provide protection from reinfection? ....................................... 8 Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.32, 712 Reinfection is possible. The longevity of antibody responses and T -cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several months. Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible, but the frequency of reinfection is unknown. The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown.475 Immune responses appear to differ by sex and age, and may contribute to differences in symptom severity . We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? ................... 9 Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of ac tive cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Confirmed cases are still underreported.287 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR -based diagnostic tests. Medical Treatments - Are there effective treatments? .........................................................................................................10 There is no universally effective treatment for COVID -19, but some treatments reduce disease severity and mortality. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 Remdesivir may reduce symptom duration in hospitalized patients, but there is no evidence that it reduces mortality. Hydroxychloroquine provides limited to no clinical benefit.213, 596 Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients, especially if given early.649 Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and appears to be effective when administ ered early, though evidence is mixed.519 Anticoagulants may reduce COVID -19 mortality in hospitalized patients. The benefits of tocilizumab are unclear. Other p harmaceutical interventions are being investigated but results from large clinical trials are needed. We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness. Vaccines - Are there effective vaccines? ...............................................................................................................................11 Work is ongoing to develop and produce a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine (e.g., Operation Warp Speed).65, 275, 280- 282, 480 Early results are being released, but evidence should be considered preliminary until larger Phase III trials are completed.711 Globally, there are 6 vaccine candidates that have received broad use approval or Emergency Use Authorization. We need published results from Phase I -III trials in humans to assess vaccine efficacy and safety, and length of immunity. Non- pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? .....................12 Broad -scale control measur es such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously. Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.220 Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.520 Due to the importance of superspreading events in COVID -19 transmission, particular focus should be placed on min imizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.719 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? .......................................................................13 SARS- CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity. Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS- CoV-2 transmission in humans. SARS- CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperat ure. There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food. We need to quantify the duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity on surfaces, not simply the presence of RN A. Decontamination - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? .........................................................14 Soap and wat er, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators488 and o ther PPE. We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? .....................................................................................................15 Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID - 19, eve n with recommended PPE. We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for a ttribution. ...............................................................................16 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? .................................................................................17 Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. At least one mutation has been associated with greater viral transmission, but virulence appears unchanged. A second SARS -CoV-2 variant is being assessed for its ability to evade the human immune system. Associations between human blood type and COVID -19 severity are unclear, but certain human genome regions are associated with more severe disease. We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients. Forecasting - What forecasting models and methods exist? ................................................................................................. 18 We need to know how different forecasting methods have fared when compared to real data and develop an understanding of which model features contribute most to accurate and inaccurate forecasts. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? What do we know? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. Based on experimental studies with humans exposed to other coronaviruses and animals exposed to SARS -CoV-2, the dose at which 50% of humans become infected is l ikely between 10 and 1,000 plaque -forming units ( PFU). The UK plans to conduct human exposure trials in January 2021 to identify the infectious dose of SARS -CoV-2.81 Non-human primates A total dose of approximately 700,000 plaque -forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS -CoV-2 infected macaques dose).574 Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical infections at doses of 4.75x1 06 PFU (delivered through several routes), while marmosets developed infections when exposed to 1x106 PFU intranasally.422 Rhesus macaques are effectively via the ocular conjunctival and intratracheal route of (106 TCID50).167 Rhesus macaques infected -CoV-2 the intranasal, intratracheal, oral and ocular routes combined recapitulate moderate human Rhesus ocular TCID50), resulting in mild infection; however, gastric inoculation did not result in infection (same dose), suggesting a limited role of gastric transmission. Interpretation is limited due to the small scale.166 African green monkeys replicate aspects of human disease, including severe pathological symptoms (exposed to 500,000 PFU via intranasal and intratracheal routes),725 mild clinical symptoms (aerosol exposures between 5,000 and 16,000 PFU),285 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with small particle aerosol exposure doses a s low as 2,000 PFU.78 Aerosol exposure of three primate species (African green monkeys, cynomolgus macaques, and rhesus macaques) via a Collison nebulizer resulted in mild clinical disease in all animals with doses between 28,700 and 48,600 PFU.329 Rhesus macaques have been suggested as the best non -human primate model of human CO VID-19.421 Rodents and other animal models Low-dose intranasal inoculation of ferrets (2,000 PFU) and Golden Syrian hamsters (1,800 PFU) with SARS -CoV-2 resulted in mild clinical symptoms, the production of infectious virus, and seroconversion.461 Golden Syrian hamsters exposed to 80,000 TCID50 (~56,000 PFU) via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms reminiscent of mild human infections (all hamsters infected). 610 In a separate study, immunosuppressed Golden Syrian hamsters showed severe clinical symptoms ( including death) after exposure to 100 -10,000 PFU via intranasal challenge.90 Golden Syrian hamsters infected with 100,000 PFU intranasally exhibited mild clinical symptoms and developed neutralizing antibodies,124 and were also capable of infecting individuals in separate cages. In another study, older hamsters had more severe symptoms and developed fewer neutralizing antibodies than younger hamsters.502 Mice genetically modified to express the human ACE2 receptor (transgenic hACE2 mice) were inoculated intr anasally TCID50 (~70,000 PFU), and all developed pathological symptoms consistent with COVID -19.59 Transgenic (hACE2) mice became infected afte r timed aerosol exposure (36 TCID50/minute) to between 900 and 1080 TCID50 (~630- 756 PFU). All mice (4/4) exposed for 25 -30 minutes became infected, while no mice (0/8) became infected after exposure for 0 -20 minutes (up to 720 TCID50, ~504 PFU).60 This paper has methodological caveats (e.g., particle size). Transgenic (hACE2) mice exposed intranasally to 400,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 develop typical human symptoms.630 Ferrets infected with 316,000 TCID50344 or 600,000 TCID50567 of SARS -CoV-2 by the intranasal route show similar symptoms to human disease.344, 567 Uninfected ferrets in direct contact with infected ferrets test positive and show disease as early as 2 days post -contac t.344 In one study, direct contact was required to transfer infection between ferrets,344 however, transmission without direct contact was found in another study.567 In a separate ferret study, 1 in 6 individuals exposed to 102 PFU via the intranasal route became infected, while 12 out of 12 individuals exposed to >104 PFU became infected.584 Domestic cats exposed to 100,000 PFU of SARS -CoV-2 via the intranasal route developed severe pathological symptoms including lesions in the nose, throat, and lungs.608 Even without symptoms, cats were able to transmit to other cats.82 Related Coronaviruses Humans exposed intranasally to ~70 PFU TCID 50 (~7 PFU).86, 474 The inhalation infectious dose of seasonal coronavirus 229E is unknown in humans. The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS -CoV-1) in mice is estimated to be between 67-540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).158, 161 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) between 100 - 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in severe syndromes.25, 144, 389, 759 What do we need to know? We need to know the infectious dose for humans by all possible exposure routes in order to inform models, develop diagnostics and countermeasures, and inform disinfection eff orts. Human infectious dose by aerosol, surface contact (fomite), fecal -oral routes, and other potential routes of exposure Most appropriate animal model(s) to estimate the human infectious dose for SARS -CoV-2 Does exposure dose determine disease severity? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans (R 0 = 2.2 -3.1, k = 0.2-0.7), through close contact and aerosol transmission.38, 91, 265, 465 Vertical transmission from mother to fetus is possible193, 675 but rare.643 As of 11 /10/2020 , pandemic COVID -19 has caused at least 50,913,451 infections and 1,263,089 deaths globally.324 In the US, there have been 10,110,552 confirmed COVID -19 cases and 238,251 confirmed deaths ,324 though both cases35 and fatalities are underesti mate s.493, 724 Estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1 .431, 512, 571, 733, 758 The US CDC and WHO acknowledge that SARS -CoV-2 can spread via aerosol or \"airborne\" transmission beyond 6 ft in certain situations717 such as enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation.113 The CDC advises that most SARS -CoV-2 transmission is spread by larger respiratory droplets, not by small -particle aerosols ,113 though the distinction is loose.694 Infectious virus aerosols have been found at varying concentrations (6 to 74 TCID 50/L381 or 9 to 219 RNA copies/m3 766). The US CDC defines \"close contact\" as a combined total of 15 minutes within 6 feet of a n infected person in a 24 -hour period , regardless of whether either person was wearing a mask (e.g., cloth face covering , KN95 or N95 respirator ).111 Exhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per person per hour;428 the amount of infectious v irus remains unknown. The risk of infection from fomites is believed to be low, though estimating contact hazard risk from estimated genome copies on surfaces (e.g., 2.5 -105 copies/cm2) is subject to considerable uncertainty.286 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others while asymptomatic or pre -symptomatic. Individuals may be infectious for 1 -3 days prior to symptom onset.48, 700 Pre-symptomatic79, 350, 618, 627, 738, 762 or asymptomatic56, 302, 427 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2.416 At least 12% of all cases are estimated to be due to asymptomatic transmission.181 Approximately 40%561 (between 15 -56%) of i nfections may be caused by pre -symptomatic transmission.103, 290, 413, 757 Individuals are most infectious before symptoms begin and within 5 days of symptom onset.130 Asymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection.626 There is some evidence that asymptomatic individuals transmit SARS -CoV-2 less often than symptomatic individuals ,94, 637 and a symptomatic children may have substantially lower levels of virus in their upper respiratory tracts than symptomatic children.347 Household transmission is rapid, but clusters from social settings are larger than those occurring in households.20 Meta -analysis indicates that approximately 18% of household contacts of infected index patients acquire SARS -CoV-2 (i.e., the \"attack rate\"), with higher attack rates for symptomatic index cases, spouses of index cases, and adults.348 In the US, symptomatic index cases res ulted in transmission to approximately 53% of household members, regardless of index patient age.263 This is higher than prior estimates,348 likely due to intense follow -up reporting .263 75% of household infections occurred within 5 days of illness onset in the index case.263 Attack rates are lower for non -household contacts.476 SARS- CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation14, 387, 591, 619 in indoor areas such as restaurants ;397 positive SARS - CoV-2 patients were twice a s likely as negative patients to report that they had recently eaten in restaurants.221 Clusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings,380, 513 including bars, restaurants, and music festivals.749 Superspreading events (SSEs) appear common in SARS -CoV-2 transmission and may be crucial for controlling spread. The majority of new infections come from relatively few infectious individuals (overdispersion parameter k = 0.2 -0.5),19, 188, 374, 378, 686 though estimates vary.288 Phylogenetics shows the importance of SSEs early in the COVID -19 outbreak.686 Rates of transmission on public trans it a re unclear but appear low ,251 but the US CDC recommends masks during travel.606 Several studies have identified plausible transmission on airplanes .55, 137, 293, 340, 470 Fluorescent tracer research on commercial airplanes suggests a low risk of aerosol or surface transmission durin g flights, though key parameters (emission rate, infectious dose) remain uncertain.611 Testing for this study assumed that mask wearing is continuous, the number of infected passengers is low, and passengers only face forward. The testing did not consider passenger movement, passenger conversations, or infected flight attendants.611 On trains in China, transmission rates were high for those in the same row as an infectious individual (1.5 -3.5% attack rate), though low for non -neighboring passengers.299 Outbreaks have also occurred on public buses.426 The role of children in disease transmission is not well- understood, but confirmed pediatric cases in the US are increasing .15 A large meta -analysis estimates that children are 44% less susceptible to COVID -19 than adults,673 though modeling suggests that susceptibility does not differ substantially by age.494 During April to May 2020 in the US, adults who worked in childcare centers acquired COVID -19 at rates similar to those without childcare exposure.247 Adults in the UK living with children did not have elevated risk of COVID -19 infection,230 though schools were closed for much of this time period (February -August) .2 Extensive contact tracing in India suggests that children readily transmit SARS -CoV-2 to other children.378 In a Georgia summer camp, 260 of 344 tested attendees (campers and staff) tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 RNA.632 Undetected cases play a major role in transmission,392 and most cases are not reported.327, 581, 612 Individuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID -19 are unlikely to be infectious.741 What do we need to know? We need to know the relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets). How common is transmission from bodily fluids like semen,388 urine,628 and feces?663 How infectious are young children compared to adults? What is the emission rate of infectious SARS -CoV-2 particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising, taking into account variation in viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 5 Host Range - How many species does it i nfect? Can it transfer from species to species? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before infecting humans, but the presence or identity of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown.395, 408, 410 Current evidence suggests a direct jump from bats to humans is plausible.80 Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS -CoV-1,767 with a suggested bat origin.146, 767 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,117 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associated with the sea food market.66, 147, 736, 748 Viruses similar to SARS -CoV-2 were present in pangolin samples collected several years ago,366 and pangolins positive for coronaviruses related to SARS -CoV-2 exhibited clinical symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.394 However, a survey of 334 pangolins did not identify coronavirus nucleic acid in 'upstream' market chain samples, suggesting that positive samples from pangolins may be the result of exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. Thes e data suggest that pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses.383 SARS -CoV-2 uses t he same receptor for cell entry as the SARS -CoV-1 coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments show that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor- binding domain binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS- CoV-1,728 potentially explaining its high transmissibility. Changes in proteolytic cleavage of the Spike protein can also affect cell entry and animal host range, in addition to receptor binding.448 Modeling suggests a wide range of animal hosts for SARS -CoV-2, though experimental studies are still needed.154 Animals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans. Infected mink have been linked to human infections in workers at mink farms.504 Several animal species are susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 infection. Animal model studies suggest that Golden Syrian hamsters, and ferrets are susceptible to infection.124, 344 In the Netherlands, farmed mink deve loped breathing and gastrointestinal issues, which was diagnosed as SARS -CoV-2 infection.1 Golden Syrian hamsters are able to infect other hamsters via direct contact and close quarters aerosol transmission.610 Several non -human primates are also susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 including cynomolgus macaques,574 African green monkeys,725 and Rhesus macaques.422 Raccoon dogs (mammals related to foxes) are susceptible to COVID -19 (105 intranasal exposure dose) and were shown to transmit infection to other raccoon dogs in neighboring enclosures.233 Domestic cats are susceptible to infection with SARS -CoV-2 (100,000 -520,000 PFU via the intranasal route608 or a combination of routes273), an d can transmit the virus to other cats via droplet or short -distance aerosol.608 Wild cats (tigers and lions)698 can be infected with SARS -CoV-2, although their ability to spread to humans is unknown.433, 754 Studies have confirmed that human keepers transmitted SARS -CoV-2 to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo.64 Two cases of SARS- CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in pet domestic cats.108 Deer mice can be experimentally infected with SARS -CoV-2 via intranasal exposure (104 or 105 TCID50)194 and are able to transmit virus to uninfected deer mice through direct contact.260 Their capacity as a reservoir species is unknown. Ducks, chickens, and pigs remained uninfected after experimental SARS -CoV-2 exposure (30,000 CFU for ducks and chickens608, 100,000 PFU for pigs608, for pigs all intranasal route).608 When pigs were inoculated by the oronasal route (106 PFU), minimal to no signs of clinical disease were noted, suggesting limited transmission concerns.530 Chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and geese were not susceptible to SARS -CoV-2 after experimental exposures.625 Rabbits do not exhibit clinical symptoms after exposure to SARS -CoV-2, but do seroconvert.471 Cattle exposed to SARS -CoV-2 showed no clinical disease but exhibited low levels of viral shedding in the nose, which could be residual virus from the exposure dose.658 Dogs exposed to SARS -CoV-2 produced anti -SARS -CoV-2 antibodies83 but exhibited no clinical symptoms.608, 616 What do we need to know? We need to know the best animal model for replicating human infection by various exposure routes. What is the intermediate host(s) (if any)? Which animal species can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to humans? Can SARS -CoV-2 circulate in animal reservoir populations, potentially leading to future spillover events?

Are people infectious during this time? What do we know? On average, symptoms develop 5 days after exposure with a range o f 2-14 days. Incubating individuals can transmit disease for several days before symptom onset. Some individuals never develop symptoms but can still transmit disease. By general consensus, the incubation period of COVID -19 is between 5375 and 6701 days.742 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.375 However, more recent estimates using different models calculate a longer incubation period, between 7 and 8 days.541 This could mean that 5 -10% of individuals undergoing a 14 - day quarantine are still infectious at the end.541 There is evidence that younger (<14) and older (>75) individuals have longer COVID -19 incubation periods, creating a U - shaped relationship between incubation period length and patient age351 while adolescent and young adult populations (15 - 24 years old) have been estimated at ~2 days.400 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 even if they lack clinical sympto ms.56, 123, 266, 642, 762 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic,114, 578, 642, 762 and asymptomatic and pre -symptomatic individuals have similar amounts of virus in the nose and throat compared to symptoma tic patients.48, 342, 772 Peak infectiousness may be during the incubation period, one day before symptoms develop.290 Infectious virus has been cultured in patients up to 6 days before the development of symptoms.48 It is estimated that most individuals are no longer infectious beyond 10 days after symptom onset. While the amount of virus needed to infect another individual is unknown, mild -moderate COVID -19 cases appear to be infectious for no longer than 10 days after symptom onset, while severely ill or immunocompromised patients may be infectious for 20 -7052 days after symptom onset; individuals can also transmit infection before symptoms appear.680 Asymptomatic individuals are estimated to be infectious for a median of 9.5 days.300 The average time between symptom onset in successive cases (i.e., the serial interval) is approximately 5 days. On average, there are approximately 4181 to 7.5390 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain (i.e., the serial interval). Based on data from 339 transmission chains in China and additional meta -analysis, the mean serial interval is between 4.4 and 6.0 days.180, 546, 742 The serial interval of COVID -19 has declined substantially over time as a result of increased case isolation,30 meaning individuals tend to transmit virus for less time. Individuals can shed virus for several weeks, though it is not necessarily infectious. Children are estimated to shed virus for 15 days on average, with asymptomatic individuals shedding virus for less time (11 days) than symptomatic individuals (17 days).425 Asymptomatic and mildly ill patients who test positive for SARS -CoV-2 take l ess time to test negative than severely ill patients.384 Patients infected by asymptomatic or young (<20 years old) individuals may take longer to develop symptoms than those infected by other groups of individuals.701 Viral RNA loads in the upper respiratory tract tend to peak within a few days of symptom onset and become undetectable approximately two weeks after symp toms begin.679 The duration of the infectious period is unknown,679 though patients can test positive for SARS -CoV-2 viral RNA for extended periods of time, particularly in stool samples.679 Patients being released from the hospital may still exhale detectab le levels of SARS -CoV-2 RNA (~7,000 genome copies per hour), though the infectivity of these patients is unknown.766 What do we need to know? We need to know the incubation duration and length of infectivity in different patient populations. What is the average infectious period during which individuals can transmit the disease? How soon can asymptomatic patients transmit infection after exposure? Does the incubation period correlate with disease severity or exposure dose?

What do we know? Most symptomatic cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group.10 Older individuals and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death, as are men.500 Fever is most often the first symptom. COVID -19 generally begins with fever, then cough and malaise, with gastrointestinal symptoms developing later.369 In 49 children with COVID -19 (0 -22 years), however, only 51% developed fever.746 Temperature- only screening may miss active infections, as only 20% of emergency department patients testing positive for COVID -19 had fevers >100\u00b0 F.672 Most cases).642, 718 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9%, only 44 -52% present with fever initially),46, 266 cough (67.7%),266 fatigue, shortness of breath, and headache .115, 127, 301 Initial cough without fever may precede mild/moderate illness.398 Chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell120, 520, 739 are also possible COVID -19 symptoms.115 GI symptoms are present in approximately 9% of patients.576 Neurological symptoms are observed in up to 82% of individu als hospitalized with COVID -19.404 Headaches are common, may persist for several weeks, and may be associated with shorter overall disease duration.102 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients are classified as severe,266, 642 and approximately 5% of patients are admitted to the ICU.266, 642 Higher SARS -CoV-2 RNA loads on admission have been associated with greater risk of death.429, 708 SARS- CoV-2 may attack blood vessels in the lung,96 leading to clotting complications and ARDS.18, 666 Clotting affects multiple organs550 and is present in 15 -27% of cases.424 Other comp lications include pneumonia,508 kidney pancreatitis,33 arrhythmia, sepsis, stroke (1.6% of hospitalized complications ,660 and shock.266, 301, 682, 764 COVID -19 may increase stroke complications.526 COVID -19 symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath commonly persist for weeks641 to months101 after initial onset. Most (88%) individuals infected with COVID -19 (n=86) showed evidence of lung damage six weeks after clinical recovery.267 This presentation may be distinct from acute COVID -19, and has been tentatively termed chronic COVID syndrome.57 COVID -19 associated hyperinflammatory syndrome can lead to increased disease severity and mortality .699 Adults can also experience a multisystem inflammatory response (MIS -A) similar to that seen in children.468 Critically ill patients have consistently high viral loads in blood samples , indicating an inability to clear the virus.129 Approximately 9% of hospitalized patients experience at least 1 hospital readmission (from any cause) within 2 months of COVID -19 recovery, with individuals over 65 showing slightly higher odds of readm ission.376 Between 16% and 76% of cases are asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection.94, 97, 367, 377, 384, 457, 483, 498, 633, 651 The case fatality rate is unknown, but individuals > 60 and those with comorbidities are at elevated risk of death.642, 764 Cardiovascular disease, obesity,21, 528 hypertension,752 diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.642, 764 The CFR increases with age (data from China and Italy): 0 -19 years < 0.2%; 20 -29 years = 0 -0.2%, 30- 39 years = 0.2 -0.3%, 40- 49 years = 0.4%, 50 -59 years 1.0 -1.3%, 60- 69 years = 3.5 -3.6%, 70- 79 years = 8.0 -12.8%, >80 years = 14.8- 20.2%.496 In Iceland, the overall case fatality rate has been estimated at 0.3 -0.6% but increases to ~4% in those over 70 years old.268 An estimated overall infection fatality rate for Indiana was calculated as 0.26%, increasing to 1.71% for those >65 years old .77 Smoking appears to be statistically associated with a higher likelihood of COVID -19 progressing to more severe disease.517 Minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID -19.464 Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic populations acquire SARS -CoV-2 infection at higher rates than other groups225, 258, 507, 538 and are hospit alized241, 540 and die disproportionately.295, 451 Hispanic and Black COVID -19 patients tend to die at younger ages than white patients.727 Hispanic , Black , and American Indian childre n account for 78% of US pediatri c deaths (n=121).76 Social vulnerability, particularly in non -urban areas, is associated with greater SARS -CoV-2 transmission risk.155 P regnant women with COVID -19 appear to require ICU care more often than non -pregnant women,533 have higher rates of preterm delivery ,723 and are less likely to present with fever and myalgia.31 Severity in pregnant women may be associated with underlying conditions such as obesity ,31 and symptom severity may be predicted early.459 Preterm births are more likely in symptomatic patients.163 Approximately 25% of pregnant COVID -19 patients had symptoms for at least 8 weeks.23 Children are susceptible to COVID -19,177 though generally show milder128, 423 or no symptoms. Between 21-28% of children (<19 years old) may be asymptomatic.423, 515, 542 Most symptomatic children present with mild or moderate symptoms,257, 515 with few exhibiting severe or clinical illness.732 In the US, 33% of children hospitalized with COVID -19 required ICU care, though the case fatality rate was low (1.8%).341 Severe symptoms in children412 and infants93, 423 are possible, and more likely in those with complex medical histories.604 WHO716 and US CDC323 have issued definitions for a rare condition in children (Pediatric Multi- System Inflammatory Syndrome, MIS -C)249 linked to COVID -19 infection.572 The prevalence of this condition is unknown. Children with both severe and moderate initial symptoms can progress to MIS -C,248 though it may be more likely to be preceded by fever.746 What do we need to know? We need to know the true case fatality rate, as well as the duration and prevalence of debilitating symptoms that inhibit an individual's ability to function. How does the asymptomatic fraction vary across age groups? How long, on average, are affected individuals unable to perform normal jobs and responsibilities?

What do we know? Infected patients show productive immune responses, but the duration of any protection is unknown.32, 713 Reinfection is possible. The longevity of antibody responses and T -cell responses is unknown but appears to be at least several months. Researchers have found SARS -CoV-2 antibodies circulating in patients for 3 -6 months after infection.211, 268, 573, 575 Mild COVID -19 infections can induce detectable immune responses for at least 3 months .575 Antibody levels increas e with disease severit y648 and are largely unaffected by patient age.211 A UK study found evidence of antibody levels waning after 4 -6 months, though the study looked at population- level seroprevalence and not individual antibody levels.697 Neutralizing antibody responses are present within 8 -19 days after symptom onset415, 631 and can persist for months.678 Individuals with more severe infections developed higher neutralizing a ntibody levels that persisted longer than those with asymptomatic or mild infections.597 The antibody IgM appears to contribute substantially to SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing ability, with IgG also contributing to a lesser extent.243 Asymptomatic cases generate weaker antibody responses to SARS -CoV-2.136 Specific components of the immune response, such as the release of IgG, may stimulate clotting factors that affect severity.774 Some patients do not develop detectable antibody responses,638, 730 and their future protection is unknown. A small study (n=4) identified that children (<3 years) can seroconvert after asymptomatic infection, but level of protection is unknown.336 SARS- CoV-2 specific memory B cells are involved in the human immune response, and provide evidence of B cell -mediated immunity after mild -moderate COVID -19 infection.490 T-cell responses may persist for at least 6 months, though they appear stronger in individuals with more severe COVID -19 cases.773 While memory B and T cells both persist for at least 6 months, there is some vari ability in the persistence of specific antibodies (e.g., IgG vs. IgA). 236, 607 In a 35 -year study of 10 men, reinfection with seasonal coronaviruses occurred 1- 3 years after initial infection.185 Previous studies on coronavirus immunity suggest that neutralizing antibodies may wane after several years.98, 734 Reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 is possible, but the frequency of reinfection is unknown. Researchers in Hong Kong356 and the US647 have identified COVID -19 reinfections. Reinfections have been either less356 or more severe647 than the initial infection. The infectiousness of re-infected individuals is unknown. Two studies suggest limited reinfection potential in macaques, with re -challenge 28 days168 or 35 days126 after initial exposure resulting in no clinical symptoms. Ferrets infected with 102-104 PFU were protected from acute lung injury following secondary challenge with SARS -CoV-2 28 days after initial exposure, but they did exhibit clinical symptoms.584 The contribution of historical coronavirus exposure to SARS -CoV-2 immunity is unknown.475 Cross -reactivity in T -cell responses between other human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 may explain some variation in symptom severity among patients.436 Key components of the human immune response (memory B cells) are activated by SARS- CoV-2, and may persist for decades to offset any waning antibody immunity.478 Cross -reactivity from seasonal coronavirus es also enhances the immune response toward the S2 unit of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.478 Two studies identified key components of the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells) in the majority of recovered COVID -19 patients, and these cells reacted to SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein.88, 262 These studies also identified Spike protein responses in CD4+ T cells of ~30 -40% of unexposed patients,262 suggesting some cross -reactivity between other circulating human coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2.88, 262 Long -lasting T -cell responses have been seen in SARS -CoV-1 patients, and T -cell cross - reactivity between other coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 suggest additional immune protection.379 Children do not appear to be protected from SARS -CoV-2 infection by historical exposure to seasonal coronaviruses.598 Serum from patients exposed to seasonal coronaviruses did not neutralize SARS -CoV-2,537 though there has been some cross -reactivity between seasonal coronaviruses and SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.653 Immune responses appear to differ by sex and age , and may contribute to differences in symptom severity. The immune responses of females differ s from males, namely through a stronger T -cell response and lower levels of some inflammatory cytokines .635 Additionally, antibody levels may differ between males and females, supporting the notion that greater inflammatory responses in males contribute to their elevated disease severity.356 S ymptom severity in adults does not appear to be due to a lack of an adaptive immune response; rather, early action of the innate immune response may affect disease severity in both adult and pediatric/adolescent cases.531 Children and adults have different immunologi cal responses to SARS -CoV-2; adults with more severe symptoms develop stronger neutralizing antibody responses than those with milder symptoms, and this severity -dependence is not observed in children.703 Additionally, children do not develop robust antibody (IgG) responses to the SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein.703 What do we need to know? We need to know the frequency and severity of reinfection, as well as the protective effects of immune components. How do different components of the immune response contribute to long -term protection? How does initial disease severity affect the type, magnitude, and timing of any protective immune respon se? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 9 Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? What do we know? Diagnosis of COVID -19 is based on symptoms consistent with COVID -19, PCR -based testing of active cases, and/or the presence of SARS -CoV-2 antibodies in individuals. Confirmed cases are still underreported.287 The US CDC recommends that anyone, including those without symptoms, who has been in contact with a positive COVID -19 case should be tested (as of 9/18/2020).121 The CDC advises that recovered patients need not be tested for SARS -COV -2 again within 3 months of recovery unless symptoms re -develop; this advice does not imply protection from re -infection.116 The timing of diagnostic PCR tests impacts results. The false -negative rate for RT -PCR tests is lowest between 7 and 9 days after exposure, and PCR tests are more likely to give false -negative results before symptoms begin (within 4 days of exposure) and more than 14 days after exposure.361 Low viral loads can lead to false negative RT -PCR tests,407 and viral loads are lower in late stage infections as well as at the end of a given day. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective diagnostically than sp utum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,689 although evidence is mixed.719 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may increase the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.760 Assays targeting antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) instead of the Spike protein (S) of SARS -CoV-2 may improve detection.95 Exhaled breath condensate may be an effective supplement to nasopharyngeal swab -based PCR ,583 and other work examining breath -based samplers is ongoing.601 Diagnostic test re sults from at -home, mid -nasal swabs were comparable to clinician -conducted nasopharyngeal swabs, though false -negatives were observed in individuals with low viral titer.439 Foam swabs lead to more accurate diagnostic tests than polyester swabs for collecting patient samples, though polyester swabs are good enough to be used in case of a shortage in foam swabs.284 Asymptomatic individuals have a higher likelihood of testing negative for a specific antibody (IgG) compared to symptomatic patients, potentially due to lower viral loads (as measured by RT -PCR). 706 Tests from the US CDC are available to states.106, 114 Rapid test kits have been produced by universities and industry.70, 74, 153, 203, 670 The CRISPR -Cas12a system is being used to develop fluorescence -based COVID -19 diagnostic tests.175, 304, 687 India has approved a rapid CRISPR -based test paper capable of accurate results within an hour of nasopharyngeal swab.5 Low-sensitivity tests (like lateral flow assays) may be beneficial despite lower accuracy, because they reduce the time necessary to identify and subsequently contain potential outbreaks.452 Immunological indicators53, 187, 232, 240, 289, 303, 532, 629, 751 fasting blood glucose levels ,688 and oxygen levels346 can identify future severe cases,138 and decision -support tools for diagnosing severe infections exist .440, 614, 731 As of 20 October , the FDA has approved 281 tests under EUAs, including 219 molecular, 56 antibody, and 6 antigen tests.228 The FDA recently authorized the first test detecting neutralizing antibodies from prior SARS -CoV-2 infection.195 Pooling samples and conducting RT -PCR tests may expand testing capability.454 Detection dogs are being used at airports to recommend individuals for subsequent SARS -CoV-2 PCR testing.539 High -throughput diagnostic platforms based on loop- mediated isothermal amplification (LamPORE) are comparable in sensitivity and specificity to PCR, and may increase sampling speed.527 A high- throughput diagnostic assay for screening asymptomatic individuals has received US Emergency Use Authorization.84, 229 Infrared temperature readings may be misleading when used at the entrance of buildings with low outdoor temperatures.184 Artificial intelligence is being used to differentiate COVID -19 from other respiratory ailments via patient coughs.364 Validated serological (antibody) assays are being used to help determine who has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2. Repeated serological testing is necessary to identify asymptomatic536 and other undetected patients.588 Exclusively testing symptomatic healthcare workers is likely to exclude a large fraction of COVID -19 positive personnel.623 Research has shown h igh variability in the ability of tests (ELISA492 and lateral flow assays) by different manufacturers to accurately detect positive and negative cases .371, 709 The FDA has excluded several dozen serological diagnostic assays base d on failure to conform to updated regulatory requirements.201 Meta -analysis suggests that lateral flow assays (LFIA) are less accurate than ELISA or chemiluminescent methods (CLIA), but that the target of serological studies (e.g., IgG or IgM) does not affect accuracy.405 Serological assay false positive rates may account for a substantial portion of reported exposures.69 The Infectious Disease Society of America advises against using serology to determine exposure within two weeks of symptom onset.277 SARS- CoV-2 RNA is likely to persist long enough in untreated wastewater to permit reliable detection for COVID -19 surveillance ,26 and can warn of SARS -CoV-2 cases ahead of positive PCR tests and hospital admissions.521 Wastewater sampling for SARS -CoV-2 should use ultrafiltration methods, rather than adsorption -extraction techniques.320 A s of July 2020, approximately 9% of the US population had serological evidence of SARS -CoV-2 exposure, with proportions varying substantially across different locations (e.g., 33.6% in New York, 3.8% in California).35 What do we need to know? We need to identify additional factors that affect the accuracy of serological or PCR- based diagnostic tests. How long do antibody targets of serological assays persist, and after what point are they not informative for prevalence? What is the relationship between disease severity and the timing of positive serological assays?

What do we know? There is no universally effective treatment for COVID -19, but some treatments reduce disease severity and mortality. There is some evidence that earlier intubation of COVID -19 patients reduces mortality,307 but results are mixed.437 Remdesivir may reduce symptom duration in hospitalized patients, but there is no evidence that it reduces mortality. Remdesivir may reduce the duration of symptoms in infected individuals, from 15 days to 10 days on average.68 The US FDA has approved the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients 12 years and older,206 with an Emergency Use Authorization for other patient groups.197, 481 Remdesivir with anti -coronavirus immunoglobulin (ITAC) is being investigated in clinical trial.482 A large clinical trial (SOLIDARITY, n=2,750 treated patients) found no benefit of remdesivir for patient mortality, regardles s of ventilation status or treatment severity.509 An abbreviated clinical trial of remdesivir (n=237) found no significant benefits.695 Hydroxychloroquine provides limited to no clinical benefit.213, 596 Hydroxychloroquine does not prevent infection as either pre -17, 245, 547 or post -exposure prophylaxis,85, 455 does not benefit mild -moderat e COVID -19 cases,105 was associated with adverse cardiac events in severely ill patients,338 does not reduce mortality,3 and increases mortality when combined with azithromycin.213 The FDA revoked its EUA on 6/15/20.196 Corticosteroids may significantly reduce mortality in severely ill and ventilated patients, especially if given early.650 Dexamethasone is associated with substantial reductions in mortality for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, smaller benefits for those receiving supplemental oxygen,297 and no benefits in patients who did not need oxygen or ventilation.297 A large meta -analysis found that 28 -day mortality in critically ill patients was reduced in patients (n=678) who received systemic corticosteroids.622 Four separate, smaller trials of corticosteroids (n<152) were stopped early.41, 170, 391, 649 The benefits of glucocorticoids may depend heavily on patient inflammation.337 In several studies, high doses of steroids have been associated with elevated mortality .406, 462 Convalescent plasma treatment is safe and appears to be effective when administered early, though evidence is mixed.519 A large trial of plasma therapy (>25,000 patients) shows that treatment is safe, with some evidence that it can reduce 7 -day mortality.308, 331 Plasma therapy shows larger reductions in mortality when administered within 4 4 hours of hospital admission,587 and donor plasma with higher antibody levels appears more effective.332, 434, 551 On 8/24/2020, the US FDA approved an Emergency Use Authorization for convalescent plasma therapy.207 Anticoagulants may reduce COVID -19 mortality in hospitalized patients. Both therapeutic and prophylactic use of anticoagulants has been associated with significant (~50%) reduction in mortality in hospitalized COVID -19 patients.472 Anticoagulant use was associated with lower mortality in the severely ill,511 but the correct dose is critical to avoid complications.316 A small Phase II clinical trial found that enoxaparin significantly reduced the need f or mechanical ventilation when used therapeutically.385 The benefits of tocilizumab are unclear. While tocilizumab appears to show a 12% reduction in mortality in treated patients,432 a randomized clinical trial found no effects on mortality,291 and other evidence suggests that it may be beneficial only in certain circumstances.292, 460, 473 Other pharmaceutical interventions are being investigated but results from large clinical trials are needed. Eli Lilly has received Emergency Use Authorization from the U S FDA for its monoclonal antibody product , bamlanivimab , for use in recently COVID -19 patients.402 Regeneron's REGN -COV2 monoclonal antibody has been associated with reductions in symptom duration.557 However, preliminary data from both Eli Lilly and Regeneron suggest that their monoclo nal antibody treatments may not work well for hospitalized patients403 or those with high oxygen requirements.555 Regeneron ha s applied for Emergency Use Authorization for its therapy .556 Other antibody products are being tested in humans and appear safe ,676 including CT -P59 from Celltrion, which reduced patient recovery time.119 Several interferon -based treatments show promise, including interferon beta -1b,305, 545 interferon beta -1a,157 interferon alpha -2b,524 and interferon kappa,234 though results from the SOLIDARITY trial found no benefit of interferon beta -1a.509 There is no clinical benefit from combination r itonavir/lopinavir.100, 239, 261, 399 Anakinra has shown clinical benefits in small observational studies.104, 141 Favipiravir may reduce the duration of clinical symptoms176 and reduce the time for viral clearance.235 Bromhexine may reduce rates of mechanical ventilation and mortality.44 Bradykinin inhibitors are being investigated as COVID -19 treatments,661 due to the potential role of bradykinins in disease.242 Early administration of high dose (>15 g/day) intravenous immunoglobulin (n=174) reduced time.602 Statins435, 585 and RAAS inhibitors692 (for hypertension) do not appear to elevate COVID -19 risk. Vitamin D (with vitamin B12 and magnesium) may reduce the need for ventilation in COVID -19 patients (n=17) .636 Elderly COVID -19 patients who had taken vitamin D supplements in the year before infection showed less severe symptoms.43 Acalabrutinib may improve patient oxygenation,577 and is being included in large clinical trials (SOLIDARITY).363 Colchicine may reduce rates of intubation and mortality.589 A ndrogen levels have been suggested as a factor in disease severity in men,255, 463, 681 and treatment options are in trial.256, 438 What do we need to know? We need clear, randomized trials for treatment efficacy in patients with both severe and mild/moderate illness.

CanSino's Ad5 -nCoV vaccine has been approved for use in the Chinese military,620 Gamelaya9 and the Vector Institute143 have been given conditional approval in Russia, SinoVac's CoronaVac candidate has been approved in China for limited emergency use,11 and two of Sinopharm's vaccine candidates have been approved for use in the United Arab Emirates.165 A retrospective review found no evidence that prior influenza vaccination negatively impacts COVID -19 progression.565 The US FDA has guidance for vaccine sponsors regarding the data needed to support Emergency Use Authorization.202 In the US, vaccines must achieve 50% efficacy (e.g. reduction of viral shedding, risk of illness) for 6 months for approval.198 What do we need to know? We need published results from Phase I -III trials in humans to assess vaccine efficacy and safety, and length of immunity. Safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates in humans, particularly from Phase III trials .REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 12 Non -pharmaceutical Intervention s (NPIs) - Are public health control measures effective at reducing spread? What do we know? Broad- scale control measures such as stay -at-home orders and widespread face mask use effectively reduce transmission and are more impactful when implemented simultaneously. Public health notifications increase adherence to policies.220 Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong151 and reduced spread throughout China,357, 360, 365, 419, 430, 685 Europe,244, 335 and the US.354 In China, modeling suggests that a one -day delay in implementing control measures increased the time needed to curtail an outbreak by 2.4 days.179 In the US, each day of delay in emergency declarations and school closures was associated with a 5 -6% increase in mortality.745 Reductions in transmission are generally visible 6 -9 days after the impleme ntation of NPIs, and increased transmission is generally visible 14-20 days after NPIs are lifted.396 US counties with mask mandates have lower case growth rates than neighboring counties lacking mask mandates.600 Modeling suggests that widespread use of facemasks is effective at reducing transmission477 even when individual mask efficiency is low,186 though their benefits are maximized when most of the population wears masks.222 In the US, shelter -in-place orders (SIPOs) and restaurant and bar closures were associated with large reductions in exponential growth rate of cases.148 School closures and cancellation of large gatherings had smaller effects.148 Similarly, researchers found that a larger number of public health interventions in place was strongly associated with lower COVID -19 growth rates in the next week.333 Adherence t o social distancing policies depends on income.702 Telework policies may reduce new cases, as adults who regularly worked in offices were at hig her infection risk.216 Mobility223, 370 and physical contact rates322 decline after public health control measures are implemented. Mobility reductions in the US have been associated with significant reductions in COVID -19 case growth.54, 283 Social distancing and reductions in both non -essential visits to stores and overall movement distance led to lower transmission rates.467 A combination of school closures, work restrictions, and other measures are likely required to effectively limit transmission.210, 352 School closures alone appear insufficient ,318, 365 though likely reduced mortality in the UK566 and the US.51 Adolescents and young adults (15 -24) may require different messaging to improve adherence to NPIs and public health policies ,270 and self-reported adherence to NPI policies (e.g., mask use) is consistently low in 18 - to 29 -year -olds.306 In the US, limiting transmission in younger populations is crucial for reducing hospitalizations and mortality in older cohorts .501 Individual behaviors (e.g., face masks, social distancing ) have been associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection.520 Always wearing masks, maintaining physical distance >1m, and frequently washing hands were all associated with reduced risk of COVID -19 infection in individuals who had direct contact with infected individuals. 178 Particle physics model ing suggests that 2m physical distancing is generally sufficient for reduction of SARS -CoV-2 aerosols expressed during coughs, though smaller particles can travel farther, and wind direction and speed may play a role.296 In the US , face mask use has been more common in sub - and urban areas, in women, and in older individuals .272 Due to the importance of superspreading events in COVID -19 transmission, particular focus should be placed on minimizing large gatherings where superspreading events are more likely.720 Retrospective contact tracing may help identify the source of large clus ters of cases, and should be implemented due to the overdispersion or heterogeneity in secondary transmission arising from each primary COVID -19 case.122 Research is needed to plan the path to SARS -CoV-2 elimination via pharmaceutical and non -pharmaceutical interventions. In South Korea, early implementation of rapid contact tracing, testing, and quarantine was able to reduce the transmission rate of COVID -19. 627 Contact tracing and high levels of testing and physical distancing359 may limit COVID -19 resurgence .28, 214 Premature relaxation of public health control measures may facilitate rapid increases in prevalence at the state level.237 Modeling suggests that periods of social distancin g or lock -down may be effective in reducing exposure from asymptomatic cases .652 Testing is critical to balancing public health and economic costs.652 Rolling interventions may be necessary .743 Undetected cases can lead to elevated risk of re -emergence after restrictions are l ifted.278 Modeling in the UK suggests that testing of between 59% and 87% of symptomatic individuals, alongside robust contact tracing and quarantine, is necessary to safely reopen schools without creating a second, winter pandemic wave. 510 Regularly testing high -risk groups like healthcare workers may provide benefits to transmission reduction.259 Quarantining whole households may increase the efficiency of testing .29 Synchronizing public health interventions across US state lines may reduce the total number of required interventions .579 Modeling indicates that COVID -19 is likely to become endemic in the US population, with regular, periodic outbreaks, and that additional social or physical distancing measures may be required for several years to keep cases below critical care capacity in absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic. 345 Results depend on the duration of immunity after exposure.345 What do we need to know? We need to understand measures that will limit spread in the winter, particularly in indoor environments. How effective are school closures when COVID -19 prevalence in the community is high? Low? How will holiday travel from colleges and universities impact COVID -19 case growth? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 13 Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? What do we know? SARS -CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from hours to days and is stable in air for at least several hours, depending on the presence of UV light, temperature, and humidity. Environmental contamination is not thought to be the principal mode of SARS -CoV-2 transmission in humans. Viable SARS -CoV-2 and/or RNA can be recovered from contaminated surfaces; however, survivability varies. Both temperature and humidity contribute to S ARS- CoV-2 survival on nonporous surfaces, with cooler, less humid environments facilitating survival (stainless steel, ABS plastic, and nitrile rubber; indoors only; simulated saliva matrix).75 Persistence is reduced with warmer temperatures (37 \u00b0C), and enhanced at colder temperatures (4 \u00b0C).279 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to be stable up to 7 days (25 -27\u00b0C; 35% RH) on smooth surfaces, to include plastic, stainless steel, glass, ceramics, wood, latex gloves, and surgical masks.414 At 22 \u00b0C, SARS -CoV-2 was shown to be detectable (via plaque assay) on paper currency for up to 24 hours, on clothing for up to 4 hours, and on skin for up to 96 hours.279 SARS- CoV-2 was found to be stable across pH 3 -10 on several surfaces at 22 \u00b0C.135 After 3 hours (22\u00b0 C, 65% RH), no infectious virus was detected on printing and tissue papers; on day 2, none was found on treated wood and cloth; on day 4, none was found on glass or banknote; on day 7, none was found on stainless steel or plastic.135 At standard room temperature and humidity, SARS -CoV-2 becomes undetectable on common library items after 2 to 8 days of quarantin e depending on the material (e.g., book cover vs leather) and conditions (e.g., stacked vs unstacked).8, 313, 599 SARS- CoV-2 can persist on plastic and metal surfaces for up to 3 days (21 -23\u00b0C, 40% RH)664 and infectious virus can be recovered from a surgical mask after 7 days (22 \u00b0C, 65% RH).135 SARS- CoV-2 RNA was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days .466 It is estimated that at least 1,000 viral particles per 25 cm2 are needed to de tect SARS -CoV-2 RNA on surfaces.514 In the absence of sunlight, SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for weeks. In the absence of sunlight, infectious SARS -CoV-2 can remain on non- porous (e.g., glass, vinyl) surfaces for at least 28 days at 20\u00b0 C and 50% RH; higher temperatures greatly reduce t he environmental stability of SARS -CoV- 2.570 This value is longer than other stability estimates,134, 570, 664 potentially due to a fluid matrix with more protein to simulate human respiratory fluid and a higher inoculation dose.570 In simulated saliva on stainless steel surfaces, SARS -CoV-2 shows negligible decay over 60 minutes in darkness, but loses 90% of infectivity every 6 .8-12.8 minutes, depending on simulated UVB radiation.552 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed a data -based model for SARS -CoV-2 decay on inert surfaces (stainless steel, ABS plastic and nitrile rubber) at varying temperature and relative humidity without sunlight.173 Particulate matter (PM) does not appear to be a viable transmission model of SARS -CoV-2. It does not appear that pollen or air particulates are carriers of SARS -CoV-2,183 despite some country -level associations.61 SARS -CoV-2 survival in the air is highly dependent on the presence of UV light and temperature. DHS has develope d a tool for estimating the decay of airborne SARS -CoV-2 in different environmental conditions.172 Due to the effects of evaporation, modeling suggests that hot, dry conditions increase the aerosol risk of SARS -CoV-2, though cold, humid conditions facilitate transmission by droplet spread.761 Experimental studies using SARS -CoV-2 aerosols (1.78 -1.96 m mass median aerodynamic diameter in artificial saliva matrix) found that simulated sunlight rapidly inactivates the virus, with 90% reductions in infectious concentration after 6 minutes in high -intensity sunlight (similar to mid -June) and 19 minutes in low -intensity sunlight (similar to early March or October). 594 In dark conditions, the half -life of aerosolized SARS -CoV-2 is approximately 86 minutes in simulated saliva matrix.594 Humidity alone had no significant impact on aerosolized virus survival.594 SARS- CoV-2 was shown to have an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (without sunlight, particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23\u00b0C and 65% RH),664 retaining infectivity for up to 16 hours in appropriate conditions (23\u00b0 C, 53% RH, no sunlight).208 Stability of SARS -CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples depends on temperature and transport medium. RNA in clinical samples collected in viral transport medium is stable at 18 -25\u00b0C or 2-8\u00b0C for up to 21 days without impacting real-time RT -PCR results.617 RNA in clinical samples is als o stable at 4 \u00b0C for up for 4 weeks with regard to quantitative RT -PCR testing (given that the sample contains 5,000 copies/mL). Separately, storage of RNA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (18- 25\u00b0C) resulted in unstable sample concentr ations. 523 There is currently n o evidence that SARS -CoV-2 is transmitted to people through food. There is no documented evidence that food, food packaging, or food handling is a significant source of COVID -19 infections,315, 710 though several outbreaks have a hypothesized food origin.276 Infectious SARS -CoV-2 has been found on frozen food packaging, but has not been linked to actual infections.562 SARS- CoV-2 is susceptible to heat treatment (70 \u00b0C) but can persist for at least two weeks at refrigerated temperatures (4\u00b0C).134, 549 SARS -CoV-2 maintains infectivity for at least 21 days when inoculated on frozen foods and stored below -20\u00b0C.219 What do we need to know? We need to quantify the duration of SARS -CoV-2 infectivity on surfaces, not simply the presence of RNA. We need to determine the concentration of viral particles per area needed to detect SARS -CoV-2 RNA on surfaces. It is unclear how viability of SARS -CoV-2 is affected across the food supply chain .

What do we know? Soap and water, as well as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.358 Chlorine bleach (1%, 2%), 70% ethanol and 0.05% chlorhexidine are effective against live virus in lab tests.133 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but not all solutions have been tested on SARS -CoV-2.24 Several solutions have been tested against SARS -CoV-2 and found to be effective (EPA list N), including those based on para -chloro -meta - xylenol, salicylic acid, quaternary ammonium compounds.190 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patient hospital rooms.497 Regular disinfection of hospital rooms (with benzalkonium wipes) can reduce the presence of SARS -CoV-2 on surfaces, though contamination is widespread without regular cleaning.343 Chlo rhexidine digluconate may be ineffective .50 Oral antiseptic rinses used in pre- procedural rinses for dentistry containing povidone -iodine (PVP -I) are effective decontaminants of SARS -CoV-2, completely inactivating SARS -CoV-2 at concentrations above 0.5% in lab tests (for 15 -30 s) .71 Efforts are ongoing to create paint -on surfaces that can rapidly inactivate SARS -CoV-2.67 Under an emergency exemption, the US EPA permitted Texas and American Airlines to use a product manufactured by Applied BioScience as a surface coating capable of inactivating SARS -CoV-2 within 2 hours, for up to 7 days.191 Iodine -based antiseptics may be able to decontaminate nasal passages, though any influence on transmission is unknown.231 A mouth- spray previously investigated for the 229E (ColdZyme \u00ae) effectively inactivated SARS -CoV-2 in vitro ; additional tests are necessary to determine any clinical benefit.269 Indoor air filters based on non- thermal plasma or reactive oxygen species may be effective at reducing circulating SARS -CoV- 2 concentratio ns, estimated by reductions in surrogate virus, though additional testing on live SARS -CoV-2 virus is needed.586 Indoor air filtration devices based on hydroxyl radical cascades, which do not emit ozone, are being trialed at 4 UK hospital s due to their efficacy in reducing concentrations of a surrogate virus (M2 phage ).27, 655 In tests with a surrogate virus (Phi6 phage), a modified version of the Joint Biological Agent Decontamination System (JBADS) was effective at decontaminating military aircraft in approximately three hours using high heat and humidity.621 Aquila Bioscience has developed a spray decontamination technique to pair with its existing alcohol - and chemical -free wipe; these products may be used to capture SARS -CoV-2 on skin, surfaces, and washable masks.87 Several methods exist for decontaminating N95 respirators488 and other PPE. Researchers have identified four methods capable of decontaminating N95 respirators while maintaining physical integrity (fit factor): UV radiation, heating to 70 \u00b0C, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). 218 Ethanol (70%) was associated with loss of physical integrity.218 Dry heat and UV decontamination can also be used under certain conditions.217 Hydrogen peroxide vapor (VHP) can repeatedly decontaminate N95 respirators.568 Devices capable of decontaminating 80,000 masks per day have been granted Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.199 The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization for a system capable of decontaminating ten N 95 masks at a time using devices already present in many US hospitals.89 However, a cohort study suggested fit failure after 1 -5 decontamination cycles with this method, depending on mask type.401 Respirator decontamination methods such as VHP appear to maintain filtration efficiency after repeated decontamination cycles.522 Several decontamination metho ds, including VHP, UVC, are capable of decontaminating N95 respirators for 10 -20 cycles without loss of fit or filtration efficiency.13 Stacking respirators may increase decontam ination rates without compromising efficiency.582 Peracetic acid may be effective in combination with VHP.326 Pulsed xenon ultraviolet light was able to decontaminate SARS -CoV-2 on respirators with 1 -5 minute exposures.613 Wet heat (65 \u00b0C for 30 minutes) in a can decontaminate N95 respirators inoculated with SARS -CoV-2.174 Methylene blue (in combination with visible light) is being investigated for decontamination of N95 respirators.659 Researchers have developed a thermal inactivation model for SARS -CoV-2, providing estimates of infectivity reduction based on time and temperature in the environment and under decontamination strategies.744 Heat treatment (56 \u00b0C) is sufficient to kill coronaviruses (not SARS -CoV-2 explicitly),544, 763 though effectiveness depends partly on protein in the sample.544 Coronaviruses may be resistant to heat inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.644- 645 Coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.182 Dry heat (100\u00b0 C, 5% RH for 50 minutes) was able to decontaminate N95 respirators inoculated with several viruses, but has not been tested on SARS -CoV-2.491 Forced air ozone reactors may be able to decontaminate surgical gowns, though SARS -CoV-2 tests are needed.142, 411 What do we need to know? We need additional SARS -CoV-2 decontamination studies, particularly with regard to PPE and other items in short supply. Does contamination with human fluids/waste alter disinfectant efficacy profiles? How effective is air filtration at reducing transmission in healthcare, airplanes, and public spaces? We need to know how to efficiently and effectively decontaminate whole rooms and large spaces. REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 15 PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it? What do we know? Face masks appear effective at reducing infections from SARS -CoV-2. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses642 demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.593 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers is high.560 Contacts with healthcare workers tend to transmit COVID -19 more often than other casual contacts.691 Hospital -acquired infection rates fell after introduction of comprehensive infection control measures, including expanded testi ng and use of PPE for all patient contacts.569 Universal masking policies also reduced the rate of new healthcare worker infections.690, 770 Even among healthcare personnel reporting adequate PPE early in the pan demic (March -April), rates of infection were 3.4 times higher than the general population.479 A modeling study suggests that healthcare workers are primarily at risk from droplet and inhalation exposure (compared to contact with fomites), with greater risk while in closer proximity to patients.330 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SARS -CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield).\"110 WHO indicates he althcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve gowns as well as gloves.714 PPE that covers all skin may reduce exposure to pathogens.209, 705 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) are recommended for those working with potential aerosols.715 Additional protection (Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with hood), should be considered for high- risk procedures .92 A small observational study found no C OVID -19 cases in 25 healthcare workers exposed to an infected patient while conducting aerosol -generating procedures, despite differences in the mask types (N95 respirator vs. 3 -ply surgical mask) worn by the workers.355 There is still insufficient evidence to recommend surgical masks as alternatives to N95s. KN95 respirators are, under certain conditions, approved for use under FDA Emergency Use Authorization.200 On May 7, the FDA rescinded a number of KN95 models that no longer meet the EUA criteria and are no longer authorized.205 A study suggests that P100 respirators with removable filter cartridges have similar filtration efficiency compared to N95 respirators and could plausibly be used if N95 respirators were in short supply.518 Particular care should be taken with \"duckbill\" N95 respirators, which may fail fit tests after repeated doffing.162 Dome - shaped N95 respirators also failed fit tests after extended use.162 The US FDA cautions healthcare facilities using passive protective barrier enclosures without negative pressure, and has withdrawn a prior Emergency Use Authorization for the devices.204 Experiments with mannequins show that face masks reduce potential spread of SARS -CoV-2 when worn by an infectious individual, but also that face masks by non -infected recipients can reduce the number of inhaled particles; the protective effect was maximized when both infected and uninfected individuals (mannequins) wore masks.657 Researchers have developed a lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that prevents SARS -CoV-2 transmission in ferrets given the peptide prophylactically via the intranasal route; human studies have yet to be conducted.160 Non- medical masks may be effective at slowing transmission, though data specific to SARS -CoV-2 are sparse.6, 12 On 4/3/2020, the US CDC recommended wearing cloth face masks in public where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.112 The CDC recommends masks without exhalation vents or valves,107 as masks with valves can allow particles to pass through unfiltered.671 The WHO recommends that the general population wear non- medical masks when in public settings and when physical distancing is difficult, and that vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly) wear medical masks when close contact is likely.711 Infected individuals wearing facemasks in the home before the onset of symptoms was associated with a reduction in household transmission.693 A meta -analysis of SARS -CoV-1, MERS, and COVID -19 transmission events found evidence that wearing face masks and eye protection were each associated with lower risk of tra nsmission ,139 with N95 respirators more effective than a sep arate meta -analysis, N95 respirators were found to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of respiratory illness in health care professionals including influenza, though surgical masks were similarly effective for influenza.489 N95 respirators were associated with up to 80% reductions in SARS -CoV-1 infections.489 Surgical face masks, respirators , and homemade face masks may prevent transmission of coronaviruses from infectious individuals to other individuals.156, 386, 662 Surgical masks were associated with a significant reduction in the amount of seasonal coronavirus expressed as aerosol particles (<5 m).386 Homemade masks reduce overall flow from breathing and coughing (63 -86% reduction) but also generate leakage jets facing downward and backward from the wearer's face.674 Some non -standard materials (e.g., cotton, cotton hybrids) may be able to filter out >90% of simulant particles >0.3 m,349 while other materials (e.g., T -shirt, vacuum cleaner bag, towels) appear to have lower filtration efficacy (~35 -62%).684 Of 42 homemade materials tested, the three with the greatest filtration efficiencies were layered cotton with raised visible fibers.750 Neck fleeces commonly worn by runners may increase the frequency of small aerosol particles, compared to wearing no mask at all.215 Cotton T -shirt masks appear ineffective at reducing emitted particles when individuals talk, breath e, sneeze, or cough, with those made of single layers increasing emitted particles during these activities.49 What do we need to know? We need to continue assessing PPE effectiveness with specific regard to SARS -CoV-2 instead of surrogates. When and how do N95 respirators and other face coverings fail? How effective are homemade masks at reducing SARS -CoV-2 transmission? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 16 Forensics - Natural vs intentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. What do we know? All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. New analysis of SARS -CoV-2 and related SARS -like coronaviruses sugges ts that SARS -CoV-2 jumped directly from bats to humans, without the influence of an intermediate 'mixing' host.80 Pangolin coronaviruses were shown to be more divergent and split off from bat coronaviruses earlier than SARS -CoV-2.80 Current sampling of pangolin viruses does not implicate the m as an intermediate to human SARS -CoV-2.80 These data suggest SARS -CoV-2 emerged from circulating bat coronaviruses in SE China/SE Asia and additional zoonotic emergence of novel coronaviruses could occur. Based on phylogenetic analysis, SARS -CoV- 2 most likely emerged from Rhinolophus (horseshoe) bats living in China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, or another Southeast Asian country,372 though historica l recombination with pangolin coronaviruses may explain some features of the SARS -CoV-2 genome.226 Genomic analysis suggests that SARS -CoV-2 is a natural variant and is unlikely to be human- derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.37, 767 Phylogenetics suggest that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to coronaviruses found in pangolins.408, 410 The SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein, which mediates entry into host cells and is a major determinant of host range, is very similar to the SARS -CoV-1 Spike protein.420 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two separate bat coronaviruses420 and coronaviruses found in pangolins.410 Comparing genomes of multiple coronaviruses using machine -learning has identified key genomic signatures shared amo ng high case fatality rate coronaviruses (SARS -CoV-1, SARS -CoV-2, MERS) and animal counterparts.271 These data furt her suggest that SARS -CoV-2 emergence is the result of natural emergence and that there is a potential for future zoonotic transmission of additional pathogenic strains to humans.271 Deletion mutants were identified at low levels in human clinical samples, suggesting that the PRRA furin cleavage site alone is not fully responsible for human infection, but does confer a fitness advantage in the human host.722 Additional whole - genome sequencing in humans would help to confirm this finding. Genomic data support at least two plausibl e origins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"37 Both scenarios are consistent wi th the observed genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Some SARS- CoV-2 genomic evidence indicates a close relationship with pangolin coronaviruses,721 and data suggest that pangolins may be a natur al host for beta -coronaviruses.408, 410 Genomic evidence suggests a plausible recombination event between a circulating coronavirus in pangolins and bats could be the source of SARS -CoV-2.393, 735 Emerging studies are showing that bats are not the only reservoir of SARS -like coronaviruses.755 Additional research is needed. There are multiple studies showing that the SARS -CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain, the portion of the protein responsible for binding the human receptor ACE2, was acquired through recombination between coronaviruses from pangolins and bats.37, 393, 409, 755 These studies suggest that pangolins may have played an intermediate role in the adaptation of SARS -CoV-2 to be able to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Additional research is needed. A key difference between SARS -CoV-2 and other beta -coronaviruses is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the Spike protein (insertion of a PRRA amino acid sequence between S1 and S2).149 A novel bat coronavirus (RmYN02) has been identified in China with an insertion between the S1/S2 cleavage site of the Spike protein. While distinct from the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS -CoV-2, this evidence shows that such insertions can occur naturally.765 Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,37 and \"[...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"37 Work with other coronaviruses has indicated that heparan sulfate dependence can be an indicator of prior cell passage, due to a mutation in the previous furin enzyme recognition m otif.159 A report claiming a lab oratory origin of SARS -CoV-2740 has been heavily disputed by scientists at Johns Hopkins University.4 What do we need to know? We need to know whether there was an intermediate host species between bats and humans. What tests for attribution exist for coronavirus emergence? What is the identity of the intermediate specie s? Are there closely related circulating coronaviruses in bats or other animals with the novel PRRA cleavage site found in SARS - CoV-2? REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS- CoV-2 (COV ID-19) Updated 11/10/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 17 Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? Current evidence suggests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. There have been no documented cases of SARS -CoV-2 prior to December 2019. Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.39, 66, 548 Analysis of more than 7,000 SARS -CoV-2 genome samples provides an estimated mutation rate of 6x10-4 nucleotides per genome per year.665 The same analysis estimates the emergence o f SARS -CoV-2 in humans between October and December 2019.665 This aligns with the first known human cases in China in early December 2019, in Europe in late December 2019,171 circulation in the US (Washington State) in February 2020,726 and circulation in Mexico in March 2020.634 In both California169 and New York City,253 evidence supports multiple introductions of SARS -CoV-2 from inside and outside the US. SARS- CoV-2 is acquiring nucleotide changes at a rate that suggests the virus is undergoing purifying selection (that the genome is stabilizing toward a common genome).729 Low genetic diversity early in the epidemic suggests that SARS -CoV-2 was capable of jumping to human and other mammalian hosts,729 and that additiona l jumps into humans may occur. In 94 COVID -19 patients, there was no association between viral genotype and clinical severity.756 However, a 382 base pair deletion in the SARS -CoV-2 genome has been linked to milder clinical illness (n=39),747 though caveats in sample size, time of sampling, and patient selection are warranted. At least one mutation has been associated with greater viral transmission, but virulence appears unchanged. Phylogenetic and clinical analysis suggests the D614G mutation in the Spike protein is associated with higher rates of SARS - CoV-2 transmission,677 but no change in clinical severity in infected patients.353 Ongoing study of SARS -CoV-2 sequences reveals the continued spread and increased presence of sequences with the D614G mutation ,353, 417, 534, 753 though it is possible that founder effects contributed to its prevalence. The D614G mutation increased viral loads in experimentally infected hamsters in the nose and throat,534 and hastened transmission (evidence of spread between hamsters after 2 days f or D614G mutants vs. 4 days for wild -type virus).298 The D614G mutation showed a competitive advantage within hamster hosts, meaning it increased in frequency in vitro compared to wild -type virus.535 The mutation did increase viral replication in human cell lines.534, 753 The D614G mutation appears to make the virus more susceptible to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies or by convalescent plasma.704 Antibodies induced by the D614G mutation or wild- type virus are able to neutralize each other.382 A second SARS -CoV-2 variant is being assessed for its ability to evade the human immune system. A separate Spike protein receptor binding motif variant (called N493K) resul ts in similar clinical disease ; importantly , it shows evidence of immune escape from polyclonal sera and neutralizing antibodies . This may affect the ability of vaccines and therapeutics that target this region.646 As of October 2020, this is the second most common receptor binding domain variant worldwide, and has been found in 12 countries.646 Associations between human blood type and COVID -19 severity are unclear , but certain human genome regions are associ ated with more severe disease. Several human genomic regions have been associated with increased risk of COVID -19 infection and severe disease.36 Some of these are linked to h uman blood type,250 where there is evidence of slightly increased prevalence34, 62, 252 and moderately increased severity in those with type A blood,294 though early evidenc e was mixed.373 Other regions associated with severe disease include locus 3p21.31, where certain alleles are found more often in patients with respiratory distress requiring ventilation,250 as well as those with severe disease.506 Repeated outbreaks of COVID -19 on m ink farms, and the detection of mink -adapted SARS -CoV-2 in humans, has led to the mass culling of all mink in Denmark.563 The State Serum Institute has noted mutations in the Spike protein that differed from commonly circulating strain s and initially showed a decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies.314 The extent of the stability of these changes and to what extent they would be affected by vaccine or treatmen t options in progress are unclear. Individuals with defective androgen signaling (long polyQ allelic repeats in the androgen receptor gene) were more likely to have severe COVID -19, possibly due to increased inflammatory responses; the length of polyQ alle les may influence treatment decisions. 58 Researchers have identified a number of human proteins associated with COVID -19 severity, which could be used as a screening tool for designing appropriate treatment regimens.769 Structural modeling suggests that observed changes in the genetic sequence of the SARS -CoV-2 Spike protein may enhance binding of the virus to human ACE2 receptors.499 More specifically, changes to two residues (Q493 and N501) are lin ked with improving the stability of the virus -receptor binding complex.499 Additionally, structural modeling identified several existing mutations that may enhance the stability of the receptor binding domain, potentially increasing binding efficacy.503 What do we need to know? We need to link genotypes to phenotypes (e.g., disease severity) in infected patients. Are there similar genomic differences in the progression of coronavirus strains from bat to intermediate species to human? Are there different strains or clades of circulating virus? If so, do they differ in virulence or transmissibility ? What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission? How do viral mutations affect the long -term efficacy of specific vaccines?
