Between Covid and your run-of-the-mill seasonal cold and flu, our system has its work cut out for it. It's advised to provide more fuel for fighting sickness, so we've compiled a list of our go-to immune boosters. As always, if you have specific questions or concerns, please reach out to us. Prevention (daily adult dosage) - 5000 IU vitamin D3 - 500 mg vitamin C - 15 mg zinc - 250 mg quercetin - Andrographis 300 to 400 mg Infection (adult dosage at symptom onset) - 25,000 IU D3 (single megadose, 5000 IU daily thereafter) - 2000 mg vitamin C in divided doses (500 mg per dose) - 30 to 60 mg zinc in divided doses (15 or 30 mg per dose) - 500 mg quercetin (250 mg per dose paired with zinc) - Andrographis 600 to 900 mg in divided doses - N-acetyl Cysteine 500 to 1500 mg (~500 mg per dose) Vitamin D3 Vitamin D3 is a pre-hormone, which acts as a catalyst for metabolism and immune response. Higher blood levels of vitamin D are associated with better outcomes in infected patients. Vitamin C Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble antioxidant and assists in the function of immune cells. Due to our limited capacity for absorption of vitamin C, doses should be limited to 500 mg or less per serving. Zinc Zinc is an essential trace mineral necessary for the growth and proper function of immune cells. Because our bodies do not store zinc in significant quantities, daily intake is needed for optimum health. Quercetin Quercetin, a flavonoid found in many plants, has remarkable antiviral and immune-supportive properties. When taken with zinc, quercetin can assist in delivering that mineral to appropriate tissues. Andrographis Andrographis is a bitter herb with a long history of use in Ayurvedic medicine. It is an immune stimulant, as well as having direct antimicrobial effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of Andrographis may also prove useful in cases of prolonged infection. N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is a multi-faceted amino acid. An antioxidant, mucolytic as well as a precursor to glutathione, NAC helps improve liver function and encourages clearance of mucus from the lower respiratory system.
