Convalescence from mild-to-moderate (MtoM) COVID-19 disease may be supported by integrative medicine strategies. Integrative Medicine (IM) is defined as healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person, including all aspects of lifestyle. Integrative medicine strategies that may support recovery from MtoM COVID-19 are proposed given their clinically studied effects in related conditions. Adoption of an anti-inflammatory diet, supplementation with vitamin D, glutathione, melatonin, Cordyceps, Astragalus and garlic have potential utility. Osteopathic manipulation, Qigong, breathing exercises and aerobic exercise may support pulmonary recovery. Stress reduction, environmental optimization, creative expression and aromatherapy can provide healing support and minimize enduring trauma. These modalities would benefit from clinical trials in people recovering from COVID-19 infection. - Cooley, J. H., Lee, J., Coppola, C. L., Pompea, S., Berry, M. K., Duran-Cerda, D. G., Higgins, C.

FOCUS, 18(1), 8-15. doi:10.1176/appi.focus.20190027 [More info](#more-journal-publication1)The prevalence and impact of trauma constitute a public health crisis that is complicated by the cultural heterogeneity of contemporary society and a higher rate of trauma among individuals from minoritized communities. A trauma-informed care approach can facilitate improved treatment of those who have experienced trauma, and trauma-informed care is increasingly viewed as potentially beneficial for all patients. This article outlines general principles of trauma-informed care and ways to enact it. Because the situations in which trauma arises, the ways in which it is conceptualized, and how patients respond to it are influenced by both culture and individual factors, a cultural humility approach is also described and recommended. Psychiatrists can navigate the complex terrain of cultures and social backgrounds in the clinical encounter and can promote healing when treating patients who have experienced trauma by adopting a trauma-informed care approach and an attitude of cultural humility. - Crocker, R.

Unfortunately, no integrative measures have been validated in human trials as effective specifically for COVID-19. Notwithstanding, this is an opportune time to be proactive. Using available in-vitro evidence, an understanding of the virulence of COVID-19, as well as data from similar, but different, viruses, we offer the following strategies to consider. Again, we stress that these are supplemental considerations to the current recommendations that emphasize regular hand washing, physical distancing, stopping non-essential travel, and obtaining testing in the presence of symptoms. - Sternberg, E.
