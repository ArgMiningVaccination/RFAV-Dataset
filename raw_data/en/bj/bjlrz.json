Their popularity mostly stems from those interested in living a healthier lifestyle. Essential oils have a \"natural\" status, offering a non toxic option for healing, cleaning, soothing, etc. However, not all essential oils on the market are indeed \"natural.\" It's important that you know what to look for when choosing them for your personal use: - Not labeled \"fragrance oil\" or \"perfume oil,\" which are not pure essential oils. - Contains no additives or preservatives in ingredients. - Common name and botanical name noted on label, as there are many varieties of plants. - Stored in dark-colored glass bottles to preserve quality. - Certified organic noted on label. [Pure Haven essential oils*](https://shop.purehaven.com/#/shop/from/?categoryID=106) are USDA certified organic and guaranteed safe and effective. Use them to enhance mind, body, and spirit in different ways every day. Here are two easy ways to enjoy your essential oils: - Diffuse in a diffuser, in a small bowl of warm water, or even on a cotton ball placed on a small glass plate or bowl and breathe in the aroma of the oil. (Tip: No need to diffuse constantly; 10-15 minutes at a time is ideal.) - Dilute in a carrier for topical application. Carriers include body oils (Pure Haven [mom and baby body oil](https://shop.purehaven.com/#/shop/detail/95366/from/?)and [mom balm](https://shop.purehaven.com/#/shop/detail/13040/from/?)are amazing unscented carriers, not just for moms), [skin care serums](https://shop.purehaven.com/#/shop?searchTerm=serum), and [lotions or creams](https://shop.purehaven.com/#/shop?categoryID=93).
