In addition to their benefits, medicinal products may also have side effects, some of which may be undesirable and / or unexpected. Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine/vaccine related problem. All medicines and vaccines undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy through clinical trials before they are authorized for use. However, the clinical trial process involves studying these products in a relatively small number of selected individuals for a short period of time. Certain side effects may only emerge once these products have been used by a heterogenous population, including people with other concurrent diseases, and over a long period of time. The [report](/publications-detail-redirect/who-wer9734-397-408) from the first joint meeting of WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety and WHO Advisory Committee on Safety of Medicinal Products is now available. The conclusions from the second joint meeting of the WHO GACVS and the WHO ACSoMP, 14-16 December The meeting discussed various topics including mpox (monkeypox) vaccines and safety surveillance, safety monitoring of pregnant and breastfeeding women, active safety surveillance of molnupiravir, hallucinations reported with delamanid in children, dolutegravir exposure at conception, emergency use protocol for tecovirimat, the use of sodium valproate in women and girls of childbearing potential as well as a gaming approach to risk and safety communication. In 2021, there was an urgent need to support the COVAX Vaccine Safety Working Group (VSWG), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the WHO-Pharmacovigilance team (WHO-PV) in collating the studies evaluating the safety of COVID-19 vaccines globally to inform strategy and policy. A landscape assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance activities, including a literature review and a survey, was conducted to inform on potential sources of evidence and to identify gaps: [VH Safety Maps](/publications/m/item/VHsafetymaps).
