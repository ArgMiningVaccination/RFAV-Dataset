People of all ages from children to the elderly, regardless of artistic experience, use art therapy in this way as an aid to supporting them with their particular concern. It is not a diagnostic tool but rather a mode of communication and expression. Drama therapists Drama therapists are both clinicians and artists that draw on their knowledge of both theatre/drama and therapy to use performance arts as a medium for psychological therapy. Clients are able to explore a wide variety of different issues and needs from autism and dementia to physical/sexual abuse and mental illness in an indirect way leading to psychological, emotional and social changes. Drama therapists can be found in many varying settings such as schools, mental health care, general health social care, prisons and in the voluntary sector. Music therapists Music therapists engage clients in live musical interaction so as to promote an individual's emotional wellbeing and improve their communication skills. Clients do not need to have any previous experience of playing a musical instrument (or even singing) as this established psychological clinical intervention utilises their unique connection to music and the relationship established with their therapist to help: develop and facilitate communication skills, improve self-confidence and independence, enhance self-awareness and awareness of others, and improve concentration and attention skills. In particular, music therapy is an effective intervention for those clients who cannot speak due to disability, illness or injury as their psychological, emotional, cognitive, physical, communicative and social needs can be addressed through the musical interaction with their therapist. Music therapy can be beneficial for individuals of all ages and physical abilities however, from new born babies in terms of establishing the parent -child bond to those receiving palliative, end-of-life care. 2 Chiropodists/podiatrists Podiatrists provide essential assessment, evaluation and foot care for a wide range of patients with a variety of conditions both long term and acute. Many of these fall into high risk categories such as patients with diabetes, cerebral palsy, peripheral arterial disease and peripheral nerve damage where podiatric care is of vital importance. Many podiatrists have become further specialised into either the area of biomechanics or surgery. Biomechanics is often associated with treating sports related injuries but spans across a wide range of conditions including children and the elderly. Podiatric surgeons offer surgical interventions in all aspects of foot health management. Podiatrists work in both the community and acute settings and while many are employees of the NHS many podiatrists now provide healthcare services in the private sector. Dietitians Dietitians are the only qualified health professionals who assess, diagnose and treat diet and nutritional problems at an individual and wider public health level. Uniquely, dietitians use the most up-to-date public health and scientific research on food, health and disease, which they translate into practical guidance to enable people to make appropriate lifestyle and food choices. Dietitians are the only nutrition professionals to be regulated by law, and are governed by an ethical code to ensure that they always work to the highest standard. Dietitians work in the NHS, private practice, industry, education, research, sport, media, public relations, publishing, government and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs). Dietitians advise and influe nce food and health policy across the spectrum from government, to local communities and individuals. Occupational therapists Occupational therapists (OTs) work in the NHS, local authority social care services, housing, schools, prisons, voluntary and independent sectors, and vocational and employment rehabilitation services as well as in education and research. Occupational therapists work with people of all ages with a wide range of problems resulting from physical, mental, social or developmental difficulties. OTs support people with a range of interventions to enable them to return to or optimise participation in all the things that people do; for example, caring for themselves and others, working, learning, playing and interacting with others. Being deprived of or having limited access to any or all of these occupations can affect physical and psychological health and hence OTs positively impact upon the wellbeing and rehabilitation of patients in most care pathways and in the broader public health and social care environment. 3 Operating Department Practitioners Operating Department Practitioners (ODPs) are highly skilled healthcare practitioners that support patients of all ages during each phase of the patient's perioperative care: Anaesthetic - provide patient -centred care and prepare specialist equipment and drugs Surgical - prepare all the necessary equipment and instruments for operations and providing these to the surgical team during the operation Recovery - supporting the patient throughout their time in the recovery ward, assessing vitals and fitness for return to the ward As well as providing this specialised care, ODPs are responsible for preparing the operating theatre and maintaining communication between the surgical team, operating theatre and wider hospital. ODPs typically work in operating departments however their skills are increasingly being needed in other critical care areas within a hospital. Orthoptists Orthoptic clinical practice encompasses both diagnosis and treatment and is wide ranging. Orthoptists help premature infants with retinopathy of prematurity, children with reduced vision due to squint, adults and children with eye movement defects due to diabetes, hypertension, endocrine dysfunction, cancer, trauma and stroke. Extended scope orthoptic practitioners now work in high volume ophthalmic specialities such as glaucoma, cataract and age related macular degeneration. Orthoptists work in acute hospital and community settings in health and education often as part of a multi -disciplinary medical, nursing and AHP team. Osteopaths Osteopaths take a holistic view of the structure and function of the body to diagnose and treat a wide variety of medical conditions. Their work is centered on the principle that the skeleton, muscles, ligaments and connective tissues of an individual need to function smoothly together so as to maintain wellbeing. Osteopaths use a number of non-invasive treatments such as touch, physical manipulation, stretching and massage to restore bodily equilibrium through increasing the mobility of joints, relieving muscle tension, enhancing blood and nerve supply to tissues, and encouraging an individual's own healing mechanisms. Prosthetists and Orthotists Prosthetists are autonomous registered practitioners who provide gait analysis and engineering solutions to patients with limb loss. They are extensively trained at 4 undergraduate level in mechanics, bio-mechanics, and material science along with anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. Their qualifications make them competent to design and provide prostheses that replicate the structural or functional characteristics of the patients absent limb. They treat patients with congenital loss as well as loss due to diabetes, reduced vascularity, infection and trauma. Whilst they are autonomous practitioners they usually work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists as part of multidisciplinary amputee rehabilitation teams. Orthotists are autonomous registered practitioners who provide gait analysis and engineering solutions to patients with problems of the neuro, muscular and skeletal systems. They are extensively trained at undergraduate level in mechanics, bio- mechanics, and material science along with anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. Their qualifications make them competent to design and provide orthoses that modify the structural or functional characteristics of the patients' neuro- muscular and skeletal systems enabling patients to mobilise, eliminate gait deviations, reduce falls, reduce pain, prevent and facilitate the healing of ulcers. They treat patients with a wide range of conditions including diabetes, arthritis, cerebral palsy, stroke, spina bifida, scoliosis, musculoskeletal, physiotherapy, sports injuries and trauma. Whilst they often work as autonomous practitioners they increasi ngly often form part of multidisciplinary teams such as within the diabetic foot team or neuro- rehabilitation team. Paramedics Paramedics are the senior ambulance service healthcare professionals at an accident or a medical emergency. Often working by themselves, paramedics are responsible for assessing the patient's condition and then giving essential treatment. They use high-tech equipment such as defibrillators, spinal and traction splints and intravenous drips, as well as administering oxygen and drugs. Physiotherapists Physiotherapy uses physical approaches to promote, maintain and restore physical, psychological and social well-being, working through partnership and negotiation with individuals to optimise their functional ability and potential. Physiotherapists address problems of impairment, activity and participation and manage recovering, stable and deteriorating conditions - particularly those associated with the neuro- muscular, musculo -skeletal, cardio- vascular and respiratory systems - through advice, treatment, rehabilitation, health promotion and supporting behavioural change. Physiotherapy uses manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, the application of electro- physical modalities and other physical approaches in response to individual need. Physiotherapists work across sectors and settings, including acute, community and workplace settings, and with a large number of population and patient groups includi ng children, the working population, and older people. 5 Speech and language therapists Speech and language therapists (SLTs) in the UK work with children and adults to help them overcome or adapt to a vast array of disorders of speech, language, communication and swallowing. These include helping young children to access education, working with young offenders to enable them to access the programmes designed to reduce reoffending, reducing life-threatening swallowing problems in the early days after stroke and providing essential support to adults with a range of acquired neurological communication difficulties to help them return to work, and their roles in their family and society. Radiographers Diagnostic radiographers Diagnostic radiographers use a range of techniques to produce high quality images to diagnose an injury or disease. They are responsible for providing safe and accurate imaging examinations and increasingly also the resulting report. Diagnostic imaging is a component of the majority of care pathways. Radiographers are also key team members in Breast Screening and Ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy. Therapeutic radiographers Therapeutic radiographers play a vital role in the treatment of cancer. They are also responsible as they are the only health professionals qualified to plan and deliver radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is used either on its own or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Therapeutic radiographers manage the patient pathway through the many radiotherapy processes, providing care and support for patients throughout their radiotherapy treatment. 6 Appendix 2: MEDLINE search strategy Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions(R) <1946 to February 08, or therap*\").ti,ab. allied health or health occupations/ or nutritionists/ or physical therapists/ or (dietetic* or clinical psycholog* or operating department practice* or ODP or operating department practitioner* or osteopath* or paramedic* or physical therap* or speech or language 1366805 2 (housing instability or housing insecurity or housing strain or housing security or mortgage problems or foreclosure or eviction* or housing loss or home repossession* or home ownership or (repossess* adj3 hous*) or (repossess* adj3 propert*) or mortgage mortgage arrears or mortgage debt* or overcrowding).ti,ab. 5010 3 Cultural Deprivation/ or or or ethnology.ti,ab. race.ti,ab. or ethnic*.ti,ab. or non?English.ti,ab. or language other than.ti,ab. or english as a second language.ti,ab. or foreign language.ti,ab. 494186 4 exp Gender Identity/ or Women's Health/ or gender differences.ti,ab. or (sex disparit* or sex difference?).ti,ab. or gender or or Social conditions/ or Social isolation/ or marginalization/ or Anomie/ or exclusion.ti,ab. or disorgani?ation.ti,ab. anomie.ti,ab. or social support.ti,ab. 134265 6 Health Status Disparities/ or Health Services Accessibility/ or Health Equity/ or health*care disparit*.ti,ab. or health care disparit*.ti,ab. or health status disparit*.ti,ab. or health disparit*.ti,ab. or health inequalit*.ti,ab. or health inequit*.ti,ab. or medically underserved.ti,ab.

Ackerman (2012) Systematic review investigating access to self-management education and conservative management for people with arthritis according to socioeconomic status 1. Lower education was associated with greater self -perceived need for therapies. However, levels of education were associated with reduced help- seeking and receipt of advice (including weight loss), physical therapy and other allied health services. 2. Lower socioeconomic status was also associated with lower healthcare use and reduced access to care/services. 3. There is evidence to suggest there is under -provision of health services in low SES areas - when controlled for, associati on between SES and reduced access to care remains. 2. Baker (2018) Systematic review of rehabilitation interventions to prevent and treat depression in post -stroke aphasia 1. People with aphasia (PWA) with mild depression may benefit from psychosocial -type treatments. 2. PWA without clinically significant depression may experience benefits to mood through participation in a range of interventions. 3. Unclear which interventions may prevent depression for PWA. 4. No evidence found for treatment of moderate to severe aphasia; specialist mental health or behaviour services required for this group. 5. PWA commonly excluded from studies 3. Camden (2020) Review of effectiveness of paediatric telerehabilitation interventions for children with disabilities and t heir families 1. Majority of outcomes improved after telerehabilitation. 2. Characteristics of effective interventions: focused on parents, centred around an exercise program, used coaching approach, focused on improving child's behavioural functioning, lasted more than 8 weeks and were offered at least once a week 4. Dallman (2020) Systematic review of impact of treatment disparities and differences in health service access and utilisation for children with ASD 1. Older children, those with less severe autism spectrum disorder, those from minority groups and those from particular geographic regions are less like to receive AH services. 2. Families of children with ASD often need more services and it is important to identify barriers to access. 3. Severity of ASD symp toms, age of child, parental income and education level, all impact on likelihood to access health services. 4. Larger national studies around race and ethnicity are needed, as it was not shown to have consistent impact in present review. 5. Feathersto n (2020) Systematic scoping review synthesising studies that 1. There was also a broad range of cognitive, affective and other biases identified to be i nfluential to AHP decision making: stereotyping (sex/gender or sex roles; race/ethnicity; socioeconomic 26 tested whether cognitive, affective or other biases influenced decisions made by allied health care professionals status/class; age; sexual orientation, health status; mental health; weight; speech intelligibility; drug use; type of child maltreatment in relation to child protection reports). 2. Other biases included anchoring; confirmation bias; diagnostic overshadowing; labelling bias. 3. There were similarities in decision making processes identified (through hypothetical clinical scenarios/vignettes) across AHPs, which indicates that bias would place an important role in decision -making outcomes including in treatment recommendations or prognoses. The presence of bias could make decision- making and outcomes inconsistent, and theref ore could have a likely negative overall effect on the quality of decision -making. 6. Moran (2020) Review of factors influencing success of rural clinical placements 1. Strong relationship between providing AH students with skills and training in rural environments have shown improvements in interprofessional competence and increases in number of student placement opportunities. 2. When unmet needs of community are driver for rural clinical placement, there is increased service delivery to 'in -need' communities and increased placement capacity 7. Nam (2012 ) Systematic review and meta- analysis valuating the effectiveness of a culturally tailored diabetes educational intervention (CTDEI) on glycemic control in ethnic minorities with type 2 diabetes. 7. CTDEI is effective for improving glycaemic control among ethnic minorities. 7. The magnitude of effect varies based on the settings of intervention, baseline HbA1c level, and time of HbA1c measurement. 8. Needle (2011) Systematic review to evaluate the evidence relating to the current role of UK -based AHPs including optometrists in HP 1. In terms of age groups, the overwhelming majority (64%) of interventions targeted adults, followed by older people (15%), children (11%) and adolescents (8%). 84% of interventions targeted both males and females, 9% just females and just 2% males (the remainder failed to specify). 2. Of the other demographic or lifestyle variables that might be expected to in fluence message or advice giving, only ethnicity was referred to, and then by only two studies (<1%). Indeed, ethnicity was a ground for exclusion (non- availability of minority language- speaking staff) more often than it was a ground for specific targeting. 3. Interventions were blind to social class, religion and sexuality, to the extent that these were seldom mentioned even in descriptions of intervention settings. 4. Almost all of these people (89%) had a pre- existing condition. The major conditions targeted were: musculoskeletal conditions (28%), cancers (20%), obesity (11%), diabetes health (both 9%) and stroke/cardiovascular (8%). 5. 62% of interventions were at Tertiary, 40% at Secondary, 8% at Primary and 3% at Quaternary level. 6. The approach was overwhelmingly individualistic, with individual empowerment (75%) and education (57%) predominating. Community development interventions were uncommon (1%). Small group working (45%) just exceeded one -to-one deliv ery (44%). However, group working was 27 generally adopted for reasons of administrative convenience or efficiency. Rarely was it an integral component of the intervention (e.g. to reduce social isolation or stigma). 7. HP is a routine component of AHP practice. In the best interventions, it was rigorously theorised, systematically developed and delivered, and robustly evaluated. Generally, however, theorisation was weak (or more often altogether lacking), and interventions appeared to be poorly planned, unsyste matically delivered, and were weakly evaluated. 8. At present, although HP is a standard component of everyday AHP practice, it seems to be largely taken- for-granted. 9. The evidence points also towards significant variation between professions. Physiotherapis ts and dietitians appeared to have better developed research capacity than other AHPs. Approaches to HP, evaluation and research also appeared to vary, with dietetics and physiotherapy subscribing to a biomedical model, and occupational therapy and arts th erapies to a social science model. 9. Speyer 2018 Systematic review and meta- analysis describing telehealth interventions delivered by allied health professionals and nurses in rural and remote areas, and to compare the effects of telehealth interventions with standard face- to-face interventions. 1. Meta -analysis results slightly favoured telehealth interventions compared with face -to-face interventions, but did not show significant differences. 2. There were significant differences for interventions using a combination of cognitive and physical appro aches between telehealth and standard treatment, with a moderate effect favouring telehealth- delivered interventions 10. Walsh (2020) Review of national policies that impact allied health workforce maldistribution 1. Training in rural and remote settings is imp ortant to attract graduates to practice in these areas 2. Financial incentives may positively impact rural recruitment and retention 3. Importance of personal and professional support in recruiting rural health professionals 11. Moorcroft (2019) Systematic review of barriers and facilitators to provision and use of low - tech and unaided AAC for people with complex communication needs 1. Many barriers were environmental (attitudes/support by professionals, family members and society) and as such have potential to be influenced by clinicians, services and funding bodies. 2. Socio -economic barriers included affordability, home environment and frequently moving schools, culture barriers were language and cultural differences Occupational therapists 12. Arbesman, (2011) Systematic review exploring the effectiveness of occupational therapy 1. The re sults indicate that strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of supported employment using individual placement and support to result in competitive employment. 2. These outcomes are stronger when combined with cognitive or social skills training. 28 interventions focusing on participation and performance in occupations related to paid and unpaid employment and education for people with serious mental illness 3. Supported education programs emphasizing goal setting, skill development, and cognitive training result in increased participation in educational pursuits. 4. The evidence for instrumental activities of daily living interventions that targeted specific homemaking occupations and supported parenting was limited but positive. 13. D'Amico (2018) Review of interventions addressing occupational performance for people with serious mental illness 1. Support for using evidence -based practice within occupational therapy 2. Consideration for occupational therapy practitioners to be mental health service providers 3. Instead of general expectations, occupation- based interventions focused on client centred goals have better outcomes. 14. D\u00e9siron (2011) Systematic review investigating the effects of occupational therapy interventions in vocational rehabilitation on return to work (including specific aspects of occupational therapy contributing to these) 1. Occupational therapy interventions impacted return t o work. Specifically reducing average self - reported sick days, functional restoration to resolve issues associated with perceived disability and employment status. Pain and depression were not found to be positively impacted by occupational therapy interve ntions. 2. Rehabilitation programmes were heterogeneous, thereby making it challenging to identify mechanisms of action/active ingredients for occupational therapy specifically 3. Occupational therapy interventions were usually situated within a multidisciplinar y team delivering a programme, thus it was not possible to identify the distinct impacts of occupational therapists on return to work. 15. Hand (2011) Scoping review investigating the effectiveness of community -based occupational therapy interventions 1. Four studies examined participation in work as an outcome, but only 1 found improvement in the intervention group compared with control participants. This study involved occupational therapy focused on work reintegration for adults with major depression; compared with the control group, the intervention group resumed work more quickly 2. Interventions that involve occupational therapy can enhance basic and instrumental activities of daily living in adults with COPD, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple conditions, as well as with depression. The impact on physical function is inconclusive. 16. Ikiugu (2017) Meta -analysis of occupational therapy interventions among adults with mental health diagnosis 1. Theory based occupational therapy interventions may be effective in improving occupational performance for those with mental health diagnosis. 2. Therapy had a small effect on improving well -being among people with mental health diagnosis. 3. Such interventions should be a feature of rehabilitation services 17. Marshall (2020) Systematic review to assess range and quality of interventions aimed at supporting transition from homelessness 1. Interventions to support formerly homeless people in participating in activ ities that are meaningful are just as important as independent living skills. 2. Occupational therapy lens may be useful in overcoming barriers to inclusion in mainstream society. 3. Opportunities for occupational therapists to further support formerly homeless people once housed. 29 18. Roy (2017) Review of practices impacting occupations of people experiencing homelessness 1. Occupational therapists can facilitate occupational engagement of people experiencing homelessness. 2. There are gaps in knowledge including family homelessness in Canadian context and cultural humility 19. White (2020) Review of practices to improve Occupational Therapy work with Indigenous Peoples 1. Occupational therapists should engage with implicit assumptions within their professi on and how it influences their practice. 2. Therapists should listen to Indigenous clients and exchange knowledge with them 3. Therapists should make use of Indigenous health workers and community leaders for better follow up opportunities and better access to i ndividuals 4. Indigenous communities should determine priorities and outcomes that are directly beneficial to them. Dietitians 20. Carolan - Olah 2017 Critical systematic review of GDM intervention programs for Hispanic women, in the United States of America (US). 1. Intensive nutritional counselling approaches which promote low calorie/low GI diets appear to be most effective in BGL management in this population. 2. Interventions that are delivered in Spanish and culturally tailored may be more acceptable t o participants. 21. Cherak (2020) Scoping review t o map the concepts and types of evidence that exist on nutrition intervention for various mental disorders 1. 11 out of 15 trials which assessed and implemented nutrition interventions to improved dietary patterns reported statistically significant and clinically important positive effects of nutrition interventions on mental disorders. 2. The majority of the trials (n=61) investigated supplementation, most commonly adding essential fatty acids, vitami ns or minerals. The majority reported either statistically significant or clinically important effect and 51% reported both. 3. Trials were heterogeneous for targeted mental disorders, nutrition interventions and outcome assessed. 22. King (2014) Review of i nterventions improving nutritional health of adults with disabilities 1. Majority of interventions resulted in improved health behaviours e.g. eating habits and more physical activity 2. Although, knowledge gained by participants varied across studies. 3. Common barriers like budgeting, grocery shopping and cooking techniques should also be addressed in this population 23. Maez (2014) Integrative review of strategies directed towards improving diabetic outcomes of rural populations by reducing HbA1C. 1. Four key intervention types were identified to reduce HbA1c: 1. Lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation and exercise/physical activity - important to provide information using varied formats (e.g. video, verbal explanation, written material) particularly f or rural populations where there are high illiteracy levels 2. Motivational counselling - needs to be consistent and include follow -up in order to be successful 30 3. Nutritional education for patients - education on portion sizes and healthy alternative cooking methods to encourage a structured approach to diet, providing information about diabetes indicators, and using goal setting were important for success 4. Education for providers - educating providers on guidelines for diabetes care and management, having a diabetes registry and system for healthcare delivery were important for patient management 24. McGill (2015) Systematic review of interventions to promote healthy eating to identify whether impacts differ by socioeconomic position (SEP). 1. \"Price\" interventions were most effective in groups with lower SEP, and may therefore appear likely to reduce inequalities. 2. All interventions that combined taxes and subsidies consistently decreased inequalities. 3. Interventions categorised as \"Person\" had a greater impact with increasing SEP, and may therefore appear likely to reduce inequalities. 4. All four dietary counselling interventions appear likely to widen inequalities. 5. \"Place\" interventions were not judged as likely to widen inequalities. Radiographers 25. Dennis (2020) Narrative review describing notable rapid access programmes and their impacts on palliative radiotherapy for patients with advanced and metastatic cancers 1. Older people and those in rural areas less likely to access radiotherapy 2. Nineteen rapi d access programmes across 8 countries (Canada, India, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, USA, UK, Ireland) which focussed on clinical assessment and treatment delivery (usually a course of single fraction) 3. Rapid access programmes can beneficial particularly f or those living in remote communities, in hospice or inpatient settings, or those with advanced age 26. Miller (2019) Narrative review describing the barriers to mammography and breast cancer screening uptake in women from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds 1. Various barriers to mammography/breast cancer screening were identified and organised into the following categories: psychological/knowledge- related, logistical, cultural/immigration -related, and social/interpersonal. 2. African American/Black; Asian/ Pacific Islander and Hispanic women reported negative attitudes from healthcare providers (including rudeness) and a lack of provider communication as a common barrier to mammogram/breast cancer screening uptake. Insensitivity to cultural modesty was also identified as a barrier by some but not all groups (e.g. Native American; Middle Eastern). 3. Quantitative studies showed that lack of doctor referral was a key barrier for several groups. Women also reported not being treated with respect by technicians. 27. Van de Venter (2020) Integrative review of strategies for fostering inclusive medical imaging environments for sexual and gender minority patient groups and radiographers Three themes identified: 1) Using inclusive language is important for creating inclusive health care environments for gender minority patients, e.g. using intake forms that ask for a patient's sex, identity, gender and expression, preferred pronouns, and other diversity characteristics, to facilitate non- judgemental interaction between patients and radiographers 2) Educating radiographers is critical to empower radiographers (pre- and post -qualifying) about addressing sexual and gender minority patients' needs, preferences and expectations. 31 3) Creating affirming health care environments can contribute to fostering an inclusive medical imaging environment 28. Vang 2018 Systematic review researching the scope and impact of mobile mammography programs in promoting mammographic screening participation among medically underserved women. 1. Mobile mammography clinics may be effective at reaching medically underserved women. 2. Adding patient navigation to mobile mammography programs may promote attendance at mobile sites and increase follow -up adherence. 3. Efforts to promote mammographic screenin g should target women from racial/ethnic minority groups, women from low -income households, and uninsured women. Art and Music Therapists 29. Daykin (2012) Systematic review on the impact of music making n the health, well -being and behaviour of young offenders and those considered at risk of offending. 1. Music making may be an important tool for the promotion of health and the prevention of offending in young people. 2. The impact of music making may be contingent upon the extent of 'ownership' felt by the young people taking part. 3. The impact of music making on young people in justice contexts may be limited by adherence to individualistic notions of creativity, emphasis on deviant biographies and behaviours, and detraction from wider questions of his tory, identity and resistance. 4. Successful interventions may allow young people to safely express their hopes, dreams and frustrations, and thereby offer a means of coping and asserting control over life. 30. Duffy 2014 Scoping review examining the use and effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among victims of IPA. 1. The review found little evidence for the benefits of CAM for IPA victims. 2. Findings suggest positive effects of music therapy and yogi c breathing; however, methodological limitations mean that these results should be interpreted with caution. 31. Fancourt (2020) Scoping review of the global evidence on the role of the arts in improving health and well -being, with a specific focus on th e WHO European region 1. Art therapy reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women. 2. Music therapy improves mood for mothers with post -partum psychosis. 3. Music and dance therapies reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among adolescents and improve individual and social well -being. 4. Music therapy improves symptoms for people with sleeping disorders. 5. Art therapy improves symptoms for people with severe mental illness in inpatient settings. 6. Art therapy improves the well -being of people with eating disorders. 7. Art therapy improves the well -being of people who have experienced trauma. 32. Uttley (2015) Systematic Quantitative Review & Qualitative Review of art therapy for 1. Art therapy appear s to have statistically significant positive effects compared with control in a number of studies in patients with different clinical profiles 32 people with non -psychotic mental disorders 2. Art therapy was reported to be an acceptable treatment and was associated with a number of benefits. A small number of patients reported varying reasons for not wanting to take part and, therefore, art therapy may not be a preferred treatment option for everyone. 3. Art therapy appears to be cost -effective versus wait -list, but confirmatory studies are needed to confir m this finding, as well as evidence to inform future cost -effective analyses of art therapy versus other treatments. Physiotherapists 33. Flores 2020 Narrative review describing healthcare disparities for Hispanic patients in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. 1. Disparities across common conditions and injuries in the physical medicine and rehabilitation literature, including poststroke rehabilitation, hip fracture treatment and rehabilitation, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury exist for Hispanic patients. 2. Hispanic patients may be at risk for worse outcomes after these conditions, because of low access to rehabilitation serv ices and disparities in the referral process. 3. Similar results are reported for pain management and Parkinson disease 34. Rathbone 2020 Scoping review exploring how sex and gender have been incorporated into low back pain (LBP) clinical practice guidelines (CPG). 1. CPGs did not consistently consider sex and gender differences in assessment, diagnosis or treatment of LBP. 2. Overall, there was no observable relationship between guideline quality and likeliness of integrating sex or gender terms. 3. When it was considered, sex and gender terms were used interchangeably, and considerations were primarily regarding pregnancy. 35. Yoshikawa 2020 Scoping review synthesizing information on the sociocultural factors influencing pain management between CALD patients with persistent pain and physiotherapists treating CALD patient. 1. Discordant perspectives on causation, pain management ap proaches, and patient autonomy in management are evident between CALD patients and physiotherapists. 2. Discordance may create stress in the therapeutic alliance and undermines the efficacy of pain management interventions. 3. Physiotherapy should foster cultural competence and equip physiotherapists with opportunities to maximise their sociocultural awareness, knowledge and skill practising physiotherapy in cultural plural societies. Podiatrists 36. To (2016) Systematic review summarising published literature concerning foot conditions and interventions associated with people who are homeless 1. Foot conditions/pathologies are prevalent in people who experience homelessness. 2. Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of interventions addressing foot conditions/pathologies (n= 1 in this review, not a clinical trial). This interventional study (n= 930 homeless individuals) were treated with removal of necrotic tissue, incision and drainage of infected areas/abscesses, wound care, antibiotics and analges ics as needed on a weekly basis by mobile health services, on average, over a period of 17.6 \u00b1 12 months. This study found improvement in 86% of participants, suggesting intervention effectiveness. 33 3. Access to foot care is suboptimal, with several studies sh owing that <50% of homeless people do not access services even if they needed them. Enhancing access to foot care could help to address mobility, function and hygiene issues, and could offer an opportunity to address other unmet health and social care need s. 34 Appendix 5: Stage 2 search flow diagram Figure A. 1 Stage 2 search flow diagram Records identified through database searching (n=1,723) Screening Included Eligibility Identification Additional records identified through other sources (n = 0) Records after duplicates removed (n = 1,690) Records screened (n = 1,690) Records excluded (n = 1,633) Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 57) Full-text articles excluded, with reasons (n = 28) Not transferrable to AHPs (n=16) Descriptive (n=8) Not a review (n=3) Methodological (n=1) Studies included in narrative synthesis (n = 29) "}
