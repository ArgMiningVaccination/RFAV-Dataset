When the chakras are balanced, the whole body works in harmony and we feel elevated, energized and with a great sense of wellbeing. Some of the issues that can be improved are back pain, low immune system, repeated injuries, bladder or bowel issues, digestive, reproductive, immune and skin disorders, thyroid problems, TMJ, eye strain, breathing issues, headaches, nervous disorders, emotional imbalances, low self esteem, eating disorders, lack of willpower, anger, anxiety and depression. Sound healing explained: Sound healing works on a cellular level. The vibrations of the sound move through the body through every cell to release energy blockages, emotions, old injuries and pain creating balance and restoring energy levels. Some of the many benefits of Sound Healing are: * Improves sleep and relaxation * Increases energy levels * Helps with chronic fatigue * Reduces stress, anxiety and depression * Improves your immune system * Brings about a zest for life * Boosts motivation and positivity * Releases negative experiences, feelings and emotions from the body * Balances hormones and mood; and * Eases tension and holding patterns in the body Bring along a yoga mat, blanket and pillow.
