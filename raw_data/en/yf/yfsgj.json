We believe that vaccines are safe and effective. As part of our preventative care philosophy we encourage that all of our patients are vaccinated. Vaccine Myths: - Does MMR cause autism? NO. Numerous large studies have been performed and there is no link between MMR, or any vaccine, and autism or any neurodevelopmental disability. - Can giving multiple vaccines at one time overwhelm a baby's immune system? NO. Babies are exposed to millions of bacteria from the time of birth. Healthy babies are constantly making antibodies against these bacteria and viruses. Vaccines use only a tiny portion of a baby's immune system's ability to form antibodies. Although children receive more vaccines than in the past, today's vaccines contain fewer antigens. - Isn't it better to space out the vaccines? NO. There is no evidence that spreading out the vaccine decreases the risk of adverse reactions. Delaying vaccinations only increases a child's susceptibility to disease. It not only requires extra visits, but also increases stress for the child, and fear of future visits. - Does thimerosal cause autism? NO. The form of mercury found in thimerosal is ethylmercury (EM), not methylmercury (MM). MM is the form that has been shown to damage the nervous system. Although there is no evidence that thimerosal causes any harm, in 2001 thimerosal was removed from vaccines as a precaution. - Are the ingredients in vaccines harmful? NO. Aluminum is used in some vaccines as an adjuvant to improve the immune response. It is the most common metal found in nature. Infants get more aluminum through breast milk and formula than vaccines. It is also quickly eliminated from the body. Formaldehyde is used to inactive a virus. The small amount left over from these steps is lower than the normal level of formaldehyde in our blood streams. Antibiotics are present in some vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination. Additives such as albumin or sucrose help the vaccine stay effective while being stored. Vaccines have small amounts of adjuvants, additives, or preservatives to keep them safe and effective. - Do children need vaccinations since the disease rates have dropped? YES. Unfortunately, all of these diseases still exist. With increased travel, an unvaccinated child is defenseless against preventable illnesses. [Click here to "}
