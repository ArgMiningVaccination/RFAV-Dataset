Is CBD legal?The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check [state laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx), especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. Cannabidiol (CBD) products have grown in popularity to help manage many ailments, such as pain and anxiety. As research investigating the benefits of CBD continues, some reports suggest that CBD may also be useful as a stimulant and provide a boost in energy. A quick look at the 5 best CBD products for energy - Best capsule: [Lazarus Naturals Energy Blend 25 mg CBD [Skip to review](http://focl) In this article, we will discuss the effectiveness of CBD in boosting energy and suggest some CBD products and alternatives people may consider trying to feel more energetic. The human body contains a complex network of neurotransmitters and cannabinoid receptors known as the [endocannabinoid system (ECS)](https://ovarianresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13048-018-0478-9) [Researchers believe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5877694/) While people may consider CBD a sedative rather than a stimulant, CBD appears to have a biphasic effect. This means that people may experience different effects or phases depending on the dosage they receive. According to [a recent study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11926-022-01077-3), lower doses of CBD may have a stimulating effect, while higher doses may have a sedative effect. [Research](https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/review-safety-low-dose-cannabidiol.pdf) suggests that high doses may increase sleep duration, while doses lower than 15 milligrams (mg) may have alerting properties. According to some other [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661819326143), CBD could potentially be useful as a wake-promoting agent. However, this will differ between people and depend on how each individual responds to CBD. Most people generally tolerate CBD well. However, some people may experience side effects depending on the dose. These side effects include, according to the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/what-you-need-know-and-what-were-working-find-out-about-products-containing-cannabis-or-cannabis) CBD may also interact with certain drugs. Therefore, people who take other medications should consult a doctor before using any CBD products. Using CBD for energy will vary depending on the product chosen. They may come in the form of capsules, energy drink mixes, bath bombs, or roll-ons.
