This protocol combines two techniques together, bringing the unique benefits of each to produce a powerful protocol that has really helped a lot of our patients. The technique begins with the dry needling protocol with the needles being positioned at the base of the skull in this instance. It is a painless procedure, almost akin to acupuncture. Once all the needles are in place, we bring out our Class IV cold laser. We then bring the laser over the needles to apply some laser energy into the tissue. The two techniques actually work on different areas of the complaint, to help relieve pain. There is no burning or any discomfort with this laser therapy, it is very comfortable although some patients have said they feel a slight warming sensation with the laser. The Laser Point procedure is a very simple procedure and is tolerated by a great many patients very easily. It has helped many to help manage or even eliminate their pain, could it help you too?
