Program Goals Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery is an innovative and interactive practice-based educational program that provides pharmacists with the skills necessary to become primary sources for vaccine advocacy, education, and administration. The program reviews the basics of immunology, identifies legal and regulatory issues pharmacists must consider before starting an immunization program, and focuses on practice implementation. The goals of this program are to: - Provide comprehensive immunization education and training. - Provide pharmacists with the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to establish and promote a successful immunization service. - Teach pharmacists to identify at-risk patient populations needing immunizations. - Teach pharmacists to administer immunizations in compliance with legal and regulatory standards. Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery is conducted in two parts: the self-study and the live training. To earn a Certificate of Achievement, participants must complete all components of the program including the self-study, the self-study assessment, the Pharmacy-Based Immunization Delivery live training seminar, the final examination, and the injection technique assessment. Self-Study Description and Learning Objectives The first part - the online self-study learning modules - is meant to ensure that all participants have an understanding of vaccine-preventable diseases and the role of pharmacists as vaccine advocates and administrators. There are five learning modules that present in-depth information on immunology, practice implementation, and legal and regulatory issues as noted below, with appropriate references to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) resource publication, Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Disease. The self-study program includes a self-assessment test and real-life case studies that are designed to help reinforce and evaluate participants' understanding of key information and concepts. Live Training Seminar Description and Learning Objectives The second part of the program\u2014the live training seminar\u2014provides an active learning experience that focuses on pharmacy practice implementation. The live training seminar is based on the experience of practitioners involved in immunization advocacy and administration. The training seminar reinforces and expands on the self-study program and addresses areas such as immunization needs, legal and regulatory issues, and injection-technique training. Participants will be expected to practice giving intramuscular and subcutaneous injections. After completing the live training seminar, participants will be able to: - Identify opportunities for pharmacists to become involved in immunization delivery. - Describe how vaccines evoke an immune response and provide immunity. - Identify the vaccines available on the U.S. market for each vaccine-preventable disease and classify each vaccine as live attenuated or inactivated. - Evaluate a patient's medical and immunization history and determine in the patient falls into the target groups for each vaccine based on the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations. - Review a patient case and determine patient-specific vaccine recommendations based on the appropriate immunization schedule. - Discuss the legal, regulatory, and liability issues involved with pharmacy-based immunization programs. - Describe the signs and symptoms of adverse reactions that can occur after vaccination - Describe the emergency procedures for management of patients with adverse reactions to vaccination. - List the steps for the appropriate intranasal administration technique for the live attenuated influenza vaccine. - Demonstrate appropriate intramuscular and subcutaneous injection technique for adult immunization. Program Completion Requirements To earn a Continuing Pharmacy Education (CPE) Credit and/or a Certificate of Achievement, participants must meet all the following requirements: - Read the self-study modules in their entirety and successfully complete the self-study assessment. A score of 70% or better is required. Participants may have a maximum of two attempts to achieve a passing score. - Attend a live training seminar offering and successfully complete the open-book final exam. A score of 70% or better is required. Participants may have a maximum of two attempts to achieve a passing score. - Demonstrate competency in one subcutaneous and two intramuscular injections as assessed by the faculty one to two weeks after the live Zoom class.
