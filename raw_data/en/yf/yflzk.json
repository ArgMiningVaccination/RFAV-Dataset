Long used in traditional Chinese medicine, turkey tail is packed with antioxidants and other health-boosting compounds. When taken as a supplement, turkey tail benefits may include the following: Boosted immunity Improved cognitive function Increased exercise performance Improved gut health Reduced inflammation Lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes This article discusses the potential uses and benefits of turkey tail. It also covers potential side effects and what to look for when purchasing turkey tail supplements. Dietary supplements are not regulated the way drugs are in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. Choose a supplement tested by a trusted third party, such as USP, ConsumerLabs, or NSF, when possible. However, even if supplements are third-party tested, it doesn't mean they are necessarily safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and check in about potential interactions with other supplements or medications.

Uses of Turkey Tail Supplement use should be suited to the individual and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. Turkey tail has well-documented uses for supporting immune function, reducing inflammation, improving gut health, and enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatments. Researchers are exploring how turkey tail may help balance blood sugar levels, boost athletic performance, fight viral and bacterial infections, and reduce fatigue. Some proponents of turkey tail believe it can prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and protect against age-related cognitive decline. Many studies investigating the potential medicinal benefits of turkey tail have been conducted using animal models or in lab settings. More clinical research is needed to determine the specific uses of turkey tail for human health. Benefits of Taking Lion's Mane Mushroom Promotes Immune Health Turkey tail contains a high concentration of two polysaccharides with immune-boosting PSP are immunomodulators that stimulate and balance the immune system to help the body fight infection, cancer, and other diseases. PSPs stimulate immune cell production to help fight and protect against infection. Research suggests that PSPs may promote the growth of monocytes\u2014a type of white blood cell that fights infection and improves immunity. Similarly, PSK helps support the immune system by activating the body's natural killer cells to fight off infection and disease. It has also been shown to modulate the body's immune response by suppressing inflammation, which may help protect against inflammatory diseases. Adjuvant Therapy for Cancer Turkey tail extracts have been used in Japan for decades as an adjuvant (additional) therapy for cancer treatments. These extracts are often combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy to boost the efficacy of these treatments and improve outcomes. A review of 13 clinical trials found that cancer patients given turkey tail in combination with standard treatments lived longer than those who received chemotherapy alone. The combination of turkey tail and chemotherapy was especially effective in improving outcomes for people with breast cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. Other studies have shown that turkey tail extracts not only inhibit the growth of some cancer cells but also improve immune function in people with certain cancers, which may reduce the risk of infection. Supports Gut Health Turkey tail may improve gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria that support healthy digestion. Turkey tail acts as a prebiotic, stimulating the development of \"good\" bacteria in the gut microbiome. Having a healthy, balanced gut microbiome is linked to improved digestive health, a strong immune system, and a lower risk of gastrointestinal disorders and diseases, In one small study, participants were given 3,600 milligrams (mg) of turkey tail PSP extract per day over eight weeks. Results showed that turkey tail extract increased the number of beneficial bacteria and suppressed the growth of potentially harmful bacteria. An earlier test-tube study found that turkey tail extract significantly increased the number of helpful bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, while reducing populations of \"bad\" bacteria, such as Clostridium and Enterococcus. May Boost Athletic Performance Turkey tail may boost stamina and fight fatigue to enhance athletic performance. A study using animal models found that turkey tail extract increased endurance and strength in mice. Moreover, the extract reduced physical fatigue in the mice and lowered blood sugar levels at rest and after exercise. Human trials are needed to determine what benefits turkey tail may offer athletes regarding endurance, strength, energy levels, and recovery. Other Benefits In addition to the health benefits listed above, some people use turkey tail to support: Bone health: Animal model research found that turkey tail extract resulted in thicker, less porous bones and may protect against bone loss related to certain cancer treatments. Cognitive function: Turkey tail is rich in antioxidants, which may improve cognitive function (e.g., memory, problem-solving) and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline. Healthy aging: The antioxidants and immune-boosting properties of turkey tail may help support health and protect against inflammation and age-related diseases. Balanced blood sugar levels: Studies using animal models show that turkey tail extracts may reduce blood sugar levels, improve insulin resistance, and prevent diabetes-related complications in people with type 2 diabetes. What Are the Side Effects of Turkey Tail? Turkey tail is safe to consume and generally well-tolerated, but some people may experience mild side effects, including: Bloating Dark stoolsDarkening of the fingernailsGasHeartburn Although turkey tail is safe for most people, it's important to speak with your healthcare provider before taking a turkey tail mushroom supplement.
