As a Grantee, the District receives five funding allocations from the following HUD programs: The Community Dev elopment Bloc k Grant Program (\"CDBG\"), the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (\"HOME\"), the \" National \" Housing Trust Fund Program (\"HTF\"), the Emergency Solutions Grant Program (\"ESG\") and the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS Program (\"HOPWA\"). The Department of Housing and Community Development (\"DHCD\") has been designated by the District of Columbia to receive and administer these entitlement funds, however, the ESG grant is received and administered by the Department of Human Services (\"DHS\" ) and the HOP WA grant is received directly and administered by the HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Administration of the DC Department of Health (\"DOH\"). As a designated Grantee, the District is required to submit to HUD, annually, a Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (\"CAPER\") 90 days following the end of the District's fiscal year, in accordance with 24 CFR 91.25. The FY 2019 CAPER is a summary of the accomplishments under the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2019 Annual Action Plan (AAP) that consists of narrative statements which explain the progress the District has made in carrying out the activities, goals , and objectives set forth in the FY 2019 AAP. The FY 2019 CAPER also describes the methods used to comply with federal regulations. In FY 2019, the District received $ 36,323,671.00 in federal funding from HUD , which generated $10,598,003.00 in program income . In addition, there were carryove r funds of $21,279,124 from FY 2018 and $131,722,227 in funds w ere made available through the Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) for affordable housing construction and rehabilitation . DHCD uses other local funds for preservation and other DHCD programs. Source of Funds Source Resources Made Available Amount Expended During Program Year CDBG public - federal $30,343,543 $27,348,599.77 HOME public - federal $11,607,632 $4,194,495.67 HOPWA $289,608.98 Other HPTF local $100,000,000 $146,908,466 Other public - local $31,722,227 30,486,566 Table taken from CR -15 6 Throughout FY 2019, housing was a priority for the District. In Mayor Bowser's 2nd Inaugural address in January 2019, she set forth a g oal to create an additional 36,000 housing units by 2025. Additionally, the Mayor's budget included historic levels of funding for affordable housing and preservation. On May 10, 2019 , Mayor Bowser signed the District's first Housing Order (\"the Order') t o establish a framework to meet the goals established in that 2nd Inaugural address. In the Order , the Mayor tasked several District agencies to identify new policies, tools, and initiatives to begin fulfilling the goal of creating 36,000 new housing units , 12,000 of them affordable, by 2025. The Housing Order focused on promoting fair housing, increasing the production of affordable housing units and analyzing the housing trends to create homeownership opportunities in the District. This document (the CAPE R) will lay out the accomplishments of specific programs that will assist the District in meeting its housing goals and revitalizing neighborhoods ; it will look at the progress made during the past year. Many partners within the District government work together to create affordable housing opportunities and supportive services for District residents. DHCD, along with DHS and DOH, work together to pro vide these housing and supportive services opportunities . In addition to creating housing , DHCD partnered with 21 non-profits to provide housing counseling services, tenant counseling services, legal services for seniors, small business technical assista nce and small business fa\u00e7ade improvements throughout the District. The CAPER will be submitted, electronically, to HUD no later than December 31, 2019, via the Integrated Disbursement and Information System. Prior to submission, DHCD will hold a public hearing on this document in accordance with the District's Citizen Participation Plan. The hearing will be held on Wednesday, November 20, 2019 at 6:30 pm at DHCD located at 1800 Martin Luther King Jr. SE, Washington, DC, in the Housing Resource Center.

DHCD has a homeowner housing rehabilitation program that uses Housing Production Partnership Trust (HPTF) and Local funds. In FY 2018/2019, no federal funds were used for the Single- Family Residential Rehabi litation Program (SF RRP). However, DHCD rehabil itated -family homes and expended $1,317,599. In addition, DHCD assisted an additional 12 1 households with direct financial assistance through the Employee Homeownership Assistance Program (EHAP) with local funds . CDBG funds were used with EHAP in the amount of $2,771,324 and assisted 116 homeowners . Progress the jurisdiction has made in carrying out its strategic plan and its action plan. 91.520(a) This could be an overview that includes major initiatives and highlights that were proposed and executed throughout the program year. In FY 2019, the Dis trict undertook many initiatives to assist in carrying out the goals outlined in the Consolidated Plan and the A AP. The District's programs expanded its out reach to the citizens by holding five public hearings, sponsoring the annual Housing Expo and updating 10 the 2011 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice. Additionally, DHCD continued to provide training for agency staff, sister agency staff , and non -profit organizations, while focusing on IDIS, CAPER Overview, Davis Bacon Training, Ethics Training for CBOs, and one-on-one technical support as needed for subrecipients, developers and other partners. The Development Finance Division \" DFD\" of DHCD , updated ( QAP ), provid ing training to development teams and work ing with the community to ensure that the scoring reflecting the supportive service needs of the community along with prioritizing the housing needs. Additionally, a consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) for afford able housing projects was revised to be consistent with the QAP and published in 2019. Comparison of the proposed versus actual outcomes for each outcome measure submitted with the consolidated plan and explain, if applicable, why progress was not made to ward meeting goals and objectives. 91.520(g) Categories, priority levels, funding sources and amounts, outcomes/objectives, goal outcome indicators, units of measure, targets, actual outcomes/outputs, and percentage completed for each of the grantee's pro gram year goals. The District is well on its way to making and exceeding its goals in the Consolidated Plan and AAP. The chart above reflects federal sources of funding, however, the District provided over $100 million dollars in local funding (HPTF) for affordable housing . This additional investment is critical to the success of creating and mainta ining affordable housing for District residents. At the start of the Consolidated Plan , the District had a larger allocation of federal dollars. With diminished federal funding local dollars were used more and more to support activities outlined in the plan. Narrative of Goals Promote Energy/Efficiency/Community Resilience: Single -Family Residential Rehabilitation Program (SFR RP) activities were funded with HPTF and not CDBG, due to limited resources and the need to maximize CDBG funds with the most underserved needs in the District. Assess how the jurisdiction's use of funds, particularly CDBG, addresses the priorities and specific objectives identified in the plan, giving special attention to the highest priority activities identified. The agency's priority need is affordable housing. Federal and local funds were used to retain the District's existing subsidized -housing stock while constructing new units to expand the supply of affordable units, as the agency was cognizant of the District's growing racial and ethnic 11 diversity. Federal funds have been restricted to household s earning 80 percent or less of the Area Median Income (AMI). Local HPTF regulatory requirements are 40 percent of funds to households earning under 30 percent of AMI; 40 percent of households earning under 50 percent of AMI; and 20 percent of funds to hous eholds earning under 80 percent or AMI. Subsi dized housing currently represents 26 percent of the occupied rental housing stock, although it is still not meeting the needs of residents. Nearly 46 percent of households in the District are housing -cost bur dened . Almost 60 percent of households in DC are renters. Most of the low -income housing is located in racially and economically segregated areas of the District. The need to both preserve existing affordable housing and expand the supply of housing is an overarching them e across many District -wide plans and working groups, including the Comprehensive Plan, Bridges to Opportunity, Sustainable DC, Housing Preservation Strike Force, and the Urban Institute Housing Needs Assessment for the District of Colum bia. This observation was noted by stakeholders as part of the citizen participation process. 12 CR-10 - RACIAL AND E THNIC COMPOSITION OF FAMILIES ASSISTED Describe the families assisted (including the racial and ethnic status of families assisted). 91.520(a) CDBG HOME HOPWA ESG HTF White 656 10 121 0 0 Black or African American 5358 176 851 0 0 Asian 151 2 8 0 0 American Indian or American Native 24 1 1 0 0 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 11 8 0 0 0 Asian & White 38 0 0 0 0 Black/African American & White 470 0 0 0 0 American Indian/Alaskan Native & White 9 0 0 0 0 American Indian/Alaskan Native & Black/Africa 57 0 0 0 0 Other multi -racial 1581 0 0 0 0 Total 8355 197 981 0 0 Hispanic 958 0 63 0 Not Hispanic 168 0 1,013 0 0 Table 2 - Table of assistance to racial and ethnic populations by source of funds Narrative 13 CR-15 - RESOURCES AND INVESTMENTS 91.520 (A) Identify the resources made available Source of Funds Source Resources Made Available Amount Expended During Program Year CDBG public - federal $30,343,543 $27,348,599.77 HOME public - federal $11,607 ,632 $4,194,495.67 HOPWA $289,608.98 Other HPTF local $100,000,000 $146,908,466 Other public - local $31,722,227 30,486,566 Table 3 \u2014 Resources Made Available Narrative The Department of Human Services (DHS) , which administers the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) Program is still finalizing its data collection for FY 2019, which is due November 30th. Since the CAPER must be published by November 15, 2019, to meet a December 31, 2019, statutory submission deadline , DHS will provide the ESG data to the public via the ESG CAPER, a separate document. In addition, DHS will provide the agency's numbers at the DHCD Public Hearing scheduled for November 20, 2019.

Through development fin ance, dispositions, and residential programming, the District has targeted neighborhood investments that affirmatively further fair housing choice across the city. DHCD seeks to create affordable housing that integrates neighborhoods racially, ethnically, and economically and diversifies the District's affordable housing supply to include higher -opportunity neighborhoods and Wards . 14 Leveraging Explain how federal funds leveraged additional resources (private, state and local funds), including a description of how matching requirements were satisfied, as well as how any publicly owned land or property located within the jurisdiction that were used to address the needs identified in the plan. A commitment of DHCD resources is often the catalyst used by commun ity-based organizations (CBOs) as the basis for their fundraising efforts and leveraging private dollars for even greater impact. With the endorsement and financial commitment of the District, organizations are greatly strengthened in their ability to obta in donations from the community, foundations, and the private sector. Additionally, District funds are often used as last-in \"gap financing\" to support important efforts after an organization's fundraising capacity has been reached. The District's housing and community development programs require, whenever possible, the maximum use of private financial resources. DHCD strives to be a gap financer for its selected projects , the private sector provides the bulk of each project's funds. DHCD funds close the gap between private funds and the project's development cost. DHCD also works in tandem with non -profit and quasi- governmental development organizations to leverage funds f or affordable housing and economic opportunity. The District uses federal funds as well as local resources to create, preserve and protect affordable housing and promote community development. The Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) has been administered by the DC Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) since 2002 and continues to serve as a key tool for preserving and developing affordable housing. The HPTF enables non- profit housing providers, mission - driven for -profit developers, and r enters wishing to exercise their right to purchase under the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) the needed funds to i mprove, purchase and develop the property for affordable housing. Strong guidelines ensure the program services the city 's diverse housing needs and funded units remain affordable for an extended period of time. Due to the high proportion of cost- burdened renters in the District, at least 50 percent of HPTF must be for rental housing. In Addition, trust fund dollars are required to target low -income residents: 40 percent of the funds shall be designated for assisting households with incomes under 30 percent of the area median income (AMI); 40 percent of the funds are designated for households with incomes less than 50 percent AMI; a nd 20 percent of funds are designated for households less than 80 percent AMI. 15 Units receiving funds from HPTF must remain affordable for a minimum of 40 years for rental units and a range between five and 15 years for ownership units. NHTF The National Housing Trust Fund (NHTF) is a federal affordable housing production program that will complement the existing District of Columbia efforts to increase the supply of affordable housing for extremely low -income households, including homeless fa milies and individuals, and persons with special needs. NHTF funding will be blended with other federal and local funding resources, including Project -Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) , to finance properties that include these units. The terms of competitive solicitations may specify deeper targeting and lower maximum rents for NHTF units than those in the federal Interim Rule. Over the summer, DHCD closed on 1736 Rhode Island Avenue NE. An agreement was executed to create sixty -one (61) new units of afforda ble housing. The unit mix will be thirty (30) one- bedroom units, twelve (12) two -bedroom units, and nineteen (19) three- bedroom units. Thirteen (13) of the proposed units, six (6) two -bedroom units , and seven (7) three- bedroom units will be set aside as Permanent Supportive Housing units with supportive services provided by Community of Hope. All housing units will be affordable to households earning at no more than 50% of the Median Family Income Reserved Units, and the 13 Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) units shall be restricted to households earning no more than 30% of the MFI. HOME Match All recipients of HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) Program funds must contribute or match no less than 25% of HOME funds spent on affordable housing. As funds are drawn down from HOME funds, the District incurs a match liability that must be satisfied by the end of each fiscal year and adds to the resources available for HOME -assisted projects. During this consolidated planning period, the District will use the HPTF for HOME match requirements. ESG Funds Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) fund match will be provided through local funds allocated for its Family Re -housing and Stabilization Program (RRH). The District invests over $24 million annually in the RRH program, the locally funded RRH program for families. Currently, through a contract with the Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, the District competitively awards RRH resources to com munity -based organizations, faith- based organizations, and other non- profit service providers. HOPWA Match While the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program does not have a match requirement, HIVAIDS, Hepatitis, STD, TB Administration's HOPWA program leverages local DC Appropriation, Federal Payment and federal -Ryan White funds to provide housing and support services to persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). 16 Program Income Program income dollars are collected monthly by DHCD, for both the CDBG and HOME programs. Program income is derived primarily from loan repayment provided to citizens to assist in the purchase of homes or from developers provided to assist in the development of affordable housing and non- housing community development pr ojects within the District. In DHCD FY 201 9, DHCD leveraged HOME funds for homeownership activities and one CHDO HOME project producing 64 affordable housing units. DHCD, acting on the recommendations of the DC Housing Preservation Strike Force, created a private -public preservation fund as one of six critical strategies to preserve affordable rental housing in the District. Funds from the program will provide short- term bridge acquisition and pre -development financing to eligible borrowers. Fiscal Year Su mmary - HOME Match 1.

The District made progress toward meeting the goals and outcomes it identified in the HUD 2018/DHCD 201 9 Fiscal Year Action P lan. DHCD also met its goal of strengthening homeownership among low - to moderate- income households through HPAP, which celebrated a 40 -year anniversary in 2018. DHCD closed on the HELP Walter Reed affordable housing project in the summer of 2018 after the transfer of the land from the federal government in late 2017 to the District. Construction of the Walter Reed affordable housing project moved forward and the housing units will be available for occupancy late 2019 /beginning 2020 . Lastly, construction continued in 201 9 on a CHDO HOME project known as \" The Maycroft\" which contains 64 affordable housing units . The Maycroft project includes a teen center; a family resource center; a food preparation area and market pantry for McKenna's 21 Wagon/M artha's Table which offers free meals to members of the community everyday of the year; and a Martha's Table Healthy Start Center. Jubilee Housing is the CHDO responsible for the Maycroft project and is exploring the establishment of a \"resiliency room\" which would be available to residents to gather to power cell phones, prepare food and refrigerate medicines in the event of an electrical grid shutdown. Discuss how these outcomes will impact future annual action plans. In future annual action plans, DHCD will focus more on its goal s to prevent and end homelessness and on preserving the existing supply and expanding the affordable -housing stock. DHCD's management plan is to strategically develop an outreach plan that will engage more non- profit organizations in the District to become qualified in becoming certified CHDOs. In 2019, DHCD identified a CHDO to receive CHDO Operating Assistance with an eligible HOME -funded project. DHCD will continue to consider offering CHDO operating assistance to certified CHDOs with eligible HOME - funded projects . Include the number of extremely low -income, low -income, and moderate -income persons served by each activity where information on income by family size is required to determine the eligibility of the activity.

DHCD committed over $130.3 million in affordable housing and community facilities gap financing during the FY19, including both federal and local sources such as HPTF. Another $1.8 million of 9% LIHTCs were allocated to projects. HPTF targets households at 30 percent AMI; 50 percent AMI; and 80 percent AMI. 22 CR-25 - HOMELESS AND OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS 91.220(D, E); 91.320(D, E); 91.520(C) Evaluate the jurisdiction's progress in meeting its specific objectives for reducing and ending homelessness through: Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their individual needs Through annual Point in Time (PIT) counts, street outreach and shelter in -reach efforts, the DC Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Continuum of Care (CoC) successfully conducted 6,205 assessments on individuals experiencing homelessness in FY1 9 and matched 1,272 individuals through the Coordinated Assessment a nd Housing Placement (CAHP) system to housing resources. Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons To better address the emergency shelter needs of families, DHS is developing smaller community - based shelters and r eplaced the existing family shelter located on the campus of D.C. General Hospital. DHS expects these smaller community -based shelters to reduce the amount of time families spend in shelter from an average of eight months to approximately 90 days by provid ing targeted assistance and quickly stabilizing families to prepare them for permanent housing. In partnership with the CoC, DHS also increased outreach efforts to unsheltered individuals through expanded hours for low -barrier shelters and enhanced case- management services. This expanded access will allow more individuals to access emergency shelter and provide increased opportunities for client engagement and targeted supportive services. In FY20, DHS is launching a coordinated street outreach network to connect unsheltered individuals to shelter systems and housing solutions while also working to im prove their health, safety, and quality of life through connections to support systems and services . Helping low -income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely low -income individuals and families and those who are: likely t o become homeless after being discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care (such as health care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions); and, receiving a ssistance from public or private agencies that address housing, health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs In FY HUD 2018/DHCD 2019, DHS continued to refine its strategies for diversion and exits for families who experience homelessness . DHS launched a new shelter diversion and rapid exit program for single adults. Project Reconnect will serve up to 200 individuals a year who 23 are 18 and over and are either new arrivals, non -recent returners, transitioning from system involvement, or fami ly engaged. DHS also worked to exit more families from shelter s into more permanent, stable housing and connect them with essential services such as employment and job training. At the \"front door,\" DHS is diverting more individuals and families instead of immediately placing them into the homeless system. DHS's prevention program for families continues to demonstrate extremely effective outcomes. Of the 2,390 families referred to prevention support services in FY HUD 2018/DHCD 2019, 90 percent were diverted from the homeless -shelter system. DHS continues to enhance the effectiveness of Rapid Rehousing (RRH) case- management services for families to increase touchpoints and include connections to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) employment -progr am providers. These changes contributed to an increase of exits in FY HUD 2018/ DHCD 2019 and decreased lengths of stay in the program in FY19. In FY HUD 2018/ DHCD 2019, DHS also expanded prevention and diversion services for at- risk youth through within the Youth Services Division (YSD). Because the vast majority of youth who experience homelessness return to live with a family member, DHS also expanded the support of family -reunification services. During FY HUD 2018/ DHCD 2019, the DHS YSD continued its community outreach to youth regarding available services for youth experiencing housing instability. The YSD prevention team also provided short -term case management to assist unstabl e housed youth in obtaining documents and referrals for services. Additionally, the YSD prevention team provided assessments and referrals for youth at the Adams Place Day Center. They also maintained a partnership with DYRS and provided services at the DYRS Achievement Center. Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time that individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were recently homeless from becoming homeless again In FY18, DHS continued its efforts to build an effective crisis -response system for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Through collaboration with the ICH and other partners, DHS is working to improve operations to quickly s tabilize and accelerate the connection back to permanent housing. During FY HUD 2018/ DHCD 2019, DHS built a cadre of RRH providers for individuals (six organizations with capacity up to 589 participants) and Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) providers (1 8 organizations with capacity up to 1,600 individuals and 700 families) to 24 allow for growth in these programs without case- management capacity constraints. DHS also assigned 140 individuals to Targeted Affordable Housing (TAH) and continues to refine the CAHP- system prioritization process. DHS also expanded services at the Adams Place Day Center to include the introduction of medical services provided by Unity Health Care and the doubling of computer workstation usage, barbering services , and laundry usage. The volume of visitors on a daily basis increased by approximately 50 percent. In FY19, DHS also launched the Day Services Center. In partnership with the Downtown BID, the Day Center provides a positive and protective environment, coordinated entry into the Continuum of Care, connections to services through case management, and therapeutic programming services for to up to 120 individuals experiencing homelessness per day . ICH, DHS, and DCHA continue to work with private and philanthropic partners to create a landlord risk -reduction fund and to launch a targeted landlord outreach/engagement effort. These efforts will facilitate access to housing for households with significant rental barriers (including active rental debt, poor credit, or prior evictio ns). 25 CR-30 - PUBLIC HOUSI NG 91.220(H); 91.320 (J) Actions taken to address the needs of public housing The District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) provides housing assistance through its federal Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) programs to over 20,000 households. DCHA's public housing Annual Contributions Contract ( ACC) portfolio consis ts of over 8,500 apartments or townhomes among 67 traditional public housing and mixed -finance developments serving families, seniors and non- elderly disabled individuals. In addition, the agency administers over 10,600 federally -funded vouchers through its HCV program. DCHA also manages 4,632 housing subsidies through the Local Rent Supplement Program (LSRP), a locally funded affordable housing program modeled after the federal voucher program. More than 3,400 local landlords are providing housing through the HCV program. The work of the agency is guided by its mission to provide quality affordable housing to extremely low - through moderate -income households, foster sustainable communities and cultivate opportunities for residents to improve their lives. In 2018, DCHA undertook a comprehensive review of the agency's real estate portfolio, comprising of 41 traditional public housing properties. In fall 2018, DCHA Executive Director Tyrone Garrett announced that significant portions of DCHA's public housing p ortfolio had deteriorated to such a condition as to be potentially un -inhabitable, or threatening to the health and safety of residents without urgent action. In response, on September 28, 2019 DCHA released for public comment the agency's draft plan \"Our People, Our Portfolio, Our Plan \u2014 DCHA's 20 -Year Transformation Plan\". The plan included staff recommendations for addressing the conditions and DCHA accepted comments during a 30 -day public comment period. Agency staff have met with residents, community groups, and key stakeholders across the city and updated the plan based on the feedback. The updated version of the plan will be presented at the DCHA Board of Commissioners meeting on November 21, 2019. In particular, DCHA identified 14 properties, comprising 2,610 units, as an agency priority. These 14 properties are in extremely urgent condition, with conditions that present physical and environmental hazards to residents. The proposed early action strategy will stabilize four of the 14 properties. As a follow -up to the early action strategy, DCHA proposes to pursue a longer -term strategy by utilizing tools made available by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that will allow for the comprehensive modernization and/or redevelopment of these sites: Rental Assistance Demonstration program and Section 18 Demolition/Disposition. Under this plan, much of this activity will require long -term relocation as a first step to improve the living conditions of residents. In the plan, DCHA staff recommends that these long -term relocations be facilitated by the use of tenant protection vouchers issued by HUD and made available by approved Section 18 Demolition/Disposi tion Applications . 26 In many respects, neither the challenge DCHA faces, nor the path that led DCHA to this moment, is unique. Like many of the nation's public housing authorities DCHA daily confronts the impact of decades of declining federal capital and op erating funding. The deterioration of the public housing stock across the country is accelerating simultaneously with HUD's announcement that it has no funding response to address long deferred maintenance. Like its counterparts, DCHA must engage private r esources and capital to fill this gap. DCHA is facing this challenge head on, not only to mitigate the negative impact of these unacceptable conditions on the residents, but also to ensure that solutions enhance residents' dignity and their rights. Action s taken to encourage public housing residents to become more involved in management and participate in homeownership Through the Office of Resident Services, DCHA provides technical assistance to elected Resident Councils in Public Housing and Rental Assis tance Demonstration (RAD) communities, including capacity -building activities, organizational support and resource coordination. The DCHA Board of Commissioners holds monthly meetings as public forums for public housing and HCV residents/participants, waiting list applicants and other stakeholders to provide input on agency management and existing/proposed agency activities, policies and programs. The public - housing and HCV families are represented by four members on the DCHA Board of Commissioners, includ ing three elected public -housing residents and an appointed HCV participant. To maximize resident access, Board of Commissioners' meeting locations rotate monthly between DCHA public housing communities and the DCHA central office. In addition, the Board h as standing committees that meet regularly. The agency holds public hearings, community meetings, and public -comment periods to discuss resident concerns and solicit input/ feedback on current and proposed policies, programs and activities. Agency staff pa rticipates at the request of resident leadership at Resident Council meetings and consults regularly with the resident District -wide Advisory Board, an elected body of resident leaders selected by Resident Councils. DCHA offers homeownership preparation pr ograms to eligible public -housing and Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) residents through its Family Self -Sufficiency program. Residents prepare for homeownership with the support of case management and benefit from incentives like a savings escrow account. DCH A works closely with DHCD to connect aspiring public -housing and HVC homeowners with resources like HPAP to become first- time homeowners. 27 DCHA's most recent efforts included community and resident engagement related to the agency's \"20 -Year Transformatio n Plan \u2014Our People, Our Portfolio, Our Plan\". A draft of the plan was made public for comment in September 2019 for a 30 day comment period. Prior to the draft plan being made public, Director Tyrone Garrett and DCHA senior staff held on- site meetings in J uly and August 2019 at 14 public housing properties considered to be in extremely -urgent condition. Each meeting focused on the specific possible short and long - term approaches for stabilizing that public housing community. Staff also offered information a bout the agency's approach to relocation and support of families throughout the process. Staff from the Office of Resident Services (ORS) also followed up with residents who attended and had expressed interest in being referred to services for credit couns eling, employment, and training options. A second round of community engagement meetings at 14 properties began in October 2019. Actions taken to provide assistance to troubled PHAs DCHA is not a troubled agency. In fact, the agency is one of only 38 publ ic-housing authorities nationwide designated as a Moving to Work (MTW) agency by HUD. This designation is based on an agency's ability to perform effectively in the management and delivery of affordable housing and related services under its purview. 28 CR-35 - OTHER ACTION S 91.220(J) -(K); 91. 320(I) -(J) Actions taken to remove or ameliorate the negative effects of public policies that serve as barriers to affordable housing such as land use controls, tax policies affecting land, zoning ordinances, building codes, fees and charges, growth limitations, and policies affecting the return on residential investment. 91.220 (j); 91.320 (i) The District focuses its strategies to remove barriers to affordable housing in order to: expand supply by both preserving existing affordable housing while adding new affordable housing units ; continue to streamline processes for both developers and residents who access the city's resources; and promote housing education and capacity building among residents, developers, and community -based partners. For more in -depth knowledge of the strategies, see the Consolidated Plan SP:55, which outlines the strategies . Actions taken to address obstacles to meeting underserved needs. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) DHCD h osted several trainings for staff and CBOs to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to meet the underserved living in the District of Columbia, such as: Green Building; Certified Occupancy Specialist Training for the CBOs; Age Friendly DC: Safe At Home Program; Small Business training; Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA); Housing Regulations Administrative training; Rent Control training; Language Access Training; Davis Bacon for Developers; Accessibility for developers and contractors . DHCD also h osted the annual fair housing symposium and the annual housing expo. Actions taken to reduce lead -based paint hazards. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) Single Family Residential Rehabilitation (SFRRP) administers loans and/or grants for home repairs to alleviate DC building code violations and assists homeowners in repairing physical threats to health and safety, and modify and/or eliminate barriers to accessibility for persons with mobility or other physical impairments. SFRRP helps households finance minor home repai rs that will : address building code violations, repair roofs, remove threats to health and safety, and modify and/or eliminate barriers to accessibility for persons with mobility or other physical impairments . In FY HUD2018/DHCD 2019, the Lead Safe Washington ( LSW ) team address ed lead - based- paint hazards and rehabilitation needs in residential single -family homes that were in the federal grant pipeline but were not able to be completed within the grant timeline. HPTF funds were used to complete these projects. Actions taken to reduce the number of poverty -level families. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) Through annual Point in Time (PIT) counts, street outreach and shelter in- reach efforts, DHS 29 and the CoC successfully conducted 6,205 assessments on individuals ex periencing homelessness in FY HUD 201 8/DHCD 201 9, and matched 1,2 72 individuals through the CAHP system to housing resources Actions taken to develop institutional structure. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) DHCD is working with DHS to develop an effective crisis -resp onse system, where people feel both safe and secure and are supported to quickly get back on their feet. Key areas of focus within this strategy include not only action items to improve the physical conditions of District shelters, but also actions to impr ove operations to ensure the District is able to more quickly stabilize families and individuals experiencing homelessness and accelerate the connection back to permanent housing. Increase Dedicated Supply of Supportive and Affordable Housing : Reducing the length of stay in the shelter is the key to meeting the annual demand for shelter s while at the same time reducing spending on shelter s. Reducing Barriers to Supportive and Affordable Housing : Having an adequate supply of housing does not help if clients are unable to access it. Increase Economic Security of Households : Economic security is particularly essential for households provided with RRH assistance. RRH is an important tool that helps people move quickly from a shelter back into permanent housing. In order to increase the success of families and individuals in the program, and to reduce the likelihood of a return back to homelessness, the District must provide targeted employment assistance to these households. While particularly important f or RRH households, increasing income is critical for all of the households served. Increase Homelessness Prevention Efforts : The District must implement evidence -based strategies to better target resources to those households most at -risk of becoming homel ess. In addition, the District needs to move further to stabilize high- risk households before they arrive at the shelter door. Actions taken to enhance coordination between public and private housing and social service agencies. 91.220(k); 91.320(j) The Ci ty Administrator and the Deputy Mayors have used periodic coordination meetings to align resources and activities to match mayoral administration priorities. This system provides for continuous consultation and coordination between agencies. DHCD hosted its 11th Annual Housing Expo and Home Show, where over 4,000 residents, social service agencies, and public and private housing agencies obtained information on services in the 30 District. The Expo was also an opportunity for agencies to learn more about the s ervices provided throughout Washington Metro area. DHCD coordinated project -level decision -making for affordable -housing projects that submitted proposals under the city's consolidated Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). The review panel considered over all resource constraints and made recommendations on which projects should be funded. After a thorough underwriting process, the project manager presented findings to a loan committee, who offered recommendations to the DHCD Director on whether to approve funding. The Interagency Council on Homelessness ( ICH ) is a group of cabinet -level leaders, providers of homeless services, advocates, homeless and formerly homeless leaders that inform and guide the District's strategies for meeting the needs of individua ls and their families who are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. The Age -Friendly DC Task Force is made up of community members and District Government cabinet members with extensive knowledge in at least one of the following subject areas: outdoor spaces and buildings; transportation; housing; social participation; respect and social inclusion; civic participation and employment; communication and information; community support and health services; emergency preparedness and resilience; and elder abuse, neglect, and fraud. The Task Force and subcommittees continue to meet regularly to track and monitor progress and streamline programs and services. Sustainable DC Interagency Task Forces were developed to provide a plan to make the city the healthiest, greenest, and most livable city in the United States. Partnership for Healthy Homes was established to have a collaboration of multiple District agencies and private -sector partners to focus on identifying homes containing both children and any of a wide range of health and/or safety threats. Identify actions taken to overcome the effects of any impediments identified in the jurisdiction's analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. 91.520(a) In FY 2019, DHCD completed its annual update to the District's 2011 Analysis of Impediments (AI) to Fair Housing Choice Plan, known simply as the AI. The District's AI provides information to the community regarding the obstacles citizens face with equal housing opportunity and fair housing choice with in the District of Columbia. The District completed annual renewal AI and will be submitted to HUD at the end of the 2019 calendar year . This document will provide an extensive review of activities to -date which addressed previous impediment findings, as well as, an in -depth analysis of current market changes and 31 demographic shifts which have created additional impediments to equal access to housing. In addition, the District has partnered with the Metropolitan Council of Governments (MWCOG) to complete a regional Analysis of Impediments with surrounding jurisdictions in Virginia and Maryland to coincide with the deadline for submitting the Consolidated Plan to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban D evelopment (HUD) . For a complete update on the Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, see the attached 2019 CAPER Fair Housing Analysis of Impediments Update. DHCD continues to prioritize non- housing neighborhood investments in Racial/Ethnic Concentrated Areas of Poverty. DHCD strives to produce affordable- housing opportunities and targeted neighborhood investments that increase racial and ethnic diversity. 32 CR-40 - MONITORING 9 1.220 AND 91.230 Describe the standards and procedures used to monitor activities carried out in furtherance of the plan and used to ensure long- term compliance with requirements of the programs involved, including minority business outreach and the comprehensive planning requirements DHCD monitoring is conducted in c ompliance with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (\"Uniform Guidance\" ). Monitoring is designed to determine the grantee's level of performance and production of gran t deliverables, and compliance with federal and /or District requirements. Subrecipients are required to adhere to the principles of the Uniform Guidance as incorporated by the HUD regulations (24 CFR part 84). DHCD has i ncorporated many of these requirements in its Administrative Instructions , grant agreements and loan documents. DHCD approaches monitoring in a collaborative approach between the Office of Program Monitoring (OPM), the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Portfolio and Asset Management Division (PAM D)and the divisions managing each program. DHCD takes a holistic approach to the monitoring of its activities by reviewing each activity (program, grant, loan, etc.) prior to funding and closing, monito ring the activity for compliance with the grant or loan documents and monitoring DHCD assisted assets. Each division responsible for the funded activities is responsible for managing the project/program deliverable pursuant to the grant or loan or agreement as prescribed by a Scope of Work or Work Plan (if applicable). Throughout this process DHCD must: (1) determine the relative depth and frequency of review of each grantee; and (2) describe the process and criteria used to select and priori tize grantees for monitoring. Project Managers routinely monitor projects for the following: (1) financial management; (2) programmatic compliance; and (3) OPM, PAMD , and OCFO collaboratively monitor grantees performing an internal compliance review of DHCD -assisted activities. These duties are in addition to overall grant management, technical assistance, or any other function related directly to project administration. This may include desk audits, site visits and providing technical assist ance to agency staff as well as subrecipients. Citizen Participation Plan 91.105(d); 91.115(d) Describe the efforts to provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on performance reports . DHCD displays its draft of the CAPER on the agency's website for the public to view. This year DHCD conducted a Needs Assessment Hearing and 2020 Action Plan Public hearing and will host a hearing on the Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report 33 (CAPER) in November 2019 . The hearings were announced in local newspapers, the DHCD newsletter, social media and via notices sent to the organizations with which the agency does business. At DHCD's 1 1th Annual Housing Expo and Home Show, citizens were able to communicate with staff members one -on-one and voice their opinions on the goals the agency had set for the fiscal year. Citizens were also allowed to present comments to the staff of DHCD and government officials who were present. At the hearings, citizens are allowed to provide comments, testify, and ask questions. During the hearings the citizens can view copies of the draft and are given sufficient time to submit written comments on DHCD's performance either by mail or email that has been established by DHCD specifically for the CAPER. For more information on the District's CAPER or to register for the public hearing, please send an email to opm.questions@dc.gov , or call 202 -442-7239. The hearing will be held on Wednesday, November 20, 2019 at 6:30pm at DHCD located at 1800 Martin Luther King Jr. SE, Washington, DC, in the Housing Resource Center. For more information or to register for the public hearing. 34 CR-45 - CDBG 91.520( C) Specify the nature of, and reasons for, any changes in the jurisdiction's program objectives and indications of how the jurisdiction would change its programs as a result of its experiences. DHCD does not anticipate any changes with its program objectives. DHCD has had great success in developing af fordable housing units and meeting the needs of the communities in the District. DHCD will continue to build partnerships internally and externally to do more in the District to ensure that residents will have affordable housing units along with a variety of amenities necessary in today's economy. Does this Jurisdiction have any open Brownfields Economic Development Initiative (BEDI) grants?

Table 14 36 Provide an assessment of the jurisdiction's affirmative marketing actions for HOME units. 92.351(b) The District has developed an affirmative marketing plan modeled after the HUD Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan (AFHMP), which is mandated for all program services, acquisition and construction units funded by DHCD. The certification process ensures its grantees and funding recipient's adhere to affirmative marketing principles and thus increases the number of residents that benefit from all of DHCD's services. DHCD implements a similar AFHMP for non -housing projects and program services. DHCD's aff irmative marketing process for programs and projects is implemented through a certification process. For a program or project, each grantee/sponsor must provide certifications that it will comply with applicable fair housing, accessibility, and equal oppor tunity civil rights laws and regulations. In DHCD FY19, DHCD approved and committed HOME funds to one project for which it approved affirmative marketing activities to ensure housing opportunities were provided to the least likely individuals or communities to know about the available housing due to geographical, language or other barriers. DHCD assesse d the affirmative marketing programs for projects and programs based upon two prongs: (1) for construction projects -its marketed actions were assessed based upon the number of targeted groups or individuals including persons with disabilities who rent or buy a unit in the funded project; and (2) for programs -it was based upon the increase of \"target\" individuals recorded as having benefited from the program service. DHCD continued to make its programs available through partnerships with various community based non- profit organizations that target all District residents as well as specific communities, such as African American, Hispanic/Latino and persons with d isabilities . Refer to IDIS reports to describe the amount and use of program income for projects, including the number of projects and owner and tenant characteristics HOME program Income was used to provide downpayment assistance to 12 first-time homebuyers who purchased homes in the District. Program Income was also used in the development of a CHDO HOME funded project which will have 64 units of affordable housing. Describe other actions taken to foster and maintain affordable housing. 91.220(k ) (STATES ONLY: Including the coordination of LIHTC with the development of affordable housing). 91.320(j) The District continued to leverage available local and federal housing development programs funds whenever possible. DHCD coordinate d with the DC Ho using Finance Agency (DCHA) in the allocation for its low -income housing tax credit (LIHTC) funds through a memorandum of understanding (MOU), working in tandem with non- profit and quasi - governmental development organizations to leverage funds for affordab le housing. 37 CR-55 - HOPWA 91.520(E) Identify the number of individuals assisted and the types of assistance provided The table below report s on the one -year goals for the number of households provided housing through the use of HOPWA activities for: short- term rent, mortgage, and utility assistance payments to prevent homelessness of the individual or family; tenant -based rental assistance; an d units provided in housing facilities developed, leased, or operated with HOPWA funds.

Changes to policy, funding, and regulation seek to promote housing choice and racially and economically integrated neighborhoods and accommodate a diverse population of individuals and families in light of DC's changing demographics. As Mayor Muriel Bowser often states, whether your family has been here five minutes or five generati ons there should be housing opportunities for you in DC. An updated AI was completed in late 2019 which utilizes the Assessment to Fair Housing (AFH) format. DHCD engaged the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (an organization founded by former Attorney General Robert Kennedy) and the Poverty & Race Research Action Council. During the development of the document DHCD and the contractors engaged in outreach with the community and stakeholders to obtain qualitative (stakeholder feedback and intervi ews) data in addition to the required quantitative data analysis. As part of the Needs Assessment process for the development of the 2020 Action Plan, DHCD reserved time for the discussion of the AI: contractors led a discussion and presented on the AI pro cess. Additionally, a fair housing survey was conducted at our 11th Annual Housing Expo as part of the public engagement process. A draft document presented by the contractors to the District was released for public comment on September 28, 2019. DHCD enga ged in four hearings to get feedback from the community on the draft document. The District anticipates incorporating comments and submitting the document to HUD in late 2019 or early 2020. The District is currently engaged in a regional Analysis of Imped iments to Fair Housing Choice with the Metropolitan Council of Governments and surrounding jurisdictions. Our partners are Alexandria, Arlington County, Fairfax County, Loudon County, City of Alexandria, City of Falls Church, Prince William County and Montgomery County. Advisory participants include Prince George's County, City of Bowie, City of Rockville, City of Gaithersburg, as well as Public Housing Authorities for the Cities of DC, Alexandria, and Rockville as well as Montgomery County and Fairfax County. The last regional effort was over 25 years ago. The planned submission date for the Regional AI is 2021. What follows is a restatement of each impediment to fair housing outlined in the 2011 AI and a response briefly summarizing some of the ways DC ha s responded toward overcoming that impediment. 50 Impediment #1 : The entrenched dual housing market within and around the District of Columbia is responsible for the levels of housing segregation in both the District and the counties that surround it. There i s one housing market for African Americans and another for everybody else. The result is a highly segregated District of Columba where one- third of the city's 39 neighborhood clusters are 93 percent or more African American and just three clusters have pro portions of Caucasians and African Americans close to what would be expected in a free housing market lacking discrimination. Due to the extreme difference in the median incomes of the District's White and Black households, this racial segregation is accom panied by economic segregation.\" In 2017 and 2019 DHCD revisited its Qualified Allocation Plan and revamped its Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) to use DC's federal and local affordable housing funds to reduce historical patterns of segregation and mitigate those that would emerge from the changing DC housing market. Th e QAP and RFP also removed points for a local elected official support of projects. Geographic targeting is used to select preferred projects in the RFP under the \"Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH)/Geographic Targeting\" and \"Transit Proximity\" priority scoring points. Using an index of housing costs (combining relative rents and home prices) and the presence of rail transit, DHCD seeks to incentivize proposals that produce o r preserve affordable housing in high -opportunity neighborhoods, those with characteristics such as low crime, low poverty, and access to high- quality schools and jobs. The aim is to provide a counterbalance to the implicit incentive for developers to buil d affordable housing in low -cost and high -poverty neighborhoods and as a consequence enhance economic, racial, and ethnic diversity. DC continues to support the enforcement of the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) \u2014and acquisition and critical -repair funds to advance housing opportunities and mitigate displacement. Furthermore, DHCD drafted final regulations for the District Oppo rtunity to Purchase Act (DOPA) in FY2018 and implemented DOPA in 2019. The Act requires rental property owners to provide the Mayor with the opportunity to purchase housing accommodations consisting of five or more rental units, as long as 25 percent or more of the rental units are \"affordable.\" DOPA offers of sale should be submitted concurrently with, but are subordinate to, a tenant's right to purchase under TOPA. DOPA purchase opportunities are announced by DHCD and developers who meet the criteria wil l are invited to respond to those requests. The developers must comply with DOPA's requirements by maintaining and increasing the number of, affordable units in the property. Since Implementing this law DHCD has exercised its DOPA rights 15 times in order to preserve existing affordable housing. 51 Housing opportunity is also promoted through the Property Acquisition and Disposition Division (PADD) at DHCD. DC is able to dispose of problematic or blighted properties offering them the development of affordable and workforce housing or other amenities that stabilize neighborhoods. This not only creates affordable housing and assisted homeownership but also removes blight and promotes greater economic development in at - risk neighborhoods. A similar process through the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) governs the disposition of other DC- owned properties that will result in a multifamily property of 10 units or more. If the multifamily units are located within a half -mile of a Metrorail station or Priority Corridor Network Metrobus Route, 30 percent of the units are now required to be affordable. If the property is outside these transportation opportunity areas, 20 percent are required to be affordable. Increased economic and r acial and ethnic diversity is also being accomplished through DC's Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) program. This program has generated 614 affordable units since its inception. Since these units are in larger new, market -rate developments they are in neighborhood s that are either established as high opportunity areas or in areas that are receiving investment and are becoming higher opportunity areas . With few exceptions, the units are allocated by a lottery open to all eligible applicants further limiting the instances of steering and creaming of applicants in the program. In the rare instances where the lottery is not used the developer must submit a fair housing marketing plan. The District has also made numerous improvements to its homeownership programs. The base amount of assistance for the lowest income -eligible recipients has been increased to $80,000 and repayments have been deferred for all but the highest income recipients until the home is sold or refinanced or no longer occupied by the recipient. An addi tional program administrator, the DC Housing Finance Agency, and many other process improvements have meant a dramatic increase in the utilization of the program, particularly increasing homeownership in the eastern Wards of the city. In FY 2019, DHCD inve sted $ 21 million assisting 397 households through the Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP) and the Employer Assisted Housing Program (EAHP). Lastly, home seekers are able to find housing throughout DC, including accessible housing for persons with disab ilities in the neighborhood of their choice, by searching the www.DCHousingSearch.org web page. DC's Affordable Housing Locator has been updated continuously since 2014, thereby ensuring that private and non -profit development partners are including all of their available affordable units on the site. Private -sector developers who are not i n partnership with DHCD are also encouraged to list their affordable housing units. This web and phone- based application was refreshed, redesigned and relaunched at DC's Housing Expo in June 2018. 52 Impediment #2 : As noted in Chapter 3, it is likely that ra cial steering \u2014a practice prohibited by the Fair Housing Act \u2014has contributed to much of the racial segregation in the District. The District's own fair housing law substantially expands the number of protected classes beyond the nation's Fair Housing Act. A s recounted earlier, reported acts of housing discrimination likely represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. DC's private, non -profit , and public sectors have made strides in providing outreach and increasing awareness regarding diversity and cult ural awareness in relationship to equal housing opportunity. For example, the Equal Rights Center (ERC), a civil rights non- profit advocacy organization, has dedicated training for private -sector partners on fair housing. ERC trains the housing industry in equal -opportunity matters such as the fair housing responsibilities of multifamily owners, as well as accessibility and source of income protections, and provides on line courses about fair -housing protections and criminal -record screening. The National As sociation of Realtors offers a curriculum on diversity for all members as continuing education. These efforts combined with the enforcement actions of the Office of Human Rights (OHR) and federal agencies assist in mitigating further discrimination in the metropolitan area. To mitigate the evident racial and ethnic segregation described in the AI, ERC conducts paired testing in the metropolitan area. The purpose is to uncover unfair housing practices and provide an equal playing field for home seekers of a ll protected categories, regardless of their income status. In 2015, ERC conducted 464 fair housing tests and increased its corporate trainings (in the housing industry) by 7 percent over the previous year. It also partnered with OHR and 17 other organizations to engage residents and businesses in a day - long awareness campaign on disability issues. In order to bring greater awareness of the housing issues in the LGBT elder community, ERC partnered with a national organization and published an informational tool kit for the LGBT elder community who face housing discrimination. Housing is linked to cross -cutting civil rights issues such as transgender and gender equality, immigrant and language access, and accessibility for persons with disabilities. Since 201 2, OHR has conducted media campaigns to educate the public on fair housing as a right, inform residents of language- access laws for Limited English Proficient DC residents, promote respect for transgender and gender identity, publicize contributions by imm igrants in creating a more diverse city, and encourage businesses and places of public accommodations to be more accessible to person with disabilities. More recent media campaigns have focused on gender equality for women and anti - discrimination in the M uslim community. OHR has also hosted a TEDx MidAtlantic Salon talk on gender equality. These Employment and Public Accommodations campaigns have had the added result of bringing attention to the obstacles faced by residents within these 53 groups when seeking housing opportunities. The relationship between employment and housing is symbiotic and the lack of one diminishes opportunity in the other. DC has also used its long running Annual Fair Housing Symposium, a partnership among DHCD, OHR, ERC, and the DC D evelopmental Disabilities Council, as a mechanism to inform and educate residents, community -based services providers, industry professionals , and government agency personnel on incorporating and abiding by fair housing principles as a means to promote racial, ethnic and economic diversity. Impediment #3 : Discrimination against African Americans and, to a lesser extent, Latinos in issuing conventional and FHA loans continues unabated in the District as it does throughout the nation. The DC Department of I nsurance, Securities, and Banking (DISB) not only protects consumers by offering regulatory supervision of financial services companies, firms, and individuals doing business in DC, but it also has the directive to develop and improve market conditions to attract and retain financial services firms in the city, at times balancing conflicting interests and real consequences for DC residents. In the upcoming AI that will commence in 2019, DC will provide an analysis of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data as it pertains to DC and its surrounding metropolitan area to show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of DC. As a predecessor to the AFH, an analysis of HMDA data would shed light on lending patterns that may be discriminatory and provide DC officials' critical information that would inform policies and decision making. Notwithstanding the lack of updated HMDA data to factor current mortgage lending discrimination, DC has moved forward in educating residents about their rights regar ding mortgage lending and insurance, how to avoid becoming victims of fraud and how to file grievances. The DISB Foreclosure Mediation Program, which began in May 2011 as a result of the \"Saving D.C. Homes from Foreclosure Amendment Act of 2010, \" has been very successful in reducing foreclosures: from 1,349 in 2010 to 114 in 2014. Other foreclosure prevention efforts are made available to DC residents through the $4.4 million District portion of the National Mortgage Settlement, which provides consumer rel ief those effected by abusive mortgage loan servicing prior to the national mortgage reforms that were passed in 2012. DISB partnered with a DC community -based organization, Housing Counseling Services, Inc. (HCS), to provide legal aid to homeowners facing foreclosure, create a hotline for distressed homeowners, and provide help for residents in accessing money they are eligible for through the settlement. In addition, HCS launched a media campaign to inform residents of DC resources and the Foreclosure Pr evention Hotline. This campaign prevented many DC residents from losing their home, thus precluding residents from adding to the economic segregation prevalent in the city. Furthermore, DISB increased financial literacy for 54 unbanked and under -banked reside nts who often rely on expensive check -cashing centers and payday lenders to become users of \"Bank on DC\" accounts from participating mainstream financial institutions. DISB continues to explore ways of decreasing 'banking deserts' predominantly in minority neighborhoods DISB engaged the community and business sector to improve education on insurance and financial scams and foreclosures and in 2013 DISB initiated two enforcement actions to protect D C investors. These initiatives were focused particularly on seniors: one against an investment company targeting seniors and a second against an individual selling fraudulent investment. In 2014 DISB began using the National Mortgage Licensing System to manage all money - related transaction licenses and registratio ns. This action allows DC to have a single -entry point for coordinating licensing of all DC financial- service providers and mortgage licensees and registrants. Additionally, since the passage of the Dodd -Frank Act, DISB has increased the number of firms under its regulatory directive. The Act authorizes DC to license investment advisors managing assets of $100 million or less, up from $25 million or less. This transition allows DC to have greater control and regulation over securities here and to increase i ts impact on residents and businesses. Impediment #4 : The relatively high cost of housing continues to pose a barrier to fair housing choice in the District by fostering economic segregation and the racial segregation that accompanies it due to the median income of the District's non- Hispanic White households being so much greater than the median income of African American households. While wealthier Caucasians have been moving into neighborhoods that had been overwhelmingly African American, gentrificatio n has accompanied this in -migration, leading to higher housing costs and displacement of a substantial percentage of residents with lower incomes who, in the District of Columbia, are disproportionately African American. In addition, the District's supply of rental housing is rapidly shrinking. More than a third of the District's rental stock was lost between 2000 and 2010. One -fourth of all District tenants are spending more than half of their income on rent, in part due to the shortage of rental dwellings . Unless lower -cost and moderate- priced rental housing can be preserved and new affordable units built in these gentrifying neighborhoods, racial and economic integration will be a very short -lived experience. To meet its commitment to increase affordable housing and create diverse neighborhoods, the DC's Mayor and Council have committed over $100 million of Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) monies for each of the last four years. Since 2009, the District has invested nearly one third of a billion dollars from the HPTF \u2014the largest trust fund of its kind per capita in the nation. In FY19 alone, almost 1,246 affordable units were produced or preserved by DHCD resources, including the HPTF. Since 2015 DHCD has funded 113 55 projects totaling over $613,000,000 in both local and federal resources to preserve and create 8,325 housing units. These numbers are augmented by the implementation of regulatory programs and negotiations such as the I) and Affordable Dwelling Units (ADUs), the usage of Planned Unit Develo pments (PUDs) , and increased investments in HPAP, DC continues to expand affordable housing. Additionally, in order to preserve affordable housing, the public -private DC Housing Preservation Fund ( DCHPF) was created and funded with $10 million and will at a minimum leverage an additional $30 million . Administered by the Washington, DC Low -Income Initiative Support Corporation (LISC -DC) and Capital Impact Partners, t he DCHPF will complements DC's preservation efforts by providing additional funds that are also easier to deploy and more flexible to aid acquisitions and predevelopment in a high- cost housing market. The DCHPF was created as a result of one of six recommendations /action items provided in the 2016's DC Housing Preservation Strike Force's final report. The Strike Force was formed in 2015 and included an 18 -member team comprised of housing experts and selected stakeholders from the public to promote the preservation of the current affordable housing stock. DC acknowledges that preserving and creating affordable housing, precursors to advancing economic, racial , and ethnic diversity, may be at risk due to loss of subsidized housing with an additional 13,700 units with subsidies that will expire by 2020. Hence, the Mayor charged the Strike Force with developing a proactive, multi -pronged strategy and action plan to preserve DC's existing affordable housing covenants set to expire by 2020. The six recommendations presented to the Mayor were: (1) establishing a \"Preservation Unit;\" (2) creating a public -private preservation fund; (3) expanding resources to preserve small properties; (4) adopting DOPA regulations; (5) advancing preservation through TOPA; and (6) enhancing pr ograms to allow low -income seniors to age in place. As a result of the Strike Force recommendations, DC has form ed a Preservation Unit working group comprised of intra -government partners, housing industry, advocates , and D C residents. Also, DC appointed i n March 2018 the first Housing Preservation Officer within DHCD to discuss, learn , and analyze how to best preserve and expand affordable housing. Through the creation of DCHPF, DC anticipates the development of a public -private partnership that would invest early and inject AFFH principles to the process of \"Preserving the affordability of 100 percent of its existing federally and city -assisted affordable rental homes.\" Since the creation of the Preservation Unit the District has found that the funds are leveraged 3 to 1 by the public private partnership thus providing additional opportunities to preserve existing affordable units. 56 The District has also enacted several programs tax and rent control provisions meant to reduce the rent and housing cost press ures on its elderly and disabled population. These range from lowering allowable rent increases in rent- controlled apartments, to deferring property taxes and providing home modifications and repairs to allow households to remain in place. In Mayor Bowser' s 2nd Inaugural address in January 2019, she set forth a goal to create an additional 36,000 units by 2025. On May 10, 2019 Mayor Bowser signed the District's first Housing Order to establish a framework to meet the goals established in the Inaugural addr ess. The Housing Framework for Equity and Growth (HFEG) (the website with the report link here is: https://housing.dc.gov/page/housing -dc-publications provides goals for the equitable distribution of affordable housing in Washington, DC, supporting the vision for creating 36,000 new housing units by 2025. The report is the first in a series that will comprise the Housing Framework for Equity and Growth. The framework will examine factors a cross multiple scales, design typologies, and resident experiences to generate recommendations that can increase housing affordability and opportunity for all residents. In late September 2019 DHCD and the Office of Planning (OP) engaged the public to disc uss the distribution of affordable units in the District at a Community Conversation: Housing Framework for Equity and Growth at the Ron Brown High School. Impediment #5 : As explained beginning on page 154, more than 12,000 units of new development have been exempted from the District's inclusionary zoning requirements because they were in the pipeline when the inclusionary zoning act went into effect. But their exemptions should have expired because ground has not yet been broken for these buildings. The District, however, has routinely granted extensions that have kept these developments exempt from the city's inclusionary zoning requirements. Some of these developments were allegedly submitted to avoid being covered by the new inclusionary zoning provis ions. At this juncture, DC is steadily providing increased economic opportunity and racial diversity through the IZ program. The program was slow to start in 2009, but to date it has generated 1,006 affordable units. In addition, in FY 16 the District changed the program to facilitate using the program to reach lower -income residents. Changes made by the Zoning Commission restrict IZ rentals to families earning up to 60 percent of AMI while IZ homeownership units will be restricted to families earning up to 80 percent of AMI. DHCD subsequently amended the IZ regulations in early FY2018 in order to effectively implement these changes and modernize the program . Streamlining the application procedures and making criteria more flexible further increased the potentia l for this program to serve to counteract barriers to fair 57 housing. The program continues to grow and evolve by providing diverse housing opportunities to residents who may have previously lived in low poverty and racially concentrated areas of DC. Impediment #6 : The District's zoning ordinance imposes significant obstacles to accessory apartments, a cost -effective way to provide housing affordable to individuals and households of modest means and to enable households with declining incomes to remain in their homes. As explained in Chapter 3, many of the zoning provisions likely discourage home owners from even applying to create an accessory apartment. This obstacle was removed in September 2016 when DC adopted new zoning regulations that facilitated the cr eation of accessory apartments. The issue of ADUs primarily affected residents who needed to have elderly parents reside with them, a person with disabilities have a dwelling unit with a no -step entrance, or simply a unit to house a growing family. The new zoning regulations, in Title 11 Subtitle U Chapter 2, provide for: (1) the existence of the dwelling unit as a matter -of-right use for single -family zones not requiring approval of DC's Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA); (2) a minimum principal dwelling s ize between 1,200 and 2,000 sq. ft.; (3) the gross floor area that an accessory apartm ent may occupy expanded from 25 percent to 35 percent of the principal structure; (4) the entrance to the accessory apartment permitted to face the street depending on th e zone and subject to conditions; (5) the apartment to be in an accessory building provided there is proper access for health and safety; (6) home occupations permitted within the accessory apartment subject to limitations; and (7) BZA -provided special exc eption flexibility for up to two requirements without the need of a variance. Impediment #7 : The only reference in the District's comprehensive plan that even hints at achieving stable, racially integrated neighborhoods is a fairly generic statement, \"On a neighborhood level, the recent housing boom has challenged the District's ability to grow a city of inclusive and racially and economically diverse communities.\" The city's plan has no goals, objectives, or policies that seek to achieve stable, racially i ntegrated neighborhoods, which in the District would also require economically diverse housing because the median income of African Americans is just 37 percent that of Caucasians. The District is currently engaged in amending its Comprehensive Plan. The p revious Comprehensive Plan was amended in 2011 during a period of tremendous growth. As part of the amendment process, DHCD and the public have proposed numerous amendments to expressly address the impediments to fair housing identified by the AI. In 2019 DHCD and the OP have worked together to discuss the Comprehensive Plan and its interrelationship with the District's fair housing impediments. The completion of the plan was included as part of the Mayor's Housing Order that was executed at a housing rall y on May 10, 2019. In the 58 Order the Mayor tasked several District agencies to identify new policies, tools, and initiatives to begin fulfilling the goal of creating 36,000 new housing units, 12,000 of them affordable, by 2025. the Order the focused on the following areas: Increasing production and accelerating delivery of housing by analyzing housing trends, needs, capacity, and impediments to housing in order to identify housing targets and policies Promoting fair housing by identifying ways to create an equitable distribution of affordable housing across Washington, DC Creating homeownership opportunities Directing all District agencies to support the goals of Homeward DC Improving resident housing experience by directing Lab @ DC to create a unified \"front door\" for residents to access affordable housing opportunities and programs The housing strategy in the Order included the need to complete the amendment process for the District's Comprehensive Plan, an important tool to create housing. As part of the process DHCD and OP worked together in 2019 on the Housing Framework for Equity and Growth to further this work. In early October 2019 OP released their draft Housing Element of the Comprehensive Plan as well as the Housing Equity Report: Creating Goals fo r Areas of Our City. A full list of the proposed amendments, including those made by DHCD, and updates on the Comprehensive Plan amendments can be found at https://plandc.dc.gov/ . Impediment #8 : Nothing in the Distric t's planning process directly addresses any fair housing issues that the city can help resolve and fair housing violations that the city can help prevent. Residential developments that require city review and approval are approved without any effort to pro mote compliance with the Fair Housing Act or the accessibility requirements of the Americans W ith Disabilities Act. The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs ( DCRA ) has made strides to enhance its permitting process and updating the Building Code. More specifically, DRCA requires that all building permit applicants submit plans electronically through ProjectDox for review. DHCD anticipates working with DCRA in the future regarding fair housing as it has with the IZ. Additionally, the 2013 Code update provides greater accessibility to persons with disabilities, both physical and visual and a uditory , in new construction and rehabilitation projects. Lastly, the changes require that 15 percent of all unit s are accessib le in all new constru ction projects , which is 10 percent higher than required under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. DC recognizes that accessible housing is beneficial not only to persons using a wheel chair, but also to the growing population of seniors and per sons suffering temporary incapacities. To this end, DC's Building Code was amended through the Building Code Supplement of 59 2013 to provide greater accessibility to persons with disabilities. DC also follows the ANSI Accessible and Usable Buildings and Faci lities guidelines in the construction of accessible units that meet the Fair Housing Act accessib ility design standards. DHCD continues to implement and enforce a robust accessible compliance mandate for all its assisted new construction and rehabilitation projects. Through its compliance program, DHCD seeks to increase accessible multifamily and single -family housing so that residents using a wheel chair can enjoy the same amenities as able -bodied residents and are able to integrally participate in their co mmunity. DHCD plans to expand its accessible housing stock by ensuring that elements of \"visitability\" are included in its future housing projects. These elements include a zero -step entrance, doors with 32 inches of clear passage, and an accessible bathro om on the main floor of the home. Impediment #9 : The District's zoning treatment of what it calls \"community -based residential facilities\" is convoluted and sometimes contradictory. It is very possible that it has contributed to the development of severe concentrations in the Northeast and Southeast quadrants that may be creating de facto social service districts that undermine the ability of community residences to achieve their goals of normalization and community integration. The District continues to evaluate the provision of social services and community -based residential facilities and their implications for fair housing through its planning and funding decisions. Impediment #10: Someone who thinks she has been discriminated against when seeking hous ing in the District immediately runs into the problem of determining whom to contact and how to file a fair housing complaint if they are not using the Internet. This situation is a substantial barrier to fair housing choice when somebody who thinks he may have faced discrimination cannot quickly and easily contact a live person who can hear the facts of his situation, or he cannot easily obtain information about how to file a fair housing complaint. Each additional step a possible victim must take increases the chances that he will abandon his effort to report a violation. Tests conducted of the city's \"311\" information line yielded three different \u2014and wrong \u2014instructions of whom to contact with a possible fair housing complaint. DC has met the goal of training front -line staff through agency partnerships and collaborations. OHR, as the civil rights enforcement agency for the District, has trained \"311\" Office of Unified Communications (OUC) employees on the services the agency provides. These include, but ar e not limited to, fair housing rights, the substantially equivalent categories under the Fair Housing Act, and the complaint and filing process. Since 2014 OHR has held Human Rights Liaison trainings for community direct -service providers, government agencies and private and public partners on responsibilities and rights under 60 the Fair Housing Act for their clients. Lastly, OHR has consistently held more than 40 liaison trainings a year since its inception. Impediment #11 : Every jurisdiction engaged in affirmatively furthering fair housing choice needs current accurate and current information on matters involving fair housing. In the District of Columbia, such information is all too often not readily available, or even available at all. The Office of Human Rights does not routinely keep track of whether fair housing complaints involve rental or ownership housing, hindering efforts to fully analyze the nature and extent of housing dis crimination. The Equal Rights Center, which collaborates with the Office of Human Rights on fair housing enforcement, maintains information on tenancy only for fair housing complaints based on federal law, but not for complaints based on the District's 12 additional protected classes. The Office of Human Rights does not record any information about the inquiries it receives about possible housing discrimination, leaving it unable to determine the percentage of inquiries that actually lead to a fair housing complaint. The District of Columbia Housing Authority does not maintain current records on the race and ethnicity of public housing residents by development and for holders of housing choice vouchers. To date, OHR has adhered to the recommendations sug gested in the AI to \"Record all inquiries on housing discrimination \u2014including the nature of the possible discrimination and whether it involves ownership or rental housing.\" OHR has implemented a tracking system of docketed complaints by Rental, Purchase, Sales, Lending, Condo, Coop, Shelter and Other. OHR further captures written inquiries in its internal database; however, general phone inquiries are not recorded. Perhaps with a dedicated Fair Housing line, these data can be captured in the future. It is noteworthy to point out that the OHR website page for filing a housing discrimination complaint is very robust and client friendly. The page walks the complainant through the process by describing fair housing issues and giving the complainant a voice on the alleged discrimination. It also provides the complainant with 17 options as to the alleged reason for the discrimination. The complaint questionnaire is usable to the lay person not familiar with legal terminology and trigger words under the Fair Housing Act. On education and outreach activities, OHR has been very active by publishing informational brochures and reports on transgender issues, language access compliance, and challenges faced by returning citizens, all areas that indirectly are affected by access to equal housing opportunity. Similarly, the ERC records the number of discrimination complaint calls received, which include fair -housing complaints. In its 2016 Annual Report, ERC states that it \"Increased the 61 number of housing discrimination referrals to HUD and local governmental agencies by 75%\". The ERC collects complaint information based on local protected categories; however, it is not reported upon in its Annual Reports. The DC Housing Authority does not maintain current records on the race and ethnicity of public housing residents by development and for holders of housing choice vouchers. The District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) does maintain records regarding race and ethnicity for Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher program clients. Below are the most current data for DCHA. Figure 1. Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher Program Households by Race Figure 2.

From Ideas to Action: Implementing a Mixed -Income Housing Strategy in Washington, DC (2009) reported, \"Finally, the inability to collect current data from the District and other cities limited the analysis.\" While most of the District staff contacted in the process of researching this analysis of impediments was very helpful, the authors frequently encountered difficulty obtaining even a response from some city staff. In some departments our direct contact was a public relations representative who served as a gatekeeper rather than enabling us to work directly with appropriate staff. As noted in Chapter 3, building code officials n ever responded to multiple requests for confirmation of building code provisions. Our multiple requests to the head of the District of Columbia Housing Authority went unheeded for months; although once other staff members were contacted, they were very hel pful. Staff tended to be very narrow in their responses to our inquiries for information rather than expansive as we explicitly asked them to be. Since the 2011 AI was completed, DHCD has worked with partner agencies on planning and policy endeavors includ ing the Consolidated Plan and Comprehensive Plan. DHCD anticipates working closely with these agencies in order to obtain better data and robust answers to effectively inform policy decisions. Additionally, DHCD has worked with these agencies regarding im plementing AFFH and the submission of the forthcoming AFH and the AI update. DHCD will continue to work with agencies not under the purview of the Mayor in accessing or receiving data referencing race and ethnic composition of its clients. DHCD will continue to engage the agencies and staff and offer to provide technical support to gather such information. DC recently hired an Open Data officer and much of the required data for the AI is available at https://dc. gov/page/open -data , Moreover, in addition to DChousingserach.org, DHCD provides numerous on- line dashboards that present its data to the public: Development Finance also teamed up with nonprofit partners to develop housinginsights.org, which places affordable housing property information in their neighborhood context by providing data on nearby properties and surrounding conditions. Impediment #13 : The District of Columbia Housing Authority lacks a cogent pro -integrative policy for siting public housing and the use of Housing Choice Vouchers. Nearly all public housing developments were located in predominantly Black areas. Most households that hold a Housing Choice Voucher are located in predominantly minority neighborhoods, many in the hypersegregated African American neighborhood clusters that comprise wards seven and eight. 63 DCHA is limited in its ability to create new public housing in areas where the agency does not own land. The locations of DCHA's existing public housing communities are relatively static as DCHA can only redevelop on the exiting public housing footprint and/or on contiguous parcels of land. However, as a partner organization in the DHCD NOFA initiative to create affordable housing, DCHA includes public housing funding as a subsidy option for owners/developers submitting proposals. The NOFA allows for the c reation of public housing units outside of DCHA's existing public housing footprints. In FY2017, through the DHCD NOFA process, 76 units of public housing were created at the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA. The Ward 2 neighborhood cluster where Phyllis Wheatley is located has a racial/ethnic mix of 29 percent African -American, 48 percent White, and 7.8 percent Asian. In addition, Hispanics of any race make up 15 percent of the cluster population. The challenge with such an approach is that the per-unit level of publ ic housing subsidy available has been lower than necessary to be the sole source of financing for units created through this initiative. The units at Phyllis Wheatley were created by layering locally funded housing subsidy and public housing subsidy. Publ ic Housing Redevelopment With respect to existing public housing developments, DCHA has made every effort to access limited available federal funding over the two decades to leverage additional financing, with the goal of redeveloping public housing into m ixed-income, low -poverty, ethnically diverse communities. DCHA has received the second -highest number of HOPE VI awards nationwide, with a total of seven, and received two Choice neighborhood planning grants, the successor program of HOPE VI. DCHA makes st rategic decisions about which sites to focus its redevelopment efforts, given limited available resources. The age and condition of the site play a critical role in that decision- making. In many of the cases where DCHA has redeveloped public housing commun ities, the neighborhood clusters where the redeveloped sites are located have experienced an improved economic outlook and increased the levels of racial/ethnic diversity for the surrounding community. HUD has not included funding in the federal budget fo r HOPE VI or Choice neighborhoods for several years, including the administration's proposed FY2019 budget. In addition, when funding has been made available, it has been on a competitive basis, oftentimes only setting aside fewer than 10 awards nationally a year. Housing Choice Voucher Program DCHA has adopted the following policies/programs over the last four years to increase HCV client access to low -poverty neighborhoods. Increase DCHA Payment Standards Unit rents in the HCV program are set in relation to HUD -established Fair Market Rents (FMRs). In DC's high -cost rental market, rents in most neighborhoods are higher than FMRs. 64 In response, based on HUD approval through DCHA's Moving to Work designation, the housing authority has the ability to set the m aximum voucher subsidy it can pay on behalf of HCV participants (referred to as the Payment Standard) at levels higher than the FMRs. In FY2016, DCHA increas ed its payment standards to 130 percent of the FMRs in an attempt to expand the number of DC neighborhoods that HCV clients could access with their vouchers. In FY2017, DCHA increased the HCV p rogram payment standards to 175 percent of FMRs to further increase the number of neighborhoods that HCV clients can access with their vouchers. Based on an asse ssment of the 2018 FMRs, DCHA decided to continue keep the agency payment standards at 175 percent of the FMRs in FY2018. It should be noted that even with the ability to set higher payment standards as a means to expand access to affordable housing, not all neighborhoods in DC are rent -accessible to voucher holders. Mobility Resources DCHA created the Housing Affordable Living Options (HALO) program in May 2015, an HCV mobility program designed to assist HCV families move into low -poverty neighborhoods, a lso referred to as \"Opportunity Neighborhoods .\" In addition to providing eligible HALO participants with mobility resources, HALO also provides participating landlords with a suite of program benefits.
