Upgrade your beauty ritual with our lovely Jade Facial Roller and Gua Sha duo today. Features and Benefits of Facial Rolling and Gua Sha About Facial Massage Facial massage is an anti-aging practice that can dramatically improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Just as we carry tension in our neck and shoulders, we also carry a lot of tension in our face, which contributes to the forming of wrinkles. Both Gua Sha and facial rolling provide similar benefits for the skin. How to Use Jade Facial Roller and Gua Sha For best results use your Jade Facial Roller and Gua Sha stones three times a week for five to 10 minutes. Concentrate on making 5-10 passes on each section of the skin, paying close attention to areas of the face with more prominent lines and wrinkles. It is best to perform facial massage at night, using your favorite serums and face creams, like SV23, but you can also add to your morning routine to improve the look of puffiness. IMPORTANT Always work in upward motions, starting from the center of the face going out toward the hairline. DO NOT use back-in-forth motions with the facial roller or Gua Sha. Use a gentle-yet-firm pressure, according to your comfort level. Use a softer touch around the eyes and avoid rolling directly ever the eyes. Avoid rolling over inflamed acne or open wounds. Be sure to thoroughly clean your Jade Facial Roller and Gua Sha after each use. Tip: To increase the cooling effect, especially with puffiness, store Jade Facial Roller and Gua Sha in the refrigerator. Step by Step 1. Wash your face with a good quality facial cleanser and thoroughly dry your face with a towel or wash cloth. 2. Apply a nourishing facial oil, serum or cream to the face and neck. 3. Before the skin has a chance to absorb the face oil or cream, begin your facial rolling or gua sha. While you don't have to go in a certain order, for those who like a little more structure in their routine, use the method below: Neck - Using upward motions from the base of the neck to the jaw line. You can start in the middle and work out or start on one side and work across to the other. Jawline - Work from the center of the base of the jaw and roll or gently scrape upwards toward the ear on each side. Chin and lower jaw - Work from the center of the chin outward and upward to the side of the face, just below the ear. Mouth - Using the smaller roller or indention, work the lower and upper lip, starting from the center and moving out toward the ears. Cheeks - Start from the corner of the nose outward and upward to the temple area. Depending on the size of your face, you may need to do 3 different pathways to cover the entire cheek area, starting from the bottom of the nose, middle of the cheek, and just below the orbital bone. Eye area - Using the smaller roller, work from the inner corner of the eye, close to the bridge of the nose, outward to the corner of the eye. Repeat for the upper eye just below the eyebrow. Don't forget the \"crow's feet\" area. Start at the outer corner of the eye and work towards the temple. Forehead - Work the \"third eye\" area between the eyebrows rolling up from the top of the nose up to the top of the forehead. Then work the left and right side of the forward using the same upward motion. You can also work horizontally from the center of the forehead out to the hairline on each side.
