See \u00a7 44- 7-180(B). CERTIFICATE OF NEED The purpose of the Certificate of Need Program, as set forth in the State Certification of Need and Health Facility Licensure Act unnecessary duplication of health care facilities and services, guide the establishment of health facilities and services which will best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality services are provided in health facilities in this State. To achieve these purposes, the Certificate of Need Act requires a person or health care facility to obtain a Certificate of Need from the Department before undertaking certain health care related projects. See \u00a7\u00a7 44-7-120 and 44-7-160 . HEALTH PLANNING COMMITTEE The Health Planning Committee advises the Department in the drafting of the South Carolina Health Plan. It is comprised of fourteen members, twelve of whom are appointed by the Governor, which must include at least one member from each congressional district. One member is is either the South Carolina Consumer Advocate or his designee. Health care consumers, health care financiers (including business and insurance), and health care providers (which must include at least one administrator of a for-profit nursing home) are equally represented. The Health Planning Committee reviews the South Carolina Health Plan and submits it to the Board of Health and Environmental Control for final revision and adoption. See \u00a7 44-7-180 . STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS In accordance with \u00a7 44-7-180(B) , this Plan contains (1) an inventory of existing and CON approved health care facilities, beds, specified health services and equipment; (2) projections of need for additional healthcare facilities, beds, specified health services, and equipment; (3) standards for distribution a general statement as to the project review criteria considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for each type of facility, service and equipment. 1(1) INVENTORY Chapter 2 of this Plan identifies the inventory regions and service areas used in the administration of the Certificate of Need Program. Healthcare facilities, specified health services, beds and equipment are inventoried where applicable. (2) PROJECTIONS OF NEED Chapters 3 through 11 of this Plan discuss the need for additional healthcare facilities, beds, specified health services and equipment in the State. While the methodologies used to determine these needs vary depending on the type of healthcare facility, bed, specified health service, or equipment, a determination of projected need is calculated for most areas addressed by the Plan. (3) CERTIFICATE OF NEED STANDARDS In consultation with the Health Planning Committee, the Department formulated these standards to guide health providers throughout the State. Inclusion of these standards in the application process is designed to give applicants notice of its requirements and to elicit from them a commitment to incorporate these standards into both their applications and finished projects. (4) PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA A general statement has been added to most sections of the Plan setting forth the Project Review Criteria considered to be the most important in reviewing Certificate of Need applications for each type of healthcare facility, bed, specified health service, and equipment. These criteria are not listed in order of importance, but sequentially, as they are in Regulation 61-15 . Where appropriate, the Plan contains a finding as to whether the benefits of improved accessibility to each such type of facility, service and equipment may outweigh the adverse effects caused by the duplication of any existing facility, service or equipment. DISCLAIMERS (1) The hyperlinks provided throughout this Plan were checked for accuracy immediately prior to publication. Due to factors outside our control, we cannot guarantee the links will not expire or otherwise become unavailable after publication. Should you be unable to access the hyperlinked information, please feel free to request the information from the Certificate of Need Program via e-mail to coninfo@dhec.sc.gov . (2) The population data set forth in this Plan was received from the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office in August of 2019 . The material includes population projections that are subject to the following conditions: 2These projections offer only one scenario of future population change using the most current data available. The overall accuracy of the projections depends on the extent to which future events unfold in a manner that reflects previous trends observed within each group. The model cannot account for unprecedented events that may significantly include large factory openings or closings, changes in technology, public health crises, environmental events, or other conditions that could have an effect on migration, birth rates, or death rates. This means that population projections are likely to be more accurate in the immediate future than in distant years into the future. The projections will be updated regularly as new data becomes available and future events unfold. Annual county population estimates released by the Census Bureau will be monitored along with birth and death data released each year, and adjustments will be made to the projected population results as appropriate. 3CHAPTER 2 INVENTORY REGIONS AND SERVICE AREAS INVENTORY REGIONS This Plan has adopted the for the purpose of inventorying Health Care Facilities and Health Services as designated and enumerated below: Region Counties I - Upstate Abbeville, Anderson, Cherokee, Greenville, Greenwood, Laurens, McCormick, Oconee, Pickens, Spartanburg, and Union II - Midlands Aiken, Barnwell, Chester, Edgefield, Fairfield, Kershaw, Lancaster, Lexington, Newberry, Richland, Saluda and York III - Pee Dee Chesterfield, Clarendon, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Georgetown, Horry, Lee, Marion, Marlboro, Sumter and Williamsburg IV - Lowcountry Allendale, Bamberg, Beaufort, Berkeley, Calhoun, Charleston, Colleton, Dorchester, Hampton, Jasper and Orangeburg NEED FOR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND HEALTH SERVICES This Plan calculates the need for certain Health Care Facilities and Health Services throughout South Carolina based on certain formulae and criteria set forth in detail in this Plan. For example: The need for hospital beds is based on the utilization of individual facilities. The need for acute psychiatric services, alcohol and drug abuse services, and comprehensive rehabilitation services is based on various service areas and utilization methodologies specified in this Plan. The need for most health services (e.g., cardiac catheterization, open heart surgery) is based upon the service standard, which is a combination of utilization criteria and travel time requirements. The need for long-term care and skilled nursing service is projected by county. SERVICE AREAS In addition to inventory regions, this Plan designates service areas for certain Health Care Facilities and Health Services. These service areas may be comprised of one or more counties. Service areas may cross the inventory regions identified above . The need for a service is analyzed by assessment of existing resources and need in the relevant service area, along with other factors 4set forth in this Plan, applicable statutes and regulations. TRANSFER BETWEEN AFFILIATED FACILITIES Given the ever-changing nature of the health care delivery system, affiliated facilities may want to transfer or exchange specific equipment, services , or licensed beds in order to better meet an identified need. Affiliated facilities are two or more health care facilities, whether inpatient or outpatient, owned, leased, or who have a formal legal relationship with a central organization and whose relationship has been established for reasons other than for transferring beds, equipment or services. In certain instances such a transfer or exchange of acute services could be accomplished in a cost-effective manner and result in a more efficient allocation of health care resources. This transfer or exchange of services applies to both inpatient and outpatient services. A Certificate of Need is required to transfer or exchange beds, services, and/or equipment . In order to evaluate a proposal for the transfer or exchange of any health care equipment or technology reviewed under the Certificate of Need program, the following criteria must be applied to it: 1. A transfer or exchange of beds, services, and/or equipment may be approved only if there is no overall increase in the number or amount of such beds and/or services. 2. A transfer or exchange initiated under this Chapter may only occur within the service area(s) established in this Plan. 3. The facility receiving the beds, services, and/or equipment must demonstrate the need for the additional capacity based on historical and/or projected utilization patterns. 4. The applicants must explain the impact of transferring the beds, services, and/or equipment on the health care delivery system of the county and/or service area from which it is to be taken; any negative impact must be detailed, along with the perceived benefits of the proposal. 5. The facility giving up beds, services, and/or equipment may not use the loss of such beds, services, and/or equipment as justification for a subsequent request to establish or re- establish such beds, services, and/or equipment. 6. A written contract or agreement between the governing bodies of the affiliated facilities approving the transfer or exchange of beds, services, and/or equipment must be included in the Certificate of Need process. 7. Each facility giving up beds, services, and/or equipment must acknowledge in writing that this exchange is permanent; any further transfers would be subject to this same process. ESTIMATED STATE CIVILIAN POPULATION Where these projections were required for calculations, this Plan has been developed using the 5estimated civilian population of 5,084,127 for 2018and projected population of 5,474,585 for 2024. All population data (county, planning area, and statewide) were provided by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, Health and Demographics Section, in August 2019 . INVENTORY DATES Only those facilities reviewed under the Certificate of Need program are included in the inventory. The cut-off date for inclusion of information in this Plan was January 17, 2020 . Inventory and utilization data set forth in this Plan is derived from the 2018 Joint Annual Reports (JARs). The period of time in which the individual data was collected is set forth by the reporting entity in its individual JAR submission. 6UPSTATEUPSTATE MIDLANDSMIDLANDS LOWCOUNTRYLOWCOUNTRYPEE DEEPEE DEEDHEC REGIONS MAP (Chapter 2) 7CHAPTER 3 GENERAL HOSPITALS GENERAL HOSPITALS Relevant Definitions \"Hospital \" means a facility organized and administered to provide overnight medical, surgical, or nursing care of illness, injury, or infirmity and may provide obstetrical care, and in which all diagnoses, treatment, or care is administered by or under the direction of persons currently licensed to practice medicine, surgery, or osteopathy. Hospital may include residential treatment facilities for children and adolescents in need of mental health treatment which are physically a part of a licensed psychiatric hospital. This definition does not include facilities which are licensed by the Department of Social Services. \"Hospital Bed \" means a bed for an adult or child patient. Bassinets for the newborn in a maternity unit nursery, beds in labor rooms, recovery rooms, and other beds used exclusively for emergency purposes are not included in this definition. Bed Capacity For existing beds, capacity is considered bed space designated exclusively for inpatient care, including space originally designed or remodeled for inpatient beds, even though temporarily not used for such purposes. The number of beds counted in any patient room is the maximum number for which adequate square footage is provided, except that single beds in single rooms have been counted even if the room contained inadequate square footage. Inventory and Bed Need All licensed general hospitals, including Federal facilities, and CON-approved general hospitals are listed in the inventory. Patient days and admissions are as reported by the hospital in its JAR. The number of patient days utilized for the general hospital bed need calculations does not include days of care rendered in licensed psychiatric units, substance abuse units, or comprehensive rehabilitation units of hospitals. These days of care are shown in the corresponding inventories for each type of service. In addition, the days of care provided in Long-Term Care hospitals are not included in the general bed need calculations. Total capacity by survey refers to a total designed capacity or maximum number of beds that may be accommodated as determined by an on-site survey. This capacity may exceed the 8number of beds actually set up and in use. It may also differ from the licensed capacity, which is based on State laws and regulations. Beds have been classified as conforming and nonconforming, according to standards of plant evaluation. Variable Occupancy Rate The General Acute Hospital bed need methodology uses the following variable occupancy rate factors: 0 - 174 bed hospitals 65% 175 - 349 bed hospitals 70% 350+ bed hospital 75% The population and associated utilization are broken down by age groups. The use rates and projected average daily census are made for the age cohorts of 0-17, 18-64, and 65 and over, in recognition that different population groups have different hospital utilization rates. Where the term \"hospital bed need\" is used, these figures are based upon utilization data for the general acute hospitals. This term does not suggest that facilities cannot operate at higher occupancy rates than used in the calculations without adding additional beds. Availability The need for general hospital beds is determined through the consideration of current utilization and projected population growth with the goal of having beds available within approximately 30 minutes' travel time for the majority of the residents of the State. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTION AND STANDARDS 1. Calculations of hospital bed need are made for individual hospitals and for service areas. 2. For individual hospitals, the methodology for calculating bed need is as follows: a. Determine the current facility use rate by dividing the 2018 patient days by the 2018 population in each of the three age cohorts. b. Multiply the current facility use rate for each age cohort by the projected population by age cohort and divide by 365 to obtain a projected average daily census (ADC) by age cohort. c. Divide the sum of the age cohort projected ADC by the variable occupancy factor (.65/.70/.75) to determine the hospital's bed need. 9d. The number of additional beds needed or excess beds for the hospital is obtained by subtracting the number of existing and approved beds from the hospital's bed need. 3. The methodology for calculating the statewide utilization bed need for a service area is as follows: a. Divide the statewide total patient days by 365 to determine the statewide average daily census. b. Divide the statewide average daily census by the statewide occupancy factor (.75) to determine the total statewide bed need. c. Divide the statewide bed need by the 2018 statewide population to generate a bed-per-population (BPP) multiplier. d. For each service area, multiply the projected population by the BPP multiplier to determine the service area bed need, then subtract the total number of existing and approved beds to determine the statewide utilization bed need for the service area. 4.The bed need for each service area is the combined bed need for all individual hospitals in the service area. The bed need for service areas with no hospital, or for service areas in which no hospital has reported any utilization data on the most recent JAR, is the statewide utilization bed need. 5. If a service area indicates a surplus of beds, then no additional beds will be approved unless an individual hospital in the service area indicates a need for additional beds. Should an individual hospital indicate a need for additional beds, then a maximum of the actual projected bed need or up to 50 additional beds may be approved for that hospital to allow for the construction of an economical unit at either the existing hospital site or another site, if the existing hospital is relocating or has relocated in whole or in part to that site. The hospital requesting the addition must document the need for additional beds beyond those indicated as needed by the methodology stated above, based on historical and projected utilization, as well as projected population growth or other factors demonstrating the need for the proposed beds. Additional beds will only be approved for the specific hospital indicating a need. 6. If there is a need for additional hospital beds in the service area, then any entity may apply to add these beds within the service area, and any entity may be awarded the Certificate of Need for these beds. If the number of beds needed is less than 50, then up to a total of 50 beds could be approved for any entity at any location within the 10service area. An applicant requesting additional beds beyond those indicated as needed by the methodology stated above must document the need for additional beds based on historical and projected utilization, projected population growth that has not been considered in this Plan or other factors demonstrating the need for the proposed beds. It is up to the applicant to document the need and the potential negative impact on the existing facilities. 7. A facility may apply to create a new additional hospital at a different site within the same service area through the transfer of existing licensed beds, the projected bed need for the facility, or a combination of both existing beds and projected bed need. The facility is not required to have a projected need for additional beds in order to create a new additional hospital. There is no required minimum number of beds in order to approve the CON application. The applicant must justify, through patient origin and other data, the need for a new hospital at the chosen site and the potential adverse impact a new hospital at the chosen site could have on the existing hospitals in the service area. 8. No additional hospital will be approved unless it is a general hospital and will provide: a. A 24-hour emergency services department that meets the requirements to be a Level III emergency service as defined in the Emergency Services section of Regulation 61-16 ; b. Inpatient medical services to both surgical and non-surgical patients; and c. Medical and surgical services on a daily basis within at least six of the major diagnostic categories as recognized by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Any applicant for a new hospital must provide a written commitment that the facility will accept Medicare and Medicaid patients and that unreimbursed services for indigent and charity patients are provided at a percentage that meets or exceeds other hospitals in the service area. The CMS Diagnostic Categories Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. 9. Due to the low utilization and the low capital cost of converting hospital-based nursing home, psychiatric, rehabilitation and/or substance abuse beds to general acute care hospital beds, the following policies may apply: a. Hospitals that have licensed nursing home beds within the hospital may be allowed to convert nursing home beds to general acute care hospital beds only within the hospital, provided the hospital can document an actual need for additional general acute care beds. Need will be based on actual utilization, using current information. A Certificate of Need is required for this conversion. 11b. Existing acute care hospitals that have inpatient psychiatric, rehabilitation, or substance abuse beds may be allowed to convert such beds to acute care hospital beds, regardless of the projected need for general acute care hospital beds. A Certificate of Need is required for this conversion. 10. In some areas of South Carolina, a considerable influx of tourists is not counted in the permanent population. If an individual hospital in these areas can document and demonstrate the need for additional beds due to non-resident (tourist) population and seasonal utilization fluctuations due to this population, then, based on further analysis, the Department may approve some additional beds at the existing hospital. 11. Should the deletion of services at a federal facility result in an immediate impact on the utilization of a hospital, then the Department may approve a request for additional beds at the affected hospital. The affected hospital must document the increase in demand and explain why additional beds are needed to accommodate patients previously served at the federal facility. 12. Changes in the delivery system due to health care reform have resulted in the consolidation of facilities and the establishment of provider networks. These consolidations and agreements may lead to situations where affiliated hospitals may wish to transfer beds between themselves in order to serve their patients in a more efficient manner. A proposal to transfer or exchange hospital beds requires a Certificate of Need and must comply with the provisions outlined in Chapter 2, Transfer between Affiliated Facilities. 13. Factors to be considered regarding modernization of facilities include: a. Functional arrangement of the facility as it relates to efficient handling of patients and related workloads. b. The ability to update medical technology within the existing plant. c. Existence of The Joint Commission (TJC) or other accreditation body deficiencies or \"grandfathered\" licensure deficiencies. d. Cost efficiency of the existing physical plant versus plant revision, etc. e. Private rooms are now considered the industry standard. 14. Each modernization proposal must be evaluated on the basis of merit, cost efficiency, and impact on healthcare delivery within the service area. The Hospital Bed Need Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. 12RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Compliance with the Need Outlined in this Section of this Plan; 2.Community Need Documentation; 3.Distribution (Accessibility); 4.Acceptability; 5. Ability to Complete the Project; and 6.Adverse Effects on Other Facilities. General hospital beds are typically located within approximately thirty (30) minutes' travel time for the majority of the residents of the State. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for these beds. LONG-TERM ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals (LTACHs) are hospitals with an average Medicare inpatient length of stay of greater than 25 days, including all covered and non-covered days of stay of Medicare patients. They provide treatment to patients with complex medical conditions, such as strokes, cardiac care, ventilator dependency, wound care and post-surgical care. A LTACH may be either a freestanding facility or may occupy space in another hospital (\"hospital-within-a-hospital\"). Hospitals must meet additional federal criteria in order to qualify as a LTACH under the \"hospital-within-a-hospital\" model: 1. The new LTACH must have a governing body, which is distinct and separate from the governing body of the host hospital, and the new body cannot be under the control of the host hospital or any third entity that controls both hospitals. 2. The LTACH must have a separate Chief Executive Officer through whom all administrative authority flows, who is not employed by, or under contract with, the host hospital or any third entity that controls both hospitals. 3. The LTACH must have a separate Chief Medical Officer who reports directly to the governing body and is responsible for all medical staff activities. The Chief Medical Officer cannot be under contract with the host hospital or any third entity that controls both hospitals. 134. The LTACH must have a separate medical staff which reports directly to the governing body, and adopt bylaws governing medical care, including granting privileges to individual practitioners. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. An application for a LTACH must be in compliance with the relevant standards in Regulation 61-16 (Minimum Standards for Licensing Hospitals and Institutional General Infirmaries). 2. Although LTACH beds are not considered to be a separate category for licensing purposes, they will be inventoried separately from general acute care hospital beds for planning purposes. 3. The utilization of LTACHs is not included in the bed need for general acute care hospital beds. No bed need will be calculated for LTACH beds. An applicant must document the need for LTACH beds based on the utilization of existing LTACH beds. 4. A hospital that has leased general beds to a LTACH shall be entitled to regain these beds once the lease is terminated. No entity other than the hospital (or its successor) that initially leased the general acute beds to the LTACH shall be entitled to the beds upon termination of the lease. A Certificate of Need application is required : a. A hospital may be allowed to convert these former LTACH beds to general acute hospital beds regardless of the projected need for general acute beds; b. A hospital may be allowed to convert these former LTACH beds to psychiatric, inpatient treatment facility, rehabilitation, or other specialty beds only if there is a bed need projected for this proposed other category of licensed beds. 5. A hospital which seeks to be designated as a LTACH, and has been awarded a CON for that purpose, must be certified as a LTACH by CMS within 24 months of accepting its first patient, or the CON issued to that hospital for that purpose shall be revoked. The entity that has had its CON revoked shall not have the authority to operate as a general acute care hospital. 6. A hospital that desires to be designated as a Pediatric LTACH must restrict admissions to patients under the age of 21 who require long-term medical care. Should the facility attempt to provide care that is inconsistent with this requirement or patient demand or other economic conditions require the facility to close, the Certificate of Need issued to that hospital for that purpose shall be revoked. 14The Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1. Compliance with the Need Outlined in this Section of this Plan; 2. Community Need Documentation; 3. Distribution (Accessibility); 4. Record of the Applicant. Long-Term Acute Care Hospital beds are located within approximately 60 minutes' travel time for the majority of the residents of the State. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for these beds. CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS (CAH) The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services administers programs through the Medicaid program to assist struggling rural hospitals. One such program designates rural hospitals as Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) who are then eligible for more favorable Medicaid reimbursement methodology. A CAH is intended to provide essential health services to rural communities. Converting a struggling rural hospital to a CAH can allow a community to maintain local health access that would otherwise be lost. CAHs are subject to review by the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), whereas other hospitals are not currently subject to IPAB review. The impact of the Critical Access Hospital Program in South Carolina is a financial one, allowing cost-based reimbursement from Medicare for a facility choosing to participate. The designation as a CAH does not require a change in the licensing of an existing hospital. However, a hospital may be required to de-license a number of beds in order to meet the 25-bed requirement. The designation of a hospital as a Critical Access Hospital does not require Certificate of Need review because it does not change the licensing category of the facility. However, an exemption from Certificate of Need review is required for a hospital to reduce its number of licensed beds in order to meet the criteria for a CAH. Should a hospital later desire to revert to a general acute hospital, a Certificate of Need is required , but the facility may be permitted to increase the number of licensed hospital beds up to the prior number of beds without regard or affect to the current bed need shown in the service area. 15The Critical Access Hospitals Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. PERINATAL REGIONS The Perinatal Regions referred to in the Obstetrical Services and Neonatal Services sections below are distinct from the Department's Regions defined in Chapter 2 of this Plan, and are identified by the name of its designated Regional Perinatal Center. Perinatal Region Counties I -Greenville Memorial Abbeville, Anderson, Edgefield, Greenville, Greenwood, Laurens, McCormick, Oconee, Pickens, Saluda II - Spartanburg Regional Cherokee, Chester, Spartanburg, Union III Palmetto Aiken, Allendale, Richland, Sumter, York IV - McLeod Regional Chesterfield, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Horry, Marion, Marlboro, Williamsburg V - MUSC Medical Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston, Colleton, Dorchester, Hampton, Jasper, Georgetown PERINATAL SERVICE LEVELS Because the cost of high-risk obstetrical and neonatal services is so great, it is not desirable or cost-effective for all hospitals in the State to provide the higher levels of care. Over the years, a regionalized approach to perinatal care has been implemented in South Carolina to address the need for high quality, risk-appropriate, cost-effective perinatal health care. Regionalization provides a coordinated system of perinatal care for a well-defined population group. Each hospital providing perinatal services is designated by the Department's Division of Health Licensing as a Level I, II, III, or IV Perinatal Hospital, or a Regional Perinatal Center (RPC). Each Level I, II, III and IV hospital maintains a relationship with its designated RPC for consultation, transport and continuing education. Patients are transferred to the appropriate RPC when medically appropriate, if beds are available. True regionalization for the optimization of perinatal care includes a stated goal of back- transporting infants when they no longer require the highest level of care. Convalescing infants benefit from a community-based program closer to home that promotes parent education and family bonding to facilitate a safe and timely discharge. In this way, quality 16care is provided to mothers and newborn infants, and specially trained perinatal personnel and intensive care facilities can be used efficiently and cost-effectively. The complete descriptions of the five levels of perinatal services described briefly below are outlined in the Section of Regulation 61-16 entitled Designation of Inpatient Perinatal Care Services. Basic Perinatal Center with Well Newborn Nursery (Level I) . Level I hospitals provide services for normal uncomplicated pregnancies. A full list of the requirements for a Level I Basic Perinatal Center with Well Newborn Nursery can be found at Regulation 61-16, Section 1306.A. Certificate of Need review is not required to establish a Level I program. Specialty Perinatal Center with Special Care Nursery (Level II) . In addition to the requirements of Regulation 61-16, Section 1306.A, Level II hospitals provide services for both normal and selected high-risk obstetrical and neonatal patients. A full list of the requirements for a Level II Specialty Perinatal Center can be found at Regulation 61-16, Section 1306.B. Certificate of Need review is not required to establish a Level II program. Subspecialty Perinatal Center with Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (Level III) . In addition to the requirements of Regulation 61-16, Sections 1306.A and 1306.B, Level III hospitals provide all aspects of perinatal care, including intensive care and a range of continuously available, sub- specialty consultation as recommended in the most recent edition of the Guidelines for Perinatal Care (GPC) by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A full list of the requirements for a Level III Subspecialty Perinatal Center with Neonatal Intensive Care Unit can be found at Regulation 61-16, Section 1306.C. Neonatal transport may only be performed by Regional Perinatal Centers. Certificate of Need Review is required to establish a Level III program. Regional Perinatal Center with Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (RPC) . In addition to the requirements of Regulation 61-16, Sections 1306.A through 1306.C, RPCs provide consultative, outreach, and support services to other hospitals in the region. A full list of the requirements for a Regional Perinatal Center can be found at Regulation 61-16, Section 1306.D. No more than one Regional Perinatal Center will be approved in each perinatal region. Certificate of Need Review is required to establish a RPC. Complex Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (Level IV) . In addition to the requirements of Regulation 61-16, Sections 1306.A through 1306.C, Level IV hospitals shall include additional capabilities and considerable experience in the care of the most complex and critically ill newborn infants and have pediatric medical and surgical specialty consultants available 24 hours a day. A full list of the requirements for a Complex Neonatal Intensive Care Unit can be found at Regulation 61-16, Section 1306.E. A Level IV hospital need not act as a Regional Perinatal Center (RPC). Certificate of Need Review is required to establish a Level IV program. 17The Perinatal-Capable Facilities Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. OBSTETRICAL SERVICES Advances in obstetrical and newborn intensive care offer the promise of lower perinatal mortality and improvement in the quality of life for survivors. The high cost of intensive care and the limited availability of skilled personnel have created the requirement for a more efficient method of resource allocation. Maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality and morbidity rates can be significantly reduced if patients at high risk are identified early in the pregnancy and optimum techniques for the care of both the mother and infant are applied. High-risk deliveries are a small percent of total annual deliveries, but these patients require a high degree of specialized care. In 201 7, 76% of all Very Low Birthweight (VLB) babies were born in either a Level III center or a Regional Perinatal Center, whereas the Healthy People 2020 national objective was 83.7%. Infant mortality is defined as the death of babies from birth until their first birthday. South Carolina's infant mortality rate for 201 7 was 6.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births versus the national rate of 5. 79 infant deaths per 1,000 births in 201 7. Neonatal mortality is the death rate for infants up to 28 days old. For 2016, South Carolina's neonatal mortality rate for all races was 4.4 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births, while the Healthy People 2020 national objective was 4.1 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births. The need for obstetrical beds will be evaluated based on information supplied by the Joint Annual Report of Hospitals and other sources. Those facilities experiencing low utilization and in close proximity to one another should consider consolidating services, where appropriate. The OB Utilization and Births Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for an obstetrical service: 1. Compliance with the Need Outlined in this Section of this Plan; 2. Distribution (Accessibility); 3. Acceptability; 4. Record of the Applicant; and 5. Adverse Effects on Other Facilities. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of 18duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. NEONATAL SERVICES Neonatal services are highly specialized and are only required by a very small percentage of infants. The need for these services is affected by the incidence of high-risk deliveries, the percentage of live births requiring neonatal services, and the average length of stay. The limited need for these services requires that they be planned for on a regional basis, fostering the location of these specialized units in hospitals that have the necessary staff, equipment, and consultative services and facilities. Referral networks facilitate the transfer of infants requiring this level of services from other facilities. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. The projected need for neonatal intensive care bassinets is calculated on a regional basis: a. For each region take the average number of births from 201 6-2018 and the average population of women age 15-44 for 201 6-2018 to generate an average birth rate. b. Multiply the average birth rate against the projected 202 3 population of women age 15-44 to project the number of births in 202 3. c. Generate the projected number of intensive care bassinets needed in a region by applying a constant of 3.25 bassinets per 1,000 live births to the projected birth rate and subtracting the existing bassinets from this total. d. Any Level III, Level IV, or RPC neonatal unit may request additional intensive care bassinets beyond those indicated as needed by the methodology above. The Level III, Level IV, or RPC neonatal unit requesting the addition must document the need for additional intensive care bassinets based on historical and projected utilization, projected population growth, routine swing of intermediate care bassinets into the intensive care setting, or other factors demonstrating the need for the proposed bassinets. e. In the absence of a projected need for Level III Intensive Care bassinets in a Perinatal Region as set forth in this Chapter, an existing Level II facility can be approved for a Certificate of Need to become a Subspecialty Perinatal Center and establish up to eight (8) neonatal intensive care bassinets (NICU beds), provided the applicant can demonstrate, during the 12 month period immediately prior to the month in which the CON application is submitted to the Department, a minimum of 1,500 births and 2,500 intermediate patient 19days at its facility. 2. Only Level III, Level IV, and RPCs neonatal units have intensive care bassinets. The Intensive and Intermediate Bassinets Chart, Utilization of Neonatal Special Care Units Chart and NICU Bed Need Chart are located at the end of this Chapter. The addition of neonatal intermediate care bassinets does not require Certificate of Need review. In some areas the number of intensive care bassinets should be increased. The intermediate care bassinets should be better utilized in Level II facilities so babies can be transferred back closer to their home community, potentially alleviating the high utilization of the current intensive/intermediate care bassinets in RPC facilities in some areas of the State. To improve the availability of the existing RPC neonatal intensive care bassinets, utilization of the back transport concept should be supported. This component of regionalized care involves the transfer of infants who no longer require neonatal intensive care to facilities with intermediate or continuing care bassinets appropriate to the individual baby's care needs. If more back transfers to the Level II facilities occurred, then some of the overcrowding problems of the existing RPC units would be alleviated. It should be noted that some RPC, Level III, and Level IV facilities with intensive care bassinets may at times have intermediate type infants in intensive care bassinets and vice versa as the patient load changes within the unit. RPCs may use intermediate and intensive care bassinets interchangeably as the level of care required by the neonate varies. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following criteria are considered the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for a neonatal service: 1.Compliance with the Need Outlined in this Section of this Plan; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); 3.Record of the Applicant; and 4.Adverse Effects on Other Facilities. Because neonatal services are planned and located regionally due to the small percentage of infants requiring neonatal services, this service is available within approximately 30 minutes' travel time for the majority of the population. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. 20CMS DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES (Chapter 3) MDC 1: Diseases and disorders of the nervous system MDC 2: Diseases and disorders of the eye MDC 3: Diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, mouth and throat MDC 4: Diseases and disorders of the respiratory system MDC 5: Diseases and disorders of the circulatory system MDC 6: Diseases and disorders of the digestive system MDC 7: Diseases and disorders of the hepatobiliary system and pancreas MDC 8: Diseases and disorders of the musculoskeletal system and MDC 9: Diseases and disorders of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and breast MDC 10: Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases and disorders MDC 11: Diseases and disorders of the kidney and urinary tract MDC 12: Diseases and disorders of the male reproductive system MDC 13: Diseases and disorders of the female reproductive system Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium conditions originating in the MDC 16: Diseases and disorders of the blood and blood-forming organs and immunological disorders MDC 17: Myeloproliferative diseases and disorders and MDC 18: Infectious and parasitic diseases MDC 19: Mental diseases MDC20: Alcohol/drug use and alcohol/drug-induced organic mental MDC 21: Injury, poisoning and toxic effects of drugs MDC 22: Burns MDC 23: Factors influencing health status and other contact with health MDC 24: Multiple significant traumas MDC 25: Human immunodeficiency virus infections 21Var.

Services may be provided in either psychiatric units of general hospitals or freestanding psychiatric hospitals . Special units for children, adolescents and geriatric patients have been developed throughout the State. If any additional beds are approved, they must come from the calculated psychiatric bed need in this Plan. These specialty psychiatric services should be identifiable units with sufficient space to have available areas for sleeping, dining, education, recreation, occupational therapy and offices of evaluation and therapy. The unit should be staffed with an appropriate multi- disciplinary care team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, occupation therapists, recreational therapists, and psychiatric technicians. Other consultants should be available as needed. The Psychiatric Programs Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. Need projections are based on psychiatric service areas. The service areas are consistent for psychiatric services and inpatient alcohol and drug abuse facilities. 2. The methodology for calculating psychiatric bed need is as follows: a. For the service area, take the greater of the service area utilization rate or the statewide utilization rate for psychiatric beds by age cohort. The statewide utilization rate for each age cohort will be used for those service areas where no beds currently exist. b. Multiply the applicable utilization rate by the projected population for the year 2024 for each age cohort (where such data is available) and divide by 365 to obtain a projected average daily census by age cohort. c. Take the sum of average daily censuses by age cohort and divide by the target occupancy rate of 70% to determine the number of beds needed in the service area. 37d. The number of additional beds needed or excess beds for the service area is obtained by subtracting the number of existing beds from the bed need. 3. Should the service area show a need for additional beds, a general acute care hospital which has no licensed or CON-approved psychiatric beds may be approved for the maximum of the actual projected bed need or up to 20 additional beds (\"20 Bed Rule\") to may not use such beds for the establishment of a specialty psychiatric unit. Any beds sought in excess of the projected bed need in the service area must be used for the provision of general adult psychiatric services in order to address the growing number of psychiatric patients being held in hospital emergency departments. Finally, although more than one general acute care hospital per service area may apply for beds under this provision, the Department may approve no more than 19 beds, in any combination, beyond the need shown in this Plan for each service area. 4. In the absence of a projected need for beds in a psychiatric service area, an existing facility can apply to add up to eight additional beds, given that it has achieved an occupancy rate Up to ten additional beds may be added in a facility which has achieved an occupancy rate of at least 90% as reported on the most recent JAR. 5. Priority should be given to excess general hospital beds that can be economically and cost effectively converted for use as a specialized psychiatric unit over the construction of new beds, if such beds will be accessible to the target population. The Psychiatric Bed Need Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1. Community Need Documentation; 2. Distribution (Accessibility); 3. Record of the Applicant; and 4. Staff Resources. Psychiatric beds are planned for and located within 60 travel time for the majority of the residents of the State. In addition, current utilization and population growth are factored into the methodology for determining psychiatric bed need. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for these services. 38STATE MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES Psychiatric Hospital Beds DMH operates a variety of psychiatric facilities. DMH has analyzed the patient population and plans to provide psychiatric services in the least restrictive environment, maintain patients in the community and keep hospitalization to a minimum. Since DMH cannot refuse any patient assigned to them by a court, renovation, replacement and expansion of the component programs should be allowed as long as the overall psychiatric hospital complement is maintained or reduced. As long as DMH does not add any additional beds over the 3,720 beds that were in existence on July 1, 1988, any changes in facility bed capacity would not require Certificate of Need review. Local Inpatient Crisis Stabilization Beds DMH reports there are an insufficient number of adult inpatient psychiatric beds in a number of regions of the State. As a result of this situation, significant numbers of persons in a behavioral crisis are being held in hospital emergency rooms for inordinate periods of time until an appropriate inpatient psychiatric bed becomes available. These emergency room patients may not have a source of funding. -term emergency stabilization of psychiatric patients in the local community, by use of both local hospital beds and non-hospital residential programs, such as community residential care facilities, for those patients who do not require a hospital level of care. For patients needing stabilization in a hospital, subject to available funding, DMH contracts with one or more local hospitals willing to admit indigent patients assessed by DMH as needing acute care in return for a daily rate for a defined period. These patients can be cared for in licensed general acute care beds or licensed psychiatric beds. To assist in alleviating this problem, the following policies will apply: a.A Certificate of Need is not required to convert existing acute care beds or existing psychiatric beds to create Crisis Stabilization services pursuant to a contract with DMH. b.A Certificate of Need is required to add psychiatric beds pursuant to a contract with DMH to provide Crisis Stabilization services. These additional beds could be approved if the Plan indicates a need for additional beds or some small number (ten beds or less) of additional beds could be approved for crisis stabilization patients only. These beds would not be restricted to any specific age group except that the patients would have to be over age 18. 39c. An application for a Certificate of Need for Crisis Stabilization patients only must be accompanied by information from DMH to verify this additional need, such as the number of patients currently awaiting treatment, the estimated average length of stay, the pay source for the patients, the number of patients emergently admitted to DMH hospitals over the past year from the area, the number of crisis patients that are expected to require this service annually, and other information to justify these additional psychiatric beds. In addition, DMH will supply verification that it made contact with all hospitals in the county and contiguous counties to notify them of the potential for adding some psychiatric beds to the area. The hospital seeking the Certificate of Need will provide the necessary care for these individuals referred by DMH and may be reimbursed for the care of the patients if there are sufficient funds, but the hospital must identify the minimum number of indigent (no source of funding) patient days it will provide to patients referred by DMH. Should the contract with DMH terminate for any reason or should the hospital fail to provide care to the patients referred from DMH, the license for these beds will be voided. If justified by DMH, the Department will consider converting inpatient psychiatric beds to other levels of care provided that alternative community-based resources are not available. Patients appropriate for de-institutionalization should be discharged when the appropriate community support services are in place. 40Facility by Region County Beds Pt.

These facilities should be located where an extensive variety of professionals representing medical, psychological, social, and vocational rehabilitation evaluation and services are available. These beds are viewed as being comprehensive in nature and not limited only to a particular service or specialty. CMS identifies 13 specific conditions for which facilities must treat Certain comorbidities as specified in 42 CFR 412.29(b)(1) must be used to determine the compliance threshold. Most general hospitals and other health care facilities offer physical rehabilitation services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy without the involvement of a formal interdisciplinary program. In addition, some hospitals have consolidated their rehabilitation services into a single unit to improve the coordination of care for acute patients in their facilities. These consolidations are intended to improve the quality of care for patients currently being treated in the facility and are not considered to be providing comprehensive physical rehabilitation services as defined in this section of the Plan. The Rehabilitation Programs Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. The need for beds is calculated based on rehabilitation service areas. 2. The methodology takes the greater of the actual utilization of the facilities in the service area or the statewide average number of beds per 1,000 of the 65+ population cohort to project need. 3. In the absence of a projected need for beds in a rehabilitation facility service area, an existing facility can apply to add up to eight additional beds, given that it has achieved an Up to ten additional beds may be added in a facility which has achieved an occupancy rate of at least 90% as reported on the most recent JAR. The Rehabilitation Bed Need Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. 45RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); and 3. Ability to Complete the Project. Rehabilitation facilities are now located throughout the state and are available within approximately 60 travel time for the majority of residents. Such facilities should be located where an extensive variety of health care professionals are available. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service.

These are (1) outpatient facilities, (2) social detoxification centers, (3) residential treatment programs, ( 4) inpatient treatment services, and ( 5) opioid (narcotic) treatment programs. OUTPATIENT FACILITIES An outpatient facility provides treatment, care and services to individuals dependent upon or addicted to psychoactive substances and their families based on an individual treatment plan in a nonresidential setting. The length and intensity of outpatient treatment varies according to the severity of the individual's illness and response to treatment. There are currently 84 licensed \"Outpatient Facilities that Treat Individuals for Psychoactive Substance Abuse or Dependence\" in South Carolina, with a total of 113 locations. A Certificate of Need is not required for outpatient facilities as described above. SOCIAL DETOXIFICATION FACILITIES A social detoxification facility provides supervised withdrawal from alcohol or other drugs in which neither the client's level of intoxication nor physical condition is severe enough to warrant direct medical supervision or the use of medications to assist in withdrawal, but which maintains medical backup and provides a structured program of counseling, if appropriate, educational services, and referral for further rehabilitation. It provides 24-hour- a-day observation of the client until discharge. A Certificate of Need is not required for a social detoxification facility. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM FACILITIES A residential treatment program facility is a 24-hour facility offering an organized service in a residential setting, which is designed to improve the client's ability to structure and organize the tasks of daily living and recovery through planned clinical activities, counseling, and clinical monitoring in order to promote successful involvement or re-involvement in regular, productive, daily activity, and, as indicated, successful reintegration into family living. Residential treatment programs utilize a multi-disciplinary staff for clients whose biomedical and emotional/behavioral problems are severe enough to require residential services and who are in need of a stable and supportive environment to aid in their recovery and transition back into the community. Twenty-four hour observation, monitoring, and treatment shall be available. 50A Certificate of Need is not required for a Residential Treatment Program. INPATIENT TREATMENT FACILITIES An inpatient treatment facility is a short-term treatment service for persons who are in need of an organized intensive program of alcohol and/or drug rehabilitation, but who are without serious debilitating medical complications. These facilities may provide detoxification for their patients, as needed, in the inpatient treatment beds. These facilities are licensed either as a specialized hospital or as part of a hospital. For reference purposes only, these facilities are also subject to compliance with Regulation 61-16. The Inpatient Treatment Facilities Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. Need projections are calculated by service area. Because patients in need of alcohol and/or drug abuse treatment frequently require psychiatric treatment services as well, the inpatient treatment service areas mirror the psychiatric service areas (e.g., Anderson/Oconee, Greenville/Pickens, etc.) to facilitate planning in a manner that recognizes the comorbidity of this patient population. 2. The methodology for calculating inpatient treatment bed need is as follows: a. For the service area, take the greater of the service area utilization rate or the statewide utilization rate for inpatient treatment beds by age cohort. The statewide utilization rate for each age cohort will be used for those service areas where no beds currently exist. b. Multiply the applicable utilization rate by the projected population for the year 2024 for each age cohort (where such data is available) and divide by 365 to obtain a projected average daily census by age cohort. c. Take the sum of average daily censuses by age cohort and divide by the target occupancy rate of 75% to determine the number of beds needed in the service area. d. The number of additional beds needed or excess beds for the service area is obtained by subtracting the number of existing beds from the bed need. 3. Because a minimum of 20 beds is needed for an inpatient program, a 20-bed unit may be approved in a service area that does not have any existing beds provided the applicant can document the need. 514. In the absence of a projected need in the service area, an existing inpatient treatment facility can apply to add up to eight additional inpatient treatment beds if it has achieved an occupancy rate of at least 70% as reported on its most recent Joint Annual Report (\"JAR\"). 5. Inpatient treatment facilities are physically distinct from freestanding detoxification centers. Applicants may not combine the bed need for freestanding detoxification with the bed need for inpatient treatment in order to generate a higher bed need for an inpatient facility. There are no prohibitions against an inpatient facility providing detoxification services to its clients as needed, but the bed need projections refer to two distinct treatment modes that cannot be commingled. 6. The establishment of a regional treatment center to serve more than a single service area may be proposed in order to improve access to care for patients in service areas that are not currently well served. Such a proposed center would be allowed to combine the bed need for separate, contiguous service areas, provided that each service area to be combined shows a positive bed need. The applicant must document with patient origin data the historical utilization of the residents in the service area that is to be combined, or why it is in the best interest of these residents for their projected bed need to be used to form a regional treatment facility. 7. It is frequently impossible for a facility to totally predict or control short-term deviation in the number of patients with mixed psychiatric/addictive etiology. Therefore, in the case of facilities with licensed beds for both psychiatric and substance abuse treatment, 75% of licensed substance abuse beds may be utilized alternatively for the treatment of patients having diagnoses of both psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following Project Review Criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1. Community Need Documentation 2.Distribution (Accessibility); and 3.Staff Resources. Services are accessible within 60 minutes' travel time for the majority of residents of the state. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. The Inpatient Treatment Bed Need Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. 52OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS Opioid treatment programs provide medications for the rehabilitation of persons dependent on opium, morphine, heroin or any derivative or synthetic drug. Opioid maintenance therapy (OMT) is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic treatment modalities, including the therapeutic use of specialized opioid compounds such as methadone, suboxone and buprenorphine to psychopharmacologically occupy opiate receptors in the brain, extinguish drug craving and thus establish a maintenance state. OMT is a separate service that can be provided in any level of care, as determined by the client's needs. For reference purposes only, Opioid (narcotic) treatment programs are described in Regulation 61-93 . Charges for medication usually range between $11 and $17 per day. A Registered Pharmacist must dispense the medication. The Opioid Treatment Programs Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. Because clients must usually attend a center 6 days per week to receive their dose of medication, these centers should be located throughout the state, with at least one center per county. To improve accessibility, opioid treatment programs should be developed in counties where none exist. 2. An additional treatment program can only be approved in a county with an existing program if the applicant is able to document sufficient need for the service. 3. For reference purposes only, Regulation 61-93 states that a narcotic (opioid) treatment program shall not operate within 500 feet of: the property line of a church, the property line of a public or private elementary or secondary school, a boundary of any residential district, a public park adjacent to any residential district, or the property line of a lot devoted to residential use. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following Project Review Criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1. Community Need Documentation; 2. Distribution (Accessibility); 3. Record of the Applicant; 53Due to the increasing number of opioid deaths in South Carolina, additional facilities are needed for the services to be accessible within 30 minutes' travel time for the majority of state residents. The benefits of improved accessibility will outweigh the adverse effects of the duplication of this existing service. 542018 Facility by Region County Beds Pt.

Children and/or adolescents up to age 21 who manifest a substantial disorder of cognitive or emotional process which lessens or impairs to a marked degree their capacity either to develop or to exercise age-appropriate or age-adequate behavior are treated by these facilities. These facilities provide medium to long-term care (six months or longer). Treatment modalities are both medical and behavioral in nature. Some facilities contract with the South Carolina Continuum of Care (COC) to provide these services. Services available, at a minimum, should include the following: 1. 24-hour, awake supervision in a secure facility; 2. individual treatment plans to assess the problems and determine specific patient goals; 3. psychiatric consultation and professional psychological services for treatment supervision and consultation; 4. nursing services, as required; 5. regularly scheduled individual, group, and/or family counseling in keeping with the needs of each client; 6. recreational facilities with an organized youth development program; 7. a special education program with a minimum program defined by the South Carolina Department of Education; and 8. discharge planning including a final assessment of the patient's condition and an aftercare plan indicating any referrals to follow-up treatment and self-help groups. Each facility shall have a written plan for cooperation with other public and private organizations, such as schools, social service agencies, etc., to ensure that each child under its care will receive comprehensive treatment. In addition, each facility shall have a written transfer agreement with one or more hospitals for the transfer of emergency cases when such hospitalization becomes necessary. A proposal for Residential Treatment Facilities for Children and Adolescents should have letters of support from the Department of Social Services (DSS), DMH, and COC. 59The Residential Treatment Facilities for Children & Adolescents Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1.The establishment or expansion of an RTF requires a Certificate of Need . 2.Need projections are calculated on a statewide basis to serve the needs of this population . 3.The applicant must document the need for the expansion of or the addition of an RTF based on the most current utilization data available. The existing resources must be considered and documentation presented as to why these resources are not adequate to meet the needs of the community. 4.An existing facility that can demonstrate a 70% or greater occupancy rate for the most recent year can apply to add up to five additional beds outside of the need identified in this Plan. An existing facility that can demonstrate an 80% or greater occupancy rate for the most recent year can apply to add up to ten additional beds, outside of the need identified in this Plan. An existing facility that can demonstrate a 90% or greater occupancy rate for the most recent year can apply to add up to fifteen additional beds, outside of the need identified in this Plan. 5. An existing facility seeking to establish a specialty unit of the RTF (i.e., full-service autism spectrum treatment), or a new facility proposing to include such a specialty unit, can apply to add or include up to 20 such beds, outside the need identified in this Plan, by demonstrating need through utilization and diagnostic data of the most recent year. 6.For a new facility, the applicant must document where the potential patients for the facility will come from and where they are currently being served, to include the expected shift in patient volume from existing providers and the expected number of out-of-state children expected to utilized beds in the facility . For the expansion of an existing facility, the applicant must provide patient origin information on the current facility , and any expected shift in patient origin from within or outside of South Carolina . 7.The applicant must document the potential impact that the proposed new RTF or expansion will have upon the existing service providers and referral patterns. 8.The applicant must provide a written commitment that the facility will provide services for indigent and charity patients at a percentage that is comparable to other health care facilities in the service area. 9.The applicant agrees to provide utilization data on the operation of the facility to the Department. 60To account for a substantial increase in out-of-state children being placed in South Carolina RTFs, the bed need methodology to be used in South Carolina is based upon a standard of 70 beds per 100,000 children. Since few, if any, children under five years of age would be candidates for this type of care, the bed need will be based on the population age 5-21. The Projected Bed Need for Residential Treatment Facilities for Children & Adolescents Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1. Community Need Documentation; 2. Distribution (Accessibility); 3. Record of the Applicant; 4. Staff Resources; and 5. Medically Underserved Groups. Residential treatment facility beds for children and adolescents are distributed statewide and are located within 60 travel time for the majority of residents of the State.

Hospitals without an open heart surgery program shall be allowed to provide Emergent/Primary and/or Elective PCIs only if they comply with all sections of Standard 7 or 8 of the Standards for Cardiac Catheterization. In 2013, SCAI, ACC, and AHA updated their joint statement on clinical competence regarding coronary artery intervention procedures. The joint statement defined certain requirements for PCI operator competence and PCI facility volume requirements. The statement also noted an overall decrease in PCI volumes. Both cardiac catheterization and open heart surgery programs require highly skilled staffs and expensive equipment. Appropriately equipped and staffed programs serving larger populations are preferable to multiple, minimum population programs. Underutilized programs may reflect unnecessary duplication of services in an area, which may seriously compromise quality and safety of procedures and increase the cost of care. Optimal performance requires a caseload of adequate size to maintain the skills and efficiency of the staff. Cardiac catheterization laboratories should perform a minimum of 200 procedures per year. Emergent PCI operators should perform a minimum of 36 PCIs annually; all other PCI operators should perform a minimum of 200 combined procedures annually. Individual providers should perform a minimum of 50 PCIs annually (averaged over two years), including no less than 11 emergent/primary PCIs annually. It is recommended these be performed in facilities meeting a 200 procedure-per-year threshold. CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION Relevant Definitions \"Cardiac Catheterization Procedure \" is an invasive procedure where a thin, flexible catheter is inserted into a blood vessel; the physician then manipulates the free end of the catheter into the chambers or vessels of the heart. All activities performed during one clinical session, including angiocardiography, coronary arteriography, pulmonary arteriography, coronary angioplasty and other diagnostic or therapeutic measures and physiologic studies shall be considered one procedure. \"Comprehensive Catheterization Laboratory \" means a dedicated room or suite of rooms in which PCIs as well as diagnostic and therapeutic catheterizations are performed, in a facility 64with on-site open heart surgery backup. \"Diagnostic Catheterization \" refers to a cardiac catheterization during which any or all of the following diagnostic procedures or measures are performed: Blood Pressure; Oxygen Content and Flow Measurements; Angiocardiography, Coronary Arteriography; and Pulmonary Arteriography. \"Diagnostic Catheterization Laboratory \" means a dedicated room in which only diagnostic catheterizations are performed. \"Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) \" refers to a therapeutic procedure to relieve coronary narrowing, such as Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) or Coronary Stent Implantation. These procedures may be performed on an emergent or elective basis. \"Emergent or Primary\" means that a patient needs immediate PCI because, in the treating physician's best clinical judgment, delay would result in undue harm or risk to the patient. An \"Elective\" PCI is scheduled in advance and performed on a patient with cardiac function that has been stable in the days prior to the procedure. \"Therapeutic Catheterization \" refers to a PCI or cardiac catheterization during which, in addition to any diagnostic catheterization procedure, any or all of the following interventional procedures are performed: PTCA; and Cardiac Valvuloplasty. \"Therapeutic Catheterization Laboratory\" means a room in which therapeutic catheterizations are performed in addition to any diagnostic catheterizations as referenced in the above definition of \"Therapeutic Catheterization\". Scope of Services The following services should be available in both adult and pediatric catheterization laboratories: 1. Each cardiac catheterization lab should be competent to provide a range of angiographic (angiocardiography, coronary arteriography, pulmonary arteriography), hemodynamic, and physiologic (cardiac output measurement, intracardiac pressure, etc.) studies. These facilities should be available in one laboratory so that the patient need not be moved during a procedure. 2. The lab should have the capability of immediate endocardiac catheter pacemaking in cardiac arrest, a crash cart, and defibrillator. 3. A full range of non-invasive cardiac/circulatory diagnostic support services, such as 65the following, should be available within the hospital: a. Nuclear Cardiology b. Echocardiography c. Pulmonary Function Testing d. Exercise Testing e. Electrocardiography f. Cardiac Chest X-ray and Cardiac Fluoroscopy g. Clinical Pathology and Blood Chemistry Analysis h. Phonocardiography i. Coronary Care Units (CCUs) j. Medical Telemetry/Progressive Care 4. Each applicant shall document plans for providing cardiac rehabilitation services to its patients or plans for establishing referral agreements with facilities offering cardiac rehabilitation services. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. The capacity of a fixed cardiac catheterization laboratory shall be 1,200 procedures per year, as measured on an equivalent basis. Each adult diagnostic cardiac catheterization shall carry a weight of 1.0 procedures, while each adult therapeutic catheterization performed in the fixed laboratory shall carry a weight of 2.0 procedures. For pediatric and adult congenital catheterization labs, diagnostic catheterizations shall carry the weight of 2.0 procedures, therapeutic catheterizations shall carry the weight of 3.0 procedures, electrophysiology (EP) studies shall carry the weight of 2.0 procedures, and biopsies performed after heart transplants shall carry the weight of 1.0 procedures. The capacity of mobile cardiac catheterization labs will be calculated based on the number of days of operation per week. 2. The service area for a diagnostic or therapeutic catheterization laboratory is defined as all facilities within 30 minutes' emergency medical transport time1; for comprehensive cardiac catheterization laboratories the service area is all facilities within 60 minutes' emergency medical transport time; a pediatric cardiac program should serve a population encompassing at least 30,000 births per year, or roughly two million people. 1 Emergency medical transport time shall be determined by the DHEC Bureau of EMS and Trauma, and for the purposes of this Plan shall mean transport by ground ambulance.

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); 3.Staff Resources; on Other Facilities. The Department finds that: (1) Diagnostic catheterization services are generally available within 45 minutes' and therapeutic catheterization services within 90 minutes' travel time for the majority of South Carolina residents; (2) Significant cardiac catheterization capacity exists in most areas of the State; and (3) The preponderance of the literature on the subject indicates that a minimum number of procedures are recommended per year in order to develop and maintain physician and staff competency in performing these procedures. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. OPEN HEART SURGERY Relevant Definitions \"Open Heart Surgery \" refers to an operation performed on the heart or intrathoracic great vessels. An \"Open Heart Surgery Unit \" is an operating room , which may be included within a suite of rooms, equipped and staffed to perform open heart surgery procedures; such designation does not preclude its use for other related surgeries, such as vascular surgical procedures. A hospital with an open heart surgery program may have one or more open heart surgery units. \"Open Heart Surgical Procedure \" means an operation performed on the heart or intrathoracic great vessels within an open heart surgical unit. All activities performed during 74one clinical session shall be considered one procedure. \"Open Heart Surgical Program \" means the combination of staff, equipment, physical space and support services used to perform open heart surgery. Adult open heart surgical programs should have the capacity to perform a full range of procedures, including: 1. repair/replacement of heart valves by traditional surgical means 2. repair of congenital defects 3. cardiac revascularization 4. repair/reconstruction of intrathoracic vessels 5. treatment of cardiac traumas In addition, open heart programs must have the ability to implement and apply circulatory assist devices such as intra-aortic balloon and prolonged cardiopulmonary partial bypass.

A pediatric cardiac surgical service should provide services for a minimum service area population with 30,000 live births, or roughly two million people. Open heart surgery for elective procedures should be available at least 40 hours per week, and elective open heart surgery should be accessible with a waiting time of no more than two weeks. All facilities providing open heart surgery must conform to local, state, and federal regulatory requirements and should meet the full accreditation standards for The Joint Commission (TJC), if the facility is TJC accredited. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1.The establishment of an open heart surgery program requires Certificate of Need review . 2. Comprehensive cardiac catheterization laboratories shall only be located in hospitals that provide open heart surgery. 3. The capacity of an open heart surgery program is 500 open heart procedures per year per open heart surgery unit ( i.e., each operating room equipped and staffed to perform open heart surgery has a maximum capacity of 500 procedures annually). 4. There should be a minimum of 200 adult open heart surgery procedures performed annually per open heart surgery unit within three years after initiation in any institution in which open heart surgery is performed for adults.

The applicant shall document the services, if any, from which these patients will be drawn; and c) The existing and projected patient origin information and referral patterns for each open heart surgery service serving patients from the area proposed to be served shall be provided. 6. No new open heart surgery programs shall be approved if the new program will cause the annual caseload of other programs within the proposed service area to drop below 350 adult procedures or 130 pediatric procedures per open heart surgery unit. 7.A one-time incremental expansion of one open heart surgery unit shall not be considered a substantial expansion of a health service, and therefore shall not be grounds for Certificate of Need review. Expansion of an existing open heart surgery service beyond the one-time incremental increase of one open heart unit shall only be approved if the service has operated at a minimum use rate of 70 percent of capacity for each of the past two years and can project a minimum of 200 procedures per year in the new 77open heart surgery unit. The applicant shall document the other service providers, if any, from which these additional patients will be drawn. 8. The application shall include standards adopted or to be adopted by the service, consistent with current medical practice as published by clinical professional organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology or the American Heart Association, defining high-risk procedures and patients who, because of their conditions, are at high risk and shall state whether high-risk cases are or will be performed or high-risk patients will be served. 9. Open heart surgery services should be staffed by a minimum of two physicians licensed by the State of South Carolina who possess the qualifications specified by the governing body of the facility. Protocols should be established that govern initial and continuing granting of clinical staff privileges to physicians to perform open heart surgery and therapeutic cardiac catheterizations. In addition, standards should be established to assure that each physician using the service will be involved in adequate numbers of applicable types of open heart surgery and therapeutic cardiac catheterizations to maintain proficiency. 10. The open heart surgery service will have the capability for emergency coronary artery surgery, including: a. Sufficient personnel and facilities available to conduct the coronary artery surgery on an immediate, emergency basis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; b. Location of the cardiac catheterization laboratory(ies) in which therapeutic catheterizations will be performed near the open heart surgery operating rooms; and c. A predetermined protocol adopted by the cardiac catheterization service governing the provision of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and other therapeutic or high-risk cardiac catheterization procedures or the catheterization of patients at high risk and defining the plans for the patients' emergency care. These high-risk procedures should only be performed with open heart surgery backup. The cardiac team must be promptly available and capable of successfully operating on unstable acute ischemic patients in an emergency setting. 11. The Department encourages all applicants and providers to share their outcomes data with appropriate registries and research studies designed to improve the quality of cardiac care. 7812. An applicant for open heart surgery service agrees, as a condition for issuance of its Certificate of Need for such service, to discontinue services and surrender the Certificate of Need for that service if they have failed to achieve 200 open heart procedures per open heart unit per year by the expiration of the first three years of operation of such services. One time incremental expansions of one open heart unit are subject to the same threshold, and any such unit shall be closed if it does not achieve 200 open heart procedures within three years of the expansion. 13. The expansion of an existing open heart surgery service beyond the incremental expansion described above shall only be approved if the service has operated at a minimum use rate of 70 percent of capacity, overall, for each of the past two years and can project a minimum of 200 procedures per year in the new open heart surgery units. The applicant shall document the other service providers, if any, from which these additional patients will be drawn. The Open Heart Units Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); 3.Staff Resources; and 4.Adverse on Other Facilities. The Department makes the following findings: (1) Open heart surgery services are available within 60 minutes' travel time for the majority of residents of South Carolina; (2) Based upon the standards cited above, most of the open heart surgery providers are currently utilizing less than the functional capability ( i.e., 70% of maximum capacity) of their existing surgical suites; (3) The preponderance of the literature on the subject indicates that a minimum number of procedures is recommended per year in order to develop and maintain physician and staff competency in performing these procedures; and (4) Increasing geographic access may create lower volumes in existing programs causing a potential reduction in quality and efficiency, exacerbate existing problems regarding the availability of nursing staff and other personnel, and not necessarily 79reduce waiting time since other factors (such as the referring physician's preference) would still need to be addressed. (5) Research has shown a positive relationship between the volume of open heart surgeries performed annually at a facility and patient outcomes. Thus, the Department establishes minimum standards that must be met by a hospital in order to provide open heart surgery. Specifically, a hospital is required to project a minimum of 200 open heart surgeries annually within three years of initiation of services. This number is considered to be the minimum caseload required to operate a program that maintains the skill and efficiency of hospital staff and reflects an efficient use of an expensive resource. It is in the public's interest that facilities achieve their projected volumes. (6) The Department recognizes the important correlation between volume and proficiency. The Department further recognizes that the number of open heart surgery cases is decreasing and that maintaining volume in programs is very important to the provision of quality care to the community. The benefits of improved accessibility will not outweigh the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. 808182# Open Heart Region/Facility Units Adults Peds Adults Peds Adults Peds Region I Anmed Health Medical Center 2 145 174 159 Prisma Greenville Memorial Hospital (Formerly GHS) 3 443 513 491 Saint Francis - Downtown 2 350 344 319 Self Regional Healthcare 1 92 90 93 Spartanburg Medical Center 3 434 449 395 Total Region I 11 1,464 1,570 1,457 Region II Aiken Regional Medical Centers 1 26 30 26 Lexington Medical Center 2 342 402 422 Prisma Health Richland (Formerly Palmetto Health) 3 356 363 484 Piedmont Medical Center 2 148 71 200 Providence Health 4 427 390 304 Total Region II 12 1,299 1,256 1,436 Region III MUSC Health Florence Medical Center (Formerly Carolinas Hopsital System)1 60 58 63 Grand Strand Medical Center 2 432 384 371 McLeod Regional Medical Center of the Pee Dee 3 372 443 259 Total Region III 6 864 885 693 Region IV Hilton Head Hospital 2 60 44 44 MUSC Medical Center 1 5 358 295 250 175 404 260 Roper Hospital 2 502 534 470 Trident Medical Center 2 240 226 190 Total Region IV 11 1,160 295 1,054 175 1,108 260 Statewide Totals 40 4,787 295 4,765 175 4,694 260 1 SC-17-63 issued 8/11/2017 for addition of one pediatric open-heart suite. Not yet operational.FY 2016 FY 2017 FY 2018OPEN HEART UNITS (Chapter 8) 83CHAPTER 9 RADIATION ONCOLOGY Cancer is a group of related diseases that involve out-of-control growth and spread of abnormal cells. These cells accumulate and form tumors that invade and destroy normal tissue. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 39 out of 100 men and 38 out of 100 women will suffer from cancer during their lifetimes. The most common types of cancer include prostate cancer for men, breast cancer for women, whereas lung and colon cancer are a common occurrence in both genders. The Department tracks the occurrence of cancer in the State, including identification of \" cancer cluster \" locations, through the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry . Megavoltage radiation has been utilized for decades as a standard modality for cancer treatment. It is best known as Radiation Therapy, but is also called Radiotherapy, X-Ray Therapy, or Irradiation. Beams of ionizing radiation are aimed to meet at a specific point and deliver radiation to that precise location. The amount of radiation used is measured in \"gray\" (Gy) and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. Radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, so the goal is to damage as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting harm to nearby healthy tissue. A typical course of treatment is five times per week, Monday through Friday, and lasts for three to nine weeks, depending on the type of cancer and the treatment goal. Relevant Definitions There are varying types of radiation treatment, and definitions are often used interchangeably. The following definitions apply: \"Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART) \" - Patient setup and/or radiation delivery is evaluated and modified periodically during the treatment course based on imaging and dose measurements made prior to or during treatment. \"Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) \" - Uses the results of imaging tests such as MRI and special computers to map the location of the tumor precisely to deliver radiation beams from different directions designed to match the shape of the tumor. This helps to reduce radiation damage to normal tissues and better kill the cancer by focusing the radiation dose on the tumor. \"Electronic Portal Imaging Devices (EPIDs) \" have been developed because of the increased complexity of treatment planning and delivery techniques. The most common EPIDs are video-based systems wherein on-line digital port images are captured and analyzed before or during treatment. These systems are used for pre-treatment verification of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy fields and to reduce errors in patient positioning. 84\"Fractionation \" is the practice of providing only a small fraction of the entire prescribed dose of radiation in each treatment or session. Individual treatment plans are created to minimize the side effects for normal tissue. The typical fractionation schedule for adults is once per day, five days a week. Hyperfractionation (Superfractionation ) refers to radiation given in smaller doses twice a day. In Hypofractionation , individual doses are given less often than daily, such as in two-five sessions. \"Helical-tomotherapy\" is a form of IRMT that delivers radiation inside a large \"donut.\" For this treatment, the patient lies on a table that slowly slides through the donut as the machine spirals around the patient. It delivers many small beams of radiation at the tumor from different angles around the body. This allows for even more precisely focused radiation. \"Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) \" Is a form of 3D-CRT where imaging scans (like a CT scan) are done before each treatment. This allows the radiation oncologist to adjust the position of the patient or re-focus the radiation as needed to hit the tumor and limit other damage. \"Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) \" - Is like 3D-CRT, but it also changes the strength of some of the beams in certain areas. This gets stronger doses to certain parts of the tumor and helps lessen damage to nearby normal body tissues. \"Conformal Proton Beam Radiation Therapy \" uses proton beams instead of photons or electrons. Protons are positive parts of atoms that cause little damage to tissues they pass through but are very good at killing cells at the end of their path. Proton beam radiation delivers more radiation to the tumor while reducing side effects on normal tissues. Protons can only be put out by a special machine called a cyclotron or sychrontron. \"Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) \" is a precision radiation therapy delivery concept derived from cranial (brain)stereotactic radiosurgery. It is an external beam radiation therapy method used to very precisely deliver a high dose of radiation to an extracranial target within the body, using either a single dose or a small number of fractions. SBRT has become an established treatment technique for lung, liver, and spinal lesions. \"Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) \" is a non-surgical radiation therapy used to treat functional abnormalities and small tumors of the brain. It can deliver precisely-targeted radiation in fewer high-dose treatments than traditional therapy, which can help preserve healthy tissue. It is also known as Stereotaxic Radiosurgery or Radiation Surgery. \"Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (SRT) \" is an approach similar to Stereotactic Radiosurgery that delivers radiation to the target tissue. However, the total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days, rather than a single large dose. It can be used to treat both brain and extracranial tumors. 85TYPES OF RADIATION EQUIPMENT Linear Accelerator (LINAC) The LINAC produces high energy x-rays that are collected to form a beam that matches the size and shape of the patient's tumor. Radiation can be delivered to the tumor from any angle by a rotating robotic arm. A LINAC must be located in a room with lead and concrete walls to keep the rays from escaping. The capacity standards for a linear accelerator vary by the capability of the equipment and are addressed in the Standards below. There is also LINAC equipment designed strictly to provide Stereotactic Radiotherapy. These specialized LINACs have an even lower capacity because of the treatment time associated with this type of care. The capacity for such equipment is established as 1,500 treatments per year per unit. Proton Beam Therapy Unit This modality is a type of external beam radiation therapy that uses protons rather than x- rays to treat cancer. A proton is a positively charged particle. A synchrotron or cyclotron speeds up protons to create high energy. This energy makes the protons travel to the desired depth in the body where the protons give the targeted radiation dose in the tumor. Cobalt-60 (Photon) This modality, best known by the trade name of Gamma Knife, is used to perform Stereotactic Radiosurgery. It is primarily used to treat brain tumors, although it can also be used for other neurological conditions like Parkinson's Disease and Epilepsy. Its use is generally reserved for cancers that are difficult or dangerous to treat with surgery. The radiation damages the genetic code of the tumor in a single treatment, preventing it from replicating and causing it to slowly shrink. The Gamma Knife consists of a large shield surrounding a large helmet-shaped device with separate, fixed ports that allow the radiation to enter the patient's head in small beams that converge on the designated target. A rigid frame is attached to the patient's skull to provide a solid reference for both targeting and treatment. The patient is then sent for imaging, to accurately determine the position of the target. The computer system develops a treatment plan to position the patient and the paths and doses of radiation. The patient is positioned with the head affixed to the couch, and the treatment is delivered. 86CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS FOR RADIOTHERAPY 1. The capacity of a conventional linear accelerator, either with or without EPID, is 7,000 treatments per year. 2. Linear accelerators with IMRT or IGRT capabilities have a capacity of 5,000 treatments per year. A facility must document that it is providing or will provide these specialized treatments in sufficient volume to justify why it should be held to this planning capacity. 3. IMRT/IGRT linear accelerators with stereotactic procedures capabilities have a capacity of 4,500 treatments per year. A facility must document that it is providing or will provide these specialized treatments in sufficient volume to justify why it should be held to this planning capacity. 4.

The Megavoltage Visits Chart and Radiotherapy Chart are located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for these services: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); and 3.Medically Underserved Groups. Radiotherapy services are distributed statewide and are located within 60 minutes' travel time for the majority of residents of the State. Because a typical course of treatment is five times per week, Monday through Friday, and lasts for three to nine weeks, the benefits of improved accessibility may out weigh the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS FOR STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY 1. The capacity of a dedicated Stereotactic Radiosurgery unit is 300 procedures annually. This is based on an average of two procedures per day times three days per week times 50 weeks per year. 2. New Radiosurgery services shall only be approved if the following conditions are met: 88a. All existing dedicated Stereotactic Radiosurgery units in the service area have performed at a combined use rate of 80 percent of capacity as evidenced in the most recent Joint Annual Reports; and b. An applicant must project that the proposed service will perform a minimum of 200 procedures annually within three years of initiation of service, without reducing the utilization of existing units below the 80 percent threshold. 3. Expansion of an existing radiosurgery service shall only be approved if the service has operated at a minimum use rate of 80 percent of capacity for each of the prior two years and can project a minimum of 200 procedures per year on the additional equipment within three years of its implementation. 4. The applicant shall project the utilization of the service, to include: a. Epidemiological evidence of the incidence and prevalence of conditions for which radiosurgery treatment is appropriate, to include the number of potential patients for these procedures; b. The number of patients of the applicant who were referred to other radiosurgery providers in the preceding three years and the number of those patients who could have been served by the proposed service; and c. Current and projected patient origin information and referral patterns for the facility's existing radiation therapy services. The applicant shall document the number of additional patients, if any, that will be generated through changes in referral patterns, recruitment of specific physicians or other changes in circumstances. 5. The applicant must include letters of support from physicians and health care facilities indicating a willingness to refer patients to the proposed service. 6. The applicant must document that protocols will be established to assure that all clinical radiosurgery procedures performed are medically necessary and that alternative treatment modalities have been considered. 7. The applicant must affirm the following: a. The radiosurgery unit will have a board certified neurosurgeon and a board certified radiation oncologist, both of whom are trained in stereotactic radiosurgery; b.

These facilities serve patients who do not require hospitalization and makes available a range of diagnostic and treatment services. Hospital-based outpatient departments vary in scope, but generally include diagnostic laboratory, radiology, and clinical referral services. AMBULATORY SURGICAL FACILITY Ambulatory surgery, often described as outpatient or same-day surgery, may be provided in a freestanding Ambulatory Surgical Facility (ASF). An ASF is a distinct, freestanding, entity that is organized, administered, equipped and operated exclusively for the purpose of performing surgical procedures or related care, treatment, procedures, and/or services, for which patients are scheduled to arrive, receive surgery, or related care, treatment, procedures, and/or services, and be discharged on the same day, as defined in Regulation 61-91, Section 101.RR. The owner or operator makes the facility available to other providers who comprise an organized professional staff (open medical staff). This definition does not apply to any facility used as an office or clinic for the private practice of licensed health care professionals. For purposes of this Plan, an endoscope is defined as a flexible, semi-flexible or rigid instrument, which may or may not have a light attached, that is inserted into a natural orifice in a non-sterile, clean environment, to visually inspect for purposes of screening and diagnosis and to perform therapeutic treatment of the interior of a bodily canal or a hollow organ (such as the colon, bladder, stomach or nasal sinuses). A substantial increase has occurred in both the number and percentage of ambulatory surgeries performed and in the number of approved ASFs. This trend has generally been encouraged because many surgical procedures can be safely performed on an outpatient basis at a lower cost. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1.The county in which the proposed facility is to be located is considered to be the service area for inventory purposes. The applicant may define a proposed service area that encompasses additional counties. 2.The applicant must identify the physicians who are affiliated or have an ownership interest in the proposed facility by medical specialty. These physicians must identify where they currently perform their surgeries and whether they anticipate making any changes in staff privileges or coverage should the application be approved. 943.For a new facility, the applicant must document where the potential patients for the facility will come from and where they are currently being served, to include the expected shift in patient volume from existing providers. For the expansion of an existing facility, the applicant must provide patient origin information on the current facility. 4.The applicant must document the need for the expansion of or the addition of an ASF, based on the most current utilization data available. This need documentation must include the projected number of surgeries or endoscopic procedures to be performed by medical specialty. The existing resources must be considered and documentation presented as to why the existing resources are not adequate to meet the needs of the community. 5.The applicant must document the potential impact that the proposed new ASF or expansion of an existing ASF will have upon the existing service providers. 6.The applicant must document whether it will restrict surgeries by specialty. Applicants that wish to restrict surgeries by specialty understand that another Certificate of Need would be required before the ASF could provide other surgical specialties. Applicants seeking to perform only endoscopic procedures are considered restricted. 7.Before an application for a new general Ambulatory Surgery Facility can be accepted for filing in a county having a current population of less than 100,000 people, all general ASFs in the county must have been licensed by the Department and operational for an entire a determination of their utilization. The requirements that all ASFs must have been licensed and operational for an entire year and submitted utilization data to the Department will not be applied to applicants for an ASF filing in a county having a current population of greater than 100,000 people. 8.Endoscopy suites are considered separately from other operating rooms and therefore are not considered competing applicants for Certificate of Need review purposes. Before an application for a new endoscopy-only ASF can be accepted for filing in a county having a current population of less than 100,000 people, all ASFs with endoscopy suites in the county must have been licensed by the Department and operational for an entire year and determination of their utilization. The requirements that all ASFs with endoscopy suites must have been licensed and operational for an entire year and submitted utilization data to the Department will not be applied to applicants for a new endoscopy-only ASF filing in a county having a current population of greater than 100,000 people. 9.The approval of a new general or endoscopy-only ASF in a county does not preclude an existing facility from applying to expand its number of operating rooms and/or endoscopy 95suites. The merger of two existing ASFs in a county to construct a consolidated ASF does 10.The applicant for a new ambulatory surgery facility must provide a written commitment that the facility will accept Medicare and Medicaid patients, and that un-reimbursed services for indigent and charity patients will be provided at a percentage that is comparable to all other existing ambulatory surgery facilities, if any, in the service area. Facilities providing ambulatory surgery services must conform to local, state, and federal regulatory requirements and must commit to seek accreditation from CMS or any accrediting body with deemed status. Ambulatory surgical services are generally available within 30 one-way automobile travel time of most South Carolina residents. Most ASFs operate five days a week, with elective surgery being scheduled several days in advance. The Ambulatory Surgical Facility Utilization Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); 3.Medically Resources. The benefits of improved accessibility will be equally weighed with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service. FREESTANDING EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES The popularity of freestanding emergency hospital services is increasing as a means of providing ready access to such services at the community level. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1.A Certificate of Need is required to establish a freestanding emergency service. 2.All off- emergency service in the same county, unless the applicant is proposing to establish a freestanding emergency service in a county that does not have a licensed hospital. The hospital must have a license that is in good standing and must be in operation to support the off-campus emergency services. 963.Regulation 61-16 will be used to survey off-campus emergency services, specifically including 24-hour/7-day per week physician coverage on site. 4.An off-campus emergency service must have written agreements with Emergency Medical Services providers and surrounding hospitals regarding serious medical problems, which the off-campus emergency service cannot handle. 5.The applicant must demonstrate need for this service by documenting capacity constraints within existing emergency departments in the service area and/or a travel time of greater than 15 minutes to an existing emergency department in the service area. The Freestanding Emergency Services Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); 3.Medically Underserved Groups; and 4.Staff Resources. Access to emergency medical services should be available within 15 minutes travel time for the majority of residents of the State.

The licensing list of nursing facilities also denotes the facilities that have Alzheimer's units. For more specific detail about nursing facilities, refer to Regulation 61-17 (Standards for Licensing Nursing Homes). Since the vast majority of patients utilizing nursing facilities are 65 years of age or older, only this segment of the population is used in the need calculations. County bed needs are projected through 2022. A two-year projection is used because nursing facilities can be constructed and become operational in two years. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. Based on observations of methodologies from other states operating a Certificate of Need regime, and recognizing that potential reliance on long-term skilled nursing services increases with age, bed need is calculated on a county basis using the following ratios: a) 10 beds/1,000 population aged 65-74; and b) 58 beds/1,000 population aged 75 and over 2. For each county, these needs are calculated separately. The individual age-group needs are then added together, and the existing bed count subtracted from that total to determine the deficit or (surplus) of beds. 3. When a county shows surplus beds, additional beds will not be approved, except to allow an individual nursing facility to add some additional beds in order to make more economical nursing units. These additions are envisioned as small increments in order to increase the efficiency of the nursing home. This exception for additional beds will not be approved if it results in a three bed ward. A nursing facility may add up to 16 additional beds per nursing unit to create either 44 or 60 bed nursing units, regardless of the projected bed need for the county. The nursing facility must document how these additional beds will make a more economical unit(s). 1024. Some Institutional Nursing Facilities are dually licensed, with some beds restricted to residents of the retirement community and the remaining beds are available to the general public. The beds restricted to residents of the retirement community are not eligible to be certified for Medicare or Medicaid. Should such a facility have restricted beds that are inadvertently certified, the facility will be allowed to apply for a Certificate of Need to convert these beds to general nursing home beds, regardless of the projected bed need for that county. The Long-Term Care Inventory and Bed Need Chart are located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria are considered the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for these beds or facilities: 1.Community Need Documentation; 2. Distribution (accessibility); 3.Staff Resources; and 4.Record of the Applicant. Because nursing facilities are located within approximately 30 minutes' travel time for the majority of the residents of the State and at least one nursing facility is located in every county, no justification exists for approving additional nursing facilities or beds that are not indicated as needed in this Plan. The major accessibility problem is caused by the lack of Medicaid funding since the Medicaid Program pays for approximately 65% of all nursing facility residents. This Plan projects the need for nursing facility beds by county. The benefits of improved accessibility do not outweigh the adverse effects caused by the duplication of any existing beds or the placement of Medicaid funds for the beds. MEDICAID NURSING HOME PERMITS The Medicaid Nursing Home Permit Act, formerly known as the Nursing Home Licensing Act of 1987, sets forth a regulatory scheme whereby Medicaid nursing home permits and Medicaid patient days are allocated in South Carolina. A long-term care facility (nursing home) must obtain a Medicaid Nursing Home Permit from the Department in order to serve Medicaid patients. A Medicaid patient is a person who is eligible for Medicaid (Title XIX) sponsored long-term care services. Each year, the South Carolina General Assembly establishes the maximum number of Medicaid patient days the Department is authorized to issue. A Medicaid patient day is a day of nursing home care for which the holder of a Medicaid nursing home Permit can receive Medicaid reimbursement. The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services provides the Department with the total number of Medicaid patient days available so the Department may distribute those patient days amongst Permit holders. 103The Medicaid Patient Days and Medicaid Beds Requested & Authorized Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. COMMUNITY LONG-TERM CARE (CLTC) PROGRAM South Carolina is seeking to increase access to long-term care facilities through a number of different programs. The Community Long-Term Care Project (CLTC) provides mandatory pre-admission screening and case management to Medicaid-eligible individuals who are in need of applying for nursing facility placement under the Medicaid program. It also provides several community-based services for Medicaid participants who prefer to receive care in the community rather than institutional care. In certain counties, those services include: Adult Day Healthcare: CLTC offers Adult Day Health Care to individuals enrolled in the Community Choices Waiver. This is medically supervised care and services provided at a licensed day care center. Transportation to and from the home is provided within 15 miles of the center. Attendant/Personal Assistance: CLTC offers attendant services to individuals enrolled in the Community Choices Waiver. Nurses assist by observing care and helping consumers develop skills in managing their attendant. Services may include assistance with general household activities; help with activities such as bathing, dressing, preparing meals, and housekeeping; and observing health signs. Care Management (Case Management - Service Coordination): CLTC assigns a nurse to help determine the services for which the participant qualifies and what services will best meet the needs of an individual enrolled in the Community Choices Waiver. Nursing Facility Transition Services may also be offered to help a participant residing in a nursing facility return to the community. Companion (Sitter): CLTC provides an approved companion to provide supervision of an individual and short-term relief for regular caregivers to individuals enrolled in the Community Choices Waiver. Home Repair/Modification Assistance: CLTC helps provide pest control services, ramps, heater fans and air conditioners to individuals enrolled in the Community Choices Waiver. It can also help make minor adaptations to non-rental property for the safety and health of the Medicaid participant. Medical Equipment/Personal Care Supplies: CLTC provides limited durable medical equipment and incontinence supplies (diapers, underpads, wipes, etc.) to individuals enrolled in the Community Choices Waiver. 104Nutritional Supplement Assistance: CLTC's Community Choices Program provides twocases per month of Nutritional Supplements to its participants. The Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) is a Medicaid State option that provides comprehensive long-term care to primarily elderly residents of the State. PACE is available to Medicaid participants who are certified as \"nursing home\" eligible, but prefer care from community services. GHS Senior Care, Palmetto SeniorCare, and The Methodist Oaks currently operate PACE programs in the State. SPECIAL NEEDS FACILITIES The South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN) provides 24-hour care to individuals with complex, severe disabilities through five in-state regional facilities located in Columbia, Florence, Clinton, Summerville and Hartsville. These facilities serve those individuals who cannot be adequately cared for by one of DDSN's community living options and focus on those with special needs, head and spinal cord injuries and pervasive development disorders. In 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its final rule on Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) that will, inter alia, ensure that individuals who receive services through Medicaid's HCBS programs have access to the benefits of community living. DDSN believes the HCBS initiative will affect its Day Programs and where its clients live. The South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be the lead agency in implementing HCBS which will be phased in over the next five (5) years. INSTITUTIONAL NURSING FACILITY (RETIREMENT COMMUNITY NURSING FACILITY) An institutional nursing facility means a nursing facility (established within the jurisdiction of a larger non-medical institution) that maintains and operates organized facilities and services to accommodate only students, residents or inmates of the institution. These facilities provide necessary services for retirement communities as established by church, fraternal, or other organizations. Such beds must serve only the residents of the housing complex and either be developed after the housing has been established or be developed as a part of a total housing construction program that has documented that the entire complex is one inseparable project. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS To be considered under this special bed category, the following criteria must be met: 1. The nursing facility must be a part of and located on the campus of the retirement community. 2. It must restrict admissions to campus residents. 1053. The facility may not participate in the Medicaid program. There is no projection of need for this bed category. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed number of beds is justified and that the facility meets the above qualifications. If approved by the Department, such a facility would be licensed as an \"Institutional Nursing Home\" and the beds generated by such a project will be placed in the statewide inventory in Chapter 11. These beds are not counted against the projected need of the county where the facility is located. For established retirement communities, a generally accepted ratio of nursing facility beds to retirement beds is 1:4. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria, as outlined in Chapter 8 of Regulation 61-15 , are considered the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for these beds or facilities: 1. Community Need Documentation ; 2. Acceptability ; and 3. Record of the Applicant . Because Institutional Nursing Facility Beds are used solely by the residents of the retirement community, there is no justification for approving this type of nursing facility unless the need can be documented by the retirement center. The benefits of improved accessibility do not outweigh the adverse effects caused by the duplication of any existing beds or facilities. SWING-BEDS A Certificate of Need is not required to participate in the Swing Bed Program in South Carolina; however, the hospital must obtain Medicare certification. The Social Security Act (Section 1883(a)(1), [42 U.S.C. 1395tt]) permits certain small, rural hospitals to enter into a swing bed agreement, under which the hospital can use its beds to provide either acute or SNF care, as needed. The hospital must be located in a rural area and have fewer than 100 beds. Medicare Part A covers the services furnished in a swing bed hospital under the SNF PPS. The PPS classifies residents into one of 44 categories for payment purposes. To qualify for SNF-level services, a beneficiary is required to receive acute care as a hospital inpatient for a stay of at least three consecutive days, although it does not have to be from the same hospital as the swing bed. Typical medical criteria include daily physical, occupational and/or speech therapy, IV or nutritional therapy, complex wound treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care. 106The Swing-Bed Participants Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. HOSPICE FACILITIES AND HOSPICE PROGRAMS Hospice is a centrally administered, interdisciplinary health care program, which provides a continuum of medically supervised palliative and supportive care for the terminally ill patient and the family or responsible party, including, but not limited to home, outpatient and inpatient services provided directly or through written agreement. Inpatient services include, but are not limited to, services provided by a hospice in a licensed hospice facility. A Hospice Facility means an institution, place or building licensed by the Department to provide room, board and appropriate hospice care on a 24-hour basis to individuals requiring such services pursuant to the orders of a physician. The Inpatient Hospice Facilities Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. A Hospice Program means an entity licensed by the Department that provides appropriate hospice care to individuals as described in the first paragraph above, exclusive of the services provided by a hospice facility. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. A Certificate of Need is only required for an Inpatient Hospice Facility; it is not required for the establishment of a Hospice Program. 2. An Inpatient Hospice Facility must be owned or operated either directly or through contractual agreement with a licensed hospice program. 3. The applicant must document the need for the facility and justify the number of inpatient beds that are being requested. 4. The proposed facility must consider the impact on other existing inpatient hospice facilities. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following Project Review Criteria are considered to be the most important in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1.Community Need Documentation; 4.Staff Resources. 107Hospice services should be available within sixty (60) minutes' travel time for the majority of residents of the State. The benefits of improved accessibility will be weighed equally with the adverse effects of duplication in evaluating Certificate of Need applications for this facility type. HOME HEALTH Home Health Agencies Home Health Agency means a public, nonprofit, or proprietary organization, whether owned or operated by one or more persons or legal entities, which furnishes or offers to furnish home health services. Home health services means those items and services furnished to an individual by a home health agency, or by others under arrangement with the home health agency, on a visiting basis and except for (f) below, in a place of temporary or permanent residence used as the individual's home as follows: Part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care as ordered by a physician or podiatrist and provided by or under the supervision of a registered nurse and at least one other therapeutic service listed below: (a) physical, occupational, or speech therapy; (b) medical social services; (c) home health aide services; (d) other therapeutic services; (e) medical supplies as indicated in the treatment plan and the use of medical appliances, to include durable medical equipment and (f) any of the above items and services provided on an outpatient basis under arrangements made by the home health agency with a hospital, nursing home or rehabilitation center and the furnishing of which involves the use of equipment of such a nature that the items/services cannot readily be made available to the individual in his/her home, or which are furnished at one of the above facilities while the patient is there to receive such items or services. Transportation of the individual in connection with any such items or services is not included. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. An applicant must propose home health services to cover the geographic area of an entire county and agree to serve residents throughout the entire county. 2. A separate application is required for each county in which services are to be provided. 3. A new home health agency may be approved if an applicant can demonstrate it will serve 50 or more patients projected to be in need in non-rural counties, or 25 or more patients projected to be in need in rural counties, through evidence that may include, but would not be limited to, the following: 108a. Letters of support that identify need for additional home health services from physicians and other referral sources. b. Evidence of underutilization of home health services. c. Evidence of limited scope home health agency service including skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, home health aides, and medical social workers. d. Evidence of the denial or delay in the provision of home health services, including but not limited to long waiting lists or delays which exceed industry standards. e. Evidence that one or more existing home health agencies has failed to meet the minimum patient service requirements set forth in Standard 8 of this section of the Plan within two years of the initiation of patient services after receiving a home health license. 4. For the purposes of this Section, a rural county shall mean a county with a population of less than 50,000, according to the most recent projections of the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs office as of the time the current Plan was adopted. 5. All home health agency services (Skilled Nursing, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech Therapy, Home Health Aide, and Medical Social Worker) should be available within a county. If there is no hospital in a county and the existing licensed home health agencies between them do not provide all of the services identified above, this may be cited as potential justification for the approval of an additional agency that intends to offer these services. 6. Specialty home health providers are exempt from the need calculation applicable to full-service home health agencies, but are otherwise subject to Certificate of Need. 7. The applicant should have a track record that demonstrates a commitment to quality services. There should be no history of prosecution, consent order, abandonment of patients in other business operations, or loss of license. However, any consent orders or loss of licenses related to licenses that were obtained from the Department between July 1, 2013 and May 22, 2014 without a Certificate of Need shall not be grounds for denial of a Certificate of Need application pursuant to this Section. The applicant must provide a list of all licensed home health agencies it operates and the state(s) where it operates them. 8. The applicant must document that it can serve at least 25 patients annually in each rural county for which it is licensed and 50 patients annually in each non-rural county for which it is licensed within two years of initiation of services. The applicant must 109assure the Department that, should it fail to reach this threshold number two years after initiation of services in a county, it will voluntarily relinquish its license for that county. 9. Nothing in this Section is intended to restrict the ability of the Department to approve more than one new Home Health Agency in a county at any given time. The Home Health Agency Inventory Chart is located at the end of this Chapter. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT REVIEW CRITERIA The following project review criteria, as outlined in Chapter 8 of Regulation 61-15 , are considered to be the most important in reviewing Certificate of Need applications for this service: 1. Community Need Documentation ; 2.Distribution (Accessibility); and 3.Medically Underserved Groups. The benefits of improved accessibility outweigh the adverse effects caused by the duplication of any existing service. Pediatric Home Health Agencies Due to the limited number of home health providers available to treat children 18 years or younger, an exception to the above criteria may be made for a Certificate of Need for a Home Health Agency restricted to providing intermittent home health skilled nursing services to patients 18 years or younger. The license for the agency will be restricted to serving children 18 years or younger and will ensure access to necessary and appropriate intermittent home health skilled nursing services to these patients. Any such approved agency will not be counted in the county inventories for need projection purposes. CERTIFICATE OF NEED PROJECTIONS AND STANDARDS 1. A separate Certificate of Need application will be required for each county for an agency that proposes to provide this specialized service to pediatric patients in multiple counties. 2. The applicant must document that there is an unmet need for this service in the county of application, and the agency will limit such services to the pediatric population 18 years or younger. 1103. The applicant must document the full range of services that they intend to provide to pediatric patients. Continuing Care Retirement Community Home Health Agencies A licensed continuing care retirement community that also incorporates a skilled nursing facility may provide home health services and does not require Certificate of Need review provided: a. The continuing care retirement furnishes or offers to furnish home health services only to residents who reside in living units provided by the continuing care retirement community pursuant to a continuing care contract; b. The continuing care retirement community maintains a current license and meets the applicable home health agency licensing standards; and c. Residents of the continuing care retirement community may choose to obtain home health services from other licensed home health agencies. Staff from other areas of the continuing care retirement community may deliver the home health services, but at no time may staffing levels in any area of the continuing care retirement community fall below minimum licensing standards or impair the services provided. If the continuing care retirement community includes charges for home health services in its base contract, it is prohibited from billing additional fees for those services. Continuing care retirement communities certified for Medicare or Medicaid, or both, must comply with government reimbursement requirements concerning charges for home health services. The continuing care retirement community shall not bill in excess of its costs. These costs will be determined on non-facility-based Medicare and/or Medicaid standards. 111Region I # Beds Abbeville Abbeville Nursing Home 94 Anderson Brookdale Anderson 44 Ellenburg Nursing Center 181 Iva Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center 60 Linley Park Rehabiliation and Healthcare 88 NHC HealthCare Anderson 290 Richard M.
