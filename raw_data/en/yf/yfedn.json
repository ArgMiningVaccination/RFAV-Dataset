Southeastern University (NSU) Professional Doctor of Physical Therapy ( DPT) Program is proud to partner with selected clinical centers across the US in providing quality clinical education experiences for our students. Our DPT Program is part of the Health Professions Division of NSU and is within the College of Health Care Sciences . Our program is located at NSU's Tampa Bay Campus . The Physical Therapy Program at Nova Southeastern University is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE), 1111 North Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virgin program is also accredited by t he Southern Association of C olleges and Schools (SACS) Commission on Colleges to award associate's, baccalaureate, master's, educational specialist, doctorate, and professional degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033- 4097 or call 404 -679- 4500 for questions about the accreditation of Nova Southeastern University . We appreciate your willingness to supervise student s, evaluate their performance, and provide feed back on our curriculum. Without your assistance and support, we would not be able to provide students with enriching clinical experiences to meet the requirements for graduation. The privilege of teaching tomorrow's physical therapy professionals is both a rewarding and challenging endeavor. We promise to provide you with all the information and assistance you may need throughout a student's clinical experience in your center. We are available and prepared to ensure that each learning experience is positive and mutually beneficial for you, your patients, your student, the clinic, and the university. The information found in this handbook and on the NSU Tampa -Bay DPT Clinical Education Resource Center web page will answer most of your questions. The responsibilities and roles of students and clinical instructors in achieving clinical education objectives are clearly delineated and linked to the program's requirements and expectations. If at any time a student is not achieving the anticipated objective s, please contact us immediately . We are here to confer and to facilitate resolution of potential problems or barriers to students' successful performance. We encourage and welcome feedback about clinical education and its role in our broader curriculum. Only by your willingness to provide these important learning experiences can NSU -Tampa Bay reach our goal to graduate caring, competent, culturally sensitive, and outstanding physical therapists. We are active participants in the Florida Consortium of Clinical Educators (FCCE) and invite all of you in Florida to participate. Please contact us for information or go to http://www.fpta.org/members/group.aspx?id=144233 . Thank you for your participation during this crucial phase of the students' education. Best regards, Robin E Galley, PT, DPT, OCS , CLWT Director of Clinical Education; Professor of Physical Therapy Nova Southeastern University -Tampa Bay, 3400 Gulf to Bay NSU -TAM PA BAY DPT STUDENTS Dear Student: This document includes information on an important component of our curriculum - clinical education. This official manual is a supplement to the College of Health Care Sciences (CHCS ) Student Handbook and as such it serves to govern the actions of student s, clinical instructors, and other parties involved in clinical education. The clinical site is an extension of the Nova Southeastern Campus while on clinical experience, and therefore students are subject to all the policies and procedures contained in t he current CHCS Student Handbook, Nova Southeastern (NSU) Student Handbook, Essential Functions of the DPT Student, NSU Code of Conduct, and Physical Therapy Department Policy & Procedures. Students are invited guests of each clinical site and representatives of Nova Southeastern University and the physical therapy profession. Discretion and professional behavior are always required . Professional conduct includes but is not limited to punctuality, reliability, dependability, attendance, appropriate dress, respectful and polite interaction with others, a calm demeanor, keeping personal business out of the workplace, and remaining free from the influence of drugs and alcohol. During this learning opportunity, students should demonstrate adult learning attributes including active learning, intellectual curiosity and initiative, participat ion in clinical discussions and activities, and integrat ion of constructive feedback into pra ctice. Ultimately the successful completion of a clinical experience is the responsibility of the individual student. The core values of our profession (below) are an excellent guide to the expectations for students and physical therapists. APTA Core Values Taken from the APTA document: Core Values for the Physical Therapist and Physical Therapist Assistant - Updated 9 -21-21 Accountability is active acceptance of the responsibility for the diverse roles, obligations, and actions of the physical therapist including self - regulation and other behaviors that positively influence patient/client outcomes, the profession, and t he health needs of society. Altruism is the primary regard for or devotion to the interest of patients/clients, thus assuming the fiduciary responsibility of placing the needs of the patient/client ahead of the physical therapist's self -interest. Collaboration is working together with patients and clients, families, communities, and professionals in health and other fields to achieve shared goals. Collaboration within the PT/PTA team is working together, within each partner's respective role, to achieve optimal PT services and outcomes for pa tients and clients. Compassion/Caring is the desire to identify with or sense something of another's experience, a precursor of caring. Caring is the concern, empathy, and consideration for the needs and values of others. Excellence is physical therapy practice that consistently uses current knowledge and theory while understanding personal limits, integrates judgment and the patient/client perspective, embraces advancement, challenges mediocrity, and works toward development of new knowledge. Integrity is steadfast adherence to high ethical principles or professional standards; truthfulness, fairness, doing what you say you will do, and \"speaking forth\" about why you do what you do. Duty is the commitment to meeting one's obligations to provid e effective physical therapy services to patients/clients, to serve the profession, and to positively influence the health of society. Social Responsibility is the promotion of a mutual trust between the profession and the larger public that necessitates responding to societal needs for health and wellness. Inclusion occurs when the PT and PTA create a welcoming and equitable environment for all. PTs and PTAs are inclusive when they commit to providing a safe space, elevating diverse and minority voices, acknowledging personal biases that may impact patient care, and taking a position of anti -discrimination . 6 MISSION ST ATEMENTS AND VISION NSU MISSION STATEMENT Nova Southeastern University is a dynamic, not -for-profit independent institution dedicated to providing high- quality educational programs of distinction from pre -school through the professional and doctoral levels, as well as service to the community. Nova Southeastern University prepares students for lifelong learning and leadership roles in business and the professions. It offers academic programs at times convenient to students, employing innovative delivery systems and rich learning resources on campus and at distant sites. The university fosters inquiry, research, and creative professional activity, by uniting faculty and students in acquiring and applying knowledge in clinical, community, and professional settings. PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM MISSION Nova Southeastern University's Department of Physical Therapy prepares professional and post -professional physical therapists with the skills, knowledge, and values to effectively practice, educate, lead, and research in interprofessional and technologically advanced environments. The curricula support expertise in the movemen t system and foster clinical inquiry and reasoning, professionalism, and evidence -based practice. The programs embrace diversity; facilitate accessibility to physical therapist education through innovative, instructional delivery models; and promote intell ectual curiosity, reflection, and lifelong learning skills. Faculty members, students, and alumni collaborate to actively lead and participate in the profession through scholarship, service, collaboration, and mentoring. The programs advocate for the health needs of society and serve those in need of physical therapy locally, nationally, and globally . PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM VISION Physical Therapy Programs at Nova Southeastern University will be nationally and internationally recognized for transforming the design and delivery of the continuum of physical therapist education and movement - centered clinical practice. Faculty, students, and alumni, working within a culture of excellence, will be leaders in the profession through education, research, and ser vice. NSU DPT GRADUATE STUDENT PROFILE NSU entry -level graduates possess the skills and knowledge to be well -prepared to serve as primary care providers in collaboration with other health professionals. They practice with cultural sensitivity using current evidence -based practice. Tampa Bay DPT CLINICAL EDUCATION MISSION & PHILOSOPHY The mis sion of the Tampa Bay DPT clinical education program is to coordinate and evaluate clinical experiences across the lifespan and continuum of care for each student with the mentoring of strong clinical instructor role models who practice contemporary physical therapy and interdisciplinary health care in selected centers near a student's home or anticipated practice community. We believe that clinical education is the heart of professional education and the link between the classroom and the real world that requires a strong working relationship with select clinical centers and instructors who share in the program's values. NSU DPT STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES Graduates of the Doctor of Physical Therapy program will: 1. Distinguish themselves as competent physical therapist practitioners in patient/client management . 2. Integrate the core values of professionalism in all roles as a physical therapist . 3. Generate reasoned clinical and professional decisions through synthesis of research evidence, clinical experience, and patient values . 4. Integrate health promotion, fitness, wellness, and prevention as practitioners, educators, consultants, and collaborators . 5. Demonstrate ability to reflect on experiences and integrate insights into self- assessment . 6. Synthesize knowledge of the movement system to identify, treat, and prevent movement disorders. CURRICULUM OVERVIEW The DPT Program at NSU -Tampa Bay was originally an expansion of NSU 's DPT Program in Ft. Lauderdale, FL and is now independently accredited by CAPTE . Our program is designed for students who need flexibility because of financial, family, or geographic reasons. The 4 -year curriculum c ombines online and face -to-face learning so that students can work at least part -time . All clinical experience courses are full -time, 11-12-week experiences occurring AFTER students complete all didactic classes. During the first 3 years of the curriculum, students participate in integrated clinical experiences (ICE) in multiple clinical settings and integrated patient experiences (PE) whereby patients come into the classroom for examination/treatment. The full curriculum, course description, and essential functions are summarized in the following Appendices of this handbook : Tampa DPT Curriculum See Appendix A: Tampa DPT Curriculum Course Description s See Appendix B : Tampa DPT Course Descriptions Essential Functions of the DPT Student See Appendix C: Tampa DPT Essential Functions Document Tampa DPT CLINICAL EDUCATION OVERVIEW Clinical Education throughout the DPT Program Curriculum Integrated Patient Experiences (PE) Integrated patient experiences begin in the first year . These experiences are actual patient interactions integrated into select courses that take place on the NSU Tampa Bay campus . The purpose of P E is to foster early and immediate application of knowledge and skills to real patients/clients with immediate feedback from faculty and lab assistants who serve as classroom lab instructors. (See Integrated Experiences section .) Integrated Clinical Experiences (ICE) Integrated clinical experiences begin in the second year. These experiences are actual patient interactions integrated into select courses that take place at partner clinical centers. The purpose of ICE is to appl y professional and clinical practice in the actual clinical setting. (See Integrated Experiences section.) Clinical Experience s This component of the DPT curriculum is comprised of 3 , 3-month terminal full-time clinical experiences . Students are assigned to selected clinical sites to apply their learned skills and receive instruction in patient care from a clinical instructor. Students are evaluated using the Clinical Internship Evaluation Tool (CIET). 8 Goal of Tampa's DPT Clinical Education The goal of Tampa's DPT clinical educ ation is that each student meets all CIET criteria through individualized learning plans that reflect depth of learning and quality mentoring by licensed physical therapists . Model Each student receives 120- 160 hours ( 3-4 weeks) of integrated clinical & patient experience s throughout the DPT didactic curriculum , and 35 weeks of terminal full-time clinical experience s beginning in the fall of their fourth year . The DCE assigns students to clinical centers for clinical experience to assure the best possi ble match of a student's learning needs and the learning opportunities available in a particular center. INTEGRATED EXPERIENCES During the first three years of the curriculum , students have patient experiences that occur during and outside of their usual Weekend Institute class time. Some of t hese experiences have been integrated into the classroom lab time of the coursework to allow for immediate application of learned skills and concepts to an actual patient. Additional clinical experience time is spent at local hospitals and clinics. During the progression of these experiences , students develop skills in all domains of learning : cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. The key components of integrated clinical & patient experiences are: 1. Clinical Setting : Experiences take place either in actual patient care facilities or in the on -campus lab facilities that have been equipped to simulate typical clinical facility settings. 2. Patients: Actual patient volunteers are recruited from the community to attend Weekend Institutes for the purpose of participating in our Integrated Patient Experiences. Patients are seen in the on- campus lab -clinic or students go to the patients' care facility locations if necessary. Patient s reflect the diversity of the lifespan and the cultures . 3. Clinical Instructors (CI): Faculty members of the Tampa Bay DPT program are all APTA Credentialed Clinical Instructors and provide guidance and supervision during these integrated experiences. Furthermore, local Credentialed CI's are present as lab assistants for such experiences. 4. Performance Assessment: Student performance is assessed through means that incorporate the criteria and sample behaviors found in the CIET . This is done to familiarize the student with the global outcomes assessed by the CIET and prepare the student for full time c linical experiences . Feedback is given often and immediately. Courses which may include Integrated Clinical &/or Patient Experiences : Essentials of Exercise Physiology Clinical Skills I & II Patient/Client Management Post Amputation Cardiovascular and Pulmonary PT Motor Control Across the Lifespan Pediatrics Musculoskeletal I, II, & III Neuromuscular I & II Topics in Clinical Education STUDENT EXPECTATIONS DURING PATIENT AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCES During each Integrated Experience, whether on -campus or off -campus, the student is expected to conduct themselves in accordance with all policies and procedures established by the clinical site (if applicable), NSU, the APTA Guide for Professional Conduct, and all applicable state and federal laws. Professional conduct includes but is not limited to punctuality, reliability, dependability, attendance, appropriate dress, respectful and polite interaction with others, a calm demeanor, keeping personal business out of the workplace, and remaining free from the influence of drugs and alcohol. Students who fail to demonstrate an acceptable level of maturity and professionalism may be asked to leave the ICE or PE and will receive a failing grade for that experience. Additionally, during every scheduled experience, the student is expected to be in professional clinic dress (NSU Polo, khaki pants, closed- toe flat shoes , white Nova lab coat, and nametag ) unless otherwise instructed by the Clinical or Course Instructor. Each student must have their own personal lab kit with them that is complete with all items listed in Appendix D.

Although the means of communication may vary, these general guidelines for the frequency of com munication are expected during clinical education: 1. CI & Student: Weekly formal or informal communication that may be one -on-one or in small groups and documente d via the weekly review forms ( Appendix J ). At minimum, formal documented meetings scheduled during Mid- Term and Final weeks to review the CIET must occur. Impromptu or emergency communication takes place as needed by the CI or student. 2. DCE Site Visits: Meetings at the clinical center will be in person or by phone at least once during each clinical experience assignment with each CI. Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed. 3. Students & DCE : Email is the official mode of communication between the DCE and students. It is the student's responsibility to check his or her University email account and Exxat for communications. The student is also responsible to keep the DCE informed of all pertinent occurrences during the clinical experience. If the matter is time sensitive, the student should communicate by text or call to DCE's cell phone. 10 4. CI/SCCE to DCE: CI's/SCCE 's are encouraged to communicate with the DCE as often as needed, and as quickly as possible, to resolve any clinical education or s tudent issues.

The DCE works directly with the NSU VP for Legal Affairs and personnel at the various sites to finalize the wording of the agreements. Contracts are checked for currency when students are placed at existing sites. If a contract has expired or will expire during the scheduled experience, the DCE is responsible for initiating the renewal. Please contact the DCE to revie w the NSU standard affiliation agreement. Copies of completed affiliation agreements/contracts are maintained in the PT Department in a secured location and in the Legal Affairs Office for NSU ( See Appendix F: Sample Affiliation Agreement. ) SELECTION AND ASSIGNMENT OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCE S The DCE assigns students to clinical sites to assure the best possible match of a student's learning needs and the learning opportunities available in a particular site . The process for student assignment for Clinical Experience s is as follows : In the summer semester of the second year, the students are given a survey to assess both geographical needs and special student interests. Based on this feedback, the DCE generates a targeted request list to send out the experience requests . Per APTA guidelines and the FCCE agreed upon request process , all experience requests are sent out between March 1 st and March 15th for the following academic year. For example, r equests for experience placements that will take place during the 202 1-2022 academic year are sent out in March of 2020. Per APTA guidelines, facilities are asked to return the solicitation forms by Apr il 30th with available placements noted. The DCE will match students with selected clinical centers for the experiences to take place in the fall and w inter semesters of the f ourth year. The assignment plans are sent to the SCCE s of the selected clinical centers by December 1 each year with a request for official confirmation that the experience is still available. o All students are required to complete the three terminal ful l-time clinical experiences in three various settings with the following qualifications: One of the three settings must be outpatient orthopedics, as this makes up the largest market of employment and the national licensure exam. At least one of the th ree placements must be in an inpatient environment (example: acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing facility, etc. ). At least one of the three placements must include over 50% primarily neurological conditions in the patient population. If a situation arises resulting in cancellation of the experience, whether by the facility or University, all parties should be notified immediately, and then it is the DCE's responsibility to re -assign the student if applicable. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 1. A student will not be assigned to a clinical site where there is deemed to be a conflict of interest. a. For example, if the student were formerly employed at that facility, an experience may only take place if in a different physical location from the prior employment held. b. There cannot be a prior relationship or \"professional familiarity\" between the student and the clinical instructor , supervisor, or any employee in a management role . 2. Students will only be assigned to centers that comply with NSU and CAPTE accreditation guidelines for clinical education. 3. Students are not permitted to contact potential clinical centers to inquire about initiating a clinical agreement or potential assignment in a center. Instead, students are to provide the DCE with the names of clinical centers that they would like to have considered for an NSU affiliation agreement. 4. Students are not permitted to contact any of their assigned experience locations prior to being instructed to do so by the DCE. All communication with the site must be made through the DCE and the SCCE . Any student who does not comply with this policy will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress and subject to disciplinary action. PREPARATION FOR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE S STUDENT REQUIREMENTS The DCE will verify that all pre -requisites are met including pre -clinical orientation and that the student may proceed to Clinical Experience . Pre -requisites include but are not limited to: 1. Successful completion of the Standardized Clinical Readiness Assessment (SCRA) 2. Successful completion of all preceding didactic coursework. 3. Successful completion of the following graduation requirements: Attendance at a State and National Conference and completion of all required service learning hours per the NSU - Tampa Bay DPT Student Policy and Procedure Manual. 4. Revie w and acknowledgement of the DPT Clinical Education Handbook and NSU Student Handbook. 5. Mandatory maintenance of valid health insurance policy. 6. Proof of completion of all required immunizations and testing (See Appendix G). 7. Maintenance of a complete, updated, and accurate Comp liance Binder & Exxat profile throug hout all clinical experiences ( See Appendix G). 8. Review of applicable State PT Practice Act. 9. Any other requirements of a clinical center to which a student is assigned. Failure to obtain or maintain any of these requirements will result in removal from the clinical experience until such time that proof of compliance can be submitted to the DCE. This absence is considered an unexcused absence that will have to be made up and can delay graduation. STUDENT COMPLIANCE The Compliance Binder & Exxat profile contains all necessary documentation for students to participate in the clinical experience. These are to be completed prior to the start of the first experience and are carried with 16 the student to each clinical site. Students are responsible for keeping only current information in the ir compliance binders & profiles . For a listing of compliance binder requirements, see Appendix G. Background Checks NSU requires Level I background checks prior to admission and Level II background checks prior to starting full - time clinical experiences. Some facilities require students to comply with facility background check process es and/or may require additional background checking beyond what is performed by the University. Students scheduled to intern at such facilities will need to comply with the policies of that site and assume any additional costs related to fulfilling that requirement. Drug and Alcohol Testing All students are bound by the NSU student handbook policies on Drug and Alcohol abuse (see Student Handbook, Drug Free Schools and Campuses and Zero Tolerance Policy) during their clini cal experience s. Some affiliating facilities require pre -experience screening and may routinely conduct random drug testing of their personnel including student interns. As an affiliate of these sites , students agree to comply with all required testing. Results of such testing shall be kept in the Compliance Binder. Positive results from drug and/or alcohol testing will require immediate suspension of the clinical experience and can involve serious consequences up to and in including dismissal from the Program. Any cost of drug screening or repeat screening in the event of an inconclusive test will be the responsibility of the student. The DCE will assist in the coordination of such services if necessary. Medical Marijuana Althoug h the possession and use of medical marijuana (THC) is permitted under Florida state law in limited circumstances, the possession and use of medical marijuana is still illegal under federal law. NSU must abide by federal law, including but not limited to the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.A. 811) and the Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act (20 U.S.C. 1145g). Specifically, the Controlled Substances Act prohibits and criminalizes both the recreational and medical use of marijuana, as well as any deri vative of marijuana. Likewise, the Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act requires NSU to maintain policies prohibiting any possession, use or distribution of the substance to receive federal funding. Accordingly, medical marijuana (THC) is considered an \"illicit drug\" for purposes of the NSU \"Drug -Free Schools and Campuses\" policy. The possession or use of the substance, even when authorized by a physician under state law, is thus prohibited on NSU property and during NSU -sponsored activities INITIAL CONTACT BETWEEN STUDENT AND CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR The DCE will reach out to all assigned facilities two to three months prior to the experience start date to make final confirmations and obtain CI contact information. Facility agreements will be reviewed and updated as necessary and CI information will be entered into E xxat , our clinical education management platform. Any facility -specific requirements will be managed as needed. The student is required to contact the assigned CI/ SCCE using their NSU Email account 6 -8 weeks prior to the start date of the experience. The student will be notified by the DCE when it is time to initiate contact and is not to do so prior to that time. The student will send the ir resume and completed personal profile along with any other requirements from the facility. The student will briefly introduce themselves in a letter to the CI and clearly state his/her objectives for the experience by sharing their E xxat profile. PROFESSIONAL E XP EC TAT IO N S OF THE STUDENT DURING CLINICAL EXPERIENCE S PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR Students are invited guests of each clinical center and representatives of Nova Southeastern University and the Physical Therapy profession. Discretion and professional behavior are always required . Students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with all policies and procedures established by the clinical site, NSU, the APTA Guide for Professional Conduct, and all applicable state and federal laws. Professional conduct includes but is not limited to punctuality, reliability, dependability, atten dance, appropriate dress, respectful and polite interaction with others, a calm demeanor, keeping personal business out of the workplace, and remaining free from the influence of drugs and alcohol. Additionally, students are not permitted to accept gifts from patients greater than $20 in value at any time during the clinical experience. Students who fail to demonstrate an acceptable level of maturity and professionalism may be terminated from an experience and receive a failing grade for the experience course. This may re sult in dismissal from the Tampa DPT Program. During this learning opportunity, students should demonstrate active learning, initiative, participate in clinical discussions and integrate constructive feedback into practice. Ultimately the successful completion of a clinical experience is the responsibility of the individual student. Other student responsibilities include, but are not limited to: Compliance Bin der & Exxat Profile : Maintenance of a complete, updated, and accurate Compliance Bin der & Exxat profile throughout all clinical experiences. Orientation: Initiate communication with the CI regarding learning style, experience goals, course requirements, strengths and weaknesses, university expectations, and clinical center policies and procedures. Clinical Internship Evaluation Tool (CIET ): Be aware of all CIET objectives and maintain progress toward their completion within the required time frame. Complete the CIET at Mid -term and Final and review/compare with CI. Course Assignments: Complete all required course assignments as assigned by the DCE. Complete any assignments issued by the CI, including in- service presentation or projects . Specific NSU Assignments during Clinical Experiences 1. Completion of a n Evidence -Based Capstone Project (see Appendix I) prior to completion of Clinical Experience III. 2. One (1) in-service to be presented at each of the three experiences. Each in -service must be different from previous in- services, contain Evidence -Based Practice elements including references in AMA format, and be relevant to the patient population or needs of the experience site. Students are NOT allowed to use information or videos presented by NSU Faculty without express permission of the faculty member. Communication: Maintain contact with DCE, faculty, and/or Program Director via Exxat and/or NSU email. Students are responsible for keeping abreast of information through communications and updates published. Students must maintain a functional cell phone and current contact information with the DCE and PT 18 department. Changes in address and phone must be communicated immediately to the Clinical Support Coordinator or DCE . DCE Communication: Initiate communication with the DCE regarding any concerns with the experience, risk of not completing objectives, incidents, injury, absences, or other problems within 24 hours of occurrence . Medical Equipment: Arrive at the clinical site prepared with properly functioning medical diagnostic instruments and other small equipment as appropriate for the center and as needed. This includes the equipment requir ed in each student's lab kits (s ee Appendix D). Report Latex Allergy: Report any allergies to latex products to the CI and DCE. This information should be included on the Student Profile completed prior to experience and placed in the compliance binder. Each student is responsible to supply the latex -free products they may need. Transportation: Students are responsible for all costs of transportation, travel, and parking associated with experiences, unless a site offers a stipend for same. We strongly suggest that students investigate alternative transportation strategi es in case of emergencies (cab, bus, ridesharing ). Housing: Students are responsible for all housing arrangements including cost. In those facilities that offer housing, the student is responsible to make these arrangements. Meals : Students are responsible for their own meals. Students may accept food provided at no cost or at a discount to student. Student Safety: Students are required to review the information regarding safety in the Campus Safety Manual published by the NSU Public Safety Department prior to commencement of clinical experience s. Non- Discriminatory Practice : Students shall deliver health care service to patients without regard to their race, religion, creed, national origin, sexual orientation, socioeconomic stat us, disability, disease status, and political beliefs, consistent with NSU policy. Health Insurance: Students must maintain a valid health insurance policy throughout their course of study in the PT Program inclusive of clinical education courses. A copy of the student's insurance card is maintained in his or her compliance folder that must be provided to the CI on the first day of the experience. Any costs incurred for emergency care, illness, injury, and/or hospitalizations during attendance at the PT Pr ogram, including all clinical experiences, are the sole responsibility of the student. This includes any initial and follow up testing and treatments related to exposure or injury sustained during an experience. Failure to maintain health/medical insurance will result in the student being removed from clinical experiences until proof of compliance with this policy is provided. Absences incurred because of non-compliance will be counted as unexcused (see Attendance ). ATTENDANCE Beginning and end dates for clinical experiences are established by the DCE with each clinical site and coincide with academic calendar requirements. The actual daily and hourly experience schedule is at the discretion of the Clinical Instructor and should include the equivalent of full -time status (40 hours per week ) and no less than 35 hours of productive patient care time any given week. The student will follow the same or similar work schedule as their Clinical Instructor, which may include longer than 8 -hour workdays , weekends, and holidays. While on clinical experiences, students do not follow the NSU academic calendar of holidays. Students are not allowed to directly request \"time off\" from a clinical without first discussed with the DCE. Further, students are not allowed to request a schedule change (i.e., swapping a regularly scheduled time for another time) without discussing with the DCE first. Only if the DCE is consulted and approves the request may the student discuss this with their CI. Students submit their experience schedule to the DCE within the first week of their experience using the Student Clinical Schedule form (See Appendix H). Students are required to notify the DCE of any subsequent changes to this schedule within 24 hours. Student attendance is verified via Exxat, and communication with CI. Tardiness As soon as a student expects they may be tardy, the student must notify both the Clinica l Instructor and DCE. The student is considered tardy if not ready to begin their day at or before their scheduled start time. If greater than 30 minutes is missed, the time must be made up. Failure to follow this procedure will result in an unexcused absence. Being tardy more than 2 times will count as an unexcused absence. Unexcused Absence Students are not permitted any unexcused absences during an experience. Unexcused absences include but are not limited to business appointments, routine dental and doctor appointments, weddings, graduations and other social or personal events. (Exceptions may be made if the stude nt reaches out to the DCE prior to the start of the experience and an appropriate make -up time is agreed upon by DCE and CI. However, this cannot be guaranteed to the student.) Time off from an experience will not be granted to allow for individual \"study time\" to complete other course work, interviews, course assignments, in -services, course modules, and/or to prepare for the licensure examination or for personal reasons. STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE UP UNEXCUSED ABSENCES. UNEXCUSED ABSENCES DEMONSTRA TE UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR AND MAY RESULT IN FAILURE OF THE EXPERIENCE COURSE OR DELAY IN GRADUATION . Excused Absence Incapacitating illness, physical or psychological injury preventing full participation in all clinical activities, or an unexpected family emergency may result in an excused absence. Students must report an unexpected or anticipated absence to their assigned CI as soon as possible and report the excused absence to the DCE immediately via DCE cell phone text or call. Unexpected absences must be excused before the start of the workday but no later than 9 AM. Supporting documentation may be requested by either the DCE or CI or both for the absence to remain excused. Excused absences must be made up at the discretion of the Clinical Instructor in consultation with the DCE. Students are required to report their absence in Exxat under \"My Leave\" and then follow -up with an email to the DCE, copying their CI, to notify how the time will be made up. In cases of illness resulting in absences of 2 or more days from clinic, documentation of illness and suitability to resume the experience may be required from a physician. Any number of excused absences may result in an extension of the experience to make u p the time and could possibly result in a delay in graduation. Make-Up Days Make -up days will be scheduled at the same site if the CI or another substitute, qualified clinical instructor is available. Make up time must be productive patient -care hours. T hey cannot be made up with additional non-patient care time such as extending hours to work on documentation, projects, etc. If the SCCE and/or CI are unable to arrange for make -up of an excused absence, the DCE has the discretion to determine if the student can be assigned to a similar center for make -up of lost days. Extended excused absences or difficulty in arranging for appropriate make -up experiences may extend the current clinical experience and/or delay graduation. 20 Leave of Absence A leave of ab sence may be granted at the discretion of the program director, department chair and/or dean on an individual basis for reasons of extended illness or other extenuating circumstances requiring extended absence from an experience. Students must request a leave of absence in writing and provide documentation to support the request. Requests for leave of absence are only granted if the student is in good standing and are not accepted after a student has been advised that he or she has failed the clinical experience course. All student requests are considered confidential and are treated as such by the faculty. The conditions and time frame of the leave of absence and return to the program is at the discretion of the program director, chair and/ or dean. The program director will advise the student and DCE of the decision. Resumption of the clinical experience will be coordinated by the DCE and may be dependent upon clinical center and CI availability. Professional Conferences Students are only permi tted to attend State and National conferences during their Clinical Experience s if they are either attending WITH their clinical instructor OR it does not require any missed regularly scheduled days. This time should not exceed a total of 2 days during a given clinical experience course. Continuing Education Courses Students may attend continuing education courses and seminars with their Clinical Instructors at their own expense. DCE pre -approval is required. Time taken for continuing education shoul d not exceed a total of 2 days during the entire 35 weeks of clinical education . Interviews for Residency and/or Employment Students are NOT permitted time away from the clinical experiences for interviews. Any such interview must be arranged outside of clinical experience hours and may not disrupt the clinical experience schedule. Requests to modify the schedule are also not permitted for these reasons. APPEARANCE AND DRESS CODE Students must present themselves as professionals by maintaining a modest, n eat, and clean appearance during experiences. Students should adhere to the dress code of their assigned clinical center. It is the student's responsibility to determine the dress code prior to their start date and arrive in suitable attire that is eithe r obtained at their own expense or provided by the center staff. Professional dress also implies that clothes are ironed / wrinkle free. Students must always wear their NSU picture identification/nametag designating student physical therapy status during clinical experiences. Students cannot wear any identification that designates any other professional status or certification obtained external to physical therapy education. Facial hair must be trimmed and neat and fingernails clipped short. Any jewelry worn should be kept to a minimum so as not to interfere with patient care, cleanliness, or pose a danger to patient safety. No facial jewelry is permitted to be worn during clinical experiences. Tattoos and other body adornments or piercings shall be covered or removed during clinical experiences. Hair should be kept neat and conservative ( not out of the ordinary hair coloring such as pink, purpl e, blue, etc.). Inappropriately attired students or those with an unkempt appearance will be asked to leave the clinical site and/or campus. The time missed until they return properly attired must be made -up or will be counted as an unexcused absence. Repeated non -compliance after a warning may result in the student failing the clinical experience course. MEDICAL RECORD DOCUMENT ATION GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS Documentation should adhere to the following APTA guidelines found in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice : 1) Documentation is required for every visit/encounter. 2) All documentation must comply with the applicable jurisdictional/regulatory requirements and requires co-signature for student entries. 3) All handwritten entries shall be made in ink and will include original signatures. Electronic entries are made with appropriate security and confidentiality provisions. 4) Charting errors should be corrected by drawing a single line through the error, initialing, and dating the chart or through the appropriate mechanism for electronic documentation that clearly indicates that a change was made without deletion of the original record. 5) All documentation must include adequate identification of the patient/client and the physical therapist or physical therapist assistant: a. The patient's/client's full name and identification numbe r, if applicable, must be included on all official documents. b. All entries must be dated and authenticated with the provider's full name and appropriate designation: 6) Documentation of examination, evaluation, diagnosis, prognosis, plan of care, and discharge summary must be authenticated by the physical therapist who provided the service. 7) Documentation of intervention in visit/encounter notes must be authenticated by the physical therapist or physical therapist assistant who provided the service. 8) Documenta tion by physical therapist or physical therapist assistant graduates or other s physical therapist and physical therapist assistants pending receipt of an unrestricted license shall be authenticated by a licensed physical therapist, or, when permissible by law, docum entation by physical therapist assistant graduates may be authenticated by a physical therapist assistant. 9) Documentation by students (SPT/SPTA) in physical therapist or physical therapist assistant programs must be additionally authenticated by the physical therapist or, when permissible by law, documentation by physical therapist assistant students may be authenticated by a physical therapist assistant. 10) Documentation should include the referral mechanism by which physical therapy services are initiated. Examples include: a. Self-referral/direct access b. Request for consultation from another practitioner c. Documentation should include indication of no shows and cancellations. 11) Students and CIs should refer to the APTA web site for additional details regarding documentation standards. Students must sign all documentation entered into electronic or manual patient medical records with their name clearly written, followed by the designation \"SPT.\" At no time may the student use any other professional designations ( e.g., PTA, ATC, etc.). The CI must co -sign all medical record entries. Students may document for Medicare Part A and B patients; however, the documentation must always reflect CI involvement during the treatment . STUDENT ASSESSMENT AND THE CIET 1. CIET training: All Students, SCCE s and CIs are required to take part in a brief tutorial online and pass the post -test with a 75% or higher prior to initial use of the CIET . Training is free and a link to the training video will be sent to the CIs by the DCE and can also be accessed through the CIET link sent to the CI by the student . 22 2. CIs will receive a certificate of completion from Nova Southeastern University following the one -time training . 3. The CIET is completed at mid -term and final week by both the student and CI for each clinical experience. The CIET workflow is outlined as follows: 4. Questions related to the electronic CIET and/or training should be directed to the DCE. 5. For more information on t he CIET, please refer to Appendices E, K, and L . EXPERIENCE GRADING Clinical Experience Courses are graded on a Pass (\"P\") / Fail (\"F\") basis following the grading policy in the CHCS Student Handbook. The DCE assigns the grades for all clinical experience courses , taking into consideration the CIET completed by the Clinical Instructor, dialogue with CI(s) and timely completion of all course assignments included on each course syllabus. All the following objectives must be met to pass the clinical experience: 1. Timely submission and completion of all course prerequisites and assignments a. NOTE: Students shall not begin a clinical experience until their complianc e Bin ders are complete and verified by the DCE. 2. Successful completion of the CIET with documented reviews at least at midterm and final . a. Specific Expectations can be found in Appendix L and must be met by the Final assessment. b. An overall performance rating of 7 or higher for CE I and 8 or higher for CE 2 c. All comment boxes must be completed by CI and Student and will not be accepted as \"n/a.\" d. An answer of \"Yes\" on final page when CI is asked \"Is the student performing at a level that is satisfactory for his/her current level of education?\" . e. Written comments from the CI reflecti ng satisfactory performance. f. A blank CIET form can be found in Appendix K. 3. Timely co mpletion of the \"weekly review form .\" (See Appendix J) 4. Completion of at least one in -service presentation on a topic agreed upon by the student and CI . a. Presentation must be submitted to Exxat for DCE to review . b. Presentations must include evidence -based practice with a reference page or slide using AMA formatting style . Students must follow all NSU Policies for Academic Honesty in any w ork submitted. 5. Completion of the APTA PT Student Evaluation Form through Exxat . NOTE: Any delay in fulfilling pre -requisites or any assignment submitted after the due date may result in delay of graduation and/ or failure of the Clinical Experience Course . UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE ON AN EXPERIENCE The SCCE , CI, and/or student should contact the DCE as soon as it is apparent that the student is not performing at a satisfactory level to achieve course objectives . It is not recommended to wait until midterm to discuss issues involving student performance. A plan for addressing concerns will be developed by the CI in collaboration with the DCE and/or SCCE within 24 hours. Students are expected to take primary r esponsibility for the management and resolution of identified performance concerns through this established plan. If student issues with performance cannot be resolved satisfactorily and the student does not meet the requirements for successful completion of an experience course, the student wi ll fail the experience and will receive an \"F\" grade for the clinical education course. The student will be referred to the Committee on Student Progress (CSP) and may be dismissed from the DPT program. The student may be allowed, if deemed eligible by the CSP and agreed upon by the Program Director , to engage in additional learning experiences including retaking a portion of or the entire clinical experience. Any student who is permitted a retake of an experience may also be required to complete additional learning experience s prior to starting the reta ke. This will be specifically identified in the final decision letter from the Program Director. The plan to retake any part of the Clinical Experience Course is at the discretion of the DCE and subject to the availability of clinical centers and CI's. This will delay the student's graduation and possibly delay sitting for the licensure exam . During clinical experiences, if a student fails Experience I, and is deemed appropriate to retake the course, they must successfully pass the retake and any required remediation work before being allowed to proceed to Experience II. Failure of Experience II that has been granted a retake may or may not warrant continuation onto Experience III based on the DCE's review of the CIET , discussion with the CI and student, and knowledge of preparedness for the third experience. Failure of experiences I & II will result in delay or cancellation of subsequent experiences. Subsequent experiences will not be rescheduled or confirmed by the DCE until successful completion of the retake. The student will be responsible for all costs incurred in retaking an experience ( refer to the CHCS Handbook, Course Remediation Cost ). Failure of the retake will result in dismissal from the program. Additionally, a student who receives a second F grade in any clinical education course is dismissed from the Physical Therapy Program. The following behaviors may result in an \"F\" grade for the course: 1. Failure to achieve program expectations for the level of clinical experience : a. CI indicates on the CIET that the student has not achieved the stated criteria rating requirements at midterm or final evaluation of performance. Refer to Experience Grading Policy. b. Failure to meet any course objectives. c. Failure to meet deadlines for submission of course assignments. 2. Unexcused absence in an experience course. 3. Excessive excused absences that are not made -up or cannot be scheduled. 4. Tardiness that persists after two warnings. 5. Unethical, illegal, or unprofessional behavior. 6. Misconduct resulting in possible danger or actual harm to a patient. 24 7. Dismissal from the clinical center at any time for any other reason. If a student is delayed more than 3 months from start ing and completing an experience, the student will be required to demonstrate competency of didactic content prior to resuming clinical education courses. The decision of whether the student is ready to resume clinical experience will be made by the DCE w ith the input of the Program Director and Committee on Student Progress. Scheduling a Clinical Experience Retake Should a retake of a failed clinical experience be permitted, the timing of that clinical placement is dependent on: 1. Availability and willingness from the selected clinical site and clinical instructor. 2. Part-of-term dates from the University. (All retakes must fall within one single part -of-term.) This may cause a delay in preferred start date. This site is chosen by the DCE in collaboration with the Program Director to ensure a quality experience with a fair and honest assessment. Though every effort is made to find a convenient placement for the student, this may not be located near the student's home and the student will be responsible for any living expenses as needed. INCOMPLETE EXPERIENCE A student may receive a grade of \"Incomplete\" at the end of a scheduled experience for the following reasons: 1. Excessive excused absences that require experience extension but do not warrant failure . 2. Inability to meet all requirements within the time frame of the experience due to unforeseen circumstances. 3. Extension of the experience was deemed appropriate based on specific criteria needing further experience to demonstrate competency but not warranting failure . A grade of \"Incomplete\" may or may not prevent a student from continuing onto the next experience. If extension of the experience is deemed appropriate by the DCE, the extension may occur at the same facility or another facility with a similar patient population and setting based on clinic and clinical instructor availability. Length of the extension will be determined by the DCE based on input from the CI. Placement dates for this extension will begin and end based on availability of the experience site and may result in a delay in graduation. If an \"Incomplete\" grade is received, a specific documented plan for passing will be established by the DCE and communicated with the student. Once these requirements have been fulfilled, the DCE will submit the grade change to the University to award the passing grade. If these requirements are not fulfilled, it will result in a failing grade and the policy on Uns atisfactory Performance on an Experience will apply. EARL Y TERMINATION OF EXPERIENCE The Site Coordinator for Clinical Education ( SCCE ), the Clinical Instructor (CI), or the Director of Clinical Education (DCE) may terminate an experience at any time for unsafe and/or inadequate performance, poor skill, inadequate clinical judgment that places the patients, staff, or self at risk for harm, or harm to a patient, or for unprofessional workplace behavior. Failure of a student to comply with all rules, regulations, policies, and procedures of the clinical center and NSU may result in early termina tion of the clinical experience and automatic failure of the clinical experience course. Any student who is terminated early from a clinical experience or fails a clinical experience will be referred to the Tampa DPT Committee on Student Progress. Students may not receive partial credit for a cours e that was terminated early. If the student is eligible, the student may re take all or part of the course , based on the discretion of the DCE . Refer to section on Unsatisfactory Performance on an Experience . STUDENT DISPUTES AND GRIEVANCE S ACADEMIC GRIEVANCES The responsibility for course examinations, assignments and grades resides with the expertise of faculty members who are uniquely qualified by their training and expertise. This faculty includes the DCE, CI and SCCE . Such evaluations and grades are the prerogative of the instructor and are not subject to formal appeal unless there is compelling evidence of discrimination, arbitrary or capricious action and/or procedural irregularities. Disputes with evaluation or experience performanc e should first be addressed with the Clinical Instructor and then with the DCE if satisfactory resolution is not achieved. Grievances and grade disputes must be in writing and directed to the DCE within 5 business days. Failure to submit a timely appeal will be considered a waiver of the student's grade dispute appeal rights. The Program Director is the final appeal for all grade disputes. NONACADEMIC GRIEVANCES The purpose of the grievance procedure is to promote the orderly resolution of problems arising out of a student complaint concerning a policy, procedure, or administrative action of Nova Southeastern University. Grievances can often be adversarial, unple asant, and unsatisfying, so it is recommend ed that students discuss problems before resorting to the formal grievance steps. Concerns and complaints related to matters involving clinical education should be presented in writing to the DCE or Program Dire ctor. Complaints should be presented in writing within 5 business days. When formal grievance steps are perceived as necessary, students have the right to fair process and hearing without retribution. Please refer to the CHCS handbook for Grievance Procedures for Nonacademic Disputes. Records of all written concerns and complaints are maintained in a secured location within the department. Discrimination and Harassment NSU and the HE -DPT Program adhere to a policy of non -discrimination and maintenance of environments free from harassment. Please refer to the CHCS handboo k Nondiscrimination Statement and Grievance Procedures for Nonacademic Disputes . CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE A CI who feels that they have a grievance involving a student should first attempt to address that concern with the student. If unresolved, the CI should promptly consult with the SCCE and DCE. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached, the complaint should be taken to the Program Director and then, to the Department Chair. CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY All parties involved in clinical education must maintain the confidentiality of all information that is of a sensitive or personal nature. This policy minimally applies to patient information, student information, CI information, and clinical site information. The following excerpt from the APTA Guide for Professional Conduct is emphasized: 26 1. Information relating to the physical therapist -patient relationship is confidential and may not be communicated to a third party not involved in the patient's care without the prior written consent of the patient, subject to applicable law. 2. Information derived from component -sponsored peer review shall be held confident ial by the reviewer unless written permission to release the information is obtained from the physical therapist that was reviewed. 3. Information derived from working relationships of physical therapists shall be held confidential by all parties. 4. Information may be disclosed to appropriate authorities when it is necessary to protect the welfare of an individual or the community. Such disclosure shall be in accordance with applicable law. Patient Information: All current HIPAA guidelines must be followed as stated by NSU, the PT Program, the APTA, and policies of each clinical center. Each s tudent must take and successfully complete the HIPAA training module(s) given by NSU on Canvas and maintain a copy of his/her certificate(s) of comple tion in their compliance binder for presentation to the SCCE or CI at each experience or during other patient care experiences. Student Information: SCCE s and CIs in each clinical center must keep all student health records, educational records, and any other personal information, strictly confidential in compliance with applicable laws governing student re cords. Student compliance binders are the property of the individual student. Copies of materials contained therein may be obtained only with the permission of the student. Clinical Site Information: Informatio n received from clinical sites shall be held in a secure location within the D PT department. Selected information from these files is made available for student review prior to the individual student's experience . Furthermore, students are to hold confidential all proprietary inf ormation about a clinical site obtained during a clinical experience . Social Media Students, CIs, and SCCE s should refrain from putting information about the clinical education experience , patients, or individuals on any form of social media including Facebook , Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat . Doing so could result in violation of HIP AA, FERPA, or NSU's Student Code of Conduct. OCCURRENCE OR INCIDENT REPORTING NSU's policy is that students report all occurrences or incidents that occur during a clinical experience regardless of whether someone is harmed, or property is damaged. The following procedure should be followed: 1. The student must immediately notify the CI of the incident. 2. The student must immediately notify their DCE of the incident. 3. The student must furnish the DCE with any documents notifying of a potentially compensable event i.e., professional liability claims or action. 4. The DCE will furnish the written documentation or oral report to the appropriate NSU authorities. 5. The student will promptly comply with all requirements of the NSU Health Professions Division Risk Manager regarding the incident. MALPRACTICE INSURANCE All matriculated students on scheduled clinical experiences are covered for professional liability by Nova Southeastern University. All incidents involving students and patients must be reported immediately by phone to the DCE by the student and the student's CI, and at request, in writing, to the Tampa Bay DPT Program. An electronic copy of the Insurance Declaration will be forwarded to the clinical center prior to an assigned student's start date. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND EXPOSURE PLAN In the event of an emergency, injury, or identification of potential r isk during clinical education courses, students are responsible for coordinating their own medical care and all costs associated. The student is responsible for all subsequent costs involved in follow -up medical care, treatment, counseling, hospitalizatio n, or preventive care. 1. Students are required to follow OSHA Universal Precautions. If an exposure occurs, however, students should: a. Use gloves to remove and dispose of all contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE). Wash the exposed area thoroughly with soap and running water. Use non- abrasive, antibacterial soap, if possible. If blood is splashed in the eye or mucous membrane, flush the affected area with running water for at least 15 minutes. b. Report the exposure to their supervising Clinical Instructor AND to the DCE as soon as possible. c. It is the student's responsibility to coordinate any post -exposure medical care and cover the costs incurred of any necessary treatment. If post -exposure treatment is offered by the Clinical Site, the student may accept, but is responsible for any costs associated. The NSU Health Care Center is available to all students and has a specific set of procedur es that they will follow for all post - exposure cases consistent with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) policy and procedures in such cases. Any costs incurred at the NSU Health Care Center are the sole responsibility of the student. d. Students that are exposed and become carriers of an infectious disease may be required to withdraw from the course or program, make up time, or reschedule or add clinical experience which may delay graduation. 2. Students that sustain any injury, illness, or debilitating condition, during an experience (at the clinic or at home) that may endanger the safety of patients, themselves, and others, may not return to the clinic until medically cleared. They must immediately notify the DCE and CI. To return, written medical clearance must indicate the student is able to participate in all activities without any potential for endangering themselves, patients, or others (including an unborn child). This is considered an excused absence, please see Attendance section. 3. If clinical exp erience poses a known, potential personal risk to the student (or if pregnant, the unborn child) the DCE will review the potential risk with the student, the SCCE and the CI. If the student chooses to discontinue an assigned experience based on potential risk, policies for Leave of Absence based on medical reasons will be followed. Supporting documentation from a physician must be submitted. 4. Once informed, should a student decide to continue the experience despite risk, they will be required to provide a written physician's statement containing recommendations and any restrictions applicable to the clinical experience . Restrictions that substantially limit student participation may result in the termination of the experience. Resumption of the experience will require a physician's clearance to 28 resume all required activities and will be rescheduled based on clinic availability. In cases of pregnancy, a written Informed Consent signed by a spouse/partner may also be required (see ADA policy) . ADA ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE CLINIC Students with disabilities requesting reasonable accommodation will be referred to the university ADA coordinator. Per the CHCS handbook, each student should discuss his or her needs with the disability service representative before the start of classes. Refer to CHCS handbook, Disabilities section. Students who request reasonable accommodations at the clinical center must meet with the DCE within one week of receiving their clinical assignment(s) and provide written consent for the DCE to discuss the approved accommodations and their implications with the SCCE of the clinical center prior to the student's arrival . These requests are subject to the approval of the SCCE at the assigned clinical center. F acilities have the right to refuse clinical placement for a student requesting approved accommodation or informal requests for accommodations. If a student has a disability that may impact clinical performance and clinical course success it is strongly encouraged that the student discloses pertinent information to the SCCE and/or CI at the assigned clinical center, for the purposes of making accommodations that may maximize a student's chances for success in the clinical course. The DCE, NSU Program Director, or the student's Academic Advisor can assist students to prepare for such conversations. If a student chooses to not disclose a disability prior to the clinical course, that student waives the right to appeal any course decisions on the grounds of disability after the fact. SEVERE WEATHER AND DISASTER PLAN At the onset of the experience, the student is ex pected to familiarize him self or herself with Site Disaster and Storm Plans as part of their facility orientation. Students will keep updated contact information, including email and phone number, on file with the DCE, HE -DPT Department , and CI/SCCE . In the event of impending seve re weather condition (i.e., tropical storm, hurricane, severe snowstorm ): 1. Students will comply with facility expectations of them as a student intern. 2. Students are expected to participate in storm preparations and follow up in the clinical setting. 3. Students are expected to stay in contact with their CI/ SCCE and DCE before and after a severe storm or hurricane. Communication is the responsibility of the student . 4. Students will report to the experience when the conditions safely permit. 5. Students are not expected to drive through hazardous conditions due to severe snowstorm , tropical storm, or hurricane to attend experiences. 6. Absences due to severe weather are considered excused and do not have to be made up unless they exceed 2 days. Anything more requires that the student make -up time (see excused absences) . Following a severe weather event, if a clinical center is destroyed or closed for an extended or indefinite time , the student will be reassigned as quickly as possible by the DCE in a comparable clinical center. Every attempt will be made to conserve the experience course; however, delay of graduation may occur. Frequent communication is important in these situations to facilitate swift action to reassign a student if necessary. CHANGE IN CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR The student will immediately notify the DCE as soon as he or she is notified of a CI's planned or unexpected extended absence and the plan for temporary or permanent substitution of the CI. Notification should occur via email or cell phone during work hours and include contact information for the substitute CI. The DCE is responsible for any follow -up with the new CI and/or SCCE . In the event of a short, temporary absence ( for example a 1/2 day off) of an assigned Clinical Instructor, the CI or his/her designee will identify a qualified substitute CI to supervise the student or pre-arrange for another educational activity pertinent to the student's learning goals. It is the student's responsibility to inform the DCE of the CI's absence and the alternative learning experiences that occurred. The DCE is responsible for any follow -up with the student, CI, or SCCE , particularly if a pattern of these substitutions emerges. At no time will the stud ent provide patient care without having a qualified, licensed CI clearly identified as his or her CI and physically present to directly supervise the student. FAMIL Y EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA) RELATED TO CLINICAL EDUCATION The HE -DPT department follows the privacy procedures of the CHCS as described in the CHCS Handbook Privacy of Records section outlining the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). The student's clinical education records file (hard -copy file) will be maintained in a secured location of the HE -DPT department offices. Any electronic files will be maintained under password protection. Access to these records will be restricted to those faculty and staff directly involved in the Clinical Education Program. Student clinical education files , electronic or hard copy , will routinely be thinned one (1) year from the date of a student's graduation from the program. GLOSSARY OF CLINICAL EDUCATION TERMS * Adopted from the American Council of Academic Physical Therapy (ACAPT) Clinical Education Glossary * Site Coordinator of Clinical Education ( SCCE ) A professional who administers, manages, and coordinates clinical assignments and learning activities for students during their clinical education experience. In addition, this person determines the readiness of persons to serve as preceptors and clinical instructors for students, supervises preceptors and clinical instructors in the delivery of clinical education experiences, communicates with the academic program regarding student performance, and provides essenti al information to academic programs . Clinical Education Site A health service delivery agency or other setting in which clinical education experiences are provided for physical therapist students. The clinical education site may be, but is not limited to, a hospital, agency, clinic, office, school, or home and is affiliated with the educational program(s) through a contractual agreement . Clinical Education A formal supervised experiential learning focused on development and application of patient/client -centered skills and professional behaviors. It is designed so that students gain substantial, relevant clinical experience and skills, engage in contemporary practice, and demonstrate competence before beginning independent practice . 30 Clinical In structor (CI) The physical therapist responsible for the physical therapist student and for directly instruc ting, guiding, supervising, and formally assessing the student during the clinical education experience. When engaged in fulltime clinical education designated to meet the minimum number of weeks required by CAPTE, the clinical instructor must be a licensed physical therapist with a minimum of one year of full time (or equivalent) post - licensure clinical experience . Clinical Experience Experiences th at allow students to apply and attain professional knowledge, skills, and behaviors within a variety of environments. Experiences include those of short and long duration (e.g., part -time, fulltime), provide a variety of learning opportunities, and include physical therapy services for patients/clients across the lifespan and practice settings. While the emphasis is on the development of patient/client physical therapy skills, experiences may also include inter -professional experiences and non -patient/clie nt service delivery such as research, teaching, supervision, and administration. Clinical education experiences are a part of the professional curriculum and include formal student assessment . Full-Time Clinical Experience A clinical education experience in which a student is engaged for a minimum of 35 hours per week. Full -time clinical education experiences designated to achieve the minimum number of weeks set forth by CAPTE are directed by a physical therapist clinical instructor. An integrated clini cal education experience may be a full - time clinical education experience. Terminal Full- time Clinical Experience A single, or set of, full -time clinical education experience(s) designated to achieve the minimum number of weeks set forth by CAPTE that occurs after the student has completed the didactic curriculum of a physical therapist professional education program. Students may return to the academic program for didactic instruction that does not require additional clinical education experiences. The expected outcome of the final, or last terminal experience is entry -level performance. Clinical Internship Evaluation Tool (CIET ) The CIET is a validated outcomes assessment instrument developed by the Pittsburg University to evaluate the performance of physical therapy students based on a specific set of criteria related to Professional Behaviors and Patient Management. The CIET is the primary grading tool of the clinical education program.

For this tool to be an effective and reliable measure, students must be rated against the standard of a competent clinician who meets the above criteria. Using the Form This form is composed of two sections. The first section, Professional Behaviors, evaluates Safety, Professional Ethics, Initiative, and Communication Skills in the clinic. Saf ety behaviors address whether the student is following all health and safety precautions required at your facility along with taking any other measures needed to maintain both the patient's safety and their own safety. Professional Ethics addresses the student's knowledge of, and compliance with, all rules, regulations, ethical standards, legal standards, and their professional appearance and conduct in the clinic during all interactions. Initiative addresses the student's ability to maximize all opportunit ies for learning during their clinical affiliation, begin to problem solve independently, seek out, accept, and implement constructive criticism, and develop teamwork and flexibility in the clinical setting. Communication Skills looks at both their ability to verbally communicate with patients, families, and other healthcare professionals along with their written skills with documentation, home programs, and other required paperwork. When evaluating the student on Professional Behaviors , the frequency of a ppropriate behavior is the construct being measured. The occurrence of the appropriate behavior is rated as: Never (0% occurrence), Rarely, Sometimes (50% occurrence) , Most of the Time, or Always (100% occurrence). From the onset of the fieldwork experienc es, our expectation is that the student shows safe, professional behavior and demonstrates a great deal of initiative. Note that you cannot mark \"Not Observed\" on these behaviors. You may mark \"not observed\" for Communication Skills if the student has not had the opportunity to demonstrate a particular skill. For instance, if the student has had no opportunity to communicate with other professionals this would be \"not observed.\" Please use the \"comments\" section to explain a low mark or provide additional feedback to the student. The second section, Patient Management evaluates the student's ability to efficiently manage a patient with an effective outcome. It is divided into four sections, Examination, Evaluation, Diagnosis/Prognosis, and Intervention. These elements of patient management are defined in the APTA Guide to Physical Therapist Practice. The examination includes all aspects of gathering data from the patient including obtaining a history, a systems review, and performing tests a nd measures. The evaluation is the analysis and synthesis of the data gathered in order to determine a diagnosis and plan of care for the patient. The student should demonstrate the development of their critical thinking skills during the evaluation proces s of patient management including determining the patient's impairments and functional limitations. Diagnosis/Prognosis involves all aspects of developing a plan of care for the patient including determining a diagnosis for physical therapy management (not the medical diagnosis), determining the prognosis or outcome for this episode of physical therapy care, determining the appropriate frequency and duration of care including criteria for discharge, and determining the appropriate treatments. Intervention i ncludes the student's ability to apply the treatments, perform patient/family education, monitor the patient's response to treatment and adapt accordingly, and recognize when the outcome has been reached. For all areas of patient management, the student should be using the best available evidence in their decision making. When evaluating the student's Patient Management skills, please keep in mind that the student should be compared to a 'competent clinician who skillfully manages patients in an efficient manner to achieve an effective outcome'. This form is designed for use with all patient types, and in any clinical setting, thus the student should be evaluated based on your clinic population and the expectation for productivity/efficiency in your specifi c clinic. In considering the student's scores for their Patient Management skills, please review the operational definitions which are presented as an additional resource. Please use the comment page for specific areas of concern and/or positive feedback. On the last page you are asked to make a global rating about how the student compares to a competent clinician on a scale from 0 to 10. The bottom of the scale indicates a student Well Below a Competent Clinician and the top of the scale represents a student Above a Competent Clinician . On the last page please also indicate whether the student is performing at a satisfactory level for their current level of education. Please let the DCE know immediately if there i s a problem in any area of Professional Behaviors or the student is not meeting the expected goals in a timely manner. In the comment section, please explain a No response and give an overall summary of the student's performance. References 1. American Ph ysical Therapy Association.

Appendix I: Description of Capstone Project As part of our curriculum, students in the Tampa DPT Program are required to complete a Capstone project for the final course of their Evidence -Based Practice (EBP) series. This project should occur sometime during their clinical education courses. The framework we are using is based on the text Writing Case Reports: A How -To Manual for Clinicians by Dr. Irene McEwen, and Guidelines by Physical Therapy Journal (PTJ). Students will draw on questions, ideas, and experience from their clinical education to develop a topic for the case report. A case report is n ot \"research\" but a rich description of practice. There are 7 potential focuses for case reports: Diagnosis/Prognosis, Clinical Measurement Procedures, Intervention, Application of Theory to Practice, Risk Management, Administrative/Education Process, and \"Full\" Traditional Case Report. Since this is a student project that must be completed within a very narrow time frame, we expect subjects will focus on a very small, well- defined aspect of PT Practice. The course director is Dr. Kathleen Rockefeller. She will be overseeing the projects and guiding the students through the process. The project might be based on an encounter with an actual patient. It could involve some sort of administrative or educational process at your facility. Since the case report is not research, and will only be shared with Nova faculty and students during a \"wrap- up\" week, formal IRB approval is not required. Of course, the student would be expected to abide by anything required by your facility related to such an experience. Dr. Rockefeller is happy to talk with you more about any questions you might have. Dr. Rockefeller will approve the topic after discussion with the student. The Clinical Instructor should also \"approve\" the topic of the case report but there are no expectati ons for you to guide the process. If you should want to be more involved, that is also fine. And the student may want to use part of the development of the case report as a potential topic for an in- service although this is not required. We hope that this will be a good learning experience for all involved. Please contact Dr. Rockefeller/Dr. Galley at any time if you have questions. Thank you for your help. Sincerely, Dr. Kathleen Rockefeller (813) 574- 5319 Dr. Robin Galley (813) 574- 5316 56 Appendix J - Weekly Review Form Weekly Review Form for Clinical Experiences Student Name: ____________________________ Clinic Name: ____________________________________ of the Week ( What went well?
