For Vermont residents: Purpose: Vermont law requires that health insurers offer cov erage to parties to a civil union that is equiv alent to coverage provided to married persons. Definitions, Terms, Conditi ons and Provisions: The definitions, terms, conditions or any other provisions of the policy, contract, certificate and/or riders and endorsements to which this mandatory endorsement is attached are hereby amended and superseded as follows: 1)Terms that mean or refer to a marital relationship, or that may be construed to mean or refer to a marital relationship, such as any oth er such terms, include the relationship created by a civil union established according to Vermont law. 2)Terms that mean or refer to the inception or dissolution of a marriage, such as \"date of marriage\", \"divorce decree\", \"termination of marriage\" and an y other such terms include the inception or dissolution of a civil union established according to Vermont law. 3)Terms that mean or refer to family relationships arising from a marriage, such as any other such terms include family relationships created by a civil union established according to Vermont law. 4)\"Dependent\" means a spouse, a party to a civil union established according to Vermont la w, and a child or children (natural, stepchild, legally adopted or a minor or disabled child who is dependent on the insured for support and maintenance) who is born to or brought to a marriage or to a civil union established according to Vermont law. 5)\"Child or covered child\" means a child (natural, step -child, legally adopted or a minor or disabled child who is dependent on the insured for support and maintenance) who is born to or brought to a marriage or to a civil union established according to Vermo nt law.24CAUT ION: FEDERAL LAW RIGHTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE Vermont law grants parties to a civil union the same benefits, protections and responsibilities that flow from marriage under state law. Howev er, some or all of the benefits, protections and responsibilities related to health insurance that are av ailable to married persons under federal law may not be available to parties to a civil union. For example, federal law, the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 known as \"ERISA\", control s the employer/employee relationship with regard to determining eligibility for enrollment in private employer health benefit plans. Because of ERISA, Act 91 does not state requirements pertaining to a private employer's enrollment of a party to a civil u nion in an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan. Howev er, governmental employers (not federal government) are required to provide health benefits to the dependents of a party to a civil union if the public employer provides health benefits to the dependent s ofmarried persons. Federal law also controls group health insurance continuation rights under COBRA for employers with 20 or more employees as well as the Internal Revenue Code treatment of health insurance premiums. As a result, parties to a civil un ion and their families may or may not hav e access to certain benefits under this policy, contract, certificate, rider or endorsement that derive from federal law. You are advised to seek expert advice to determine your rights under this contract.
