The laboratory of Daniel DiMaio, M.D., Ph.D., in the Department of Genetics is seeking a postdoctoral researcher in molecular virology. We study tumor viruses to determine the mechanistic basis of fundamental biological processes and to develop new strategies to inhibit tumor virus infection and the cancers they cause.Because viruses are dependent on cellular machinery for all phases of their life cycle, they historically have been valuable tools to study many aspects of biology. Our lab focuses on human papillomaviruses (HPV), which cause approximately 5% of all human cancer. Our prior studies revealed a novel mechanism of growth factor receptor activation by a viral oncoprotein, provided the first example of oncogene addiction, designed artificial proteins with unprecedented chemical simplicity, described the first clear biological role of cell-penetrating peptides, and discovered that some proteins can act in a manner independent of their amino acid sequence. Our main current focus is the complex process by which HPV enters cells, which we study to discover new principles of cell biology and biochemistry. These studies many also lead to new approaches to inhibit virus infection and cancer formation. Our laboratory seeks to hire a highly motivated postdoctoral associate with expertise in virology, molecular and cellular biology, and/or biochemistry. Potential projects include structure-function analysis of HPV proteins involved in virus entry, development of a novel system to propagate infectious HPV pseudoviruses, and mechanistic studies of cellular proteins that are required for virus entry. Major experimental approaches include cell culture, virus propagation and infection, mutant construction and analysis, protein expression and purification, and imaging techniques in cultured cells.

The aim of the project is to develop and deploy agent-based (or generative) models to understand human-environment interactions in the Zambezian Biome of southern-central Africa over the last ~30,000 years. The position is funded through a Yale Bioscience Postdoctoral Fellowship, and will begin on 1 September 2023. The time period under study spans the global climatic transition from the Last Glacial Maximum into the Holocene ca. 11,500 years ago, as well as the regional economic transition of humans from hunter-gatherers to food producers ca. 2,000-3,000 years ago. The goal is to understand the changing resource landscape for ancient humans across those transitions, as well as potentially the iterative environmental impacts of those same humans on available resources. Ultimately, these models will provide testable hypotheses for interpreting the archaeological and paleoenvironmental records relevant to reconstructing ancient human social organization. They will also inform development of strategies for mitigating paired human-climate impacts on environments in the region, by identifying where and under what conditions ecosystem tipping points may be anticipated. One year of this two-year project has already been completed. Therefore, the incoming candidate will build on existing data and code structure, but the position will not be renewable for a second year.

The Higgins-Chen Lab at Yale University invites applications for up to 2 postdoctoral associate positions in the biology of aging, supported by multiple NIH grants. The lab is focused on using machine learning approaches to identify omics-based biomarkers to estimate the biological age of individuals, then adapt the biomarkers for use in clinical trials of geroscience-based interventions to prevent or treat age-related diseases. The lab also studies the interaction between aging and mental health. Lab members primarily perform computational analysis, collaborating with clinicians, experimental biologists, epidemiologists, social scientists, and industry to train and validate biomarkers. Postdoctoral associates may work on one or more projects and are encouraged to incorporate their other research interests into the work. They may work collaboratively with one or more current lab members for these projects. Projects we are currently hiring for include: - Molecular signatures of Alzheimer's resilience: Work with a unique multi-omics multi-region brain dataset for Alzheimer's disease, highly enriched in individuals with ApoE E4 alleles yet are resilient to cognitive decline. All somatic mutation, DNA methylation, and proteomics data from 3 brain regions are already collected, along with detailed phenotypic data. A postdoctoral associate would work to identify molecular signatures of resilience using individual data types and perform multi-omic integration. - Epigenetic clocks to link aging hallmarks, interventions, and outcomes: Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation are commonly used aging biomarkers in epidemiological studies. However, there is little mechanistic understanding of how they relate to molecular hallmarks of aging, risk for age-related disease, and response to aging interventions, limiting their potential use in clinical trials. With collaborators, we are collecting data from humans, human cell culture, and mouse models concerning DNA methylation relationships with aging hallmarks, interventions, and outcomes. A postdoctoral associate would work to integrate this data and test new computational approaches to develop mechanistically informed epigenetic aging clocks. - Computational solutions for adapting aging biomarkers to longitudinal studies and clinical trials: Aging biomarkers are needed to longitudinally monitor an individual's aging process and their response to interventions. However, current aging biomarkers are mostly trained and validated using cross-sectional measurements, and they also can be affected by a variety of confounders that make it unclear whether changes in biomarkers can be truly attributed to a modification of aging. A postdoctoral associate would work with longitudinal biomarker data from large aging cohorts and other datasets to develop computational methods for utilizing longitudinal data in training and validation of aging biomarkers, and methods for detecting and correcting for confounders. Another major focus of the lab is investigating how mental health influences the aging process and identifying ways to improve the long-term health of individuals with psychiatric disorders. Postdoctoral associates are welcome to contribute to these projects. Qualifications: - Excellent collaboration skills and ability to contribute to a positive, supportive, and collegial lab environment - A PhD, MD, or MD/PhD and experience in geroscience, cellular and molecular biology, computational biology, bioinformatics, or a related field. - Strong computational skills, including experience with programming languages such as R or Python, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods - Motivated and self-directed to complete research projects and learn new skills needed for that research Preferred Qualifications: - Experience and domain knowledge relevant to one or more projects listed above (Alzheimer's Disease, mouse or cell culture aging studies, epidemiology of aging, etc) - Expertise in computational methods relevant to one or more projects listed above (proteomics analysis, multi-omics data integration, advanced longitudinal modeling, etc.) Application Process: Appointments are initially for 1-2 years, are renewable, and have flexible start dates. The positions are available immediately and will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Qualified applicants may be contacted to schedule an interview. Interested candidates should submit the following application materials: - A 1-page cover letter describing your research interests, career goals, and how your expertise may contribute to one of the above projects (please focus your letter on one project - we may discuss other projects during the interview). - A detailed CV or Biosketch - Contact information for three professional references who can provide letters of recommendation or discussions by phone upon request.

ABOUT THE YALE CENTER FOR DIGITAL ETHICS The Center for Digital Ethics (DEC) builds on Yale's unique depth, breadth, and reach of scholarship in the humanities and social sciences to provide an internationally recognized hub for the study of the governance, ethical, legal, and social implications (GELSI) of digital technologies and their human, societal, and environmental impact. Strengths in other areas of the university\u2014from the natural sciences, computer science, data science, and engineering to Yale's unique array of professional schools\u2014provide an essential and valuable complement. The DEC expands multidisciplinary opportunities at Yale and facilitates connections to other academic institutions, businesses, and government agencies. By bringing together a diverse community of stakeholders, the DEC implements three essential requirements for understanding the human, social, and environmental implications of digital technologies and for equitably and sustainably developing them: a firm footing in GELSI analysis and scholarship; the rigorous and scientific treatment of vital facets of digital technologies (from computer and data science to law and social sciences); and the ability to learn from, and influence, important societal endeavors outside academia (from policy- and law-making to business strategies). Digital technologies in general, and AI in particular, build on computer science, data science, and statistics, rely on human psychology and sociology, draw on insights from linguistics, literature, and philosophy, and call for new frameworks for governance, law, and business. Attention to social implications and questions of value throughout this process is essential. Thus, the DEC enables and supports scholars from a wide range of disciplines and beyond to meet, exchange ideas, and collaborate. The DEC is deeply engaged with informing and steering emerging policy initiatives on the socio-ethical value and implications of AI, digital technologies, and their applications. It sponsors public discussions that build an understanding of the socio-ethical and socio-legal aspects of digital technologies. Visitors and speakers include academics and researchers as well as civil servants, members of the technology industry, policymakers and lawmakers, and experts in culture and mass media. The DEC brings together leadership with the vision and ability to think innovatively and boldly and to move those ideas forward. It ensures diversity in its membership, promotes the inclusion of views, and arrives at consensus through open and constructive exchanges of ideas and balanced debate. Yale University is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer.
