P rincipals who are new to CBSE are sure to have several queries about the system. W e shall unravel the day -to-day areas of work and answer many queries related to the professional lives of CBSE School P rincipals in this Handbook, through the fascinating journey of learning and absorbing of Shri Sambhav Singh Rathore.* This Handbook has been prepared in a manner unlike the style of usual Handbooks. There is a reason behind that. W e want to generate your curiosity at every step, so that you too learn and absorb from end to end, like Shri Rathore. Hope you enjoy your journey , just as much as he did! F rom the following illustration, you will have an idea what a P rincipal, that is you, means for a student: HOW IT ALL STARTED?CHAPTER-1 In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals14When a parent of a cute kid demands that he wants to see you immediately , it may not always be good news. Especially , if you are the Principal of the school where the cute kid is a student. But it surely is an exercise in understanding , patience and problem-solving. If you are a P rincipal of a school and are reading this Handbook with the same approach , go ahead. But if you believe that all good things come in small packages that are unwrappable in 2-minutes, then let me alert you - this is the exception to your rule. My name is Sambhav Singh Rathore1. F or the last three years, I have been working as the P rincipal of The New Academy* in Bhilwara, Rajasthan. I shall take you down the several twists and turns of my memory lane, by sharing my journey as a P rincipal of a CBSE school. In this Handbook, I have used a few boxes which are titled as below: 1.We the Principals: These are tips and learnings only for Principals 2.All in the Family: L earnings and tips for Everyone else in a School 3.All aboard: Learnings and tips for all Principals and Everyone in a School. 4.Six Honest Men: These are my queries based on Rudyard Kipling's poem \"I K eep six honest serving Men \". I keep six honest serving men They taught me all I knew Their names are What and Why and When And How and Where and Who 1 The name and place of the person and sch ool are fictitious. Any similarity is purely coincidental.SIX HONEST MEN: \"What\" is the knowledge that I must be \"armed\" with on being appointed as a Principal? 5.Answering the bell: Here I try to resolve some of your anticipated queries and sometimes also come out with some interesting tidbits. 1.1. The Beginning: I began my career as a PG T, and worked for a long time in a well- established CBSE school. As a teacher , I was fairly aware of my roles and responsibi lities, and was ever willing to learn more to be a better teacher . After teaching for 8 years at a stretch, I got an opportunity to be appointed as the Principal of a newly -opened school. The Management of the school aimed to get the school affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. I joined and spent my initial days groping in the dark. I had no ideas on how to even begin this work. I was flooded with thoughts of regret for having left the much more comfortable job of a teacher . While in academics, I did not have any administrative and leadership issues. This was something very new.Chapter 1 : How It All Started ?151.2. Various Roles of a Principal: A school that is known for its quality, joyful classrooms and standards of education definitely has a focused, committed and dynamic Principal, who knows how to handle anticipated situations, and has the resilience to handle the unanticipated too with the help of all resources at her command. Well, let me be honest; getting a new school affiliated was completely unanticipated by me and had it not been for the Affiliation Byelaws, I would have been fired by now. ANSWERING THE BELL My academic experience of researching resource material for my students, gave me my first opening to an understanding of what was required of me as a Principal to a school that was wanting to get affiliated to CBSE. I STARTED RESEARCHING AND SURFING THROUGH THE CBSE WEBSITE WWW.CBSE.NIC.IN. I went to the link 'affiliation' and came across the CBSE Affiliation Bye Laws 2018. Chapter 9 of the CBSE Affiliation Bye- Laws states the roles and responsibilities of the Head of School. Let us have a look at some of the important provisions. (For more details you will have to do extra homework and read the Chapter 9 of Affiliation Byelaws, 2018 for yourself.) In the table below, the section entitled 'domain' is the inference I have drawn after studying the provisions.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals16Head of the School - CLAUSE PROVISION DOMAIN 9.2.1Head of the School/Principal will be the ex-officio Member Secretary of the School Management Committee.Administrative 9.2.2Will function as the Head of the office of the school under his charge and carry out all Academic and Administrative duties required of a head of the educational institute.Administrative & Pedagogical Leadership 9.2.3Will ensure that all provisions of the Affiliation and Examination Byelaws and all directions given by CBSE from time to time are strictly complied with.Administrative 9.2.4Be the drawing and disbursing officer for the employees of the school however in the case of an unaided school, he may perform only such function, as drawing and disbursing officer as may be specified in the instructions issued by the SocietyFinancial Controller 9.2.5Be responsible for the proper maintenance of accounts of the school, school records, service books of teachers, and such other registers, returns and statistics as may be specified by the Society/Board.Administrative 9.2.6Handle official correspondence relating to the school and furnish, within the specified dates, the returns and information required by the State Government/Board.Administrative 9.2.7Make purchases of stores and other materials required for the school in accordance with the rules governing such purchases and enter all such stores in the stock register and shall scrutinize the bills and make paymentsFinancial Controller 9.2.8Conduct physical verification of school property and stock at least once a year and ensure the maintenance of stock registers neatly and accurately.AdministrativeChapter 1 : How It All Started ?179.2.9Be responsible for proper utilization of the Pupils Fund.Financial Controller 9.2.10Make satisfactory arrangements for the supply of good drinking water and provide other facilities for the pupils and ensure that the school building, its fixtures and furniture, office equipment, lavatories, play grounds, school garden and other properties are properly and carefully maintained.Administrative 9.2.11Supervise, guide and control the work of the teaching and non-teaching staff of the schoolPedagogical Leadership 9.2.12Be in-charge of admission in the school, preparation of school timetable, allocation of duties and teaching load to the teachers, and shall provide necessary facilities to the teachers for the discharge of their duties and conduct of school examination in accordance with the instructions issued by the Government /Board from time to time;Pedagogical Leadership 9.2.13Plan the year's academic work in advance in consultation with his/her colleagues and hold staff meeting at least once a month, review the work done during the month and assess the progress of the pupils.Pedagogical Leadership 9.2.14Help and guide the teachers to promote their professional growth and actively encourage their participation in courses designed for in-service education.Pedagogical Leadership 9.2.15Promote the initiative of the teachers for self- improvement and encourage them to undertake pedagogical and other innovations which are educationally sound.Pedagogical Leadership 9.2.16Supervise classroom teaching and secure co- operation and coordination amongst teachers of the same subject areas as well as inter-subject coordination.Pedagogical LeadershipIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals189.2.17Arrange for special remedial teaching of the children belonging to the weaker sections of the community also of other children who need such remedial teaching.

The Principal/Head of the School shall act as a Centre Superintendent whenever and wherever appointed by the Board and shall not delegate his authority, duties and responsibilities to any other person under any circumstances. AdministrativeCAPACITY ENHANCEMENTCHAPTER-2 Chapter 2 : Capacity Enhancement21CBSE has its affiliated schools located all across the country as well as abroad. But I realized that whether it is a city or a town, urban or rural school, in India or abroad, the only thing that could help new Principals like me was systematic capacity building programmes, which I could undertake in my school or take outside help. Once again CBSE came to my help, in the form of its Training Policy through CBSE Centres of Excellence (COEs). I could SIX HONEST MEN: ALL ABOARD: The numbers of CBSE affiliated schools in India are: 22,535 Central Navodaya Vidyalayas - 596, and o Central Tibetan Schools - 14I had the requisite experience and academic qualifications. I wanted to upgrade and update myself professionally. But \"how\" to and \"where\" from? Several CBSE schools are also located in smaller cities like mine. State govt. schools (both grant-in-aid and aided schools) - 2737 Private schools - 17818 Schools located outside India - 232 The CBSE affiliated schools have 11.47 lakhs teachers and 1.97 crores students. - All figures are as on 15.12.19 update myself professionally not only in general areas but also in subject-specific requirements. Allow me to show you some of the details of the Training Policy of CBSE and the various formats that the board uses for its outreach to us. In 2018, CBSE has formulated a Teachers' Training Policy, which is incorporated in its Affiliation Byelaws. ALL IN THE FAMILY: This Training Policy is to be followed by all Principals, for themselves as well as for the Teachers working in their school.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals222.1. CBSE Training Policy: The CBSE has established Centres of Excellence throughout the country to cater to training needs of all its affiliated schools, particularly the independent schools, as they are not able to participate in programmes of the state/central government institutes.

As a part of \"Vidya-Daan\", several CBSE schools have prepared and \"donated\" their content to CBSE for putting on public domain for the larger good of School education. Initially, the Board has curated e-content from some CBSE Schools and pooled it for classes VI to X for English, Hindi, Maths, Science and Social Science Subjects. The content has been systematically organized as per NCERT syllabus for the above- mentioned classes and subjects.Chapter 2 : Capacity Enhancement31And for those who walk among us in the belief that trainings are a waste of time, here is a sum total of what our peer group have to say: CBSE TRAININGSKEEP US UPDATED HONE OUR SKILLS TO HANDLE REAL LIFE SITUATIONS ENABLE PEER INTERACTION AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHEREXPAND THE HORIZONS OF OUR THINKINGTO BE AND TO DO LISTCHAPTER-3 Chapter 3 : To Be And To Do List33Now that I was secure in the knowledge that professional development and capacity SIX HONEST MEN: Am I a Good Leader? \"HOW\" DO I KNOW IF I HA VE THE DESIRED COMPETENCIES OF A GOOD LEADER? \"HOW\" DO I ACQUIRE THEM, IF I DON'T?building is a smooth task in CBSE , I moved on to my next task: that of building a team. 3.1. Leadership Competencies: Simply speaking , L eadership means leading a group of people or an organization. It is often said that one may be a born leader , but L eadership is a ski ll that is acquired, developed and honed over time. 3.1.1. Are you a Leader or a Boss? Principals are also termed as School leaders. School P rincipals can be soaked in P ower, Bossism, My -way-is-the-only-way style of functioning , or they can be School leaders. The following images demarcate the differences between a leader and a boss: Identify who you are? (https://in.pinterest. com accessed on 22.11.2019) In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals34 Difference is clear!!!Chapter 3 : To Be And To Do List35I decided that I would prefer to be a leader than a boss. However , due to the overwhelming load of work, playing various roles - as an administrator , pedagogical leader, leading by example, etc. - was not easy initially. Once again, research and training helped me. Preparing a list of competencies that are desirable in a leader in the form of a checklist and adoptin g the same in my real-life helped me. I trained myself to be positive and I began to build a motivated team to work with. The team comprised the Vice -principal, T eachers, Administrative staff, Support Staff and Transport staff.

I also undertook self- evaluation on these domains as well as few other connected ones. Do I : Have awareness of their needs? Know the requirements of training of the staff? Ensure they build their self- esteem & confidence? Provide avenues of growth? Fulfill reasonable needs of staff? Make for a comfortable working space? Implement schemes and policies for their welfare? Implements policies to promote growth and development? Create a happy pool of teachers? Have awareness of medical and personal issues of the staff? Create a safe and joyful working space? Build respect for the non-teaching staff and create an empowered group? 3.2. Administrative Leadership Aspect: 3.2.1. List of Possible Works to be Done: I have also prepared a T o-do-list. According to me, a Principal/ School leader must be aware of the following administrative responsibilities.

ANSWERING THE BELL: I remember an amazing deed of the principal of my previous school. One of my teacher colleagues had been blessed with a baby and after availing maternity leave, she had joined back her duties. As a new mother, she was finding it difficult to balance between being a mother and a teacher. When my Principal came to know of this, what he did next was touching indeed. He allowed her to take all her classes at one-go and leave immediately thereafter for home to look after her child. There are so many such inspiring examples. I want to share just one more with you. In a recent news, police personnel have been found helping mothers appearing for TET examination, by taking care of their little ones.

Naturally, our schools must be bullying- free. In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals50CBSE has already issued guidelines to schools on anti-bullying measures. These guidelines can be accessed at: http://cbseacademic.nic.in/ web_material/Circulars/2015/17_ Prevention%20of%20Bullying%20 &%20Ragging%20in%20Schools.pdf Learning occurs best in a positively charged environment. Students have better self- esteem and learn to be positive towards their peer group and their ecosystem. In a world where pressures and stresses of everyday life are increasingly affecting the mental status of not only students but also the teachers, traditional methods to address them may sometimes prove to be inadequate. I find that CBSE has taken quite a few initiatives for making schools happy places which enable implementation of learning in a joyful manner. 4.2.1. Making Schools Anger- Free/ No-Anger Zones: A joyful learning environment and happy school ecosystem can do wonders for the holistic development of our children. A learning abode like a school must be devoid of any kind of negativity. Government of India has recently launched the \"Fit India\" programme. Fitness of body is closely linked to fitness of mind. A fit mind is a creative mind and is capable of contributing to society. Anger is detrimental to fitness. Long term effects of uncontrolled anger include increased anxiety, high blood pressure and headache. The Board has decided to take up this area of holistic health and fitness in an innovative manner. Therefore, vide circular no. CBSE/ SECY/2019-20 dated 23rd December 2019, the Central Board of Secondary Education, as a part of its thrust on 'Joyful Education and Holistic Fitness', has urged all its affiliated Schools and School Leaders to make efforts to convert all CBSE Schools into a No-Anger Zone or Anger-Free Zone. In this Anger-Free Zone , all players, whether it is the School Educators, Parents, School personnel or other stakeholders, are expected to work towards managing their anger issues. The best way to teach children the value of \"freedom from anger\" is by setting examples ourselves. Some of the simplest changes that could be undertaken for making school an anger free zone include genuinely smiling at students and teachers, talking to students and everyone around them calmly, not looking at cell- phones all the time, practising breathing exercises, practising mindfulness, giving 20 minutes to self, laugh and make others laugh with you but not at others, teach coping skills, etc. There can be several other ways to create an Anger-Free Zone . Making our schools Anger-Free Zones will help our students in developing Affective Skills and in eradicating emotions like Fear, Disrespect, Humiliation, and Hurt, which are the by-products of anger. This change in the school environment will help our children become mentally active and emotionally wealthy. They shall go back home more charged and happier, and will definitely want to return to their schools the next day. Children are the harbingers of change. What they learn in the school, they will teach that to their parents. Imagine children going home and telling their parents , \"you are not allowed to be angry.\" This way both school and home will have a happy environment for them. Chapter 4 : Transforming the Learning Environment51Therefore, as a part of this initiative, schools must also take up exercises with children to help them overcome their own anger issues and also empower them with tools so that they can help others overcome their anger issues. Various suggestive measures have been given in the circular. ALL ABOARD: The circular on Making Schools Anger- Free Zones hands-on learning approach. It breaks away from the routine of the teacher standing in front of the learners giving lectures, and moves towards the learner taking responsibility for her own learning, with the help of ALL ABOARD: Some Facts about Experiential Learning: Gurukul system of ancient and medieval India is the classical format of experiential learning. The interplay between the learner and his/her environment triggers learning. In the digital world - blended form of learning includes field trips, DIY experiments, simple videos, robotics etc. It has been in vogue since early 20th century; popularized by educational philosopher David Kolb, who developed the theory of experiential learning in 1984 together with Roger Fry, based on the works of Piaget and Dewey. activities based on real-life experiences that the teacher facilitates. It makes learning a technical knowledge that goes much beyond the classroom and seeks to bring a more engaging way of learning to make learning outcomes deeper.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals524.2.2.2.

The learner plays a pivotal role in assessing himself. gives a multisens ory experience of learning by using all senses, auditory , visual, tactile https://carleton.ca/experientialeducation/what-is-experiential- accessed on 09.08.2019)Chapter 4 : Transforming the Learning Environment534.2.2.4. Stages of Experiential Learning: The learner can enter a learning cycle at any stage, but must go through all the four stages to complete his learning cycle. Stage 1 - Concrete Experience: The learner cannot learn merely by reading or observing. He needs to actively participate in the experience by feeling it with all the five senses. The idea is to immerse in the experience and learn. Stage 2 - Reflective observation: This is the second stage where the learner reflects at the situation before forming any opinion. The learner must reflect upon the present by connecting it to his past experiences. Reflective observation focuses on observing and perceiving. Stage 3 - Abstract Conceptualization: The learner creates theories to explain his experiences. In this stage the learner gathers and analyses the information and draws conclusions. Sometimes it may challenge the pre-existing concept. This focuses on learning by thinking. Stage 4 - Active Experimentation: This is the final stage where the learner applies what he has learnt while learning by doing. 4.3. Art- Integrated Learning: WE THE PRINCIPALS: Documentation of all activities/ experiences undertaken during the Experiential Learning process must be recorded in Student Portfolio for internal assessment at secondary level. Teachers are encouraged to use the tool of Portfolios for self-directed learning at all levels, for all subjects. For learning more about why, what and how of experiential learning, please refer to CBSE's HANDBOOK ON EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING Art-Integrated Learning is yet another step by CBSE for making classrooms joyful. The NCF 2005 has recommended as follows: \"Art as a subject at all stages covering all four major spheres, i.e. music, dance, visual arts and theatre... We must bring the arts squarely into the domain of the curricular, infusing them in all areas of learning while giving them an identity of their own at relevant stages.\" The NCF also states that: \"The importance of India's heritage crafts, both in terms of their economic and aesthetic values, should be recognized as being relevant to school education.\"In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals54Keeping the above in mind, the Board has held discussions with several stakeholders, including schools, principals, teachers, NCERT, art professionals, etc., and accordingly it has emerged that integration of Art with education will lead to the betterment of learning and the classrooms will become more joyful. Art-Integrated Learning is a cross-curricular approach to teaching and learning based on collaboration between the teaching of the subject with the teaching of Art (Visual/ performing etc.), where Art, in any of its multiple forms, becomes the primary pathway to learn the subject/topic and also for assessment. The integration is meant not only to make the learning process (of the chosen subject area for integration) joyful, but it also lends itself to imbibing a greater appreciation and understanding of the art form being utilized for this purpose. 4.3.1. Necessity of Art-Integrated Learning: Firstly, when Art is integrated with education, it helps the child apply art-based enquiry, investigation and exploration, critical thinking and creativity for a deeper understanding of the concepts/topics. All disciplines being pursued by students at 4 Hindi word for a Street Playall stages require creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. For example, the routine method would be involving studying metallurgy in Chemistry, or mitosis and meiosis in Biology. But art integration would provoke the student to ask questions such as - If I were a metal, how would I artistically depict my journey of combination with other metals or how can I use a Nukkad Natak4 to depict mitosis/meiosis? Secondly, Art Integrated learning is a strong contender for experiential learning, as it enables the student to derive meaning and understanding, directly from the learning experience. Thirdly, this kind of integration not only makes the teaching and learning process joyful, it also has a positive impact on the development of certain life skills, such as, communication skills, reflection and enquiry skills, un-conditioning of the mind leading to higher confidence levels and self-esteem, appreciation for aesthetics and creativity, etc. Fourthly, this integration broadens the mind of the student and enables her to see the inter-disciplinary links between subjects/ topics/real life. Therefore, it is possible to teach: a) The planets in the universe or forests, oceans, etc. through Art, by each child WE THE PRINCIPALS: o CBSE has made Art Education mandatory for classes 1 to 10 from the academic session 2019-20. o Two periods of Art education are mandatory per week.o In classes 6 to 8, schools are encouraged to take up culinary art also. o More and more integration of Art in education is to be planned by principals while preparing Annual pedagogical Plans for teaching all classes and all subjects.Chapter 4 : Transforming the Learning Environment55choosing a planet/forest/ocean and making a travel brochure on it. b) Reactions and compounds in Chemistry by each child becoming the element/ compound of his /her choice and then trying to mingle or not to mingle with others in the class. A lot of humour could be the hallmark of this exercise. c) Learning the meaning and lines of a difficult poem by breaking each line into a dialogue spoken by Amitabh Bachchan or James Bond or set to music based on Bollywood songs, etc. ALL ABOARD: For more details please refer to: http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_ material/Circulars/2019/12_ Circular_2019.pdf ANSWERING THE BELL: To implement Art-Integrated Education in our schools, we need to:and Guidelines on Art-Integrated Learning Circular no.

Joyful Classrooms: WE THE PRINCIPALS: TO MAKE CLASSROOMS JOYFUL... Guide your teachers to start lessons with the following questions to themselves: 4 What outcomes should the lesson seek to achieve?In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals56 Ways to L earning can be many (aside from above), ranging from integrating sports in educational activities to integrating story -telling in classroom transactions. Joy comes when a child feels a sense of achievement as if she has created something new , all on her own. It could occur after completion of a lesson onrealising that she has understood the concept clearly and can see how it links to real life; it could occur when the given task is done independently by the students; it could occur while doing an activity in or outside the classroom. To help students to attain the ' AHA! moment, activity -based and joyful learning must be practiced in all classrooms.

This is a beautiful story of how a 11-year old orphan girl teaches joy and gratefulness to an entire village. Do read the whole story and use this story in your pedagogy for imbibing life skills. 'Chocolate fudge and fig cake, indeed!' scorned Miss Polly. 'I think we can remedy that very soon. 'She paused in thought for a minute, then went on slowly: 'At nine o'clock every morning you will read aloud one half-hour to me. Before that you will use the time to put this room in order. Wednesday and Saturday forenoons, after half past nine, you will spend with Nancy in the kitchen, learning to cook. Other mornings you will sew with me. That will leave the afternoons for your music. I shall, of course, procure a teacher at once for you,' she finished decisively, as she arose from her chair. Pollyanna cried out in dismay. 'Oh, but Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, you haven't left me any time at all just to\u2014to live.' 'To live, child! What do you mean? As if you weren't living all the time!' 'Oh, of course I'd be BREATHING all the time I was doing those things, Aunt Polly, but I wouldn't be living. You breathe all the time you're asleep, but you aren't living. I mean living\u2014doing the things you want to do: playing outdoors, reading (to myself, of course), climbing hills, talking to Mr. Tom in the garden, and Nancy, and finding out all about the houses and the people and everything everywhere all through the perfectly lovely streets I came through yesterday. That's what I call living, Aunt Polly. Just breathing isn't living!' 4.5.1. Key Growth and Human Development Periods: infancy (birth to 2 years of age) early childhood (3 to 8 years of age) middle childhood (9 to 11 years of age) adolescence (12 to 18 years of age)4.5.2. Life Skills for Early Childhood: In early childhood, the skills and experiences acquired are vital. The Life Skills Education Program (LSE) aims to provide practical day-to-day living skills to children. Through these programs, the children are motivated to cultivate regard, ability and autonomy through activities and develop skills that will impact positively on them all through life, such as collaboration, communication, conflict resolution, etc. In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals584.5.3.

Life Skills for Adolescence: Adolescence, a key developmental and growth stage, traces the transitional phase from childhood to adulthood. It is defined by rapid changes in physiology and psychosocial development. Adolescence is also the phase when young people widen their relationships further than parents and family and are heavily influenced by their peer group and the outside world as a whole. Cognitively speaking , adolescents become more analytical in their thought process. Now they are able to think abstractly , to formulate better and to establish an independent belief system. These are the years of creativity , idealism, buoyancy and an adventurous spirit5. But these are also the years of innovation and risk -taking, giving in to detrimental peer pressure, taking irrational decision s on crucial issues, particularly with regard to their bodies and sexual orientation. Therefore, adolescence is a defining moment in one's life, a phase of greater potential as well as a phase of increased frailty. 5 adapted from serc.carleton.edu Chapter 4 : Transforming the Learning Environment59ALL ABOARD: For more details refer to: http://www.cbse.nic.in/cce/life_skills_ cce.pdf 4.6.

In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals604.6.1. Critical Thinking: According to John Butterworth and Geoff Thwaites,6\" Critical Thinking consists of making informed, evaluative judgements about claims and arguments. The main strands of critical thinking are: analysis (interpretation), evaluation and further argument. Critical thinking is characterised by being fair and open-minded; active and informed; sceptical;inde pendent. Scepticism means willin gness question or to entertain doubts. 4.6.2. P According to John Butterworth and Geoff Thwaites7, \"P roblem Solving asks for a solution, which may be a calculated value (in mathematical sense) or a way of doing something . There are three clearly defined processe s that we may use while solving problems: i. identifying which pieces of data are relevant when faced with a mass of data, most of which is irrelevant; ii. combining pieces of information that may not appear to be related to give new information; iii. Relating one set of information to another in a different form-this involvesusing experience, relating new problems to ones we have previously solved.\" 4.6.3. Creativity and Innovation: These skills prepare a child to discover innovative approaches and make them learn to apply creativity to real-life challenges. A diverse learning across fine arts, performing arts, and vocational skills is inculcated in a child. 4.6.4. Communication and Collaboration: The practices of effective communica tion and collaboration help to develop interest and fun in the teaching learning process. It also effectively broadens the cultural, social, and environmental bounda ries and helps a child to understand social and environmental concerns better. 4.6.5. Career and Life -skills: These skills prepare a child to look into a problem with respect to a broad perspective that might go from local to national and international. Through these skills, a child learns to adapt to different cultures and situations, to initiate her/himself even in diversity and tries to imbibe something productive and meaningful for her/his life from each situation. 6 Butterwor th, John and Thwaites Geoff .

MY TAKEAWAYS : ___________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________FOCUSSING UPON THE COMPETENCIESCHAPTER-5 Chapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies63SIX HONEST MEN: I KEEP HEARING THIS WORD, BUT \"WHAT\" REALLY ARE COMPETENCIES? 5.1. Meaning of Competency: We quite often say , \" A person is competent enough to handle a gathering of 100 people.\" This means that the person has the skill- sets or abilities needed to handle a group of 100 persons. In this case, the person has the requisite skills of content - knowledge, communic ation, people - management and leadership. All these skills put together are nothing but competencies. Thus, a Competency refers to demonstration of knowledge, skills, ability and attitude to perform a task successfully and efficiently on repeated occasions, naturally , without thinking consciously , by meeting real life challenges and analysing , reasoning , communicating ideas effectively. In the field of Education, a competency is defined as a piece of knowledge, an individual skill or an ability , developed in a transparent way attuned to the academic expectations of a particular level. A competent person is capable of applying or using a set of knowledge, skills and abilities to successfully carry out a task in a defined setting . For e.g . as per the sec tion B of CBSE class 10th English course, a class 10th student studying English Language and Literature course will be able to analyse and interpret the information in any given Reading Comprehension passage.Competency requires children to be more focused on attaining mastery in any task. Competency needs a particular time to develop and nourish. It requires the child to be independent in his/ her approach to performing the task. This will help the child to work alone in the near future and take decisions accordingly. 5.2. Competency-Based Learning (CBL): More and more education systems are gravitating towards Competency -Based learning. It is a model of education that focuses on the demonstration and application of learning , rather than on the time spent for a course. This method has the quality of being tailor-made to meet different learning abilities. Thus, it enables achieving student outcomes more efficiently. The CBL based model allows the learners to move throug h coursework at their own pace and achieve mastery in each learning outcome. Teachers can maintain the same learning goal for the entire class, but the difference here is that the teacher needs to ensure that each learner is facilitated in appropriate ways or ways unique for each learner. As learning takes place at the learner 'sIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals64pace in this model, schools can imagine and innovate new instructional formats and methods of delivery prioritizing skills and abilities over who delivers the instruction or how it is delivered. This enables students to engage in the learning exercises, activities and experiences, thereby acquiring and demonstrating their knowledge and skills which have predetermined learning objectives and outcomes. ALL ABOARD: The power of measurement was first written about by Peter Drucker in his famous book - The Practice of Management . He stated that \"what gets measured, gets managed\". Later Robin Sharma tweaked this statement to \"what gets measured, gets done\". Competency based learning also advocates measuring the attainment of skill sets or learning outcomes, through items/questions specifically designed to do so. This measurement, if done through items based on application of conceptual understanding to real-life situations, gives the correct indication of a child's competency to handle similar situations in life. Three key components of competency- based learning are: Skill - a task or group of tasks performed to a specified level of proficiency which typically involves the manipulation of tools and equipment, or expertise that is knowledge or attitude-based. Knowledge - pre-requisite set of facts & information Abilities - performance to a specified standard under specific conditions.5.3. Components of Competency-Based Learning: SKILLS KNOWLEGDE ABILITIESChapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies655.3.1. Concepts Adjoining CBL: Active Learning: thinking hard -deep and surface learning Metacognition: learning how to learn Differentiated L earning: design activity according to the levels of the students: inclusive learning (students must be exposed to a variety of teaching-learning strategies) 21st century skills Formative Assessment and F eedback: concept of assessment for learning: questioning , formative feedback, peer and self-assessment, formative use of summative assessment. 5.4. CBL: Features and Processes Decide the Competency to be focussed upon in a particular class. Follow Personalised learning and prepare Personalised Learning Plans PLPs. Teachers have autonomy to plan and develop their own lesson and instructional formats and activities. Students are aware of the learning objectives and are able to describe them. Students are aware of what they are expected to know and are empowered to demonstrate their learning. Assessmet is continuous and formative. Students learn actively and apply their set of crtical-thinking and problem-solving skills. Holistic and Sustainable Learning.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals665.5. Competency and its Elements: 5.5.1. Students advance upon Demonstrated Mastery:8 In the CBL model, students demonstrate what knowledge and skills they have acquired, through performance assessment. The assessment is participatory , in the sense, that students are involved by teachers in the conversations about what their learning looks like, and decide how and when to demonstrate what they have learned. Thus, they are able to work more upon those areas that are more difficult for them. They may even advance beyond the desired grade level in some areas while taking more time in the ones that pose challenge to them. Noticeable is that Compulsive and Formal summative assessment does not figure prominently in the evaluation of students. Teachers are also able to focus assistance on the areas which are more challenging for students, simultaneously ensurin g they learn what is needed to advance to the next level of learning.5.5.1.1. Personalised Learning Pathways9 for Developing Students' Competency: As discussed above, the main feature of Competency-Based L earning is that the Students have mastery of their L earning. To achieve this, Personalised Learning Pathways for Students can be created. 5.5.1.1.1. Personalised Learning Pathways (PLPs)? Personalised Learning Pathways (PLPs) are an effective tool for increasing student engagement. These pathways/plans can improve learning outcomes and educational aspirations of students when developed in serious collaboration among students, their parents or/and teachers to identify , organise and apply personal approaches to learning and engagement. Educators can customize these plans to meet local needs and contexts. The educators can target short term or long -term goals for their students through PLPs. Short term goals are actually specific guiding steps to reach long term goals. 8 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED561280.pdf Competencyworks , An International Study in Competency Education pp. 26-28 accessed on 22.11. 2019. 9 https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/aec/media/documents/ PersonalisedLearningPathways16.pdf accessed on 22.11.2019Chapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies675.5.1.1.2. Features of Personalised Learning Pathways: An effective PLP should: engage students to know what their goals are contain specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time bound (SMART) goals for supporting students to realise their goals record student's academic goals in congruence to the student's spiritual, emotional, social and physical health and wellbeing articulate learning path required to pursue the goals analysed for a student be easily accessible to students, families be owned by the student throughout all stages: development, monitoring and review include matter for literacy and numeracy skills for all students who are at risk of falling behind. enable teachers to provide customised support for each student's learning should record the implementation of appropriate educational strategies and differentiated curricula needed to support exceptional learners to fulfill their potential. change as the student moves from learning stage to learning stage. ALL ABOARD: PLP is effective when a student owns it right from its inception. When students are engaged in monitoring and review processes, active learning and personal empowerment is enhanced. 5.5.1.1.3. PLP as a Feedback Mechanism: For continuous assessment, PLPs can be a good feedback mechanism. Teachers may refer to the PLP throughout the year, making notes for self, highlighting the evidences (make it evidence as later it is singular) of outcomes achieved by a student. This evidence can be discussed with the student and family during informal and formal conversations.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals68 5.5.1.1.4. PLP Cycle: are ready. With greater transparency in learning objectives, students have greater ownership and opportunities for their learning and also for choices in how they learn and how they demonstrate their learning. Flexibility in the manner of learning of students is also maintained, based on the interests and passions of students. Thus, in this process, teachers need to collaborate, facilitate and engage more with students.5.5.2. Competencies include explicit, measurable, transferable learning objectives that empower students10: In CBL, teachers develop their own lesson plans and assessment methods. This autonomy to teachers gives improved student outcomes. These are fine-tuned through frequent discussions and collaboration among school colleagues and internal processes. Transparency and explicity is maintained as students are aware of learning objectives and are able to describe their learning objectives. They are empowered to demonstrate learning, in their own way, when they 10 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED561280.pdfCompetencyworks, An International Study in Competency Education pp. 26-28 accessed on 22.11. 2019. Chapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies695.5.3. Assessment is meaningful and a positive learning experience for Students: 11: In CBL , assessment is an integral part of the cycle of learning . Emphasis is on F ormative assessments so that the teachers are able to identify and understand the hard spots or the areas of misconceptions on a concept to give feedback to students. With this, students develop an awareness of what they must know and be able to demonstrate through frequent performance assessments. If CBL is followed right from the beginning of schooling years, students develop the thinking skil l of being able to reflect upon their own knowledge and be active partners for performance reviews. This self-awareness results in students' understanding that assessment is an organic part of the learning process and also an integral part of learning. Personalization of Education. There is flexibil ity in time -table as students receive timely and differentiated instructional support and misconceptions are addressed quickly. F or example, when students don't complete a course, focus is directed upon the specifi c skills needed to be developed rather than taking the entire course again. This is in fact personalization ofeducation. This learnin g framework allows schools to provide differentiated academic support to learners. Daily and weekly check -ins with teachers is central to preparation of schedules . Rather than allow students to progress automatically with gaps in their learning, to fail whole courses, CBL classes are designed to provide additional support and interventions to bring students to consistent levels of learning. 5.5.4. Students develop and apply a broad set of skills and Dispositions: Students learn actively and are able to apply critical-thinking and problem- solving skills along with communication skills, collaborative skill s and cultural responsiveness . 5.5.5. Learning outcomes emphasize competencies of application and creation of knowledge, along with other necessary skills and behaviours: To enable stronger emphasis on the skills of application and creation in practical, hands - on contexts, the physical infrastructure of schools is made more flexible. 21st century skills are blended with subject specific knowledge for learning in a coordinated manner. 5.5.6. Holistic Approach: CBL is an integrative and holistic approach that incorporates interrelated concepts of inclusivity, integrative thinking and dealing with complexities. 11 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED561280.pd fCompetencyworks, An International Study in Competency Education pp. 26-28 accessed on 22.11. 2019.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals705.5.7. Sustainable Learning12: CBL ensures learning among the learners which enables him/he r to sustain after learning those skill sets or practices. The academic participation enables to create economic, social and environmental programs improving life standards, generating empowerment and respecting interdependence. F ew aspects involved in it are- learning to know Learning to do Learning to be Learning to live together 5.6. Competency VS Learning Objectives: Competency is the main ideas or skill- set that a student is expected to master Learning objectives are the specific abilities necessary to accomplish the competency. 5.6.1.

Implemetation of CBE: Details on operational part of Competency - Based Education (CBE) as well as guidelines to P rincipals are also necessary for taking necessary action on their part for facilitating seamless implementation. Thus, important Characteristics of Competency Based Education Model with reference to four pillars of education system are illustrated as hereunder for the principals and teachers: a.Objectives o To follow a more practical and professional approach where first of all predefined, real life based, application- oriented competencies are defined. o To ensure attainment of competencies through precise measurable learning outcomes in behavioural terms. o To go beyond mere accumulation of knowledge from textbooks and tests to enable students to practice acquired competencies in their daily life. b.Content o Competency based education focuses on minimum required core content. o It specifically defines competencies to be attained after a certain time interval in which a speci fic part of the curriculum has been covered. o It is contrary to traditional learning approach which keeps increasing the content by following the inconsistent principle ' greater the content, greater the achievementof students. c.Pedagogy o Pedagogical processes are child centric and inclusive in nature as the focus is on individual achievement. o Interdisciplinary Instruction (including scholastic as well as co - scholastic areas such as Arts, Story Telling, Sports, W ork Education and SEW A etc.), Collaborative Learning, Cooperative L earning, Reciprocal Teaching, Discussions, Group P rojects, P eer T utoring, Blended learning with integration of ICT (Flipped Classrooms), Computational learning based on logical reasoning , decomposition, patterns, Experiential L earning, Problem Based L earning, Games, Case Studies, Simulations, Portfolios, Presentations, P rojects are the main teaching -learning processes under this approach. o The idea is to support student 's ability to become an independent/ self-reliant and lifelong learner by using a variety of interactive methods. o Pedagogies also take care of individual differences of students, issues of social nature of learning and present challeng es in a graded manner to make learning child-centered. d.Assessment o Criterion reference assessments that measure the attai nment ofIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals72Learning Outcomes are essential feature of CBE. o It involves Objective as well as Performance Assessments. o Objective Assessment have predetermined, correct responses items like MCQs, oral responses to questions, and short -answer written responses based on what students know and know how to do. o In performance assessments, focus remains on what learners can do with their knowledge involving assessments of critical thinking, synthesis and affective and psychomotor skills. o Reporting of Assessment result is done on the basis of rubrics and students must be able to demonstrate required level of competency in order to progress to higher grades. 5.7.1. Some Points to Remember: As proper framing of the Learning Outcomes and linking them with pedagogical processes is crucial to the success of CBE , attention is drawn to the following concepts and suggestions: (A)Learning Outcomes (L Os) o These are formal statements that tell us what a student is able to do after learning a given topic/ concept. o The learning described in outcomes should encompass the essential and significant knowledge and skills studentsshould develop in a course. o In this process, they generalise their learning and integrate it with other areas of their lives outside school. This helps them learn concepts in a more focussed and meaningful way. o LO should be a clear and concise statement of the skills that the students will be able to demonstrate after the instruction is over. o LOs should be observable and measurable and clearly understood by all stakeholders - students, parents and teachers. o They delineate not only the cognitive achievement but also the values, life skills and attitudes students would demonstrate at the end of a unit. o Learning Outcomes provides opportunity for teachers to reflect on the curriculum, context of learning, content, application and assessment to be designed for ensuring the achievement of desirable degree of L earning Outcomes. o Thus, L Os are extremely important tool for students, teachers, parents, administrators and policy makers. o Teachers need to use learning outcomes as a tool for improving education, not as an end in itself . (B)W riting Learning Outcomes on the basis of the framework providedby NCERTChapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies73o A complete L earning Outcome will consist of: i. An observable behavior or an action verb and any special condition for displaying the outcome. Action verb denotes the intended domain in the taxonomy of cognitive domain and focuses on cognitive processes operating on different kinds of knowledge dimensions like factual, procedural, conceptual and meta-cognitive. ii. After the action verb comes subject content for which the action is being taken followed by explicit level of achievement (if not implicit) and condition of performance (if required). The performance level considered sufficient to demonstrate mastery . Simple rule of thumb for writing a Learning Outcome is an action verb/ phrase + object of the verb + clause/ phrase indicating level of achievement +context or conditions if any. Some examples of learning outcomes from different subjects are provided in the Annexure-A. o Test items prepared and matched to the L Os assembled before starting instructions.o LOs usually have the following features: i. unambiguous language ii. behavioural activity iii. measurable outcomes with desired performance criteria iv. linked to teaching and learning methods v. assessment and evaluation aligned with overall competencies mentioned in the framework developed by NCERT (C) NCERT Learn ing Outcomes Documents: o The L earning Outcomes Documents developed by NCERT define the learning outcomes/ competencies in all the curricular areas, linking them with the curricular expectations and the pedagogical processes. o The defined L earning Outcomes can easily be adopted or adapted by schools. In fact, CBSE very strongly advises the adoption/ adaptation of L earning Outcomes developed by NCERT for Grades 1 to 10, to all its affiliated schools. o The links for these L earning Outcomes Documents of NCERT are given below: Learning Outcomes at Elementary Stagehttp://www.ncert.nic.in/publication/Miscellaneous/pdf_ files/tilops101.pdf Learning Outcomes at Secondary Stage http://www.ncert.nic.in/departments/nie/dtee/activities/pdf/learning_outcomes.pdfIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals74(D) Suggestive Pedagogical Strategies for achievement of LOs o Knowledge of LOs paves way to self- assessment by students who would learn to compare their achievement against the stated outcomes instead of comparing them with their peers. o This would also help them to internalise the learning outcomes. o Therefore, teachers may: communicate the learning outcomes in as unambiguous way as possible to students at the start of a lesson; use LOs as Advance Organisers and ask students to paraphrase them in order to get complete understanding of their meaning; work out the instructional activities, pedagogies, and assessments most likely to ensure that the stated outcome of learning is achieved; plan lessons by selecting and arranging developmentally appropriate content and process while taking care of social and emotional contexts and varying learning styles, aptitudes, and abilities of students; (please see suggestive lesson plan in Annexure B) use techniques like collaborative learning, problem solving and others mentioned above under the characteristics of assessment, as well as connect the classroom, lab, and experiential activities to requirements of the desired level of learning the most important aspect of the whole learning process is that the learner at every level, for every subject, for every topic, should be able to connect all learnings to real-life practice; facilitate experiences that advance students' critical thinking and creativity; use technology to relate local and global societal issues and responsibilities with the curricular contexts; make use of resources available at DIKSHA Platform in this reference; and continuously improve professional capacity by researching and participating in various capacity building programmes. (E) Suggestive Assessment Practices to gauge achievement of LOs o Performance in CBE is always seen vis a vis given criterion or standard of performance. o It can be integrated with Assessment for Learning and Assessment as Learning. o Some of the features of assessment of LOs could be: Assessment must: be Authentic i.e. it requires application of knowledge and skills to real world problems and demands decision making to determine optimum use of knowledge and skills in a given situation;Chapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies75necessarily match with the Learning Outcomes cited in the beginning; be reliable, valid and based on critical and creative thinking; assess ability to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes. o A balance between assessment ' for', 'as' and 'of' learnin g should be maintained for optimum results and minimum stress on students; o Multiple methods of assessment like portfolios, presentations, group projects, open ended questions, MCQs, short answer and long answer problems, reflective assignments involving measurement of capacity to analyse and evaluate experience in the light of theories and research evidence; o Rubrics must be shared with students prior to the test. 5.8. Suggestive actions for Principals to ensure implementation of CBE in schools: o Must take a lead role in the development of annual pedagogical plans 2020-21 for the entire year for providing meaningful and joyful learning experiences to the students. Guidelines are given in circular Acad- 49/2019 dated 5 September 2019. o Must design the pedagogical plans in coherence with L Os and individual requirement of students while allowing appropriate level of autonomy to teacher.o Must include specif ic and measurable LOs in all the lesson plans prepared by teachers and ensure their optimum achievement. o Must integrate activities defined in the alternative academic calendars by NCERT in the lesson plans. Also ensure continuation of integration as and when NCERT releases more such calendars. o Download all CBSE Handbooks / Manuals from http://c bseacademic. nic.in/manual.html and arrange discussions among teachers and students. o Make earnest efforts to use resources other than textbooks. Hubs of learning can develop their own resources including mapping of L Os to the curriculum, low cost pedagogical activities and assessments. o Must make use of CBSE resources available at DIKSHA . Other initiatives of CBSE like weekly Critical and Creative T est which is also available at DIKSHA platform must be used and integrated with the teaching -learning process. o May consider mentioning performance in terms of competencies in report cards. o Must ensure accomplishment of required competencies / L Os by students by the end of the academic session, and supplementary remedial action to help non-achi evers to reach the desired minimum level. o May display posters of the 'Compact Learning Outcomes' for classes I to X in classrooms.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals76o May sensitize parents of all students on the various competencies that their child is expected to achieve at a given level / in a class, by calling special/ virtual Parent Teacher Meetings. o Must suitably integrate Art Education, Health and Physical Education, Life Skills Education and V alues Education and Inclusive elements as per the directions provided by CBSE in the curriculum documents for accomplishing the competencies given in the L earning Outcomes document of NCERT. o Must ensure planning of lessons by integrating Experiential L earning/ Art-Integrated/ Storytelling/Sport Integrated activities, as required, without any financial burden on students. (Refer to CBSE Handbooks as stated above). o Must ensure planning of lessons that have relevant subject -integration so that daily class load is 3-4 classes. The time allotted for transaction of each subject in the integrated lesson plan can be counted tow ards the total periods/time required for a subject in an academic session. o Post-COVID-19, as and when schools re-open (detailed guidelines on this will be issued), consider having flexible seating-arrangement in classrooms to facilitate experien tial learning activities. o Implement SEW A projects to ensure maximum student participation for real-life connect. o Scrupulously follow the directions of CBSE as stipulated in examination bye - laws, affiliation-byelaws and variousadvisories of CBSE issue d from time to time regarding compulsory training of teachers, activities to be undertaken, availability of facilities to students, safety, and special provisions for special children for ensuring holistic education of desirable quality in an equitable manner. 5.9. CBSE and CBE : Over the period of the last two academic sessions, the Board has already implemented all the above principles to transform education tow ards an outcomes - based approach and more competency - oriented, by initiating many measures. Some of them are highlighted below: 1.Competency -Based Education to be the Annual Theme of Training in 2020-21: In continuation of its training policy , the Board has decided to make Competency-Based Education as the annual theme of training in the session 2020-21. The Board will shortly come out with an online teacher training module on DIKSHA on CBE. 2.Implementation of Experiential Learning/ Active Experiential L earning /Active Learning/ Innovative P edagogies in all its schools. This has also been the annual theme of training in the session 2019-20. Further, the Board has released Handbook on Experiential Learning which is available at: http:// cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/ Manuals/ExperientialLearning.pdfChapter 5 : Focussing Upon the Competencies773.Creative and Critical Thinking Practice: Vide circular no. Acad-03/2020, dated 8 January 2020, the Board has started Creative and Critical Thinking (CCT) W eekly P ractice P rogramme to enhance critical thinking skills of the students. CCT items on Reading , Mathematics and Sci ence Literacy are uploaded on a weekly basis on DIKSHA for students of classes VII- X. New questions for CCT practice are uploaded every Monday and answers are shared by Thursday . The CCT questions and solutions can be accessed following URL: https://diksha.gov .in/resources/ play/collection/do_3129060885052 0473612338? contentT ype=TextBook. Given the success of this program, it will soon be extended to other grades.4.Strengthening Assessment Practices: The Board has introduced 20% Case Based Questions in class X and 10% Case Based Questions in class XII Board examinations in all subjects. These Case Based Questions are necessarily itemized with real-life connect for assessing competencies in each subject. F urther reforms are on the anvil and will be announced shortly. All above measures will reinforce each other if P rincipals assume P edagogical Leadership and ensure quality education through implementation of competency -based education focussing on attainment of L earning Outcomes by every learner , to the fullest extent possible. Competency-based learning is a relatively new approach to learning design which is proving increasingly popular with school going learners. When developed and implemented correctly, this can be a reliable, valid indicator of learning and proficiency in regard to designated competencies. Furthermore, it can provide a more learner-centred, personalized, and efficient way of learning and demonstrating proficiency. We, as Principals, must understand it thoroughly ourselve s first, and then introduce it in the school in a systematic fashionWE THE PRINCIPALS: PEDAGOGICAL PLANNINGCHAPTER-6 Chapter 6 : Pedagogical Planning79I find that the ultimate Guide for a School Educator is the National Curriculum Framework 2005. Before beginning to make a P edagogical Plan, I referred to it and found that aside from the framework it also tells us about the ways children learn and how to design a Learning Experience: 6.1. NCF on How Children Learn:- Children learn in a variety of ways, both individually and with others: o through experience, o making and doing things, o experimentation, o reading, o discussion, o asking, Idea of a joyful Tuesday from the eyes of a child.o listening, o thinking and reflecting, o expressing oneself in speech, o expressing oneself in movement, o expressing oneself in writing 6.2. NCF on Effective Learning Environment: Learning takes place both within school and outside school . L earning is enriched if the two arenas interact with each other. All children are naturally motivated to learn and are capable oflearning. Learning must be paced so that it allows learners to engage with concepts and deepen understanding , rather than remembe ring only to forget after examinations. Learning can take place with orwithout mediation . The social context and interactions provide avenues for learners to work at cognitive levelsIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals80above their own. At the same time learning must provide variety and challenge, and be interesting and engaging. Boredom is a sign that the task may have become mechanically repetitive for the child and of little cognitive value. Schools must provide opportunities to enquire, question, debate,reflect, and arrive at concepts orcreate new ideas. An element of challenge is critical for the process of active engagement and learning various concepts, skills and positions through the process.ask, to listen and to interact \u2014 are the key processes through which learning occurs. The context in which learning takes place is thus of direct cognitive significance. In the early primary school years, a beginning has been made in the area of group work. Projects and activities that can be carried out bygroups need to become a featureof learning in the middle and highschool also. There are ways in which such group learning can be assessed and evaluated. Schools could also consider giving mixed age groups of children projects to do together. Making meaning and developingthe capacity for abstract thinking,reflection and work are the mostimportant aspects of learning. We must ask ourselves why we only ask children to give answers to questions. Even the ability to make a set ofquestions for given answers is avalid test of learning. Art and work provide opportunitiesfor holistic learning that is rich in tacit and aesthetic components. 'Intelligent guessing' must beencouraged as a valid pedagogictool. Quite often, children have an idea arising from their everyday experiences or because of their exposure to the media, but they are not quite ready to articulate it in ways that a teacher might appreciate. Teaching something before thechild is cognitively ready takesaway from learning it at a later stage.ALL ABOARD: TEACHING-LEARNING SHOULD NEVER BE LIKE THIS: Learning takes place through interactions with the environmentaround, nature, things and people,both through actions and throughlanguage . The physical activity of moving, exploring and doing things, on one's own, with one's peers or in the company of adults, and using language \u2014 to read, to express or Chapter 6 : Pedagogical Planning81Tasks that are too easy or too difficult, that are repetitive andmechanical, that are based onrecalling the text, that do not permitself-expression and questioning by the child and that depend solely on the teacher for correcti on, make the child assume the passive stance of obedience. Learners learn not to value theirown ability to think and reason,that knowledge is created by othersand that they must only receive it. By the time they reach Class VII, many children who have grown up in this kind of learning envir onment, lose their self- confidence and their ability to express themselves or make meaning out of their experiences in school. Instead of a culture of quizzing,of answering quickly and alwaysknowing the right answers, weneed to allow learners to spendtime on deeper, meaningfullearning. We are now seeing a small shift away from the focus on ' factual knowledge', but teacher preparation, planning of classroom practice, textbookpreparation, and evaluation needto support this shift more decisively. For this, it is necessary to build thecapabilities and confidence of teachers to auto nomously plan their teaching in response to the needs and demands of children's learning. 6.4. Pedagogical Plans: Vide circular Acad. 15/2019 dated 9th March 2019, CBSE has issued guidelines related to P edagogical Plans. Do go through them. The Board envisions that each teacher must have the capacity to make her/ his own lesson plan for each lesson to be taught by her.ALL ABOARD: We Certainly Don't Want This:6.3. Designing Learning Experiences: FOR US: Keeping all above in mind, we must make the Pedagogical Plans for our schools. In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals82 These lesson plans must be innovative, based on experiential learning13 and preferably integrate art14 in the pedagogy. Single lesson plans can then be combined into an annual pedagogical plan of the teacher. This plan must give equal importance to the scholastic and co-scholastic areas. Pedagogical plans are VISION to ACTION plans. For the teachers, a Pedagogical Plan means converting his/her vision of the teaching-learning process in his/ her classroom to action. Pedagogical Plans imbibe all thinking, preparation and steps of execution involved in making each stage of curriculum transaction (setting learning objectives, preparing lesson plans, transaction, assessment, identifying outcomes of learning of each student through assessment) meaningful and comprehensible for students. These plans are the systematic plans prepared by a teacher for fruitfully engaging students in the classroom WE THE PRINCIPALS: It is our task to combine all annual pedagogical plans of all teachers of all grades and subjects of the school into an Annual Pedagogical Plan of the school. and outside the classroom for scholastic and co-scholastic areas of the curriculum. It can be in the form of a weekly flow, monthly flow chart or annual flow chart. 6.5. Planning a Pedagogical Plan: 13 Please see examples of innovative and experiential learning based lesson plans in the Experiential learning Handbook of the Board 14 Please see examples of innovative and art integrated lesson plans in the Integration of Art in Education Guidelines of the BoardESSENTIAL BEFORE TEACHING PRE-PLANNING Plan with students and not with content in mind Use a predictable lesson structure Listen to student thinking Keep the body of the lesson focused on open ended topics Keep track of the objectives of the lesson Plan so that students do most of talking and discussing, are able to work independently, get opportunities to interact with each other, and undertake self and peer assessment Chapter 6 : Pedagogical Planning83STUDENT THINKING LESSON STRUCTURE Learning to go beyond memorizing content Giving students the opportunities for sharing their thinking Monitoring student thinking- through discussions, portfolios, journal entries, retelling, responses to literature, answer to interview questions and self-reflection questionnaires Starting and ending your lessons a certain way helps students become comfortable as they know what to expect Providing time for independent or group work keeps students engaged Create space for students to reflect on their academic work and social interaction Minimize distractions and interruptions Keep lessons focused on student thinkingIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals84FOCUS ON OPEN ENDED TOPICS AND ATTAINING THE OBJECTIVE OF LESSONFACILITATION TECHNIQUES TO PROBE THINKING Rather than egging students towards one right answer or memorizing facts, students should be given opportunities to engage, debate, interpret, disagree Rigorous thinking, creativity and risk taking to be encouraged Stay focused on the objective of the lesson - do not get waylaid sometimes in what we may feel are teachable moments Pace the lesson and ensure necessary content is taught and avoid extraneous details The way a teacher facilitates student talk determines success of lesson Use language that supports and fosters student thinking Asking specific as well as open ended questions- How is Sara feeling at this point? How can you say that? Does anyone have any other thought? Use cooperative structures like think pair share Listen to and value student thinkingChapter 6 : Pedagogical Planning85PREPARATION FOR WORK STUDY TRY OUTS Introduction of the day's objective Connecting old to new Instruction and review of necessary skills Construction and review of background knowledge Preparation for working together First have students try the strategy in groups just after direct teaching- example how to predict or draw inferences (finding clues) Try outs- reading a draft and using sticky notes to insert details Teachers can move around to see how the students are progressing and help struggling writersIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals86INDEPENDENT WORK TIME REFLECTING AND TRANSITION Very important if we want our students to become proficient Characteristics of independent work- Student work independently Expected behavior spelt out time set locations shared, consistent language Teacher actively conferring with student Room organized for independent work Reflecting about what they have to do, share with a partner before moving to independent work Putting it all together ReflectingChapter 6 : Pedagogical Planning87LESSON FACILITATIONVALUING MOMENTS WHEN STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ANSWERS Key to a good lesson- Taking a stance- should encourage diverse participation and make student responsible and make students responsible for their own thinking Embracing situations when students do not know the 'right' answer Being a good listener Asking open ended questions Probing student thinking- What in the text made you think that? Using positive language to encourage students thinking and behavior Help students through challenging moments as they try to make sense of the content; hear diversity of opinions, build consensus, helping students to disagree respectfully; be careful not to sway student's opinion Encourage students to find answers; it is not about right answer but the ability to use imagination to see patterns and link concepts, foster investigation and inquiry, encourage wonder and out of the box thinking, build persistenceIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals88MORE IDEAS Using wait time wisely -give students opportunity to mull over a question/idea Connecting students thinking - using discussions prompts, I agree, in addition to--, I can't believe Using cooperative structures- Turn to your partner, Think pair share Using non- judgmental responses Building a class community- a context for taking risks THUS, A PEDAGOGICAL SUB-PLAN FOR TRANSACTING ONE COMPETENCY WOULD BRIEFLY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS: My Pedagogical PlanCompetency to be focussed on Identifying how this competency Resources required teaching- Challenges to be addressedLesson Plan with Innovative Pedagogy to meet the goalrelates to other disciplines and to real life learning and for measuring the learning outcome MAKING SCHOOLS INCLUSIVECHAPTER-7 In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals90CBSE is perhaps the first board that has framed a holistic policy for all categories of Children with Special Needs during conduct of board exams. The board has also included provisions in its Affiliation Byelaws and circulars for ensuring inclusive schools. As a Principal, it is our duty to implement these policies to make our schools inclusive. I present before you the following suggestive techniques to make your school an Inclusive School: Integration in Vision and Mission Orientation with all and of all Continuous Teacher Training Modifications in Curriculum, Methodology and Assessment Behaviour Modification High Five Strategies Accommodations in Classroom, subject enrichment program.Shadow Teacher Parent as partner Role of Professionals Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive91An inclusive school must include integration in its vision and mission. The Right for Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 also states15 : all educational institutions provide inclusive education to the children with disabilities and towards that end shall (i) admit them without discrimination and provide education and opportunities for sports and recreation activities equally with others; ________________________________ (ii) make building, campus and various facilities accessible; ________________________________ (iii) provide reasonable accommodation according to the individual's requirements; ________________________________ (iv) provide necessary support individualised or otherwise in environments that maximise academic and social development consistent with the goal of full inclusion; ________________________________ (v) ensure that the education to persons who are blind or deaf or both is imparted in the most appropriate languages and modes and means of communication; ________________________________ (vi) detect specific learning disabilities in children at the earliest and take suitable pedagogical and other measures to overcome them; ________________________________ (vii) monitor participation, progress in terms of attainment levels and completion of education in respect of every student with disability; ________________________________ (viii) provide transportation facilities to the children with disabilities and also the attendant of the children with disabilities having high support needs. ________________________________ 7.2. Orientation, Interaction & liaising with all Stakeholders: 7.2.1. Involving parents, teachers and stake holders and the community is an important principle of quality, both in and out of the classroom. It is even more relevant in the case of inclusive education, which is much broader than formal education and should not only take place within the four walls of a classroom. Parents' collaboration with teachers and school is not only beneficial for children; there are also possible gains for all parties. It enhances: constructive and extended Parental interaction with children7.1. Integration in vision and mission of the school: 15 https://indiacode.nic.in/show-data?actid=AC_CEN_25_54_00002_201649_1517807 328299&sectionId=12077&sectionno=16&orderno=16#12077 accessed on 11.05.2020In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals92 responsiveness and sensitivity to their needs Regular interaction of parents help teacher in knowing about minutest detail of child with respect to special needs. Acquisition of a better understanding of family culture 7.3. Empowering Teachers: Role of In-service Teacher training programme is mandatory to create a community conducive to helping all students meet academic and behavioral goals. Ongoing and Effective communication is essential for locating individuals, services and materials to best support all your students Some key planning and teaching strategies can make a dramatic difference in reaching students with diverse abilities and skills. 7.3.1. Some strategies and techniques for Principals for Inclusion are: Increase Awareness and Attitudinal Change through advocacy Create a Future with Trained Professionals: Pre-Service Training programs to help ensure that future generations of teachers enter the profession with the skills and knowledge to work in an inclusive environment, Build on Existing Human Resources: In-Service Training and Professional Development Organizing training workshops for educators and key community members on general inclusive education techniques, especially those which highlight how such techniques can benefit all children by improving overall quality of teaching. 7.3.2. Suggestive Checklist for Inclusive 2 *LEVEL 1 1Teachers attend workshops or class on developing an inclusive classroom and social, receiving advanced professional training on regular basis. 2Teacher receive on-going support for improving their understanding to accommodate subject curriculum for educational needs of children with special needs Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive933General teacher and special educators and other related professional working together to support inclusive classroom practices in school 4Learning form diversified sources, learning while sharing, exploring, exchanging, school visits 5Teachers are encouraged to prepare case studies of students 6Teachers are given opportunity to visits inclusive schools with best practices 7Teachers are encouraged to enroll in online and distance education programmes on inclusive schooling 8Teachers are encouraged to take up research and development in assessment, learning and performance of children with special needs and link to the quality initiative in school education * Level 1 - Never Level 2 - Sometimes Level 3 - Mostly/Always In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals947.4. Modification in Curriculum Planning, Teaching Methodology & Assessment: 7.4.1. Curriculum Planning: In continuation with the process of initiating inclusion of students with special needs in the general education classroom, educators are constantly looking forward to provide/ providing varied experiences for optimal learning. . Although there are proven benefits of inclusion, traditional curricula and instructional techniques are not always sufficient for students with cognitive, emotional or physical disabilities. 7.4.1.1. Indicators: S.NO INDICATORS *LEVEL 1 *LEVEL 2 *LEVEL 3 1Inclusive committee uses the prescribed curriculum of the board with flexibility for adjustment in curriculum to meet the educational needs of children with special needs as specified by the board. 2Inclusion committee ensures access to curriculum by modifying curriculum goals and classroom instruction using the age appropriate material for assignments, homework and tests. 3Inclusion committee ensures required adjustment and/or adaptation in the curriculum to meet the educational needs of children with special needs * Level 1 - Never Level 2 - Sometimes Level 3 - Mostly/Always Here the facilitators' implements/ implementation of differentiated instruction techniques, using adaptive technologies, changing the student's physical environment, and integrating culturally responsive language and content into curriculum are all examples of curriculum enhancement.Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive957.4.2. Teaching Methodology: Experiential Learning: Students are actively engaged in learning 7.4.2.1. Classroom Practices & Instructional Practices16: Teacher must establish prior knowledge of student Facilitator must proceed from the simple to complex by breaking up the learning into its parts. Use a step-by-step approach , teaching in small bits, with much practice and repetition. Reinforcement of abstract concepts with concrete, for example using real apple instead of showing apple card . Relate learning to children's lives using interest inventories . Using sensory elements: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic ones, like writing numbers in sand trays or creating foam cut-outs for numbers & alphabets Provide opportunities for success to build self-esteem . Concentrate on individual children , not syndromes. Give positives before negatives. Vary types of instruction and assessment, with multiple intelligences and cooperative learning. Establish a supportive, respectful classroom environment that 16 www.teachhub.com In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals96encourages students to ask questions and become actively involved in their learning. Increase students' self-awareness of levels and progress. Remember the basics such as teaching student's proper hygiene, social skills, respecting others, effectively listening, or reading directions on a worksheet, in addition to the 3R's: Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic. Effectively communicate and collaborate with families, students and colleagues. Have faith & high expectations of all children focusing on their strength & abilities rather than on their disabilities 7.4.3. Behaviour Modification: When students with special needs exhibit inappropriate and belligerent behaviour, classroom activities can become stressful and uncivilized, leading to frustration and anxiety for everyone involved. In order for every child to have the opportunity to grow and learn in a healthy academic environment, teachers and administrators must use disciplinary actions and behaviour modification strategies to ensure the safety and productivity of their classrooms. 7.4.3.1. Managing Commonly observed behaviour Problems: BEHAVIOUR SUGGESTED STRATEGIES Inability in Comprehending a plan (has high expectation but lacks plan of action); sets out to \"get straight 'As', ends up with \"Fs\" (sets unrealistic goals). Assist the student in framing long-term goals & break the goal into obtainable parts. Appropriate question should be asked to know whether the student would be able to do the task & how? Frequently taking feedback to know whether the student has achieved the set goal. Appropriate Time scheduling has been done to complete each step to reach the desired goal. Unable to sequence and complete the steps to accomplish the required task. Simplifying task into achievable steps. Give examples and Strategies to accomplish task. Moving ahead without completing the previous task. Outlining the requirements of a completed activity (e.g. complete one task and Move on to the other). Difficulty in comprehending instructions from others. Channeling the attention of students before giving Instructions. Cues can be used by combining verbal and written directions. Give one instruction at a time followed by reinforcement. Recapitulation activity should be done.Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive97Progressing from Simple to Complex. Assignments and activities should be prioritized in terms of difficulty level suitable examples should be given for students reference. Difficulty in maintaining consistency and accuracy over time. Providing short assignment and maintaining quality. Frequent positive reinforcements should be given to the students. Difficulty in assignments completing. Time bound short assignment should be given. Monitoring of work/assignment completion. Appointing a \"peer buddy\" for assistance. Problem in retention Provide study strategies (PQRST, mnemonics, skimming, visualization) for better retention. Combine visual, auditory, textual and kinesthetic cues to strengthen the memory. Difficulty in assessment. Extra time should be provided with the provision of oral/ online assessment. The format should be child - friendly, uncluttered and direct with working space for student's response. Confusion from non-verbal cues (misreads body language, etc.) Directly teach (tell the student) what non-verbal cues mean? Model and have student practice reading cues in a safe setting. Confusion from written material (difficulty finding main idea from a paragraph; attributes greater importance to minor details). Provide students with a copy of reading material with main ideas underlined or highlighted. Provide an outline of important points from reading material. Teach outlining, main-idea / details concepts. Difficulty sustaining attention to tasks or other activities (easily distracted by extraneous stimuli). Reward attention. Break up activities into small units? Reward for timely accomplishment.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals987.5. Different ways of Assessment: A facilitator can assess students in different ways Visually and Low vision child Teacher can assess the child by giving a large font paper. Distraction free seating and proper lightning Oral responses Recorded assessment Using scribe Hearing impaired Limited questions to answer Use of communication boards Encourage sign language Online exams Continuous assessment (through activities, sheets etc) Specific Learning disability Mark for content not for spelling Use of graphic organizers Labeling of diagrams instead of drawing MCQ's Option based questions 7.6. High Five Learning Strategy : The above learning activities generate interest and provide variety of avenues through which a teaching learning process can be implemented for diverse learners. Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive997.6.1. Sports and Children with Special Needs: Exercise and sports benefit all children as it provides energy channelization and release of happy hormones which keep them healthy and fit.Sports can help in building self-confidence, improving interpersonal skill and team spirit. It also helps in weight management, which is a common problem among today's kids.

Story telling using puppets will be more interesting and Interactive: https://youtu.be/tjm_caPOfbU (Story telling with puppets) 7.6.4. Role of Music: 7.6.5. Role of Dramatics17: Drama is often about collaboration and negotiation, and when it is used in mixed- ability groups it can act as a bridge between children with special needs and others in their peer group. It can enable students with particular difficulties, and provides an ideal environment to encourage students to work together and to develop trust and friendships. 17 https://www.artsonthemove.co.uk/education/drama-and-students-with-special-needs. php accessed on 16.05.2020Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive1017.7. Accommodation in classroom, playground, Subject Enrichment Program: Case Study (Accommodations and Modifications)18 Vivek is an 8th grade student who has learning disabilities in reading and writing. He is in a regular 8th grade class that is team-taught by a general education teacher and a special education teacher. Modifications and accommodations provided for Vivek's daily school routine include the following: Vivek will have shorter reading and writing assignments. His textbooks will be based upon the 8th grade curriculum but at his independent reading level (4th grade). He will have test questions read/explained to him, when he asks. He will give his answers to essay-type questions by speaking, rather than writing them down. Modifications or accommodations are most often made in the following areas: Scheduling. For example, giving the student extra time to complete assignments or tests breaking up testing over several days Setting. For example, working in a small group working one-on-one with the teacher jump two laps instead of 4 in playground Materials. For example, providing audio taped lectures or books giving copies of teacher's lecture notes using large print books, Braille, or books on CD (digital text) Instruction. For example, reducing the difficulty of assignments reducing the reading level using a student/peer tutor Student Response. For example, allowing answers to be given orally or dictated using a word processor for written work Using sign language, a communication device, Braille, or native language if it is not English. 18 Developing Your Child's IEP, https://www.parentcenterhub.org/pa12/ accessed on 16.05.2020In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals1027.7.1. Room Accommodations: Special chairs or cushions, lower or high table or chair, tilted, desk top Different or additional lighting (not fluorescent), sitting by a window for natural light Sitting close to the blackboard or teacher, sitting away from others Stand instead of sitting or sitting instead of standing Picture schedules, visual cues or visual timer Quiet times or places to help concentration Colour coding Visual organization of the room and supplies Keeping materials for student and handing out as needed Have at least part of the room bear with nothing on walls ceilings or floors 7.7.2. Teacher Accommodations: Don't wear cologne (hard on allergies) Don't wear a lot of jewellery (distracts kids with ADHD) Count to 10 before letting anyone answer questions (processing time) Vary teaching methods Projects for extra credit or in place of timed tests Giving instructions one step at a time instead of all at once Ask questions to get repeat of information Divide the class (small groups, peer partners, peer tutors) Set up lessons (community instruction, role playing activities) Change the learning goals (more time, cooperate, share) Create alternative activity (learning centre, research teams) 7.8. A Shadow Teacher : fortifying lives from behind: A shadow teacher is to support the student who needs Optimal Learning, OL, and support, in his /her school academics The teacher fills in the gaps in the learning process, to help the student build self-confidence as well as to promote positive interaction in the classroom. The teacher helps the student focus on important concepts and support in every possible way to develop academic and social skills. 7.8.1. The student benefits from the shadow teacher because .... The student follows regular classroom instruction and interaction with his/her peers. They learn to build on his/her strengths and not his/her weaknesses. The student receives required educational enrichment.Chapter 7 : Making Schools Inclusive103The school benefits by the shadow teacher because there is a collaborative effort to meet the special needs of the particular student. The parents benefit because they have daily communication with an adult who knows what is going on in school and what events are taking place.

There are several best and innovative practices already existing within the affiliated schools of CBSE and the board wishes schools to learn from each other and partner with each other to augment their self-improvement. WE THE PRINCIPALS: CBSE wishes schools to learn from each other and partner each other for their growth through self-improvement. With this aim in mind, Hubs of Learning have been formed. 8.1. What are Hubs of Learning? The Board has taken up several initiatives that impact positively on the quality of education. One such measure is the creation of Hubs of Learning notified vide Circular No. Aff-12 dated March 9, 2019 . It is a part of the policy of the board to share, co-operate and learn from each other by forming a small cluster of schools into Hubs of Learning - for collaboration among schools for quality enhancement . Hubs of Learning have been formed as clusters of 4-6 neighborhood schools each, for the purpose of collaborative growth, promoting self-improvement and for ensuring the enhancement of the quality of education. 8.2. Mission of Hubs: To create an environment of collaboration for learning guided by 21st Century Skills 8.3. What is the need for collaboration through Hubs? This collaborative partnership between schools is needed to create an ecosystem for the schools to take up effective all round self-improvement. This collaboration will allow not only sharing of best practices, but also the possibility of adaptation or even replication of these practices. It is expected that school leadership would assume greater responsibility towards improving the quality of their schools and also extend their support to neighbourhood schools. All schools in a given group are expected to be \"givers\" as well as \"receivers\" of support, fresh ideas, resources, opportunities for student learning, opportunities for teacher learning, other joint activities, etc. The Board is of the view that there is as much to learn from a small school with fewer resources as from a large school with several resources.Chapter 8 : Collaboration Counts: Hubs of Learning1078.4. Need for Hubs of Learning: In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals1088.5. Objectives of Hubs: 8.6. Hubs of Learning viz-a-viz Sahodayas: Though the Hubs and Sahodaya may like to work in harmony with each other for defined activities for a defined period, it may be noted that the Hubs of Learning are in no way co-terminus with, or an extension of Sahodaya. Therefore, Sahodaya groups cannot give directions to these hubs or join them. Further, it must be understood that unlike Sahodaya which is a voluntary effort, the Hubs of Learning are mandated by the Board. The linking of schools into Hubs of Learning would provide a common and shared platform with the objectives to: 1. Create a culture of support and healthy interdependence across different areas of teaching learning viz. curriculum planning, teaching-learning activities and other school practices. 2. Promote solidarity by facilitating joint conduct of various student/staff activities culminating in an enriched school life. 4. Enable sharing of resources: manpower, infrastructure, teaching- learning material etc.3. Provide an opportunity to share a repertoire of ideas, instructional and assessment strategies which would help individual teachers to improve classroom practices and contribute to their continuous professional developmentObjectives of Hubs of LearningChapter 8 : Collaboration Counts: Hubs of Learning1098.7. If you are a Lead Collaborator: 8.8. As a Hub Member, you will: From among the schools participating in a HoL, one school shall be nominated as Lead Collaborator School by the Board on the basis of Board results and other criteria, such as, pupil teacher ratio, innovative practices in the school, etc. You will: 4 get all the schools of its HoL on board; ensure that all schools devise their own systems for quality enhancement and self-improvement. 4 function as such for a maximum period of two years. 4 take up all mentioned activities but at their own pace (depending on their capacity and ability). 4 provide handholding support to all schools in its Hub to ensure the implementation of safety guidelines as laid down in CBSE Affiliation Byelaws. 4 Share information and expertise, observations and reflections on areas such as: annual pedagogical plans curriculum plans and transaction strategies, learning outcomes, innovative pedagogy, etc. that would encourage the adoption of best practices. 4 Make efforts for co-planning of curriculum transaction and if required, and feasible, even co- teaching in areas of difficulty. 4 Organize various activities together, such as: quizzes, project demonstrations, art exhibitions, and other co-curricular and extra- curricular activities as mutually decided 4 Cooperate with each other in the area of educational and school related needs of Children with Special Needs. 4 Help each other in the creation of new knowledge and designing novel pedagogical strategies to provide holistic education. 4 Add to each other's organizational and administrative skills. 4 Share / exchange resources: manpower, infrastructure etc., as far as possible. 4 Ensure Digital collaboration - share e-content and other digital resources, learn from each other's digital tools for better teaching and learning and even administrative practises.In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals1104 Collaborate in teaching and learning of Skill Courses viz. tying up jointly with industry, etc. 4 Support each other in professional development by exchanging or participating in each other's in- service training programs, and sharing information related to this. (Training of all school teachers has been made mandatory in Affiliation Byelaw, 2018, by providing for minimum number of days of training per year. Training is to be conducted preferably in association with the COEs of the Board or through any Teacher's training institute recognized by the Centre/UT/State/ Regional Teachers Training Institutions. 4 Promote academic enrichment through teacher exchange programmes, common science fairs, joint seminars, workshops, trainings, exchange of ideas, instructional strategies and assessment procedure. 4 create a Sense of Community to overcome Isolation by: Making conscious and dedicated efforts to forge partnerships with each other to give and receive support. Disregarding the notions of hierarchy and learn to work together. Celebrating success and analyzing failure collectively to gain insights. engage in Systemic Reforms including mutually beneficial professional learning that has the power to facilitate systemic changes in school processes and culture. 8.9. How to know your Hub? All CBSE affiliated schools have been grouped in Hubs of Learning. Schools can go to the following link to track their Hub: http://59.179.16.89/cbse/2019/mm/ Login.aspx WE THE PRINCIPALS: AS HUBS MEMBERS Hubs have been made for collective growth of all CBSE affiliated schools and are NOT to be taken or canvassed as a level of superiority or power by the Lead Collaborator schools. Each member of the Hub is important and all members of the Hub are equal. Participation of all schools of the Hub must be ensured. Regular interaction among the Hub Schools must be done. Each school must get an opportunity to conduct the activities. It must be noted that the activities can be taken up even in the minimum of resources available. Maximum utilization of readily available resources should be done without posing any financial burden on any school.Chapter 8 : Collaboration Counts: Hubs of Learning111A committee is to be formed in each school comprising Principal and other teachers who can help in the activities of the Hub. The Principal can either nominate such teachers or also ask the teachers to volunteer for the activities of the Hub. Each school must identify and decide its priorities for self-improvement, and the areas of concern, discussing in detail with 8.10. How to inject energy for this initiative in your school? 8.10.1. At your Schools: A. Constitute a SCHOOL HUB COMMITTEE: B. Decide Self-Improvement Priorities: all teachers and SMCs. Accordingly, it can further put its requirement before the Hub. 8.10.2. At the Hub Level: A. THE FIRST MEETING: B. THEN:4 LEAD COLLABORATOR SCHOOL will call for the first meeting. It will inform each school to bring its own annual calendar and the list of self-improvement priorities. 4 The Best Practices of each school can also be shared in this meeting. The concerned school can present the same in the Hub meeting and also circulate its documentation amongst the Hub schools. 4 The common time/dates where various activities related to the Hub of schools can be conducted can/could be identified. In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals112C. NEXT: ANNUAL HUB CALENDAR WILL BE PREPARED: 4 Accordingly, the details of the Annual Calendar of possible activities in the Hub can be discussed and outlined, taking care of the requirement of each school. 4 The Hub calendar shall ideally contain : list of activities ALONG WITH THE CALENDAR, THE FOLLOWING CAN BE SHARED THROUGH E-MAIL: what is hoped to be achieved through the activity or the expected outcomes list of persons responsible for the activities and timelines of the activity how the activity will be executed in the hub. rubrics for assessing the activity for whether the expected outcomes have been achieved. likely challenges and possible solutions to those challenges. D. THEREAFTER: 4 The overall Hub calendar can be shared on a common social media Platform or a Hub School Website or through emails. Magazine, Blogs - managed by Lead School - if deemed fit; can also be used for this. 4 Subsequent meetings can be in any school as maybe decided jointly. 4 Hubs should make it a practice to visit all schools in the Hub through these meetings. E. HOW MANY MEETINGS OF A HUB? 4 It is desirable that the Hub meets once every month. The meeting can also be virtual through Skype, etc. if the schools of the Hub are not located in the same city or are remotely located from each other. 4 Wherever joint activities are possible (such as Teacher Trainings, Art exhibitions, pedagogical planning, etc.) there the number of meetings may accordingly be increased. The venue of joint activities too shall be jointly decided. Chapter 8 : Collaboration Counts: Hubs of Learning113G. DOCUMENTATION: HOW AND WHY? HOW? WHY? 4 It is advisable to maintain brief minutes of all meetings and activities of the Hub, as it will help in measuring the improvements in Hub schools. 4 The progress in each area of Hub activity by each school must be jointly monitored and analysed by the entire Hub. The Hub could think of developing their own set of rubrics for monitoring progress in each activity. The Board may ask for list of activities undertaken and achievements, if any, by schools, at the time of registration of the school's candidates for Board examinations. At the time of school inspection for Extension or Upgradation, the aforementioned record will also be checked to ascertain the genuine efforts made by the schools for self- improvement. This will be done with the objective to facilitate reflection and help set goals.

Nk=ko`fRr CBSE Scholarship P ortal for application to finalisation of candidates for various scholarship schemes of CBSE/ Govt. of India.CBSE School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA) Please refer to the latest circulars on www.cbse.gov.in & www.cbseacdemic.nic.in CHAPTER-12 Chapter 12 : CBSE School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA)15312.1. Introduction: CBSE has developed a framework 'School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA)' which lays down a set of standards and best practices as paradigms for attaining the benchmark in an individual institution for the upliftment of learning outcomes in the domain of school education imparted to children. The main purpose of SQAA is enhancement of quality , recognition of excellence, promotion of accountability , and benchmarking schools across a range of descriptors or indicators of assessment. The School Quality Assurance Assessment (SQAA) is easily implem entable, feasible, transparent, objective, and carries with it a measure of credibility and acceptability. Assessment of a school is intended to be a means to document the strengths and weaknesses of its educational practices and institutional effectiv eness leading them to desired objectives. This will help them to cle arly visualize their unique features and make them aware of what could be improved further . It would help teachers, educational administrators and all other stakeholders involved in school education to learn from this exercise and improve themselves. 12.2. Vision of SQAA: CBSE SQAA aspires to provide quality education to students through standardized instruments and processes of self-evaluation and external assessment benchmarks in the concept, establishment and running of effective systems within an institution in accordance with changing socio-economic and cultural contexts.12.3. Benefits of SQAA: SQAA empowers and enables schools to self-assess their performance in different domains by providing them guidelines, tools and instruments to achieve a self- set target and goal thus helping to move further on developmental continuum. It would reassure stakeholders such as employees, professional bodies, general public that the school aspires for continual improvement and thus will benefit the student learning outcomes. SQAA will help a school to: assess how well it is doing in different areas of school functioning review its ongoing process of improvement of the institution use the feedback to plan for the future. 12.4. Eligibility for SQAA Process: Each school affiliated to the Board must undergo the process of SQAA and update its information online on the eight domains once every three years, starting from the year, 2020. 12.5. Framework of SQAA: Since quality is a complex issue in education and should be seen in a holistic manner so CBSE School Quality Assessment and Assurance is holistic and it covers all aspects of sch ool functioning , namely Scholastic Processes, Co-Scholastic Processes, Infrastructure, Human Resources, Inclusive Practices, Management and Governance, Leadership and Beneficiary Satisfaction . These eight domains carry different weightage and are further divided into sub domains which qualify the various aspects of that particular domain. In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals154 Domains of School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA) 12.6. Process of School Quality Assessment and Assurance: At the introductory level, CBSE is only focusing on Phase 1 of SQAA i.e. Self-Assessment for quality improvement of its affiliated schoolsThe process of School Quality Assessment and Assurance involves two essential phase s: Phase 1: Self-Assessment using different instruments of SQAA Phase 2: Validation by External Peer Assessor Team by vising the Assesse School Phase 1Self-Assessment Ideal State: Outcome to be uploaded on CBSE P ortal every year by the school Mandatory: Outcome to be uploaded on the CBSE Portal once in every three years Phase 2Validation by External Peer Assessor Team On demand by school On random basis by the Board May be done by members of Hubs of Learning for each otherChapter 12 : CBSE School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA)15512.7. Self-Assessment: The school conducts sel f-assessment using the SQAAF . The schools may make use of other SQAA instruments for self-review . This step is the most important part of the entire SQAA process; both in terms of commitment of time and effort involved and on the basis of value to be derived. The process of self- assessment includes collecting data on various indicators laid down in SQAA . It should be prepared through a collaborative and participative approach and build ownership of all stakeholders towards the goal of institutional excellence. Once self- assessment is done, it is also expected of the schools that they prepare a self- improvement plan and act accordingly . The plan may be aligned to the performance indicators/standards as detailed in the SQAA framework. The preparation of plan is a must in order to complete the cycle of self-assessment. Otherwise the complete purpose of self-assessme nt will be defeated. Core Learning Team School self-assessment and school improvement planning is a continuous process. It is very important the school leaders (management and principal) involve the school staff and stakeholders in these processes. The schools may set up a Core Learning T eam (School Quality Assessment and Assu rance Committee) which will conduct the self-assessment of the school on the eight domains and will also coordinate with the P eer Assessor Team through the entire process of External Evaluation. The following may be the members of this Core Learning Team: Member Representative of School ManagmentPrincipalOne teacher from each level - primary, middle, secondary, sr. secondary One student from each level - primary, middle, secondary, sr. secondary Two Parent Members of PTAOne teacher from co-curricular domainOne Counsellor, Special Educator/ Health ProfessionalOne representative from Administration Support and Mentoring Support and mentoring may be provided either by L ead Collaborators of Hubs of Learning and/or by a neighborhood school that has exhibited high standards of quality assurance. CBSE will also be available for any support and assistance required in terms of organizing Capacity Building Programmes as per the need of the school. 12.8. Domains and sub domains of SQAA : All the eight domains are further subdivided into sub -domains and sub -sub-domains, which qualify the various aspects of that particular domain. Each sub domain has 4 statements under which benchmarks have been developed with a weightage between 1-4. These benchm arking statementsIn Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals156provide a clarity regarding the practices related to each sub-sub domain. Although it is expected that each school meets the best practices as depicted in these benchmarking statements, not all statements will apply to or be appropriate for each school. Each school will mark against the statement that is applicable and appropriate for the school. This will help the school to aspire for the next level. The first statement under each sub-sub domain depicts the best practice(s) carrying a weightage of 4. In order to get a score of 4, the other three statements must stand true/appropriate for the school. The benchmarking statements have been given in CHAPTER 3 of SQAA Manual available at the http://cbseacademic.nic. in/web_material/Manuals/SQAA_FINAL. pdf Description of the Level of the Score per sub-sub domain There are four levels of performance of 'Dynamic-Evolving', 'Stable', 'Transient' and 'Inceptive' for rating school processes. The school can refer the following criteria to know where it stands in terms of developmental stage, and formulate appropriate and achievable plans for self- improvement and enhance accountability. Score Maturity Level Guidance 4Dynamic- Evolving Demonstrates strong benchmarked defined and documented processes. Governance and leadership exhibits accountability, responsibility, self-evaluation and improvement planning. 3Stable Evidences of data based improvement processes. System is defined and documented. People are aware of their roles in the institution and practicing it. Practices are preventive and corrective in nature. 2Transient System is in early constructive years. Practices are generally corrective in nature. 1Inceptive System is at initial stage. Practices are individual based. Note: If none of the above are true then no score need be given against the concerned sub- sub-domain.Chapter 12 : CBSE School Quality Assessment and Assurance (SQAA)157Explanatory Chart of Domain/Sub-domain/Sub-sub domain In Pursuit of Excellence : A Handbook for Principals158The CBSE SQAA is an affirmation of 'Quality'. It is a means of demonstrating confidence in the schools' purpose and performance. The goals are effectiveness, improvement and public assurance. It will not involve ranking of schools/institutions, but rather, will establish a level of acceptable quality for all the schools affiliated with the Board. It will help the schools to go through the rigorous process of self-audit and reflection, build on their strengths and work on the areas that need attention, ultimately helping them to move towards becoming 'Hubs of Excellence '. The complete guidelines have been detailed out in the School Quality Assessment and Assurance Manual available at the following link: http://cbseacademic.nic.in/web_material/ Manuals/SQAA_FINAL.pdf 12.9. Action to be Taken By Schools: All the schools affiliated the Board have to undertake the exercise of self-assessment to review their dimensions of quality and excellence and submits its report online to CBSE.
