The actions were collected by the contractors of the QIO Program, a statutorily mandated program of quality improvement contractors who work for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve the care of Medicare beneficiaries, including beneficiaries who reside in nursing homes. By law, a QIO works in every state and territory. This information was collected by the QIOs in late April 2020, and compiled by CMS and its contractors to provide a rapid -access compen dium for providers and administrators of nursing homes in the United States to learn from the many creative plans that state governments and other entities have put into operation in a short period of time. This compendium is not intended as guidance from CMS. It does not replace or serve as a substitute for CMS requirements and policy. The actions outlined in this document have not been evaluated for effectiveness by CMS or any government agency. This compendium is solely an informational product offered by CMS to nursing homes as well as state and local officials during the National Public Health Emergency. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: CMS wishes to thank the many health care providers, state government employees and organizations that generously contributed mate rials developed in the first and second quarters of 2020 to this toolkit. CMS also extends its sincere appreciation to the management, health care providers and staff members of the nursing homes who work tirelessly to provide the best care for this vulnerable population while acting to stop further transmission of the virus. 3 OBJECTIVE: This toolkit catalogs the many innovative solutions designed at the state level to protect our nation's vulnerable nursing home residents during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic. Beginning in October 2020, the toolkit includes up -to-date in formation, guidance, and innovative programs designed to increase vaccine use against influenza virus, pneumococcus (bacterium), and SARS- CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19.

While the content is organized into sections, you may also rely on key word searches and the index to help you locate the information you need. Major categories include: o State actions for COVID -19 Management and Response, now including vaccinations o Telehealth o Organizations Available to Assist Nursing Homes State- specific information is included when available. The new vaccination section initially focuses on reliable sources of information available at the national level, but will explore state -based innovative programs in subsequent editions, especially as vaccination against COVID -19 becomes more widely available. COVID -19 vaccination may require advanced st rategies in the vaccine delivery system (such as dual -dose vaccines and complex \"cold -chain management\") that providers will need to master in order to be successful . When possible, references are given for the innovations, including links to contacts and resources for more information. 5 I. STATE ACTIONS FOR COVID -19 MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE 1.
