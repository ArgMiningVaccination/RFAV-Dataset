This is a good place to start: The Parkinson's B1 Therapy FB group [facebook.com/groups/parkins...](/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2Fparkinsonsb1therapy) This may help : [healthunlocked.com/cure-par...](https://healthunlocked.com/cure-parkinsons/posts/144405745/updated-dosing-information-on-hdt-b1-thiamine-hcl-hci-for-new-members-considering-hdt-including-a-link-to-all-of-dr.-costantinis-info) Art The originators of the high-dose thiamine protocol specify thiamine HCL is the version to take: [vitacost.com/vitacost-vitam...](/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vitacost.com%2Fvitacost-vitamin-b-1) [park_bear](/user/park_bear) I assume they may have specified thiamine HCL bc not all forms of B1 are water soluble and then a high dose could be dangerous.

I have just bought B1 on Amazon- Dr. Clark Store. Caps are 500mg and cost about USD29 for a bottle of 100 caps. Vitacost 500mg capsules High dose is HGL. I would not take 2-3 grams of allithiamine. "}
