On Thursday, Crystal Cruises announced its updated health and safety protocols, which require that all passengers are fully vaccinated at least 14 days before their [voyage](https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel).

However, staff will still be tested for the coronavirus and will have to follow a series of protocols including receiving a negative test, quarantining for seven days when they arrive at the ship and get another negative test at the end of their quarantine. \"When vaccines are widely available, they will be a requirement of employment for crew which must be completed at least 14 days prior to service,\" Anderson said in a statement.
