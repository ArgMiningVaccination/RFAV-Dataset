Crane Uses KPC Concentrated Herb Powders In Custom Prescription Formulation - KPC's premium Chinese herbs, herb extracts, and herbal preparations have made it one of the most established and respected producers of concentrated Chinese herbs in all of China. - KPC works with botanical pharmacology experts who use sophisticated scientific analysis to validate herb identification. - During formulation, KPC's herb extracts are regularly tested to insure that they meet both GMP quality standard and KPC's own even higher expectations. Rigorous Testing - All products are analyzed for heavy metals and harmful bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli, molds, and yeast. - Gas chromatography (GC) ensures safety by testing for over 200 pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. - High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) measures potency by assuring consistent levels of active ingredients. - We use inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICO-MS) in testing. ICO-MS is the future of nonorganic (heavy metal) testing. It is the most precise and sensitive available for heavy metal testing. Other systems in use today are sensitive to subparts per million (ppm), but the ICP-MS can detect elements in the subparts per billion (ppb) range \u2014 and even some elements in the subparts per trillion (ppt) range.
