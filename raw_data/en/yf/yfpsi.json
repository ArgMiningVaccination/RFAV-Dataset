ADA's Standards of Care strives to provide up-to-date guidance using the best available evidence rigorously and comprehensively,\" said Nuha ElSayed, MD, MMSc, PPC chair. The committee is a multidisciplinary team of 20 leading U.S. experts in the field of diabetes care and includes physicians, nurse practitioners, certified diabetes care and education specialists, registered dietitians, pharmacists, methodologists, and others with experience in adult and pediatric endocrinology, epidemiology, public health, cardiovascular risk management, microvascular complications, preconception and pregnancy care, weight management, diabetes prevention, behavioral and mental health, inpatient care, and use of technology in diabetes management. Two designated representatives of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) participated in the subcommittee on the \"Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\" section. This section received endorsement from the ACC for the sixth consecutive year. New this year, the ADA garnered the expertise of specialized subject matter experts by adding them as committee members to the subsections on neuropathy, retinopathy, foot care, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
