This summary addresses squamous cell cancer of the vulva and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias (VIN), some of which are thought to be precursors to invasive squamous cell cancers. The labia majora are the most common sites of vulvar carcinoma and account for about 50% of cases. The labia minora account for 15% to 20% of vulvar carcinoma cases. The clitoris and Bartholin glands are less frequently involved.[ Incidence and Mortality Vulvar cancer accounts for about 6% of cancers of the female genital system in the United States.[ Estimated new cases and deaths from vulvar cancer in the United States in 2023:[ Anatomy The vulva is the area immediately external to the vagina, including the mons pubis, labia, clitoris, and Bartholin vulva includes the mons pubis, clitoris, inner and outer lips of the vagina, and the openings of the urethra and vagina. Risk Factors Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors associated with vulvar cancer include the following: HPV-associated VIN, termed usual-type VIN when high grades 2 and 3, is most common in women younger than 50 years, whereas non-HPV VIN, termed differentiated-type VIN when high grade 3, is most common in older women.[ The former lesion-type VIN grade 1 is no longer classified as a true VIN.[ For more information, see Cervical Cancer Treatment. Clinical Features Women with VIN may not present with symptoms at diagnosis. Possible signs and symptoms of invasive squamous cell cancers of the vulva include the following: Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation The following procedures may be used to diagnose and stage vulvar cancer: Prognosis Prognosis depends on the pathological status of the inguinal lymph nodes and whether spread to adjacent structures has occurred.[ The size of the primary tumor is less important in defining prognosis.[ Follow-up After Treatment Invasive and preinvasive neoplasms of the vulva may be HPV-induced, and the carcinogenic effect may be widespread in the vulvar epithelium. As a result, patients are monitored regularly for signs or symptoms of recurrence. References: The histological classification of vulvar disease and precursor lesions of cancer of the vulva was developed by the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD).[ Nonneoplastic epithelial disorders histologies References: Staging evaluation for vulvar cancer may include the following: Suspected bladder or rectal involvement must be confirmed by biopsy.[ The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gyn\u00e9cologie et d'Obst\u00e9trique (FIGO) Staging FIGO and the American Joint Committee on Cancer have designated staging to define vulvar cancer; the FIGO system is most commonly used.[ The staging system does not apply to malignant melanoma of the vulva, which is staged like melanoma of the skin.[ |Stage||Definition| |FIGO = F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gyn\u00e9cologie et Adapted from FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology.[ | |b Depth of invasion is measured from the basement membrane of the deepest, adjacent, dysplastic, tumor-free rete ridge (or nearest dysplastic rete peg) to the deepest point of invasion.| |I||Tumor confined to the vulva.| |IA||Tumor size 2 cm and stromal invasion 1 Adapted from FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology.[ | |II||Tumor of any size with extension to lower one-third of the urethra, lower one-third of the vagina, lower one-third of the anus with negative nodes.| |Stage||Definition| |FIGO = F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gyn\u00e9cologie et Adapted from FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology.[ | |b Regional refers to inguinal and femoral lymph nodes.| |III||Tumor of any size with extension to upper part of adjacent perineal structures, or with any number of nonfixed, nonulcerated lymph nodes.| |IIIA||Tumor of any size with disease extension to upper two-thirds of the urethra, upper two-thirds of the vagina, bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa, or regional Adapted from FIGO Committee on Gynecologic Oncology.[ | |b Regional refers to inguinal and femoral lymph nodes.| |IV||Tumor of any size fixed to bone, or fixed, ulcerated lymph node metastases, or distant metastases.| |IVA||Disease fixed to ulcerated regionalb lymph node metastases.| |IVB||Distant metastases.| Grade is reported in registry systems and may differ between systems; a two-, three-, or four-grade system may be applied. If not specified, the following system is generally used:[ Overall, about 30% of patients with operable disease have lymph node spread. The pattern of spread is influenced by the histology. Risk factors for lymph node metastasis include the following:[ Well-differentiated lesions tend to spread along the surface with minimal invasion, whereas anaplastic lesions are more likely to be deeply invasive. Spread beyond the vulva is either to adjacent organs such as the vagina, urethra, and anus, or via the lymphatics to the inguinal and femoral lymph nodes, followed by the deep pelvic nodes. Hematogenous spread appears to be uncommon. References: The primary treatment for vulvar cancer is surgery. Radiation therapy is also given to patients with stage III or IV disease.[ Because there are few patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV), only limited data are available on treatment efficacy in this setting, and there is no standard chemotherapy regimen for these patients. Physicians may offer eligible patients with stage III or IV disease participation in clinical trials. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. |Stage ( FIGO Staging vulvar intraepithelial therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery| or and chemoradiation vulvectomy and pelvic exenteration| |Synchronous radiation therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without surgery| Surgery Surgical resection Since the 1980s, the trend of surgical resection in patients with vulvar cancer has been toward more limited surgery, often combined with radiation therapy to minimize morbidity.[ Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) Another strategy to minimize the morbidity incurred by groin lymph node dissection in patients with early clinical-stage disease is SLND, reserving groin dissection for those with metastases to the sentinel node(s). Evidence (SLND): |Complications||Local may be useful when performed by a surgeon experienced in the procedure, and it may avoid the need for full groin lymph node dissection or radiation therapy in patients with clinically nonsuspicious lymph nodes. Radiation Therapy Radical radiation therapy can be used for patients unable to tolerate surgery or when surgery is not an option because of the site or extent of disease.[ Groin lymph node metastases are present in approximately 20% to 35% of patients with tumors clinically confined to the vulva and with clinically negative nodes.[ Localized node-negative disease A randomized trial to address the efficacy of radiation therapy in patients with clinically localized vulvar cancer has been reported.[ In summary, the trial was stopped prematurely, and little can be said about the relative efficacy of the two treatment approaches.[ Pelvic node-positive disease Pelvic radiation therapy has been compared with pelvic node resection in patients with documented groin node-positive disease. Evidence (pelvic node resection vs. pelvic radiation therapy): Chemotherapy There is no standard chemotherapy for vulvar cancer, and reports describing the use of this modality in the setting of metastatic or recurrent disease are anecdotal.[ Extrapolating from regimens used for anal or cervical squamous cell cancers, chemotherapy has been studied in combination with radiation in the neoadjuvant setting or as primary therapy in advanced disease. Chemotherapy regimens have included various combinations of fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, mitomycin, or bleomycin.[ There is no clear evidence of improvement in survival or palliation. Given the advanced age and comorbidities of many patients with advanced or recurrent vulvar cancer, patient tolerance is a major consideration in the use of these agents. Systemic treatment for inoperable patients A systematic review of the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in patients who were considered inoperable or who would have required extensive surgery, such as pelvic exenteration, colostomy, or urinary diversion, revealed no randomized trials.[ In summary, there is evidence that neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy with 5-FU plus either cisplatin or mitomycin may convert patients to a more operable status, but the evidence base is limited by study design. In addition to a paucity of randomized trials, interpretation of these studies is complicated by the lack of a standard definition of operability.[ Systemic treatment for operable patients There is limited evidence about the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in advanced operable vulvar cancer, and the available data do not suggest an advantage to this approach. A systematic review found only one randomized trial that addressed this issue, and it was published only in abstract form.[ References: Treatment Options for VIN Treatment options for VIN include the following: Traditionally, there were three grades of VIN, however, there is little evidence that all three grades are part of the same biological continuum or that grade 1 is even a cancer precursor. In 2004, the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) changed its terminology, reserving the designation VIN for two categories of lesions based on morphological appearance.[ High-grade VIN is usually managed with active therapy because of a higher risk for progression to invasive disease.[ VIN lesions may be multifocal or confluent and extensive. It is important to perform multiple biopsies in treatment planning to exclude occult invasive disease. VIN located in nonhairy areas can be considered an epithelial disease; however, VIN found in hairy sites usually involves the pilosebaceous apparatus and requires a greater depth of excision because it can track along hair roots. Surgery The principal treatment approach is surgery, but there is no consensus on the optimal surgical procedure. The goal is to remove or destroy the entire VIN lesion while preserving vulvar anatomy and function. Simple vulvectomy yields a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100% but is seldom indicated. Other more limited surgical procedures, including separate excision of multiple lesions, are less deforming.[ A systematic literature review identified only a single randomized trial comparing any of the surgical approaches.[ Whatever procedure is used, patients are at substantial risk of recurrence, particularly when the lesions are high grade or multifocal.[ Nonsurgical interventions Topical imiquimod Among women with high-grade VIN, substantial response rates and acceptable tolerability were reported for topical imiquimod 5%, an immune-response modifier with activity in vulvar condylomata. Evidence (imiquimod): Other nonsurgical interventions Nonsurgical approaches have been studied because of the physical and psychosexual morbidity associated with many vulvar surgical procedures. Some of these approaches, including topical fluorouracil, recombinant interferon gamma, bleomycin, and trinitrochlorobenzene, have been largely abandoned because of high recurrence rates or intolerable local side effects, such as pain, irritation, and ulceration.[ Photodynamic therapy, using topically applied 5-aminolevulinic acid as the sensitizing agent for 635 nm laser light, has also been studied. However, data are limited to small case series with variable response rates.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Treatment Options for Stages I and II Vulvar Cancer Treatment options for stage I and stage II vulvar cancer include the following: Surgery Radical local excision with ipsilateral or bilateral inguinal and femoral lymph node dissection may be indicated. For stage I microinvasive lesions (<1 mm invasion) with no associated severe vulvar dystrophy, a wide (1 cm margin) excision (without lymph node dissection) may be done. For all other stage I lesions, if well lateralized, without diffuse severe dystrophy, and with clinically negative nodes, a radical local excision with complete unilateral lymphadenectomy may be done.[ For stage II disease, large T2* tumors may require modified radical vulvectomy or radical vulvectomy.[ For both stage I and stage II disease, radical local excision and sentinel node dissection is indicated and groin dissection is reserved for those with metastasis to the sentinel node(s).[ Surgery and radiation therapy Some investigators recommend radical excision and groin nodal radiation therapy as a means to avoid the morbidity of lymph node dissection. However, it is not clear whether radiation therapy can achieve the same local control rates or survival rates as lymph node dissection in early-stage disease. A randomized trial to address this issue in patients with clinically localized vulvar disease was stopped early as a result of early emergence of worse outcomes in the radiation therapy arm.[ Radiation therapy alone For patients unable to tolerate radical surgery or deemed ineligible for surgery because of the site or extent of disease, radical radiation therapy may be associated with favorable survival.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Treatment Options for Stage III Vulvar Cancer Treatment options for stage III vulvar cancer include the following: Surgery with or without radiation therapy Modified radical or radical vulvectomy with inguinal and femoral lymphadenectomy is the standard therapy.[ Localized adjuvant radiation therapy consisting of 45 Gy to 50 Gy may also be indicated when there is capillary-lymphatic space invasion and a thickness of greater than 5 mm, particularly if the nodes are involved.[ Radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery Preoperative neoadjuvant radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy may be used to improve operability and even decrease the extent of surgery required.[ Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy For patients unable to tolerate radical surgery or deemed ineligible for surgery because of the site or extent of disease, radical radiation therapy may be associated with long-term survival.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Treatment Options for Stage IVA Vulvar Cancer Treatment options for stage IVA vulvar cancer include the following: Surgery Radical vulvectomy and pelvic exenteration may be indicated for patients with stage IVA vulvar cancer. Surgery and radiation therapy Surgery followed by radiation therapy may be done for large resected lesions with narrow margins. Localized adjuvant radiation therapy consisting of 45 Gy to 50 Gy may also be indicated when there is capillary-lymphatic space invasion and thickness greater than 5 mm.[ Radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery Neoadjuvant radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy of large primary lesions (to improve operability) may be done, followed by radical surgery.[ Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy For patients unable to tolerate radical vulvectomy or who are deemed ineligible for surgery because of the site or extent of disease, radical radiation therapy may be associated with long-term survival.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. References: Treatment Options for Stage IVB Vulvar Cancer There is no standard treatment approach in the management of stage IVB vulvar cancer. Local therapy must be individualized depending on the extent of local and metastatic disease. There is no standard chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and reports describing the use of this modality are anecdotal.[ Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.
